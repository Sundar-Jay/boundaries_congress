Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5116, \nthe America COMPETES Act. To maintain economic growth and a high \nstandard of living, our nation must remain competitive in a global \neconomy. To be competitive, U.S. companies must engage in trade, \npreserve market shares, and provide sustainable products, processes, \nand services. Scientific and technological advances serve as critical \ncomponents of economic growth because they contribute to the creation \nof new goods, services, jobs, and increased productivity. Our country \nis in need of innovative concepts and ideas to strengthen our economy \nboth domestically and internationally. The America COMPETES Act will \nincrease the nation's investment in science, technology, engineering, \nand mathematics, STEM. Further, COMPETES provides critical federal \ninvestment in science through research and education. I am pleased that \nthe 111th Congress will reauthorize this law, and I am pleased that it \ncontains some important elements to broaden the participation of groups \nof Americans who are underrepresented in STEM fields, such as women and \nracial or ethnic minorities.\n  According to the Census Bureau, 39 percent of the population under \nthe age of 18 is a racial or ethnic minority. Yet, in 2003, only 4.4 \npercent of U.S. science and engineering jobs were held by African \nAmericans and only 3.4 percent by Hispanics. In 2008, the American \nCommunity Survey reported that 10.3 percent of the total U.S. \npopulation were in the Professional, Scientific, Management and \nAdministrative Services industry; however, only 7.7 percent of \nCambodians, 6.8 percent of Hmongs, and 5.2 percent of Laotians actually \nheld these types of jobs. Further, women represent only a little more \nthan one quarter of our science and technology workforce. Many experts \nmaintain that the ability of the U.S. to produce enough scientists will \nfall far short unless we take strong action to develop the potential of \nwomen and minorities. Thus, broadening participation efforts are \ncritical to meeting the growing demand for U.S. workers with STEM \nskills and to improving American competitiveness globally.\n  Although minorities have increased their share of degrees awarded in \nthe sciences, poor preparation in science and mathematics is a major \nfactor limiting the access of these citizens to careers in the STEM \nfields. H.R. 5116 helps improve secondary STEM education by requiring \nfederal agencies to report how they are disseminating federally funded \nSTEM education resources to practitioners, including to teachers and \nadministrators at high-needs schools. Further, it requires the \nestablishment of an inventory of federally sponsored STEM education \nprograms that must include an assessment of the effectiveness of the \nprograms and the rates of participation of underrepresented minorities \nin such programs. An increased investment in STEM-based programs will \noffer more high-level science and mathematics courses in high school, \nenhance undergraduate and graduate degrees in science and engineering, \nand solidify employment in science and engineering positions in this \nglobal economy. The National Science\n\n[[Page E2238]]\n\nFoundation will receive substantial funds to develop and implement a \npolicy for the broader impacts review criterion that will result in \nimproving the effectiveness and impact of activities to broaden \nparticipation within STEM. Such a policy is long overdue. We spend \nbillions of federal dollars for science advancements but have limited \nrequirements for the institutions receiving these dollars to give back \nto the nation in terms of helping institutions or students beyond their \nwalls improve their access to quality science.\n  I support the bill because it advances our nation in the STEM areas; \nhowever, I am disappointed that many of the provisions to broaden \nparticipation that were included in the House-passed version were \nabsent from the final version. I promise to continue to work to ensure \nthat all Americans have access to high quality STEM education and \ncareers. I support H.R. 5116, the America COMPETES Act of 2010; this \nbill will enhance our present practices in science and our economic \nstrength in the global marketplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "AMERICA COMPETES REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2010\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               speech of\n\n                          HON.

Madam Speaker, I would like to call to your attenion \nthe work of an outstanding medical practice Ferraro Medical Associates, \nP.A., which is celebrating its 65th Anniversary of dedicated service to \nits patients, and by extension, the greater community. It is only \nfitting that Ferraro Medical Associates, and its late founder Dr. \nStephen P. Ferraro, be honored in this permanent record of the greatest \ndemocracy ever known, for the comfort and care that it has provided to \nso many Paterson families.\n  Dr. Stephen P. Ferraro was born in 1920 in Paterson, NJ to Angelo and \nNatalizia who emigrated from Sicily to the United States. They had four \nchildren, two of whom died untimely deaths leaving Stephen and Joseph. \nStephen's parents ingrained in their sons the importance of education, \nand became successful themselves, owning multiple properties in \nPaterson.\n  Dr. Ferraro attended School No. 15 and graduated Eastside High School \nin 1937. In high school he was very athletic but music intrigued him \nmost and he played the violin for the Eastside orchestra. After \ngraduation he earned a bachelor's degree from Notre Dame University in \n1941. Stephen developed a passion for medicine and flying which lasted \na lifetime.\n  In 1946 Dr. Ferraro obtained his degree of Doctor of Medicine from \nGeorgetown University Medical School. He graduated in the top of his \nclass. He returned to Paterson to pursue his career. He did a rotating \ninternship at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson. In \n1947 he was certified and passed the State of New Jersey Board as \nDoctor in Medicine and Surgery. Dr. Ferraro then decided to join the \nUnited States Air Force University School of Medicine in Randolf, Texas \nand became a USAF Flight Surgeon, spending three years in Okinawa. In \nthe Air Force he saw many in great need and he was determined to always \nbe a ``people doctor'' and provide his service where the need was \ngreatest.\n  By 1950, when he returned from spending four years at Boston City \nHospital, becoming Chief Surgical Resident, he had met a nurse named \nBetty. He went to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and became Chief \nSurgical Resident from 1954-1956. Betty followed him and worked \nalongside him as his operating room nurse. They later married at St. \nAnthony Church in Paterson and had six children-- Stephen Jr., Natalie, \nAngelo, Lisa, Lucia and Barbara.\n  Dr. Ferraro never forgot the city he came from. In 1957 he became \nattending surgeon of St. Joseph's Hospital & Medical Center in \nPaterson. He soon decided to open his own practice at 414 Broadway. \nBetty was always by his side and was his nurse at the practice. \nTogether they were the perfect ``team.'' The office was on the first \nfloor and their apartment was on the upper levels. He became the Co-\nChief of Department of Surgery at Fairlawn Memorial Hospital, attending \nsurgeon at Saddle Brook Hospital, Police Surgeon and City of Paterson \nphysician, Medical Director of Nabisco Brands, Inc., assistant \nprofessor at Seton Hall University Department of Surgery and also \nbecame Medical Examiner for Federal Aviation-Class A, and USCIS Civil \nSurgeon. Dr. Ferraro was a distinguished and respected physician who \nwith all his qualities provided the best to his patients and left a \nremarkable legacy to his children.\n  Dr. Ferraro's children admired their father for instilling the \nimportance of education in them. When his children were very young he \nwould always encourage them to read. They spent time with their father \naround the office. Dr. Ferraro was a great role model, allowing them to \nsee the medical world in his office as one of the choices for their \nlives.\n  Lisa Ferraro followed her father's footsteps and graduated from Ross \nUniversity Medical School. In 1984-1987 she completed her internship \nand residency in Internal Medicine at St. Joseph's Regional Medical \nCenter in Paterson and immediately went to work with her father. Dr. \nLisa Ferraro was Board Certified in Internal Medicine in 1987 and \njoined attending staff Internal Medicine at SJHMC.\n  She has worked as school physician for Public Schools Nos. 5, 8, 28 \nand Kilpatrick School. She was assistant Medical Director at Nabisco \nfrom 1987-1992 and has taught first year medical students from UMDNJ, \nas well as forth year foreign medical students. In 2000 she was \nappointed as Civil Surgeon for USCIS. In February 2010 she became \nCertified in Aesthetic Medicine.\n  Dr. Ferraro left a truly wonderful legacy in Paterson. In April 1996 \nDr. Stephen and Dr. Lisa Ferraro registered the office as a \ncorporation, Ferraro Medical Associates, P.A. Despite the challenges, \nthe office still serves our community at 414 Broadway. Presently the \npractice provides medical care to approximately five hundred patients a \nmonth. It is estimated that close to half a million patients have \npassed through the doors at 414 Broadway.\n  Although Dr. Stephen P. Ferraro departed from this earth in 2002, he \nleft a legacy of perseverance as well as a well recognized practice, \nwhich continues to thrive under the leadership of Dr. Lisa Ferraro. Her \nsiblings are all successful professionals in their fields.

Madam Speaker, I ask that you join all of the \npatients and friends of the Ferraro family, all those who have been \nhelped throughout the years, and me in recognizing the outstanding \ncontributions they have made to the community in Paterson and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "TRIBUTE TO FERRARO MEDICAL ASSOCIATES, P.A.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HON.

In \nmany of these cases the constituent needs assistance cutting through \nthe federal bureaucracy to get the attention they need to their \nindividual situation. Although I believe that people shouldn't need to \nturn to their Congressional office in order to get their cases \nresolved, I am happy to be able to assist when such instances occur.\n  My Congressional office resolved thousands of constituent service \ncases, which included providing assistance to Veterans, Seniors with \nMedicare and Social Security concerns, foreclosure and mortgage \nassistance to homeowners, families seeking adoptions, and expediting \npassports. The Congressional office provided assistance to constituents \ntrying to reach family members during natural disasters overseas such \nas Haiti and Chile. In many of these cases our assistance made a real \ndifference in people's daily lives.\n  Some specific examples of the hundreds of successful results achieved \nby the Congressional office are described below.\n  Veterans: Obtained well over $2 million in retroactive payments and \nbenefits for individual local veterans earned but never received from \nthe Veterans Administration due to administrative backlogs and errors. \nThese awards ranged from a few dollars to over $100,000 depending on \nthe type of injury, level of disability, and length of the VA delay in \nprocessing the case.\n\n[[Page E2240]]\n\n  Successfully assisted many local Veterans in receiving long over due \ncombat medals such as medals from World War 2 for a Mahopac veteran and \nseveral Purple Heart recipients.\n  Awarded the prestigious Air Medal to former flight crewmembers of the \n336th Medical Detachment, and Army Reserve Helicopter Ambulance unit in \na ceremony at Stewart Airport. The 60 men and women of the 336th \nMedical Detachment, trained as Medevac pilots, helicopter crew chiefs \nand medics, evacuated sick and wounded soldiers from the battlefield. \nDue to adverse field conditions and administrative oversight, the \nunit's flight crews did not receive their Air Medals until my office \nintervened on their behalf.\n  Social Security: Assistance was provided to constituents such as \nexplaining eligibility for disability benefits; facilitating \ncommunication between beneficiaries and local SSA offices; assisting in \nsetting up payment schedules for overpayments to beneficiaries' \naccounts; reinstatement of disability benefits that were incorrectly \nstopped; expediting appeal hearings, expediting the processing of \nretroactive checks in favorable disability cases that included amounts \nin excess of $100,000; removal of overpayments that were mistakenly put \nonto beneficiaries' records; and assisting with the appeal of an \noverpayment waiver request.\n  For example--\n  Expedited a Social Security appeals hearing for a constituent who \nsuffered major spinal injuries, was unable to work and facing \nbankruptcy. The case was found fully favorable to the constituent.\n  Expedited a retroactive payment in a Social Security disability case \nfor $79,000.\n  Helped get a Social Security disability appeals hearing for a woman \nsuffering from a tick-borne illness similar to Lyme's Disease. The \nappeal was expedited and she was awarded more than $1,800 in monthly \nbenefits and more than $65,000 in retroactive benefits, and found \neligible for Medicare.\n  Medicare: Facilitated reimbursement for Durable Medical Equipment and \nother services.\n  Helped remove surcharge on Part B, premium and processing of \nretroactive payment.\n  Internal Revenue Service: Expedited processing of refund and economic \nstimulus payments.\n  Helped change filing status for taxpayer.\n  Department of Labor: Challenged denial of prescription coverage for a \ndrug that was in a beneficiary's plan.\n  Assisted in having overpaid monthly COBRA premium credited toward \nfuture monthly premiums.\n  Assisted with having COBRA premium reduction applied to several \nbeneficiaries who did not initially receive it.\n  Federal Trade Commission: Worked with constituents and relevant \ncredit agencies to fix mistakes on credit reports.\n  Visiting Washington DC: When constituents, school groups, and local \norganizations visit Washington DC, my office helps arrange tours, and \ncan help with other aspects of the visits. I make every effort to \npersonally greet local visitors. In 2009 my office arranged and gave \nover 700 tours of the Capitol to local families, school classes, and \nother visitors from the 19th Congressional District. The office also \nassisted with information including assistance in arranging for tours \nof other significant sites in Washington.\n  Service Academy Nominations: Each year my Congressional office \nsubmits nominations of local students to our nation's military service \nacademies including the U.S. Military Academy at West Point (USMA), \nNaval (USNA), Air Force (USAFA), and Merchant Marine (USMMA) Academies. \nI consider it a great honor to be able to nominate top local students \nwho will become the next generation of military leaders. During my two \nterms in office, I was proud to serve on the U.S. Military Academy's \nBoard of Visitors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "FEDERAL GRANTS AND APPROPRIATIONS FOR LOCAL PROJECTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           HON.

Farley Middle School.\n\n\n                          Constituent Services\n\n\tCasework: One of the aspects of the job that I find most rewarding is the ability to assist local constituents with individual problems. In many of these cases the constituent needs assistance cutting through the federal bureaucracy to get the attention they need to their individual situation. Although I believe that people shouldn't need to turn to their Congressional office in order to get their cases resolved, I am happy to be able to assist when such instances occur.\n\tMy Congressional office resolved thousands of constituent service cases, which included providing assistance to Veterans, Seniors with Medicare and Social Security concerns, foreclosure and mortgage assistance to homeowners, families seeking adoptions, and expediting passports. The Congressional office provided assistance to constituents trying to reach family members during natural disasters overseas such as Haiti and Chile. In many of these cases our assistance made a real difference in people's daily lives.\n\tSome specific examples of the hundreds of successful results achieved by the Congressional office are described below.\n\tVeterans: Obtained well over $2 million in retroactive payments and benefits for individual local veterans earned but never received from the Veterans Administration due to administrative backlogs and errors. These awards ranged from a few dollars to over $100,000 depending on the type of injury, level of disability, and length of the VA delay in processing the case.\n[[Page E2240]]\n\n\tSuccessfully assisted many local Veterans in receiving long over due combat medals such as medals from World War 2 for a Mahopac veteran and several Purple Heart recipients.\n\tAwarded the prestigious Air Medal to former flight crewmembers of the 336th Medical Detachment, and Army Reserve Helicopter Ambulance unit in a ceremony at Stewart Airport. The 60 men and women of the 336th Medical Detachment, trained as Medevac pilots, helicopter crew chiefs and medics, evacuated sick and wounded soldiers from the battlefield. Due to adverse field conditions and administrative oversight, the unit's flight crews did not receive their Air Medals until my office intervened on their behalf.\n\tSocial Security: Assistance was provided to constituents such as explaining eligibility for disability benefits; facilitating communication between beneficiaries and local SSA offices; assisting in setting up payment schedules for overpayments to beneficiaries' accounts; reinstatement of disability benefits that were incorrectly stopped; expediting appeal hearings, expediting the processing of retroactive checks in favorable disability cases that included amounts in excess of $100,000; removal of overpayments that were mistakenly put onto beneficiaries' records; and assisting with the appeal of an overpayment waiver request.\n\tFor example--\n\tExpedited a Social Security appeals hearing for a constituent who suffered major spinal injuries, was unable to work and facing bankruptcy. The case was found fully favorable to the constituent.\n\tExpedited a retroactive payment in a Social Security disability case for $79,000.\n\tHelped get a Social Security disability appeals hearing for a woman suffering from a tick-borne illness similar to Lyme's Disease. The appeal was expedited and she was awarded more than $1,800 in monthly benefits and more than $65,000 in retroactive benefits, and found eligible for Medicare.\n\tMedicare: Facilitated reimbursement for Durable Medical Equipment and other services.\n\tHelped remove surcharge on Part B, premium and processing of retroactive payment.\n\tInternal Revenue Service: Expedited processing of refund and economic stimulus payments.\n\tHelped change filing status for taxpayer.\n\tDepartment of Labor: Challenged denial of prescription coverage for a drug that was in a beneficiary's plan.\n\tAssisted in having overpaid monthly COBRA premium credited toward future monthly premiums.\n\tAssisted with having COBRA premium reduction applied to several beneficiaries who did not initially receive it.\n\tFederal Trade Commission: Worked with constituents and relevant credit agencies to fix mistakes on credit reports.\n\tVisiting Washington DC: When constituents, school groups, and local organizations visit Washington DC, my office helps arrange tours, and can help with other aspects of the visits. I make every effort to personally greet local visitors. In 2009 my office arranged and gave over 700 tours of the Capitol to local families, school classes, and other visitors from the 19th Congressional District. The office also assisted with information including assistance in arranging for tours of other significant sites in Washington.\n\tService Academy Nominations: Each year my Congressional office submits nominations of local students to our nation's military service academies including the U.S. Military Academy at West Point (USMA), Naval (USNA), Air Force (USAFA), and Merchant Marine (USMMA) Academies. I consider it a great honor to be able to nominate top local students who will become the next generation of military leaders. During my two terms in office, I was proud to serve on the U.S. Military Academy's Board of Visitors.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["John J.

DANNY K. DAVIS\n\n                              of illinois\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010\n\n  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express both my \ndeep concern and the deep concern of some of my constituents about the \nunjust imprisonment of several members of a religious minority in Iran. \nIn particular, I wish to speak of the member of the Baha'i faith who \nhave been persecuted and imprisoned in Iran. My home district in \nChicago has a rich diversity of people from all backgrounds and faiths, \nand I am fortunate to have Baha'is as part of this rich diversity. The \nBaha'i faith is a peaceful religion that teaches the oneness of \nhumanity and that all forms of prejudice should be eliminated.\n  Some of you will recall that in 2009 I was one of the co-sponsors to \nHouse Resolution 175. That resolution condemned the Government of Iran \nfor its state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its \ncontinued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights. H. \nRes. 175 passed with 407 ``aye'' votes on October 22, 2009. However, \nsome of my constituents have informed me that the persecution and \nsuppression of the Baha'i faith in Iran persist with no relief in \nsight.\n  In 2009 the international press reported that seven Baha'I leaders in \nIran were unjustly arrested and held in prison without knowing the \ncharges for their arrest for approximately 20 months.\n  The unjust prosecution of these seven particular Baha'is was \ncondemned by international leaders and drawn into our national \nawareness for a short time. Those seven Baha'is are real people with \nfamilies, who continue to suffer injustice because of their peaceful \nreligious beliefs. The more disturbing fact is that those seven Baha'i \nleaders are merely the ones that made the headlines. There are \napproximately 48 additional Baha'is currently imprisoned in Iran. \nApproximately 132 Baha'is have been arrested and released on bail to \nawait trial, and another 92 Baha'is have been sentenced to \nimprisonment. In the last decade, hundreds of Baha'is have been \nprosecuted and imprisoned for their religious beliefs. But that is not \nthe only degradation that Baha'is in Iran must face. Baha'is have been \ndismissed from their jobs, expelled from universities, and deprived of \ntheir property and pensions, all because of their religious beliefs.\n  Our national consciousness would not be so aware of this unjust and \nunfair treatment if it had not been for yet another unjust prosecution \nof a young American journalist, Roxana Saberi, in 2009. While Roxana \nshared a prison cell with two of the female Baha'i leaders in Evin \nprison, she was astounded by the tranquility of her Baha'i cell mates \neven as they faced harsh conditions and uncertainty about their future. \nFortunately, Roxana was freed from prison and has returned safely to \nthe United States; however, those seven Baha'i leaders remain in prison \nand were sentenced to 10 years of confinement in one of the most \ndreadful prisons in Iran.\n  In short, the Baha'i faith teaches tolerance, patience, peace and \nself-investigation of the truth. Yet, Baha'is are singled out and \nmarked from persecution and ridicule from the class room to the court \nroom and from the lunch room to the laboratory. We have our own history \nof unjust treatment in this country and the grievous and slow healing \nwounds from such pernicious and repugnant conduct can still be felt \ntoday. However, the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion in \nour great country have contributed greatly to the healing of our \nsociety.\n  I believe each and every human being has a fundamental right to \nfreedom of religion that should not be curtailed or circumscribed by \nthe coincidence of one's citizenship in a particular nation.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to express both my deep concern and the deep concern of some of my constituents about the unjust imprisonment of several members of a religious minority in Iran. In particular, I wish to speak of the member of the Baha'i faith who have been persecuted and imprisoned in Iran. My home district in Chicago has a rich diversity of people from all backgrounds and faiths, and I am fortunate to have Baha'is as part of this rich diversity. The Baha'i faith is a peaceful religion that teaches the oneness of humanity and that all forms of prejudice should be eliminated.\n\tSome of you will recall that in 2009 I was one of the co-sponsors to House Resolution 175. That resolution condemned the Government of Iran for its state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority and its continued violation of the International Covenants on Human Rights. H. Res. 175 passed with 407 ``aye'' votes on October 22, 2009. However, some of my constituents have informed me that the persecution and suppression of the Baha'i faith in Iran persist with no relief in sight.\n\tIn 2009 the international press reported that seven Baha'I leaders in Iran were unjustly arrested and held in prison without knowing the charges for their arrest for approximately 20 months.\n\tThe unjust prosecution of these seven particular Baha'is was condemned by international leaders and drawn into our national awareness for a short time. Those seven Baha'is are real people with families, who continue to suffer injustice because of their peaceful religious beliefs. The more disturbing fact is that those seven Baha'i leaders are merely the ones that made the headlines. There are approximately 48 additional Baha'is currently imprisoned in Iran. Approximately 132 Baha'is have been arrested and released on bail to await trial, and another 92 Baha'is have been sentenced to imprisonment. In the last decade, hundreds of Baha'is have been prosecuted and imprisoned for their religious beliefs. But that is not the only degradation that Baha'is in Iran must face. Baha'is have been dismissed from their jobs, expelled from universities, and deprived of their property and pensions, all because of their religious beliefs.\n\tOur national consciousness would not be so aware of this unjust and unfair treatment if it had not been for yet another unjust prosecution of a young American journalist, Roxana Saberi, in 2009. While Roxana shared a prison cell with two of the female Baha'i leaders in Evin prison, she was astounded by the tranquility of her Baha'i cell mates even as they faced harsh conditions and uncertainty about their future. Fortunately, Roxana was freed from prison and has returned safely to the United States; however, those seven Baha'i leaders remain in prison and were sentenced to 10 years of confinement in one of the most dreadful prisons in Iran.\n\tIn short, the Baha'i faith teaches tolerance, patience, peace and self-investigation of the truth. Yet, Baha'is are singled out and marked from persecution and ridicule from the class room to the court room and from the lunch room to the laboratory. We have our own history of unjust treatment in this country and the grievous and slow healing wounds from such pernicious and repugnant conduct can still be felt today. However, the freedom of speech and the freedom of religion in our great country have contributed greatly to the healing of our society.\n\tI believe each and every human being has a fundamental right to freedom of religion that should not be curtailed or circumscribed by the coincidence of one's citizenship in a particular nation. The freedom in our country to choose how to peacefully worship God is something many of us take for granted. We need only consider the unjust and inhumane treatment of Baha'is in Iran to realize that this freedom is not available to everyone in the world.\n\tI agree with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when she condemned the sentencing of the Baha'i leaders and stated that the ``United States is committed to defending religious freedom around the world, and we have not forgotten the Baha'i community in Iran.''\n\tI speak to you today as a reminder that religious persecution remains a fact of life in our\n[[Page E2242]]\nworld and that the plight of the Baha'is in Iran is a poignant example of injustice. On behalf of my Baha'i constituents, I ask that you lend your voice to mine, so that we may create a chorus of diverse voices against the type of blatant religious persecution that we are witnessing in the unjust treatment of Baha'is in Iran.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Danny K.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to insert into the Record \nexcerpts of remarks made at a symposium sponsored by Executive Action, \nLLC: ``Countering Iran's Nuclear & Terrorist Threats, The Opposition's \nRole: What Are the U.S. Policy Options?'' held at the Willard \nIntercontinental Hotel in Washington, DC on Friday, December 17, 2010.\n\n\n     Michael Mukasey, former Attorney General of the United States\n\n       This is one of those moments in history when we know that \n     future generations are going to ask what we did to advance \n     good and what we did to resist evil . . . .\n       I'm a lawyer, and lawyers make their cases with facts and \n     law and policy. So let's look at some facts, and some law, \n     and some policy, and see whether the case is there. The \n     history of the relationship between the United States and the \n     Iranian regime since the 1979 revolution can be summed up as \n     a series of attempts by the United States to, as the \n     diplomats say, engage the Iranian regime, each attempt less \n     successful than the one that preceded it. I'm not going to go \n     through that entire history, but an important part of it \n     begins in the 1990s, during the Clinton administration, when \n     the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran, also known as \n     the MEK, was designated by the Secretary of State under U.S. \n     law as a foreign terrorist organization and that designation \n     regrettably continues to this day . . . .\n       The MEK is the only organization of Iranians, both inside \n     Iran and outside Iran that opposes the current regime that \n     favors a government in Iran that is democratic, secular, non-\n     nuclear, and a republic. Again, this is not one of the few \n     organizations that fit that description; it is the only one . \n     . . .\n       If in fact MEK has renounced violence, as it has; if in \n     fact it presents no threat to any U.S. personnel or interest, \n     in fact it presents no such threat; and if in fact it has \n     been of affirmative assistance to the United States, as it \n     has; and is not regarded as a terrorist organization in the \n     United Kingdom or the European Union, then why was it placed \n     on that list and why does it continue to remain on the list \n     of such organizations that is kept by the Secretary of State? \n     Well, I think, it's pretty openly acknowledged that the \n     reason MEK was placed on that list during the Clinton \n     administration was to curry favor with Iran, and to use the \n     designation as a way of entering into dialogue with the \n     Iranian regime. And I am sorry to say that even during the \n     administration that I served in, it is reported that MEK \n     continued to remain on the list for the same misguided reason \n     . . . .\n       The Iranian regime is now in the enviable position of \n     having the United States designate as a terrorist \n     organization a group of Iranians who are a threat to that \n     regime, and of limiting that group's activities. In other \n     words, the Iranians now have the great Satan working for them \n     . . . .\n       The continued designation of MEK as a terrorist \n     organization gives great comfort and legitimacy to the \n     Iranian regime, by putting on the sidelines an organization \n     that is potentially a grave threat to the regime. What's to \n     be done? Well as I'm sure many of you know there is an \n     ongoing case in which MEK has challenged the designation. In \n     July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     circuit issued an opinion essentially sending the matter back \n     to the State Department and to the Secretary of State and \n     asking her to re-evaluate whether MEK should be on that list. \n     But the court did something more than that. It expressed a \n     good deal of skepticism at least about the non-classified \n     information that was put before the court and shared with \n     MEK, and which MEK could therefore rebut. Without getting \n     into a whole lot of detail, the Secretary of State may choose \n     to base her determination entirely on classified information \n     if she wants, and then nobody knows why she made the \n     decision, but she didn't do that in this case. She said she \n     based her decision on both the classified information and the \n     non-classified information and the court discussed in some \n     detail some of the non-classified information, and it showed \n     that a lot of it consisted of unsubstantiated, anonymous \n     rumor, whose reliability was unknown and could not be tested. \n     And all we can say is that if the classified part of the \n     record, which MEK has not been allowed to see and to which it \n     cannot therefore respond to directly, consists of the same \n     kind of information as the non-classified part, then the \n     Secretary of State's decision would be based on absolutely \n     nothing substantial. Time will tell. But this is about more \n     than a case in the District of Columbia and more than MEK. \n     This is about the posture of the United States toward the \n     Iranian regime . . . .\n       When succeeding generations consider the question I \n     presented at the beginning of these remarks, of what we did \n     to advance what is good and to resist what is evil, they will \n     find an answer that we and they can live with.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n            Tom Ridge, former Secretary of Homeland Security\n\n       At one point in time, we talked about and we put the MEK on \n     the terrorist list because we thought it might enhance and \n     improve the dialogue, change the dialogue. There might be \n     some noticeable improvement in our relationship with Iran and \n     I think history concludes so far in the past several years \n     since we put that organization, which by the way disarmed \n     itself, consolidated itself and has been a source of some \n     very important intelligence for this country's use and the \n     rest of the world's knowledge. If the goal was to improve \n     engagement and to solicit a different response from the \n     Iranian government, that hasn't worked out very well either. \n     So, you say to yourself at the end of the day, these efforts \n     during the past several years have been fruitless, and some \n     say through some organizations that are basically feckless, \n     not terribly effective. What happens if they become even \n     further emboldened by having nuclear capability? One, we know \n     what it says about Iran--if you think that part of the world \n     is unstable now, we can only imagine what the consequences \n     will be then . . . .\n       And you know what is probably even more alarming is that \n     we're starting to see more and more analysts accept in their \n     writings the notion of a nuclear Iran and how we would deal \n     with it. Think about that, ten years ago we were worried and \n     trying to figure out how we could make sure that didn't \n     happen and now we have some pundits and some analysts in the \n     international community saying, it's almost a fait \n     accompli, ``now what are we going to do?'' Let's just \n     pause for a moment and think what that means to the rest \n     of the world vis-a-vis America. What does it say about our \n     ability to influence geopolitical events? What does it say \n     about how our allies and friends in that region look to \n     us, and our ability to affect change that affects their \n     lives and the security of that particular region. . . .?\n       So how do we go forward? What do we do next? I think the \n     Attorney General very clearly identified probably one of the \n     most significant things we can do and that is delist as the \n     UK has done, and the European Union has done, MEK. They did \n     consolidate. They did disarm. They were a source of \n     considerable intelligence for us, and if we are to look for \n     peaceful means of encouraging a regime change, it seems to me \n     that one of the first and most significant steps we could \n     take, I guess it's under review right now by the State \n     Department, but as you well know in January of this year I \n     think the DC Circuit Court of Appeals said that, based on the \n     information you presented in this court right now (and \n     unfortunately you had to go to court, everybody goes to court \n     in the United States, but to get them delisted from the State \n     Department) the court said preliminarily, the information \n     that you've at least shared with us in court today doesn't \n     warrant them being listed as a terrorist organization. I \n     think the consequences of that particular decision, the State \n     Department as I understand it and perhaps others on this \n     panel can give us a more enlightened and more recent point of \n     view that they're actually honestly and actively considering \n     that outcome.\n       What's the benefit of that outcome? First of all it's the \n     strongest possible signal that our approach toward Iran is \n     changing. It's saying that 30 years of peaceful engagement \n     hasn't been effective, and I think everybody around the world \n     knows that. But I'm going to give you a different perspective \n     if I might because I think it has as much to do as how we're \n     viewed around the rest of the world and why I think we should \n     do it as soon as possible. I've always thought that, if \n     America was considered to be a product that we look to sell \n     around the world then our brand is based on our value system. \n     Think about that for a moment. For 200+ years, more recently \n     we have tried to promote the notion of civil society, and \n     civil institutions, and believing that in the heart of all \n     men and women everywhere around the world there is a desire \n     to be free, a desire to control your own destiny, to raise \n     your own family, to share in hopefully, the opportunities \n     that your society and your government would provide for you. \n     In inheriting all of that, we have many of those discussions \n     as it relates to how we are engaged in our effort against \n     terrorism around the world. We challenge ourselves around Abu \n     Ghraib, we challenge ourselves around Guantanamo, we \n     challenge ourselves with regard to due process. We know what \n     we stand for. It's part of the American brand. We are our \n     strongest allies; we're also our strongest critics. We know \n     what we believe in and when we seem to deviate, if some of us \n     seem to think we deviate from that brand, we take a close \n     look at ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves ``What are \n     we doing?'' Well, part of that American brand I think is \n     being consistent with our values overseas as well. And when \n     we see a repressive theocracy, day in and day out, \n     imprisoning, torturing, executing men, women, entire families \n     because they've been brave enough, courageous enough to stand \n     in opposition to the theocracy. In their hearts, not\n\n[[Page E2243]]\n\n     necessarily looking to the institutions of government like \n     America but looking to the value system of freedom and \n     liberty, speech, assembly, peaceful opposition. So I frankly \n     think one of the most important things this country can do, \n     and hope we will do it as soon as possible is to delist. \n     Delist the People's Mujahedin of Iran. It's not a terrorist \n     organization. And after that, be part of a sustained, public, \n     rhetorical, and as well diplomatic embrace of our brand, with \n     the hope of convincing the rest of the world that the loyal \n     opposition, those pro-democracy warriors, individuals and \n     families in Iran can at least look to the United States not \n     with casual and occasional criticism of the Iranian \n     government and how it treats its citizens, but a sustained \n     clamor for change, aggressive diplomatic efforts to at least \n     pull some of our friends and allies into the chorus of \n     opposition to this regime. Time is running out. There aren't \n     too many options left.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\nFrances Fragos Townsend, former advisor to President George W. Bush on \n                           Homeland Security\n\n       Our policy goals in this country really must be a \n     reflection of our values. It must be consistent and it must \n     be fundamental to how we build a policy process. It struck \n     me, when you go back and look at the current, when we heard \n     Tom Ridge and others talk about the sanctions regime, we can \n     debate its efficacy we can debate its impact, but the \n     statement of the goal right now as we sit here today in \n     Washington the goal of the sanctions, which have not been yet \n     successful, is to get the regime to the bargaining table. Is \n     that really all? To describe that is as humble and modest in \n     terms of an objective, that's not enough. So, when you look \n     at all the other things we've talked about just so far this \n     morning that the MEK is still listed as an FTO all of that \n     stems from ``what are you trying to achieve.'' If you're not \n     clear, and you're not ambitious, and your goals don't \n     represent your values, you are doomed to failure. . . .\n       The FTO designations, as you can imagine during my time in \n     the government (I was in the Justice Department for many \n     years and then in the White House), monitoring the FTO \n     process, the Foreign Terrorist Organizations designation \n     process, working with the State Department was among my \n     responsibilities. I must tell you that having traveled \n     throughout the Middle East and around the world, talking to \n     our allies, the FTO designation process (we should just be \n     honest) is disrespected by our allies. It is ineffective. It \n     is corrupted by politics, and I don't mean, ``corrupted'' in \n     the criminal sense, but it has been pervaded by political \n     debate, which is part and parcel of a foreign policy \n     discussion when you're setting foreign policy goals. The fact \n     that we permit domestic politics in foreign policy concerns \n     to come into what is supposed to be an objective process, \n     that is the designation of a foreign terrorist organization, \n     undermines US credibility. . . .\n       Not only, having disarmed, and renounced violence and \n     assisted the United States, should the MEK come off the list, \n     the US Congress should abolish the list because I frankly \n     think in many respects because of how it's operated, it does \n     more to undermine our credibility on these subjects. So, I \n     would both take MEK off the list and I would ask Congress to \n     abolish it. . . .\n       The other thing that I would say and hasn't been spoken \n     about, again I'm sensitive to this because of my \n     responsibilities in the White House is, I frankly think, as \n     part of the delisting process one of the things that would \n     enable or open the potential for is permitting MEK leaders \n     who are outside of Iran to get visas and come to the United \n     States. That's an entirely, again, separate process. It would \n     be treated separately. Delisting does not necessarily mean \n     that those leaders would be able to apply and get such a visa \n     that ought to be part of this process. Those people ought to \n     be able to come here and speak about the atrocities, they \n     ought to be able to speak about the human rights abuses and \n     what's happening inside Iran to those advocates for democracy \n     and freedom. And they ought to be able to be their own \n     advocates. Right now, we are their advocates, but they are \n     entitled to make their own case both before the American \n     Congress and the American people, to raise money, to raise \n     support, and to raise awareness. So, for me, it's: take them \n     off the list, abolish the list and grant visas to expatriates \n     and exiled MEK leaders so that they can come and make their \n     own case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "COUNTERING IRAN'S NUCLEAR & TERRORIST THREATS, THE OPPOSITION'S ROLE: \n                   WHAT ARE THE U.S. POLICY OPTIONS?\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HON.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to insert into the Record excerpts of remarks made at a symposium sponsored by Executive Action, LLC: ``Countering Iran's Nuclear & Terrorist Threats, The Opposition's Role: What Are the U.S. Policy Options?'' held at the Willard Intercontinental Hotel in Washington, DC on Friday, December 17, 2010.\n\n\n     Michael Mukasey, former Attorney General of the United States\n\n       This is one of those moments in history when we know that \n     future generations are going to ask what we did to advance \n     good and what we did to resist evil . . . .\n       I'm a lawyer, and lawyers make their cases with facts and \n     law and policy.

In other \n     words, the Iranians now have the great Satan working for them \n     . . . .\n       The continued designation of MEK as a terrorist \n     organization gives great comfort and legitimacy to the \n     Iranian regime, by putting on the sidelines an organization \n     that is potentially a grave threat to the regime. What's to \n     be done? Well as I'm sure many of you know there is an \n     ongoing case in which MEK has challenged the designation. In \n     July, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia \n     circuit issued an opinion essentially sending the matter back \n     to the State Department and to the Secretary of State and \n     asking her to re-evaluate whether MEK should be on that list. \n     But the court did something more than that. It expressed a \n     good deal of skepticism at least about the non-classified \n     information that was put before the court and shared with \n     MEK, and which MEK could therefore rebut. Without getting \n     into a whole lot of detail, the Secretary of State may choose \n     to base her determination entirely on classified information \n     if she wants, and then nobody knows why she made the \n     decision, but she didn't do that in this case. She said she \n     based her decision on both the classified information and the \n     non-classified information and the court discussed in some \n     detail some of the non-classified information, and it showed \n     that a lot of it consisted of unsubstantiated, anonymous \n     rumor, whose reliability was unknown and could not be tested. \n     And all we can say is that if the classified part of the \n     record, which MEK has not been allowed to see and to which it \n     cannot therefore respond to directly, consists of the same \n     kind of information as the non-classified part, then the \n     Secretary of State's decision would be based on absolutely \n     nothing substantial. Time will tell. But this is about more \n     than a case in the District of Columbia and more than MEK. \n     This is about the posture of the United States toward the \n     Iranian regime . . . .\n       When succeeding generations consider the question I \n     presented at the beginning of these remarks, of what we did \n     to advance what is good and to resist what is evil, they will \n     find an answer that we and they can live with.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n            Tom Ridge, former Secretary of Homeland Security\n\n       At one point in time, we talked about and we put the MEK on \n     the terrorist list because we thought it might enhance and \n     improve the dialogue, change the dialogue. There might be \n     some noticeable improvement in our relationship with Iran and \n     I think history concludes so far in the past several years \n     since we put that organization, which by the way disarmed \n     itself, consolidated itself and has been a source of some \n     very important intelligence for this country's use and the \n     rest of the world's knowledge. If the goal was to improve \n     engagement and to solicit a different response from the \n     Iranian government, that hasn't worked out very well either. \n     So, you say to yourself at the end of the day, these efforts \n     during the past several years have been fruitless, and some \n     say through some organizations that are basically feckless, \n     not terribly effective. What happens if they become even \n     further emboldened by having nuclear capability? One, we know \n     what it says about Iran--if you think that part of the world \n     is unstable now, we can only imagine what the consequences \n     will be then . . . .\n       And you know what is probably even more alarming is that \n     we're starting to see more and more analysts accept in their \n     writings the notion of a nuclear Iran and how we would deal \n     with it. Think about that, ten years ago we were worried and \n     trying to figure out how we could make sure that didn't \n     happen and now we have some pundits and some analysts in the \n     international community saying, it's almost a fait \n     accompli, ``now what are we going to do?'' Let's just \n     pause for a moment and think what that means to the rest \n     of the world vis-a-vis America. What does it say about our \n     ability to influence geopolitical events? What does it say \n     about how our allies and friends in that region look to \n     us, and our ability to affect change that affects their \n     lives and the security of that particular region. . . .?\n       So how do we go forward? What do we do next? I think the \n     Attorney General very clearly identified probably one of the \n     most significant things we can do and that is delist as the \n     UK has done, and the European Union has done, MEK. They did \n     consolidate. They did disarm. They were a source of \n     considerable intelligence for us, and if we are to look for \n     peaceful means of encouraging a regime change, it seems to me \n     that one of the first and most significant steps we could \n     take, I guess it's under review right now by the State \n     Department, but as you well know in January of this year I \n     think the DC Circuit Court of Appeals said that, based on the \n     information you presented in this court right now (and \n     unfortunately you had to go to court, everybody goes to court \n     in the United States, but to get them delisted from the State \n     Department) the court said preliminarily, the information \n     that you've at least shared with us in court today doesn't \n     warrant them being listed as a terrorist organization. I \n     think the consequences of that particular decision, the State \n     Department as I understand it and perhaps others on this \n     panel can give us a more enlightened and more recent point of \n     view that they're actually honestly and actively considering \n     that outcome.\n       What's the benefit of that outcome? First of all it's the \n     strongest possible signal that our approach toward Iran is \n     changing. It's saying that 30 years of peaceful engagement \n     hasn't been effective, and I think everybody around the world \n     knows that. But I'm going to give you a different perspective \n     if I might because I think it has as much to do as how we're \n     viewed around the rest of the world and why I think we should \n     do it as soon as possible. I've always thought that, if \n     America was considered to be a product that we look to sell \n     around the world then our brand is based on our value system. \n     Think about that for a moment. For 200+ years, more recently \n     we have tried to promote the notion of civil society, and \n     civil institutions, and believing that in the heart of all \n     men and women everywhere around the world there is a desire \n     to be free, a desire to control your own destiny, to raise \n     your own family, to share in hopefully, the opportunities \n     that your society and your government would provide for you. \n     In inheriting all of that, we have many of those discussions \n     as it relates to how we are engaged in our effort against \n     terrorism around the world. We challenge ourselves around Abu \n     Ghraib, we challenge ourselves around Guantanamo, we \n     challenge ourselves with regard to due process. We know what \n     we stand for. It's part of the American brand. We are our \n     strongest allies; we're also our strongest critics. We know \n     what we believe in and when we seem to deviate, if some of us \n     seem to think we deviate from that brand, we take a close \n     look at ourselves in the mirror and ask ourselves ``What are \n     we doing?'' Well, part of that American brand I think is \n     being consistent with our values overseas as well. And when \n     we see a repressive theocracy, day in and day out, \n     imprisoning, torturing, executing men, women, entire families \n     because they've been brave enough, courageous enough to stand \n     in opposition to the theocracy. In their hearts, not\n[[Page E2243]]\n\n     necessarily looking to the institutions of government like \n     America but looking to the value system of freedom and \n     liberty, speech, assembly, peaceful opposition. So I frankly \n     think one of the most important things this country can do, \n     and hope we will do it as soon as possible is to delist. \n     Delist the People's Mujahedin of Iran. It's not a terrorist \n     organization. And after that, be part of a sustained, public, \n     rhetorical, and as well diplomatic embrace of our brand, with \n     the hope of convincing the rest of the world that the loyal \n     opposition, those pro-democracy warriors, individuals and \n     families in Iran can at least look to the United States not \n     with casual and occasional criticism of the Iranian \n     government and how it treats its citizens, but a sustained \n     clamor for change, aggressive diplomatic efforts to at least \n     pull some of our friends and allies into the chorus of \n     opposition to this regime. Time is running out. There aren't \n     too many options left.\n                                  ____\n\tFrances Fragos Townsend, former advisor to President George W. Bush on \n                           Homeland Security\n\n       Our policy goals in this country really must be a \n     reflection of our values. It must be consistent and it must \n     be fundamental to how we build a policy process. It struck \n     me, when you go back and look at the current, when we heard \n     Tom Ridge and others talk about the sanctions regime, we can \n     debate its efficacy we can debate its impact, but the \n     statement of the goal right now as we sit here today in \n     Washington the goal of the sanctions, which have not been yet \n     successful, is to get the regime to the bargaining table. Is \n     that really all? To describe that is as humble and modest in \n     terms of an objective, that's not enough. So, when you look \n     at all the other things we've talked about just so far this \n     morning that the MEK is still listed as an FTO all of that \n     stems from ``what are you trying to achieve.'' If you're not \n     clear, and you're not ambitious, and your goals don't \n     represent your values, you are doomed to failure. . . .\n       The FTO designations, as you can imagine during my time in \n     the government (I was in the Justice Department for many \n     years and then in the White House), monitoring the FTO \n     process, the Foreign Terrorist Organizations designation \n     process, working with the State Department was among my \n     responsibilities. I must tell you that having traveled \n     throughout the Middle East and around the world, talking to \n     our allies, the FTO designation process (we should just be \n     honest) is disrespected by our allies. It is ineffective. It \n     is corrupted by politics, and I don't mean, ``corrupted'' in \n     the criminal sense, but it has been pervaded by political \n     debate, which is part and parcel of a foreign policy \n     discussion when you're setting foreign policy goals. The fact \n     that we permit domestic politics in foreign policy concerns \n     to come into what is supposed to be an objective process, \n     that is the designation of a foreign terrorist organization, \n     undermines US credibility. . . .\n       Not only, having disarmed, and renounced violence and \n     assisted the United States, should the MEK come off the list, \n     the US Congress should abolish the list because I frankly \n     think in many respects because of how it's operated, it does \n     more to undermine our credibility on these subjects. So, I \n     would both take MEK off the list and I would ask Congress to \n     abolish it. . . .\n       The other thing that I would say and hasn't been spoken \n     about, again I'm sensitive to this because of my \n     responsibilities in the White House is, I frankly think, as \n     part of the delisting process one of the things that would \n     enable or open the potential for is permitting MEK leaders \n     who are outside of Iran to get visas and come to the United \n     States. That's an entirely, again, separate process. It would \n     be treated separately. Delisting does not necessarily mean \n     that those leaders would be able to apply and get such a visa \n     that ought to be part of this process. Those people ought to \n     be able to come here and speak about the atrocities, they \n     ought to be able to speak about the human rights abuses and \n     what's happening inside Iran to those advocates for democracy \n     and freedom. And they ought to be able to be their own \n     advocates. Right now, we are their advocates, but they are \n     entitled to make their own case both before the American \n     Congress and the American people, to raise money, to raise \n     support, and to raise awareness. So, for me, it's: take them \n     off the list, abolish the list and grant visas to expatriates \n     and exiled MEK leaders so that they can come and make their \n     own case.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Tom McClintock"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "156 Cong.

Madam Speaker, with the conclusion of the 111th \nCongress, a career of extraordinary public service in the House of \nRepresentatives comes to an end. My colleague, friend and mentor--\nChairman David Obey--is concluding his career in Congress representing \nthe families of northwestern Wisconsin that began in 1969. For twenty \nterms, David Obey has been a liberal champion and a fierce defender of \nworkers and their families. He has been a passionate and effective \nlegislator for right of all Americans to access quality health care and \neducation. And, in the realm of U.S. foreign policy, Chairman Obey has \na lifetime record of always striving to advance human dignity, peace, \nand the highest ideals of the American people around the world.\n  It has been my privilege to serve in this House with Rep. Obey for \nthe past ten years--one-quarter of his congressional career. For the \npast four years, I had the honor of serving on the House Appropriations \nCommittee, calling the gentleman from Wisconsin ``Mr. Chairman.'' I \nhave watched David Obey work--work hard, tirelessly, and with \ntremendous determination and intellect--to advance an agenda that makes \nthe lives of regular Americans the highest priority of the federal \ngovernment. Chairman Obey always fought for the less fortunate, the \nvulnerable, those struggling for an opportunity to succeed, and to \nensure those who have made this country great with their toil and \nsacrifice in the factory, the farm field, or on the battlefield. He \nfought so they too could live and retire with security, respect, and \ndignity.\n  It is often said that Mr. Obey was tough and rough on the outside, \nbut I always found him to be a kind, warm soul who knew the importance \nand magnitude of his responsibilities and carried them out with the \nhumble expertise of a legislative master. ``I started as a shy boy from \na troubled family of modest means,'' Rep. Obey once said. Well, that \nshy boy has made a lifetime of contributions to our country that will \nbe judged by history as both profound and far reaching. People who will \nnever know David Obey are living better lives with more opportunities \nbecause of him. The State of Wisconsin and the United States are better \nplaces because of his years of service in the U.S. House.\n  As a Wisconsin Progressive in the tradition of Robert LaFollette, \nRep. Obey has never shied away from calling out injustice or just plain \ndumb policymaking. In his book, ``Raising Hell for Justice,'' he \nreminds citizens and policymakers that ``federal budgets that pay for \ntax cuts for millionaires with budget cuts in education, Medicaid, \nchild care, and health care are not just unfair; they are immoral.''\n  This quote was again put to the test only last week as Chairman Obey \nvoted against extending massive tax cuts for millionaires and \nbillionaires. I was proud to join Chairman Obey in opposing this tax \ncut for the wealthy that only continues the disturbing pattern of \nincome re-distribution away from working families and towards a class \nof economic elites.\n  As the longest serving Member of Congress in Wisconsin history, I \nknow David spent far too much time away from his wife, Joan, and their \nfamily.

Madam Speaker, with the conclusion of the 111th Congress, a career of extraordinary public service in the House of Representatives comes to an end. My colleague, friend and mentor--Chairman David Obey--is concluding his career in Congress representing the families of northwestern Wisconsin that began in 1969. For twenty terms, David Obey has been a liberal champion and a fierce defender of workers and their families. He has been a passionate and effective legislator for right of all Americans to access quality health care and education. And, in the realm of U.S. foreign policy, Chairman Obey has a lifetime record of always striving to advance human dignity, peace, and the highest ideals of the American people around the world.\n\tIt has been my privilege to serve in this House with Rep. Obey for the past ten years--one-quarter of his congressional career. For the past four years, I had the honor of serving on the House Appropriations Committee, calling the gentleman from Wisconsin ``Mr. Chairman.'' I have watched David Obey work--work hard, tirelessly, and with tremendous determination and intellect--to advance an agenda that makes the lives of regular Americans the highest priority of the federal government. Chairman Obey always fought for the less fortunate, the vulnerable, those struggling for an opportunity to succeed, and to ensure those who have made this country great with their toil and sacrifice in the factory, the farm field, or on the battlefield. He fought so they too could live and retire with security, respect, and dignity.\n\tIt is often said that Mr. Obey was tough and rough on the outside, but I always found him to be a kind, warm soul who knew the importance and magnitude of his responsibilities and carried them out with the humble expertise of a legislative master. ``I started as a shy boy from a troubled family of modest means,'' Rep. Obey once said. Well, that shy boy has made a lifetime of contributions to our country that will be judged by history as both profound and far reaching. People who will never know David Obey are living better lives with more opportunities because of him. The State of Wisconsin and the United States are better places because of his years of service in the U.S. House.\n\tAs a Wisconsin Progressive in the tradition of Robert LaFollette, Rep. Obey has never shied away from calling out injustice or just plain dumb policymaking. In his book, ``Raising Hell for Justice,'' he reminds citizens and policymakers that ``federal budgets that pay for tax cuts for millionaires with budget cuts in education, Medicaid, child care, and health care are not just unfair; they are immoral.''\n\tThis quote was again put to the test only last week as Chairman Obey voted against extending massive tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. I was proud to join Chairman Obey in opposing this tax cut for the wealthy that only continues the disturbing pattern of income re-distribution away from working families and towards a class of economic elites.\n\tAs the longest serving Member of Congress in Wisconsin history, I know David spent far too much time away from his wife, Joan, and their family. I wish David, Joan, and their sons' families many happy days together in the coming years.\n\tIn conclusion, let me simply say--Mr. Chairman, you have served our country so very well. It is personally difficult to see you leave, but your lifetime of service will live on in the lives of millions of Americans whose lives you have helped to improve. As a colleague and a friend, you have made me a better legislator and for that I am grateful to you.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Betty McCollum"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "156 Cong.

The \nbill passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support because the \nSenate understood that this is simply an issue of fairness and equity \nto users and a matter of managing pollution and protecting the \nenvironment, In fact, this bill simply clarifies current law, that the \nFederal Government has a responsibility to pay its normal and customary \nfees assessed by local governments for managing polluted stormwater \nrunoff from federal properties, just as private citizens pay. The \nconsequence of failing to pass this bill is that we give the Federal \nGovernment a free ride and pass its fees on to our constituents \nthroughout the United States.\n  Section 313 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act states, ``Each \ndepartment, agency, or instrumentality . . . of the Federal Government \n. . . shall be subject to, and comply with all Federal, State, \ninterstate, and local requirements . . . in the same manner, and to the \nsame extent as any nongovernmental entity including the payment of \nreasonable service charges.'' However, the Government Accountability \nOffice issued letters to Federal agencies in the District of Columbia \ninstructing them not to pay the District of Columbia's Water and Sewer \nAuthority's (D.C. Water's) Impervious Area Charge. D.C. Water \ncalculates the charges to manage stormwater runoff based on the amount \nof impervious land occupied by the landowner. Impervious surfaces, such \nas roofs, parking lots, sidewalks and other hardened surfaces are the \nmajor contributors to stormwater runoff entering the sewer system and \nlocal rivers, lakes and streams, causing significant amounts of \npollutants to enter these waters. This bill clarifies that in my \ndistrict and all others congressional districts, Federal agencies must \ncontinue to pay their utility fees instead of passing the fees to our \nconstituents.\n  Nothing in this Act was intended to affect the payment by the United \nStates or any department, independent establishment, or agency thereof \nof any sanitary sewer services furnished by the sanitary sewage works \nof the District through any connection thereto for direct use by the \ngovernment of the United States or any department, independent \nestablishment, or agency thereof. The rules for those payments are set \nforth in law codified at section 34-2112 of the D.C. Code and nothing \nin this Act amends or otherwise affects those rules. This bill requires \nthat Congress make available, in appropriations acts, the funds that \ncould be used for to pay stormwater management charges, but not that \nthe appropriations act would need to state specifically or expressly \nthat the funds could be used to pay these charges.\n\n[[Page E2246]]\n\n  This bill is supported by the National Governors Association, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State \nGovernments, the National Association of Counties, the National League \nof Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the International City/County \nManagement Associations, as well as the National Association of Clean \nWater Agencies. All of these national groups understand that stormwater \nmanagement fees, without any exceptions, are necessary for managing and \nreducing water pollution caused by stormwater runoff. Moreover, they \nunderstand that many agencies in States and localities may stop paying \ntheir water and stormwater management fees if we do not act, putting \neven more financial burden on residents.\n  Federal law has mandated that these local governments must collect \nthese fees. No exemption has been granted to Federal facilities. Please \nsupport S. 3481 to clarify the original intent of the law.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "S. 3481--A BILL TO AMEND THE FEDERAL WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. \n3447, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of \n2010.\n  The original GI Bill proved to be a landmark initiative for our \ntroops and an outstanding investment in the future of our Nation. The \nPost-9/11 GI Bill, signed into law in 2008, built on the success of the \noriginal program by providing helpful and hard-earned educational and \neconomic benefits for our newest generation of veterans. Although \ntoday's legislation seeks to make it easier for veterans to utilize \ntheir educational benefits, some of the changes will have detrimental \nconsequences.\n  Just as the veterans of WWII were the engine of economic recovery and \nexpansion in the post-war period, the most recent generation of \nveterans will continue their service to America by reaching their full \neducational and economic potential through the Post-9/11 GI Bill.\n  While I support this bill and urge my colleagues to vote for it, \nthere are some provisions in the legislation that I believe deserve \nadditional consideration. Although I support setting a national average \ntuition rate for benefits, I am concerned that students in states like \nNew York will be negatively impacted by the $17,500 baseline.\n  This legislation will reduce benefits for students in New York \nalready enrolled in programs where the cost is above the baseline. \nStudents based decisions about which institution of higher education to \nattend partly on a benefit level guaranteed in the 2008 law. A ``hold \nharmless'' provision would have allowed these students to continue to \nreceive the same level benefits for which they are entitled.\n  Under current law, state approving agencies, SAAs, are charged with \napproving programs and schools that are deemed appropriate for vets \nusing the GI Bill. S. 3447 permits the Veterans Administration, VA, to \nmake this determination and I am concerned that this responsibility \nshould remain within SAA's jurisdiction, as they have been the experts \nin protecting veterans from fraudulent programs. The bill goes further \nby permitting veterans to use their GI benefits at schools without any \napproval by SAAs or the VA. In my view this is unwise.\n  This legislation permits the VA to expand GI benefits to trade \nschools, unaccredited colleges, and programs that lead to no degree or \ncertificate. While I understand that many veterans choose not to take a \nmore traditional path and attend an institution of higher education, I \nam deeply concerned that taxpayer dollars will go to programs that will \nnot lead to gainful employment.\n  I am also concerned that this bill includes a so-called ``last-\npayer'' provision. The last payer provision withholds the student's GI \nBill benefit until a calculation is made of any state and private \ntuition aid, for which a veteran may be eligible. In some cases, this \nwould cause a delay in GI benefits and lead to needless confusion.\n  As a former college administrator, I am very pleased to see so many \nveterans returning home and choosing to seek further education. \nHowever, I am deeply concerned with a growing number of reports that \nsome institutions may be abusing GI tuition payments by aggressively \ntargeting veterans for academic programs that may not provide an actual \nbenefit to a student, such as preparation for future employment.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that in the 112th Congress we can achieve \nbipartisan solutions to these issues to protect both taxpayers and \ndistinguished veterans. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is a small token of our \nappreciation for their valor and service to our Nation. I would like to \nsubmit for the Record a letter signed by various higher education \ngroups that outlines the community's concerns with this legislation.\n\n\n                                American Council on Education,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 14, 2010.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Council on \n     Education and the organizations listed below, we write to \n     express our hope that before adjournment, the 111th Congress \n     will approve a final version of the\n\n[[Page E2247]]\n\n     Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvement Act of \n     2010 that addresses the concerns outlined below.\n       Both the House version (H.R. 6430) and the Senate version \n     (S. 3447) make welcome improvements to current law, such as \n     expanding the benefits to troops serving in the Active Guard \n     Reserve and to National Guard members who have honorably \n     served their country on active duty, including at the sites \n     of natural disasters. The bills also replace the complex \n     state-by-state tuition and fee cap look-up chart with \n     language that specifies that GI Bill benefits cover tuition \n     and fees for veterans attending public institutions while \n     establishing a single national tuition baseline for those who \n     enroll in private institutions.\n       However, we believe that the House version is preferable in \n     two very critical respects. First, S. 3447 contains a \n     provision that would add a new source of confusion for \n     veterans and prevent them from having a clear idea of the \n     level of support to which they are entitled.

TIMOTHY H. BISHOP\n\n                              of new york\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, December 15, 2010\n\n\tMr. BISHOP of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 3447, the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvements Act of 2010.\n\tThe original GI Bill proved to be a landmark initiative for our troops and an outstanding investment in the future of our Nation. The Post-9/11 GI Bill, signed into law in 2008, built on the success of the original program by providing helpful and hard-earned educational and economic benefits for our newest generation of veterans. Although today's legislation seeks to make it easier for veterans to utilize their educational benefits, some of the changes will have detrimental consequences.\n\tJust as the veterans of WWII were the engine of economic recovery and expansion in the post-war period, the most recent generation of veterans will continue their service to America by reaching their full educational and economic potential through the Post-9/11 GI Bill.\n\tWhile I support this bill and urge my colleagues to vote for it, there are some provisions in the legislation that I believe deserve additional consideration. Although I support setting a national average tuition rate for benefits, I am concerned that students in states like New York will be negatively impacted by the $17,500 baseline.\n\tThis legislation will reduce benefits for students in New York already enrolled in programs where the cost is above the baseline. Students based decisions about which institution of higher education to attend partly on a benefit level guaranteed in the 2008 law. A ``hold harmless'' provision would have allowed these students to continue to receive the same level benefits for which they are entitled.\n\tUnder current law, state approving agencies, SAAs, are charged with approving programs and schools that are deemed appropriate for vets using the GI Bill. S. 3447 permits the Veterans Administration, VA, to make this determination and I am concerned that this responsibility should remain within SAA's jurisdiction, as they have been the experts in protecting veterans from fraudulent programs. The bill goes further by permitting veterans to use their GI benefits at schools without any approval by SAAs or the VA. In my view this is unwise.\n\tThis legislation permits the VA to expand GI benefits to trade schools, unaccredited colleges, and programs that lead to no degree or certificate. While I understand that many veterans choose not to take a more traditional path and attend an institution of higher education, I am deeply concerned that taxpayer dollars will go to programs that will not lead to gainful employment.\n\tI am also concerned that this bill includes a so-called ``last-payer'' provision. The last payer provision withholds the student's GI Bill benefit until a calculation is made of any state and private tuition aid, for which a veteran may be eligible. In some cases, this would cause a delay in GI benefits and lead to needless confusion.\n\tAs a former college administrator, I am very pleased to see so many veterans returning home and choosing to seek further education. However, I am deeply concerned with a growing number of reports that some institutions may be abusing GI tuition payments by aggressively targeting veterans for academic programs that may not provide an actual benefit to a student, such as preparation for future employment.\n\tMr. Speaker, it is my hope that in the 112th Congress we can achieve bipartisan solutions to these issues to protect both taxpayers and distinguished veterans. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is a small token of our appreciation for their valor and service to our Nation. I would like to submit for the Record a letter signed by various higher education groups that outlines the community's concerns with this legislation.\n\n\n                                American Council on Education,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 14, 2010.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Council on \n     Education and the organizations listed below, we write to \n     express our hope that before adjournment, the 111th Congress \n     will approve a final version of the\n[[Page E2247]]\n\n     Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Improvement Act of \n     2010 that addresses the concerns outlined below.\n       Both the House version (H.R. 6430) and the Senate version \n     (S. 3447) make welcome improvements to current law, such as \n     expanding the benefits to troops serving in the Active Guard \n     Reserve and to National Guard members who have honorably \n     served their country on active duty, including at the sites \n     of natural disasters. The bills also replace the complex \n     state-by-state tuition and fee cap look-up chart with \n     language that specifies that GI Bill benefits cover tuition \n     and fees for veterans attending public institutions while \n     establishing a single national tuition baseline for those who \n     enroll in private institutions.\n       However, we believe that the House version is preferable in \n     two very critical respects. First, S. 3447 contains a \n     provision that would add a new source of confusion for \n     veterans and prevent them from having a clear idea of the \n     level of support to which they are entitled. This so-called \n     ``last-payer'' provision, which withholds the GI Bill benefit \n     until a calculation is made of any state and private tuition \n     aid for which a veteran may be eligible, would not only \n     confound veterans and delay the delivery of aid, but in some \n     cases would conflict with state statutes. In contrast, H.R. \n     6430 does not include such a provision and will help end the \n     frustration and confusion that far too many veterans have \n     experienced in attempting to access their benefits.\n       Second, H.R. 6430 includes an important ``hold harmless'' \n     provision, designed to protect veterans who might otherwise \n     be negatively impacted by the establishment of a national \n     baseline. In several states, veterans attending private \n     institutions currently receive a base benefit that is greater \n     than the new national baseline amount provided in either \n     version of the legislation. By failing to include this ``hold \n     harmless'' language, the Senate bill would reduce benefits \n     for a number of veterans upon enrollment for a subsequent \n     term. In contrast, the House bill would help ensure that \n     veterans continue to receive their current benefits without \n     interruption.\n       As this legislation nears passage, we strongly urge you to \n     modify S. 3447 so that it reflects the approach taken by the \n     House bill on these two important issues. Our campuses have \n     worked very hard to smooth out the difficulties that veterans \n     have faced under current law, and these improvements will \n     enable them to serve veterans even more effectively.\n       Thank you for all of your work on behalf of the nation's \n     veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Molly Corbett Broad,\n     President.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Timothy H.

JOHN M. SPRATT, JR.\n\n                           of south carolina\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010\n\n  Mr. SPRATT. Madam Speaker, when I was elected to Congress 28 years \nago, it was the fulfillment of a life-long ambition. But I had never \nserved in elective office before, and frankly, I wondered how well it \nwould wear--all the back-slapping and glad-handing and garrulous talk.\n  My first revelation was to find that this House is not made up of \nback-slappers and glad-handlers. It is made up of members who work hard \nto get here, many out of patriotic purpose, hoping that they in their \ntime can contribute something worthy of this great country. Most of the \nmembers are extroverted and energetic, and have to be, to get elected \nevery two years.\n  At Davidson College, my alma mater; at Oxford on scholarship; at Yale \nLaw; in the Pentagon as a young analyst, and as a practicing lawyer, I \nmade many good friends, but few as good as the friends I have made \nhere. Of all the things I will miss, I will miss most the fellowship \nand camaraderie.\n  I first experienced Congress as a young Army officer in the Pentagon, \nworking for the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) on defense \ncontractors in financial distress, mainly Lockheed Aircraft \nCorporation. As staff at the Department of Defense, we did a lot of \nwork that I thought staff at Congress should be doing, particularly if \nCongress hoped to be a co-equal branch. The greatest difference between \nCongress then, from '69 through '71, and Congress 12 years later, when \nI came here in 1983 as an elected member, was staff. Committee staff \nand members' staff both had grown greatly, in quality and quantity. As \na result, today's Congress is better staffed and equipped, more \neffective and independent, and a lot closer to being co-equal.\n  I have had the good fortune of working with talented staff in my \noffice and on the committees where I have served; and as I leave, I \nthank them all, because anything I have done of significance, I did \nwith their good help.\n  My first quest in Congress was to get a good committee assignment. \nAfter two days of bidding, I had struck at every option and never \nscored a hit. I was at a loss for where to go when Tony Coelho sought \nme out and offered me a seat on the House Armed Services Committee.\n  The HASC dove-tailed nicely with my district because the Fifth \nDistrict includes Shaw Air Force Base. But as important as Shaw is, I \nlearned that other members had defense interests far larger than mine. \nSince I was not carrying water for a large defense constituency, I had \nthe independence to take on troubled systems, like the DIVAD, the \nDivision Air Defense gun, which my amendment effectively killed; or the \nMX , which I voted to stop at 50 missiles, or binary chemical weapons, \nwhich my amendments helped side-track and eventually derail.\n  In selecting members for every committee, the leadership tries to \nmatch the member's interests at home with his committee in the House. \nThat's natural and to be expected, but we should also select members \nfor ballast--members free to act, ask hard questions, and offer \namendments.\n  At the time I took my seat on Armed Services, the nation was engaged \nin the biggest defense build-up in our peace-time history, and the \ncommittee chairman presiding over this build-up was well past his \nprime. Elderly and weak, he could barely be heard over the din of noise \nin the committee room. When Les Aspin let it be known that he was going \nto run for the chair, and leap-frog six senior members, I was among the \nfirst to offer support. We prevailed, and over the next five years, \nAspin allowed me to set up and chair two panels, the first on Reagan's \nStrategic Defense Initiative, and the second, on the nuclear weapons \ncomplex. Though both were important, neither was receiving the \nattention it deserved by the committee or any of its subcommittees, due \nto other issues or a lack of interest in these.\n\n  Because of our oversight, we were able to pare back the SDI budget; \nshift funds from strategic missile defense to theater missile defense, \nand wipe out a few far-fetched systems altogether. For example, my \namendment deleted funding for the space-based interceptor. In the press \nrelease accompanying passage of the defense bill, the headline read: \n``House Takes the Star out of Star Wars.'' President Reagan did not \nfind it amusing; he vetoed the defense bill, but after many years and \nbillions of dollars, our cuts have stood the test of time.\n  After two years, we had to return SDI to the Research and Development \nSubcommittee, so we set up a new panel dealing with nuclear facilities. \nThe Cold War had enabled our nuclear complex to put off environmental \nand safety issues. To deal with these problems, we shifted nearly a \nbillion dollars from Defense to Energy, and saved over a billion \ndollars by stopping the Special Isotope Separator, a laser-driven \nprocess to produce plutonium, even though the Secretary of Energy \nacknowledged we were ``awash in plutonium.''\n  We scored a number of such successes, but the most satisfying took \nplace largely off stage where we made the case for a moratorium on \nnuclear testing. We first helped Representative. Kopetski draft a bill \ncalling for an immediate cessation of testing, and we then drafted an \nalternative that we thought the Senate would pass allowing for a few \nfinal tests before declaring a moratorium. We proposed the alternative \nto Senators Exon and Hatfield, who took up its support and moved it to \npassage through the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. This saved \nthe moratorium from being vetoed because the super-collider was also in \nthis bill, and President Bush wanted it to be funded.\n  Another satisfying measure: my substitute to the war powers \nresolution authorizing President Bush to use force against Iraq. This \nsubstitute authorized the force needed to search for weapons of mass \ndestruction, but before going further, it called on the president to \nseek the sanction of the U.N. Security Council, as his father had done, \nand to come back to Congress with the case for a broader use of force, \nwhich would be received with a fast-track guaranty, an up-or-down vote \nin the House and Senate. My substitute did not prevail, but it drew 157 \nvotes, and gave many members a position they could uphold.\n  I made my mark in the House on defense, but during most of my 28 \nyears, my greatest concern was the budget and chronic deficits. In \n1997, I was elected by the Democratic Caucus as ranking member of the \nBudget Committee. I ran against opposition and told the caucus that if \nI was elected, we would ``finish the job'' of balancing the budget that \nbegan with President Clinton's first budget. About the same time, \nErskine Bowles returned to Washington to be the President's Chief of \nStaff, and when he paid me a courtesy call, he told me that he had the \nsame understanding with the President. With the President's \nencouragement, the four budget principals in the House and Senate began \nmeeting, and by May 1997 we had hammered out a balanced budget \nagreement which worked. By 1998, the budget was in balance for the \nfirst time in 30 years.\n  President Bush took office with an advantage few presidents have \nenjoyed, a budget in balance, in the black by $236 billion the year \nbefore. I was invited to Austin, Texas with 12 other members to discuss \ndefense issues with the incoming president. I used my time to encourage \nPresident Bush to apply the surplus in Social Security to buy \noutstanding Treasury debt, and reduce Treasury debt held by the public. \nThis would increase net national saving, lower public debt, and be a \nlong step toward making Social Security solvent. The president-elect \nprofessed interest but not for long, and by 2004, the deficit was over \n$400 billion.\n  President George W. Bush was greeted as he took office by a surplus \nof $200 billion. When he left office in 2009, the surplus was gone, and \nthe deficit projected for that fiscal year was $1.2 trillion.\n  As I leave Congress, the deficit is hovering around a trillion \ndollars and while improving, current deficits exceed the deficits of \nthe mid-1990s by every measure. But the process of resolving both is \nbasically the same: everything must be on the table and everyone must \nbe at the table.\n  As the menu for such a meeting, the President's Fiscal Commission has \nsubmitted a plate full of recommendations. I served on the commission \nand voted for the report, even though I do not support all of its \nproposals. I cast an ``aye'' because our country is in desperate need \nof a plan for balancing the budget and making Social Security and \nMedicare solvent. These will not be popular--far from it--but as they \nshore up our economy, they will prove their worth and raise the \nstanding of Congress in the eyes of our countrymen. I am\n\n[[Page E2249]]\n\nsorry that I will not be here to lend my support, but as a parting \ngesture, I urge the House to go for it.\n  I will remember with pride my 28 years in the House of \nRepresentatives and our positive accomplishments over that time. I am \ntold that only 500 members have served in the House for as long as 28 \nyears. I thank my constituents for that opportunity, and hope that \nhistory will show that I used it to make this a better country in ways \nthat stood the test of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "REFLECTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HON.

The focus of this \nlegislative measure is to prevent contamination of food before it \noccurs, which is a departure from the current system today that \nresponds after a food-borne illness outbreak. Specifically, it requires \nfood producers to come up with strategies to prevent contamination and \nthen continually test to make sure these strategies are working. In \naddition, H.R. 2751 would allow the FDA to increase the number of \ninspections to conduct, and requires foreign importers to ensure their \nfood products meet U.S. safety standards.\n  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the leadership of the House and the Senate for \nthis bipartisan legislation to provide a framework for developing \npreventive control standards from farm to table to protect the public \nfrom food contamination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "FDA FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               speech of\n\n                          HON.

Lack of \n     accountability for Wall Street and big banks cost 8 million \n     jobs.

Madam Speaker, it is with sorrow that I inform the House \nof the death of Mrs. Avis Green Tucker, a distinguished Missouri \ncitizen from Warrensburg, in the 4th Congressional District. Avis Green \nTucker was not just my own long-time friend. She was one of Missouri's \nmost highly respected newspaper publishers. She was a willing volunteer \nfrequently called to important service by Missouri governors from both \npolitical parties. And she was a particularly inspiring role model \namong women leaders in our state.\n  Avis and her husband, William Tucker, bought the Daily Star-Journal \nin 1947 and the paper stayed in the Tucker family for some 60 years, \nuntil its sale in 2007 to another distinguished Missouri newspaper \nfamily, the Bradleys of St. Joseph. Bill Tucker was serving as \npublisher in Warrensburg when he died of a heart attack in 1966. Avis \ntook over as one of the few female daily newspaper publishers in the \nMidwest. She once said: ``I decided I was going to run this paper. I \nwas going to try. I told everyone that I had more nerve than ability, \nwhich was the truth.'' But that was a typically reticent and humble \nstatement from a\n\n[[Page E2252]]\n\nwoman whose abilities were quite remarkable. Those abilities were \nwidely recognized. In 1982, Avis became the first female president of \nthe Missouri Press Association. That was just one of many ``firsts'' \nachieved by Avis Tucker, including serving as the first female \npresident of the Missouri Associated Dailies organization, and becoming \nthe first woman inducted into the Missouri Press Association Hall of \nFame. She received the National Newspaper Association's McKinney Award, \ngiven to a woman who ``exhibited distinguished service to the community \npress.'' Just this past May, Avis became chair emeritus of the Missouri \nPress Association's Foundation Board, which she helped found and fund.\n  She served not only as one of the state's rare female publishers, but \nin other leadership roles, particularly at our mutual alma mater, the \nUniversity of Missouri. Mizzou's world-famous School of Journalism \nhonored her with its Honor Medal in 1976. And in 1972, Avis became the \nfirst woman president of the University of Missouri's governing body, \nthe Board of Curators. Her service as a curator has particular \nsignificance for me, since she was appointed to succeed her late \nhusband as a curator upon his death. And Bill Tucker had been appointed \nto succeed my father, Isaac Newton Skelton III, upon his passing. In \nMissouri, one of the highest honors one can achieve is being named to \nhelp guide our land-grant state university, and this is an honor that \nhas been treasured by both the Skelton and Tucker families.\n  Avis Green Tucker will be remembered fondly by all who had the \nprivilege of knowing her, including me.

Madam Speaker, today I am inserting into the \n     Congressional Record a recent blog post by Professor William \n     Black from the Associate Professor of Economics and Law at \n     the University of Missouri--Kansas City. Professor Black has \n     focused on white collar crime and routing out of fraud in our \n     financial system, both in practice and as a field of academic \n     study. Professor Black's answers on this CNN blog give \n     direction to our work on cleaning up our financial system of \n     the criminals while protecting those who follow the law. As \n     this Congress\n\n[[Page E2253]]\n\n     comes to a close and we look to the future, we are faced with \n     the task of doing more to address the challenges of Main \n     Street while holding Wall Street accountable. Professor \n     Black's writing should be one of our guides.\n\n               Black: The Dominance of Unethical Banking\n\n                            (By Jay Kernis)\n\n       Only on the blog: Answering today's five OFF-SET questions \n     is William K. Black, Associate Professor of Economics and Law \n     at the University of Missouri--Kansas City.\n       He was the Executive Director of the Institute for Fraud \n     Prevention from 2005-2007. Black also served as litigation \n     director of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, deputy director \n     of the FSLIC, SVP and General Counsel of the Federal Home \n     Loan Bank of San Francisco, and Senior Deputy Chief Counsel, \n     Office of Thrift Supervision. He was also deputy director of \n     the National Commission on Financial Institution Reform, \n     Recovery and Enforcement.\n       You say that fraud by America's major banks plays an \n     enormous continuing role in the country's financial crisis. \n     How widespread is the fraud and what are the most serious \n     charges?\n       The FBI testified in September 2004 that mortgage fraud was \n     ``epidemic'' and predicted that it would cause an ``economic \n     crisis'' if it were not contained. Instead of being \n     contained, FBI data show that it grew enormously after 2004. \n     The mortgage lending industry's own anti-fraud experts (MARI) \n     warned in 2006 that ``liar's'' loans deserved their name--\n     MARI reported a study finding that 80% of such loans were \n     fraudulent. MARI warned that liar's loans were ``an open \n     invitation to fraudsters.''\n       In a liar's loan the lender agrees not to verify the \n     borrower's income, wealth, job, and debts. The lender and its \n     agents, loan brokers, can then make up those numbers to make \n     the loan appear to be only moderately insane and sell the \n     fraudulent loan to an entity, typically an investment banking \n     firm or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, who will pool thousands of \n     fraudulent loans together and create a toxic financial \n     derivative called a ``CDO.'' The rating agencies and \n     investment bankers knew they had to engage in the financial \n     version of ``don't ask; don't tell'' on these CDOs because if \n     they ever really kicked the tires they would all explode--the \n     frauds in the underlying liar's loans from which the CDOs \n     were supposed to ``derive'' their value were that obvious and \n     common.\n       A credit ratings firm couldn't give a ``AAA'' rating (the \n     highest possible--the rating that virtually all these toxic \n     derivatives were given) if it looked at a sample of the \n     loans--so they religiously did not kick the tires on the \n     liar's loans. So we had the farce of ``credit rating'' \n     agencies whose expertise was supposedly in reviewing credit \n     quality never looking at that credit quality so that they \n     could make enormous fees by giving toxic waste pristine \n     ``AAA'' ratings.\n       The investment banks couldn't sell the financial \n     derivatives loans to others if the investment bankers (whose \n     supposed expertise was evaluating credit risk) were to \n     actually look at credit quality of the underlying liar's \n     loans. If they looked, they'd document that the loans were \n     overwhelmingly fraudulent. They'd then have three options.\n       A. They could sell the CDOs to others by calling them \n     wonderful ``AAA'' investments--while having files proving \n     that they knew this was a lie. This option is the \n     prosecutor's dream.\n       B. They could have sued the lenders that sold them the \n     fraudulent liar's loans. The investment banks typically had a \n     clear contractual right to force the fraudulent loans to buy \n     back the liar's loans. But there were fatal problems with \n     that option. The lenders that made liar's loans typically had \n     minimal capital (net worth). If the investment banks had \n     demanded that they repurchase the loans they would have been \n     unable to do so--and the demand would have exposed the \n     investment banks' bright shining lie that by pooling liar's \n     loans they could create ``AAA'' CDOs. Every CDO purchaser \n     from the investment banks would then demand that the \n     investment banks repurchased their CDOs--which would have \n     caused virtually every large U.S. investment bank to fail.\n       C. They could have gone to the Justice Department and \n     expose the massive fraud that was destroying the American \n     economy and help the FBI investigate the lenders specializing \n     in making liar's loans, the corrupt appraisers, and the \n     credit rating agencies. But that would have caused the CDO \n     bubble to burst and the investment banks to fail.\n       That's why the industry went with the fourth option--\n     ``don't ask; don't tell.'' It's like the famous fable of the \n     emperor and the fraudulent designer. The designer tells \n     everyone that he has created clothes for the emperor of such \n     beauty that only the most sophisticated people can even see \n     the clothes. The emperor and his cronies all agree that the \n     clothes are glorious. The fraud only collapses when a boy \n     blurts out: ``the emperor is naked.'' As long as no one \n     engaged in the frauds pointed out that you can't make a \n     ``AAA'' rating out of a pool of massively overvalued \n     fraudulent loans the housing bubble could hyper-inflate and \n     the officers of the investment banks and credit rating \n     agencies could become wealthy beyond their dreams.\n       I cite a study by Fitch, the smallest of the Big 3 rating \n     agencies later that documents the endemic nature of the fraud \n     in the nonprime mortgages backing the CDOs. That study does \n     not contradict the ``don't ask; don't tell'' strategy because \n     Fitch only published it in November 2007--after the secondary \n     market that created CDOs collapsed and it would not lose any \n     fees by asking and telling about the endemic fraud.\n       The industry sharply increased the number of liar's loans \n     after MARI's warnings that they were overwhelmingly \n     fraudulent. Fitch reviewed a small sample of the nonprime \n     loan and found that there was evidence of fraud in ``nearly \n     every'' file they reviewed and that the frauds were obvious \n     on the face of the loan and servicing files and would have \n     been discovered by any competent loan underwriting process. \n     Self-reviews by fraudulent nonprime lenders have consistently \n     revealed pervasive fraud in liar's loans. Reviews by \n     independent experts demonstrate that fraud was endemic in \n     liar's loans.\n       My testimony to the Senate and the Financial Crisis Inquiry \n     Commission (FCIC) explains why the number of criminal \n     referrals the FBI receives annually extrapolates to millions \n     of frauds. There were no formal definitions of an ``alt a'' \n     or ``stated income'' loan (the two most common euphemisms for \n     liar's loans and, therefore, all the data are best guesses), \n     but Credit Suisse reported in 2007 that by 2006, 49% of new \n     mortgage loans in the U.S. were stated income (liar's loans). \n     If one assumes an 80% fraud incidence--which is the low end \n     of published studies by independent experts--that translates \n     into millions of fraudulent loans being made in 2006 alone.\n       State Attorney Generals' investigations have found that it \n     was lenders and their agents who put the lies in ``liar's'' \n     loans. The NY AG found, for example, that Washington Mutual \n     (WaMu), which specialized in nonprime loans, (and is the \n     largest bank failure in U.S. history) kept a ``black list'' \n     of appraisers. Appraisers got on the black list, however, if \n     they refused to provide WaMu with inflated (fraudulent) \n     appraisals. Survey data of appraisers confirms that nonprime \n     lenders and their agents commonly coerced appraisers to \n     inflate market values. The borrower has no leverage to coerce \n     appraisers.\n       There is no honest reason for a lender to seek, or permit, \n     appraisals to be inflated. White-collar criminologists and \n     competent banking regulators recognize that appraisal fraud \n     is a superb ``marker'' of ``control fraud''--the devastating \n     frauds in which the senior officers that control a seemingly \n     legitimate firm use it as a ``weapon'' to defraud. Iowa \n     Attorney General Miller testified before the Federal Reserve \n     in 2007 that his investigations found that the lenders and \n     the agents typically prompted or even directly provided the \n     false information in nonprime loan applications.\n       This makes sense because only lenders and loan brokers \n     would know the key debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios \n     that would make the borrowers' application more likely to be \n     approved and generate the largest fees to the lenders and \n     their agents. AG Miller even aptly described the \n     ``Gresham's'' dynamic that prevailed in nonprime lending. A \n     Gesham's dynamic arises in this context when lenders and loan \n     brokers that cheat gain a competitive advantage over honest \n     lenders and agents. The result can be a race to the bottom in \n     which those with no ethics drive the ethical from the \n     marketplace.\n       Attorneys General in 50 states are investigating mortgage \n     fraud and foreclosure fraud. Do you think this was bad \n     bookkeeping or are banks intentionally doing something \n     illegal?\n       I've explained why the data demonstrate that mortgage \n     fraud, particularly via liar's loans, was endemic, \n     intentional, and driven by the lenders and their agents. \n     Lenders and agents engaged in mortgage fraud do not want to \n     keep accurate records, for those records could provide a \n     roadmap for prosecuting them. The dearth of records was one \n     of the key attractions of liar's loans to these lenders and \n     their agents. That dynamic means that records are commonly \n     missing at lenders engaged in fraud.\n       Keeping good records is also a pain for loan officers. It \n     is a cost--it slows them down from making new (fraudulent) \n     loans that drive their income. Another marker of loan fraud \n     is paying loan officers large bonuses based on loan volume \n     instead of loan quality--everyone in the trade knows this \n     ends in disaster. But the failure of the lender is not a \n     failure of the fraud scheme. Here's the four-part recipe for \n     lenders maximizing fictional short-term accounting income \n     (thereby maximizing their bonuses). Note that the same recipe \n     maximizes real losses:\n       A. Grow extremely rapidly\n       B. Make very bad loans at high interest rates (``yield'')\n       C. Use extreme leverage (high debt relative to you equity)\n       D. Provide grossly inadequate loss reserves\n       A lender that follows this recipe is mathematically \n     guaranteed to report record (albeit fictional) income in the \n     near term--and to cause massive losses in the longer term. \n     This is why the Nobel prize winning economist, George Akerlof \n     and his colleague Paul Romer wrote the famous 1993 article \n     entitled: ``Looting: the Economic Underworld of Bankruptcy \n     for Profit.'' They describe accounting fraud as ``a sure \n     thing.'' The lender fails, but the senior officers walk away \n     wealthy. Since 1993, things have become far worse--we now \n     often bail out the failed lenders and leave the thieves in \n     charge.\n       But a lender making thousands of bad loans has to gut its \n     ``back office'' operations--the folks who are supposed to \n     document loans and prevent bad loans. We know that this is \n     exactly what happened. Bank officers and employees of \n     nonprime lenders\n\n[[Page E2254]]\n\n     were reamed out by their superiors if they tried to block the \n     bad loans. This dynamic is an independent reason why \n     recordkeeping at the nonprime lenders is often horrific.\n       Finally, lenders like Bank of America, Citibank, and WaMu \n     acquired major nonprime lenders that were notorious for their \n     predatory and fraudulent lending. These banks then often \n     place the employees they obtained via these mergers in charge \n     of loan servicing. It was utterly predictable that they would \n     continue their unethical practices when they functioned as \n     loan servicers--particularly because the alternative would be \n     to admit that their loan servicing files were a shambles. Far \n     better to simply file false affidavits and claim that \n     everything was in order--which is exactly what many of the \n     largest loan servicers did ten thousand times a month.\n       This is one of the reasons that my colleague Randy Wray and \n     I have called for Bank of America to be placed promptly into \n     receivership. A minor blue collar thief can go to prison for \n     life under some ``three strikes'' laws--a huge bank doesn't \n     even suffer a major loss of reputation when it commits a \n     hundred thousand felonies. The U.S. now has its own version \n     of crony capitalism that has produced recurrent, intensifying \n     financial crises--just as crony capitalism does in many \n     nations. The difference is that our economy is so massive \n     that when we have a crisis many nations suffer. When a \n     nation's elites are able to cheat with impunity the result is \n     always disastrous.\n       What should President Obama and Congress be doing right now \n     to regulate the banks in a meaningful and fair way?\n       Economists, white-collar criminologists, and regulators \n     agree that the key is to stop, or at least limit, perverse \n     incentives. Intensely criminogenic environments lead to \n     epidemics of control fraud. There are six key components of \n     what makes an environment dangerously criminogenic.\n       A. Size matters. A tremendous bubble in the price of \n     persimmons won't harm the U.S. economy. Real estate bubbles, \n     by contrast, could cause losses that were a large percentage \n     of the U.S. GDP. That's how you get a Great Recession. \n     Accounting control frauds are particularly dangerous because \n     of they can grow so rapidly and because they tend to cluster \n     in the assets that are most ideal for accounting fraud. The \n     combination of clustering and rapid growth means that \n     epidemics of accounting control fraud can hyper-inflate \n     massive bubbles. Akerlof & Romer and my work have long warned \n     specifically about this danger.\n       The federal regulatory and prosecutorial agencies are \n     filled with ``chief economists,'' but there are no ``chief \n     criminologists'', no comprehensive federal data on the most \n     destructive white-collar crimes, and virtually zero federal \n     funding for research into the elite financial frauds that \n     have caused trillions of dollars of losses in the U.S. over \n     the last 20 years. We need to do the opposite--hire chief \n     criminologists, keep comprehensive data on the worst frauds, \n     and fund research so that we can actively identify the \n     industries at greatest risk of developing the next epidemic \n     of control fraud. (And this needs to be done not only for \n     banks. The FDA, for example, needs help in spotting frauds \n     that maim and kill.) We then need to act, quickly, to stop \n     those epidemics in their tracks. We did this in 1990-91 as \n     S&L regulators when we stopped the rapid spread of ``liar's'' \n     loans at several California S&Ls.\n       B. Deregulation, desupervision (the rules remain in place \n     but the anti-regulators running the regulatory agencies don't \n     enforce them) and de facto decriminalization (the three \n     ``de's'') produce the ideal criminogenic environment. The \n     regulators are the ``cops on the beat'' when it comes to \n     sophisticated frauds. If you remove the cops of the beat, \n     cheaters prosper and honest businesses are driven from the \n     markets. President Obama largely kept in place the failed \n     anti-regulators he inherited from President Bush. Indeed, \n     Obama promoted Geithner--an abject failure as a regulator in \n     his capacity as President of the NY Fed--and renominated \n     Bernanke, an even greater failure. Obama should fire Attorney \n     General Holder and Treasury Secretary Geithner and ask \n     Chairman Bernanke to resign. He should appoint regulators and \n     prosecutors who have a track record of success.\n       C. Executive compensation. There is a consensus that \n     executive compensation should be based on long-term (real) \n     profitability. In reality, executive compensation is \n     overwhelmingly based on short-term reported income. (It's \n     actually worse than that--if the short-term results are bad \n     corporations commonly gimmick the compensation system to \n     reward the senior officers' failures.) Everyone agrees that \n     short-term reported accounting income is easy to inflate \n     through accounting fraud and virtually everyone agrees that \n     this creates strong, perverse incentives. Since, the current \n     crisis began, the percentage of bonus compensation based on \n     short-term reported income has increased--executive \n     compensation has become more perverse.\n       Note that executive compensation also allows the CEO to \n     convert the firm's assets to his personal benefit using \n     seemingly normal corporate mechanisms, which makes it far \n     harder to prosecute the CEO for looting the firm. All bonus \n     income that takes annual income above $200,000 should be paid \n     after five years--if the firm's reported income turns out to \n     be real. There should be ``clawback'' provisions to recover \n     bonuses even after those five years if they were based on \n     corporate income inflated by fraud or ``window dressing.''\n       D. Professional compensation is perverse. Accounting \n     control frauds deliberately exploit this to create the \n     Gresham's dynamic that allow them to suborn the outside \n     professionals--appraisers, attorneys, auditors, and rating \n     agencies--who are supposed to prevent fraud, but who actually \n     become the frauds' most valuable allies. Honest professionals \n     don't get hired, the unethical professionals prosper. This \n     process creates ``echo'' epidemics of control fraud. \n     Fraudulent nonprime lenders, for example, shaped financial \n     incentives to be perverse to create endemic appraisal and \n     loan broker fraud. The banks should not be able to hire or \n     fire the appraisers, credit rating agencies, and auditors--\n     except for fraud or serious incompetence. Those professionals \n     can only be truly independent if they are assigned to work \n     for the bank by a truly independent entity.\n       E. The federal government has permitted banks to inflate \n     their reported incomes and ``net worth'' for the purpose of \n     evading the mandatory statutory duty under the Prompt \n     Corrective Action (PCA) law to close deeply insolvent banks. \n     Congress, at the behest of the Chamber of Commerce, the \n     banking trade associations, and Chairman Bernanke, \n     successfully extorted the Financial Accounting Standards \n     Board (FASB) to scam the accounting rules so that the banks \n     could fail to recognize on their accounting reports over a \n     trillion dollars in losses.\n       When banks understate their losses massively they, by \n     definition, overstate their net worth massively. The PCA's \n     provisions kick in when net worth falls, so the accounting \n     lies have gutted the PCA. The accounting lies also allow the \n     banks to (once again) report high fictional income when they \n     are experiencing large, real losses. This accounting scam \n     allows the bank executives to collect hundreds of billions of \n     dollars in bonuses. We should end the accounting scam and \n     enforce the PCA.\n       We are also secretly subsidizing banks and hiding their \n     losses through massive loans from the Federal Reserve backed \n     by toxic collateral. We should end those subsidies and force \n     them to post good collateral.\n       F. Systemically dangerous institutions (SDIs) have often \n     become far larger and more dangerous since the crisis. The \n     administration is taking no serious steps to protect us \n     against the roughly 20 SDIs even though the administration \n     claims that when one of them next fails it is likely to cause \n     a global financial crisis. Why are we juggling 20 live \n     grenades? The only question is when the next pin will drop \n     out and we'll be blown up.\n       The good news about the SDIs is that they have reason to \n     exist. They would be far more efficient if they shrank in \n     size to levels at which they no longer endangered the global \n     economy. We should do three things about the SDIs. One, stop \n     their growth--immediately. Two, order them to shrink over the \n     next five years to a size at which they no longer are SDIs. \n     Let them decide what operations to sell. Three, intensively \n     regulate the SDIs during those five years. That includes \n     placing any insolvent SDIs in ``pass through \n     receiverships''--which does not prompt crises.\n       If there were one questionable banking practice that you \n     could stop today, what would that be?\n       The foreclosure frauds.\n       You have spent decades examining what goes on in banks. Do \n     think that bankers, either through culture or genetics, are \n     ethically-challenged?\n       When you allow a Gresham's dynamic to operate and when \n     entry to an industry is easy (as it was for loan brokers and \n     mortgage bankers), you concentrate the least ethical business \n     leaders in the industry that is most criminogenic. In the \n     last decade, banking has been severely criminogenic in the \n     U.S. and much of the world. The unethical banking leaders \n     became dominant. Their banks, which followed the four-part \n     recipe for maximizing fictional accounting income, became far \n     larger and drew the greatest praise from the business \n     boosters than dominated the financial media. They made their \n     reputations and their fortunes through fraud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "BLACK: THE DOMINANCE OF UNETHICAL BANKING\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           HON.

Madam Speaker, today I am inserting into the \n     Congressional Record a recent blog post by Professor William \n     Black from the Associate Professor of Economics and Law at \n     the University of Missouri--Kansas City. Professor Black has \n     focused on white collar crime and routing out of fraud in our \n     financial system, both in practice and as a field of academic \n     study. Professor Black's answers on this CNN blog give \n     direction to our work on cleaning up our financial system of \n     the criminals while protecting those who follow the law. As \n     this Congress\n[[Page E2253]]\n\n     comes to a close and we look to the future, we are faced with \n     the task of doing more to address the challenges of Main \n     Street while holding Wall Street accountable. Professor \n     Black's writing should be one of our guides.\n\n               Black: The Dominance of Unethical Banking\n\n                            (By Jay Kernis)\n\n       Only on the blog: Answering today's five OFF-SET questions \n     is William K. Black, Associate Professor of Economics and Law \n     at the University of Missouri--Kansas City.\n       He was the Executive Director of the Institute for Fraud \n     Prevention from 2005-2007. Black also served as litigation \n     director of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, deputy director \n     of the FSLIC, SVP and General Counsel of the Federal Home \n     Loan Bank of San Francisco, and Senior Deputy Chief Counsel, \n     Office of Thrift Supervision. He was also deputy director of \n     the National Commission on Financial Institution Reform, \n     Recovery and Enforcement.\n       You say that fraud by America's major banks plays an \n     enormous continuing role in the country's financial crisis. \n     How widespread is the fraud and what are the most serious \n     charges?\n       The FBI testified in September 2004 that mortgage fraud was \n     ``epidemic'' and predicted that it would cause an ``economic \n     crisis'' if it were not contained. Instead of being \n     contained, FBI data show that it grew enormously after 2004. \n     The mortgage lending industry's own anti-fraud experts (MARI) \n     warned in 2006 that ``liar's'' loans deserved their name--\n     MARI reported a study finding that 80% of such loans were \n     fraudulent. MARI warned that liar's loans were ``an open \n     invitation to fraudsters.''\n       In a liar's loan the lender agrees not to verify the \n     borrower's income, wealth, job, and debts. The lender and its \n     agents, loan brokers, can then make up those numbers to make \n     the loan appear to be only moderately insane and sell the \n     fraudulent loan to an entity, typically an investment banking \n     firm or Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, who will pool thousands of \n     fraudulent loans together and create a toxic financial \n     derivative called a ``CDO.'' The rating agencies and \n     investment bankers knew they had to engage in the financial \n     version of ``don't ask; don't tell'' on these CDOs because if \n     they ever really kicked the tires they would all explode--the \n     frauds in the underlying liar's loans from which the CDOs \n     were supposed to ``derive'' their value were that obvious and \n     common.\n       A credit ratings firm couldn't give a ``AAA'' rating (the \n     highest possible--the rating that virtually all these toxic \n     derivatives were given) if it looked at a sample of the \n     loans--so they religiously did not kick the tires on the \n     liar's loans. So we had the farce of ``credit rating'' \n     agencies whose expertise was supposedly in reviewing credit \n     quality never looking at that credit quality so that they \n     could make enormous fees by giving toxic waste pristine \n     ``AAA'' ratings.\n       The investment banks couldn't sell the financial \n     derivatives loans to others if the investment bankers (whose \n     supposed expertise was evaluating credit risk) were to \n     actually look at credit quality of the underlying liar's \n     loans. If they looked, they'd document that the loans were \n     overwhelmingly fraudulent. They'd then have three options.\n       A. They could sell the CDOs to others by calling them \n     wonderful ``AAA'' investments--while having files proving \n     that they knew this was a lie. This option is the \n     prosecutor's dream.\n       B. They could have sued the lenders that sold them the \n     fraudulent liar's loans. The investment banks typically had a \n     clear contractual right to force the fraudulent loans to buy \n     back the liar's loans. But there were fatal problems with \n     that option. The lenders that made liar's loans typically had \n     minimal capital (net worth). If the investment banks had \n     demanded that they repurchase the loans they would have been \n     unable to do so--and the demand would have exposed the \n     investment banks' bright shining lie that by pooling liar's \n     loans they could create ``AAA'' CDOs. Every CDO purchaser \n     from the investment banks would then demand that the \n     investment banks repurchased their CDOs--which would have \n     caused virtually every large U.S. investment bank to fail.\n       C. They could have gone to the Justice Department and \n     expose the massive fraud that was destroying the American \n     economy and help the FBI investigate the lenders specializing \n     in making liar's loans, the corrupt appraisers, and the \n     credit rating agencies. But that would have caused the CDO \n     bubble to burst and the investment banks to fail.\n       That's why the industry went with the fourth option--\n     ``don't ask; don't tell.'' It's like the famous fable of the \n     emperor and the fraudulent designer. The designer tells \n     everyone that he has created clothes for the emperor of such \n     beauty that only the most sophisticated people can even see \n     the clothes. The emperor and his cronies all agree that the \n     clothes are glorious. The fraud only collapses when a boy \n     blurts out: ``the emperor is naked.'' As long as no one \n     engaged in the frauds pointed out that you can't make a \n     ``AAA'' rating out of a pool of massively overvalued \n     fraudulent loans the housing bubble could hyper-inflate and \n     the officers of the investment banks and credit rating \n     agencies could become wealthy beyond their dreams.\n       I cite a study by Fitch, the smallest of the Big 3 rating \n     agencies later that documents the endemic nature of the fraud \n     in the nonprime mortgages backing the CDOs. That study does \n     not contradict the ``don't ask; don't tell'' strategy because \n     Fitch only published it in November 2007--after the secondary \n     market that created CDOs collapsed and it would not lose any \n     fees by asking and telling about the endemic fraud.\n       The industry sharply increased the number of liar's loans \n     after MARI's warnings that they were overwhelmingly \n     fraudulent. Fitch reviewed a small sample of the nonprime \n     loan and found that there was evidence of fraud in ``nearly \n     every'' file they reviewed and that the frauds were obvious \n     on the face of the loan and servicing files and would have \n     been discovered by any competent loan underwriting process. \n     Self-reviews by fraudulent nonprime lenders have consistently \n     revealed pervasive fraud in liar's loans. Reviews by \n     independent experts demonstrate that fraud was endemic in \n     liar's loans.\n       My testimony to the Senate and the Financial Crisis Inquiry \n     Commission (FCIC) explains why the number of criminal \n     referrals the FBI receives annually extrapolates to millions \n     of frauds. There were no formal definitions of an ``alt a'' \n     or ``stated income'' loan (the two most common euphemisms for \n     liar's loans and, therefore, all the data are best guesses), \n     but Credit Suisse reported in 2007 that by 2006, 49% of new \n     mortgage loans in the U.S. were stated income (liar's loans). \n     If one assumes an 80% fraud incidence--which is the low end \n     of published studies by independent experts--that translates \n     into millions of fraudulent loans being made in 2006 alone.\n       State Attorney Generals' investigations have found that it \n     was lenders and their agents who put the lies in ``liar's'' \n     loans. The NY AG found, for example, that Washington Mutual \n     (WaMu), which specialized in nonprime loans, (and is the \n     largest bank failure in U.S. history) kept a ``black list'' \n     of appraisers. Appraisers got on the black list, however, if \n     they refused to provide WaMu with inflated (fraudulent) \n     appraisals. Survey data of appraisers confirms that nonprime \n     lenders and their agents commonly coerced appraisers to \n     inflate market values. The borrower has no leverage to coerce \n     appraisers.\n       There is no honest reason for a lender to seek, or permit, \n     appraisals to be inflated. White-collar criminologists and \n     competent banking regulators recognize that appraisal fraud \n     is a superb ``marker'' of ``control fraud''--the devastating \n     frauds in which the senior officers that control a seemingly \n     legitimate firm use it as a ``weapon'' to defraud. Iowa \n     Attorney General Miller testified before the Federal Reserve \n     in 2007 that his investigations found that the lenders and \n     the agents typically prompted or even directly provided the \n     false information in nonprime loan applications.\n       This makes sense because only lenders and loan brokers \n     would know the key debt-to-income and loan-to-value ratios \n     that would make the borrowers' application more likely to be \n     approved and generate the largest fees to the lenders and \n     their agents. AG Miller even aptly described the \n     ``Gresham's'' dynamic that prevailed in nonprime lending. A \n     Gesham's dynamic arises in this context when lenders and loan \n     brokers that cheat gain a competitive advantage over honest \n     lenders and agents. The result can be a race to the bottom in \n     which those with no ethics drive the ethical from the \n     marketplace.\n       Attorneys General in 50 states are investigating mortgage \n     fraud and foreclosure fraud. Do you think this was bad \n     bookkeeping or are banks intentionally doing something \n     illegal?\n       I've explained why the data demonstrate that mortgage \n     fraud, particularly via liar's loans, was endemic, \n     intentional, and driven by the lenders and their agents. \n     Lenders and agents engaged in mortgage fraud do not want to \n     keep accurate records, for those records could provide a \n     roadmap for prosecuting them. The dearth of records was one \n     of the key attractions of liar's loans to these lenders and \n     their agents. That dynamic means that records are commonly \n     missing at lenders engaged in fraud.\n       Keeping good records is also a pain for loan officers. It \n     is a cost--it slows them down from making new (fraudulent) \n     loans that drive their income. Another marker of loan fraud \n     is paying loan officers large bonuses based on loan volume \n     instead of loan quality--everyone in the trade knows this \n     ends in disaster. But the failure of the lender is not a \n     failure of the fraud scheme. Here's the four-part recipe for \n     lenders maximizing fictional short-term accounting income \n     (thereby maximizing their bonuses). Note that the same recipe \n     maximizes real losses:\n       A. Grow extremely rapidly\n       B. Make very bad loans at high interest rates (``yield'')\n       C. Use extreme leverage (high debt relative to you equity)\n       D. Provide grossly inadequate loss reserves\n       A lender that follows this recipe is mathematically \n     guaranteed to report record (albeit fictional) income in the \n     near term--and to cause massive losses in the longer term. \n     This is why the Nobel prize winning economist, George Akerlof \n     and his colleague Paul Romer wrote the famous 1993 article \n     entitled: ``Looting: the Economic Underworld of Bankruptcy \n     for Profit.'' They describe accounting fraud as ``a sure \n     thing.'' The lender fails, but the senior officers walk away \n     wealthy. Since 1993, things have become far worse--we now \n     often bail out the failed lenders and leave the thieves in \n     charge.\n       But a lender making thousands of bad loans has to gut its \n     ``back office'' operations--the folks who are supposed to \n     document loans and prevent bad loans. We know that this is \n     exactly what happened. Bank officers and employees of \n     nonprime lenders\n[[Page E2254]]\n\n     were reamed out by their superiors if they tried to block the \n     bad loans. This dynamic is an independent reason why \n     recordkeeping at the nonprime lenders is often horrific.\n       Finally, lenders like Bank of America, Citibank, and WaMu \n     acquired major nonprime lenders that were notorious for their \n     predatory and fraudulent lending. These banks then often \n     place the employees they obtained via these mergers in charge \n     of loan servicing. It was utterly predictable that they would \n     continue their unethical practices when they functioned as \n     loan servicers--particularly because the alternative would be \n     to admit that their loan servicing files were a shambles. Far \n     better to simply file false affidavits and claim that \n     everything was in order--which is exactly what many of the \n     largest loan servicers did ten thousand times a month.\n       This is one of the reasons that my colleague Randy Wray and \n     I have called for Bank of America to be placed promptly into \n     receivership. A minor blue collar thief can go to prison for \n     life under some ``three strikes'' laws--a huge bank doesn't \n     even suffer a major loss of reputation when it commits a \n     hundred thousand felonies. The U.S. now has its own version \n     of crony capitalism that has produced recurrent, intensifying \n     financial crises--just as crony capitalism does in many \n     nations. The difference is that our economy is so massive \n     that when we have a crisis many nations suffer. When a \n     nation's elites are able to cheat with impunity the result is \n     always disastrous.\n       What should President Obama and Congress be doing right now \n     to regulate the banks in a meaningful and fair way?\n       Economists, white-collar criminologists, and regulators \n     agree that the key is to stop, or at least limit, perverse \n     incentives. Intensely criminogenic environments lead to \n     epidemics of control fraud. There are six key components of \n     what makes an environment dangerously criminogenic.\n       A. Size matters. A tremendous bubble in the price of \n     persimmons won't harm the U.S. economy. Real estate bubbles, \n     by contrast, could cause losses that were a large percentage \n     of the U.S. GDP. That's how you get a Great Recession. \n     Accounting control frauds are particularly dangerous because \n     of they can grow so rapidly and because they tend to cluster \n     in the assets that are most ideal for accounting fraud. The \n     combination of clustering and rapid growth means that \n     epidemics of accounting control fraud can hyper-inflate \n     massive bubbles. Akerlof & Romer and my work have long warned \n     specifically about this danger.\n       The federal regulatory and prosecutorial agencies are \n     filled with ``chief economists,'' but there are no ``chief \n     criminologists'', no comprehensive federal data on the most \n     destructive white-collar crimes, and virtually zero federal \n     funding for research into the elite financial frauds that \n     have caused trillions of dollars of losses in the U.S. over \n     the last 20 years. We need to do the opposite--hire chief \n     criminologists, keep comprehensive data on the worst frauds, \n     and fund research so that we can actively identify the \n     industries at greatest risk of developing the next epidemic \n     of control fraud. (And this needs to be done not only for \n     banks. The FDA, for example, needs help in spotting frauds \n     that maim and kill.) We then need to act, quickly, to stop \n     those epidemics in their tracks. We did this in 1990-91 as \n     S&L regulators when we stopped the rapid spread of ``liar's'' \n     loans at several California S&Ls.\n       B. Deregulation, desupervision (the rules remain in place \n     but the anti-regulators running the regulatory agencies don't \n     enforce them) and de facto decriminalization (the three \n     ``de's'') produce the ideal criminogenic environment. The \n     regulators are the ``cops on the beat'' when it comes to \n     sophisticated frauds. If you remove the cops of the beat, \n     cheaters prosper and honest businesses are driven from the \n     markets. President Obama largely kept in place the failed \n     anti-regulators he inherited from President Bush. Indeed, \n     Obama promoted Geithner--an abject failure as a regulator in \n     his capacity as President of the NY Fed--and renominated \n     Bernanke, an even greater failure. Obama should fire Attorney \n     General Holder and Treasury Secretary Geithner and ask \n     Chairman Bernanke to resign. He should appoint regulators and \n     prosecutors who have a track record of success.\n       C. Executive compensation. There is a consensus that \n     executive compensation should be based on long-term (real) \n     profitability. In reality, executive compensation is \n     overwhelmingly based on short-term reported income. (It's \n     actually worse than that--if the short-term results are bad \n     corporations commonly gimmick the compensation system to \n     reward the senior officers' failures.) Everyone agrees that \n     short-term reported accounting income is easy to inflate \n     through accounting fraud and virtually everyone agrees that \n     this creates strong, perverse incentives. Since, the current \n     crisis began, the percentage of bonus compensation based on \n     short-term reported income has increased--executive \n     compensation has become more perverse.\n       Note that executive compensation also allows the CEO to \n     convert the firm's assets to his personal benefit using \n     seemingly normal corporate mechanisms, which makes it far \n     harder to prosecute the CEO for looting the firm. All bonus \n     income that takes annual income above $200,000 should be paid \n     after five years--if the firm's reported income turns out to \n     be real. There should be ``clawback'' provisions to recover \n     bonuses even after those five years if they were based on \n     corporate income inflated by fraud or ``window dressing.''\n       D. Professional compensation is perverse. Accounting \n     control frauds deliberately exploit this to create the \n     Gresham's dynamic that allow them to suborn the outside \n     professionals--appraisers, attorneys, auditors, and rating \n     agencies--who are supposed to prevent fraud, but who actually \n     become the frauds' most valuable allies. Honest professionals \n     don't get hired, the unethical professionals prosper. This \n     process creates ``echo'' epidemics of control fraud. \n     Fraudulent nonprime lenders, for example, shaped financial \n     incentives to be perverse to create endemic appraisal and \n     loan broker fraud. The banks should not be able to hire or \n     fire the appraisers, credit rating agencies, and auditors--\n     except for fraud or serious incompetence. Those professionals \n     can only be truly independent if they are assigned to work \n     for the bank by a truly independent entity.\n       E. The federal government has permitted banks to inflate \n     their reported incomes and ``net worth'' for the purpose of \n     evading the mandatory statutory duty under the Prompt \n     Corrective Action (PCA) law to close deeply insolvent banks. \n     Congress, at the behest of the Chamber of Commerce, the \n     banking trade associations, and Chairman Bernanke, \n     successfully extorted the Financial Accounting Standards \n     Board (FASB) to scam the accounting rules so that the banks \n     could fail to recognize on their accounting reports over a \n     trillion dollars in losses.\n       When banks understate their losses massively they, by \n     definition, overstate their net worth massively. The PCA's \n     provisions kick in when net worth falls, so the accounting \n     lies have gutted the PCA. The accounting lies also allow the \n     banks to (once again) report high fictional income when they \n     are experiencing large, real losses. This accounting scam \n     allows the bank executives to collect hundreds of billions of \n     dollars in bonuses. We should end the accounting scam and \n     enforce the PCA.\n       We are also secretly subsidizing banks and hiding their \n     losses through massive loans from the Federal Reserve backed \n     by toxic collateral. We should end those subsidies and force \n     them to post good collateral.\n       F. Systemically dangerous institutions (SDIs) have often \n     become far larger and more dangerous since the crisis. The \n     administration is taking no serious steps to protect us \n     against the roughly 20 SDIs even though the administration \n     claims that when one of them next fails it is likely to cause \n     a global financial crisis. Why are we juggling 20 live \n     grenades? The only question is when the next pin will drop \n     out and we'll be blown up.\n       The good news about the SDIs is that they have reason to \n     exist. They would be far more efficient if they shrank in \n     size to levels at which they no longer endangered the global \n     economy. We should do three things about the SDIs. One, stop \n     their growth--immediately. Two, order them to shrink over the \n     next five years to a size at which they no longer are SDIs. \n     Let them decide what operations to sell. Three, intensively \n     regulate the SDIs during those five years. That includes \n     placing any insolvent SDIs in ``pass through \n     receiverships''--which does not prompt crises.\n       If there were one questionable banking practice that you \n     could stop today, what would that be?\n       The foreclosure frauds.\n       You have spent decades examining what goes on in banks. Do \n     think that bankers, either through culture or genetics, are \n     ethically-challenged?\n       When you allow a Gresham's dynamic to operate and when \n     entry to an industry is easy (as it was for loan brokers and \n     mortgage bankers), you concentrate the least ethical business \n     leaders in the industry that is most criminogenic. In the \n     last decade, banking has been severely criminogenic in the \n     U.S. and much of the world. The unethical banking leaders \n     became dominant. Their banks, which followed the four-part \n     recipe for maximizing fictional accounting income, became far \n     larger and drew the greatest praise from the business \n     boosters than dominated the financial media. They made their \n     reputations and their fortunes through fraud.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Marcy Kaptur"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "156 Cong.

Madam Speaker, I wold like to submit the \nfollowing: As the Representative for New York's 19th Congressional \nDistrict, I had numerous significant accomplishments in all aspects of \nmeeting local community needs, individual constituent services, and \nenacting federal legislation on behalf of my constituents.\n  I kept my annual promise of holding at least one public event in \nevery town and city in the district to give my constituents an \nopportunity to speak directly with me about their opinions and \nconcerns. I hosted Town Hall Meetings, Congress on Your Corners, \nbusiness roundtables, issues forums and workshops throughout all 4 \nyears of my Congressional service. In addition to these events, I \nattended numerous community events hosted by local organizations, \nsenior centers, fire departments, schools, etc. I also did a series of \n``work-a-day'' events where I worked alongside a constituent in a local \njob so I could better understand the day to day challenges they face. \nSome of these events included working with a nurse at an area hospital, \nan assembly line worker at a manufacturing plant, a ride along with a \ndelivery truck driver, weatherization installation at a home, \ninstallation of a geothermal heat/cooling system at a new senior \nhousing development, and installation of solar energy panels on the \nroof of an elementary school.\n  The Congressional offices in Carmel, Goshen, and Washington responded \nto thousands of constituent opinions and information requests. Hundreds \nof casework problems were resolved for individuals and families who had \nproblems with federal agencies when applying for Veterans benefits, \nSocial Security and Medicare payments, and expediting passport \napplications.\n  The Congressional office provided hundreds of Capitol tours for \nschool classes and families visiting Washington DC, fulfilled flag \nrequests, nominated students to our nation's military service \nacademies, and assisted with federal grant applications.\n  I cosponsored and voted for important legislation to create and save \njobs, cut taxes on middle class families, improve the process for \nVeterans applying for well deserved benefits, reform financial services \nregulation, and health insurance reform designed to improve \naccessibility and affordability. I authored legislation that \ndramatically improved the Veterans benefits system, streamlining the \nprocess for veterans to receive the care and compensation they earned \nin service to our nation. My legislation is widely regarded as the most \nsweeping reform of the VA in a generation.\n  I was proud to bring millions of federal dollars home for local \nprojects that create and save jobs, improve water quality, improve \ntraffic safety and public transportation, build local infrastructure, \nand save local property tax dollars.\n  I voted against my own pay raise each time it came before the House, \nand donated my raise to local non-profit organizations rather than \naccepting it.\n\n                     Meeting Local Community Needs\n\n\n    Economic Development: Local Jobs and Small Business Development\n\n  I worked actively to bring new jobs to the area and save local jobs \nthat were at risk of leaving including:\n  Kolmar--Successfully assisted in keeping the largest manufacturing \ncompany in Western Orange County from leaving the state, thereby \nretaining hundreds of local jobs in an economically depressed area.\n  Pepsi Bottling--Successfully assisted with efforts to keep the \ncompany's facilities in Northern Westchester when they were considering \na move out of state.\n  SpectraWatt--Instrumental in negotiations to bring a new solar energy \nmanufacturing company to Dutchess County, replacing almost a hundred \njobs that had been outsourced overseas. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis \nvisited the site to discuss the local benefits with business and labor \nleaders.

Madam Speaker, I wold like to submit the following: As the Representative for New York's 19th Congressional District, I had numerous significant accomplishments in all aspects of meeting local community needs, individual constituent services, and enacting federal legislation on behalf of my constituents.\n\tI kept my annual promise of holding at least one public event in every town and city in the district to give my constituents an opportunity to speak directly with me about their opinions and concerns. I hosted Town Hall Meetings, Congress on Your Corners, business roundtables, issues forums and workshops throughout all 4 years of my Congressional service. In addition to these events, I attended numerous community events hosted by local organizations, senior centers, fire departments, schools, etc. I also did a series of ``work-a-day'' events where I worked alongside a constituent in a local job so I could better understand the day to day challenges they face. Some of these events included working with a nurse at an area hospital, an assembly line worker at a manufacturing plant, a ride along with a delivery truck driver, weatherization installation at a home, installation of a geothermal heat/cooling system at a new senior housing development, and installation of solar energy panels on the roof of an elementary school.\n\tThe Congressional offices in Carmel, Goshen, and Washington responded to thousands of constituent opinions and information requests. Hundreds of casework problems were resolved for individuals and families who had problems with federal agencies when applying for Veterans benefits, Social Security and Medicare payments, and expediting passport applications.\n\tThe Congressional office provided hundreds of Capitol tours for school classes and families visiting Washington DC, fulfilled flag requests, nominated students to our nation's military service academies, and assisted with federal grant applications.\n\tI cosponsored and voted for important legislation to create and save jobs, cut taxes on middle class families, improve the process for Veterans applying for well deserved benefits, reform financial services regulation, and health insurance reform designed to improve accessibility and affordability. I authored legislation that dramatically improved the Veterans benefits system, streamlining the process for veterans to receive the care and compensation they earned in service to our nation. My legislation is widely regarded as the most sweeping reform of the VA in a generation.\n\tI was proud to bring millions of federal dollars home for local projects that create and save jobs, improve water quality, improve traffic safety and public transportation, build local infrastructure, and save local property tax dollars.\n\tI voted against my own pay raise each time it came before the House, and donated my raise to local non-profit organizations rather than accepting it.\n\n                     Meeting Local Community Needs\n\n\n    Economic Development: Local Jobs and Small Business Development\n\n\tI worked actively to bring new jobs to the area and save local jobs that were at risk of leaving including:\n\tKolmar--Successfully assisted in keeping the largest manufacturing company in Western Orange County from leaving the state, thereby retaining hundreds of local jobs in an economically depressed area.\n\tPepsi Bottling--Successfully assisted with efforts to keep the company's facilities in Northern Westchester when they were considering a move out of state.\n\tSpectraWatt--Instrumental in negotiations to bring a new solar energy manufacturing company to Dutchess County, replacing almost a hundred jobs that had been outsourced overseas. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis visited the site to discuss the local benefits with business and labor leaders. Although recent reports indicate the company is struggling, discussions are still ongoing to keep the jobs in Dutchess County.\n\tI successfully advocated for Stewart Air National Guard Base to receive 8 new C-17 aircraft and all of the support services and local economic development opportunities that go with it.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the \nSpeaker's table the bill (H.R. 6523) to authorize appropriations for \nfiscal year 2011 for military activities of the Department of Defense, \nfor military construction, and for defense activities of the Department \nof Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal \nyear, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendments thereto, and \nconcur in the Senate amendments.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the Senate amendments is as follows:\n\n       Senate amendments:\n       Strike title XVII and corresponding table of contents on \n     page 18.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Madam Speaker, reserving the right to object, I take \nthis moment to express great disappointment at the situation the House \nnow finds itself. It is very unfortunate that before us is an amended \nversion of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2011.\n  Last night, the other body struck title XVII of the version of the \nbill that this House passed last Friday, December 17. Title XVII, Madam \nSpeaker, was the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, which the \nHouse has passed on multiple occasions with strong bipartisan support. \nSeveral Senators objected to its inclusion in the bill. They expressed \nconcerns over its budgetary impact, and indicated a willingness to work \ntoward identifying an acceptable way to authorize and pay the claims.\n  I regret the inability to resolve this matter at this time, and I am \nvery appreciative of the strong support from Chairman Skelton and \nincoming chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Mr. McKeon of \nCalifornia for their strong support of this provision. The unresolved \nnature of Guam war claims has serious implications for the military \nbuild-up on Guam. I appreciate the administration's strong support for \nthis provision. The administration recognizes the connection between \nresolving this issue and successfully implementing the military build-\nup on Guam.\n  We will continue our work to bring closure to this matter of justice \nfor the people of Guam, and to act on the legislative recommendations \nof the Federal Guam War Claims Review Commission that reported to \nCongress pursuant to Public Law 107-333. It was not for a lack of \neffort from this body, and we will continue to build on the progress \nwe've made. The underlying bill is important for our national defense \nand for our men and women in uniform and their families, and therefore \nthis body is left no other choice but than to concur with the Senate \namendments at this time.\n  Again, I want to thank everyone who has assisted me, both the leaders \nand to the multiple staff members who have helped us through this \nprocess.\n  Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I'll keep my remarks brief as this is the \nthird time that the House will debate and vote on the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. They say that the third time is \nthe charm. Let it be so this morning.\n  I return to the floor with this bill because the Senate found it \nnecessary to delete a portion of the House-passed bill in order to \nachieve the consensus needed to move the bill to final passage. The \nSenate amendment removes from the House bill Title 17, which dealt with \nGuam War Claims. I am deeply disappointed in the Senate's decision to \nremove this important legislation, which I strongly support and which \nhas been so ably advocated by the delegate from Guam. However, here we \nare and we are out of time to engage with a back and forth with the \nSenate. We must move this bill to the President's desk or watch it die. \nThat is why I ask for unanimous consent for the House to concur to the \nSenate amendment to H.R. 6523.\n  Let me briefly repeat what I said the other day. This bill is must \npass legislation with many provisions that cannot become law any other \nway. This bill stops an increase in health care fees from hitting the \nfamilies of military personnel; authorizes military families to extend \nTRICARE coverage to their dependent children under age 26; and adopts \ncomprehensive legislation fighting sexual assault in the military. It \ncreates a counter-IED database and enhances the effort to develop new, \nlightweight body armor. It gives DOD new\n\n[[Page H8945]]\n\ntools and authorities to reduce its energy demand while improving \nmilitary readiness. It bolsters our defense against cyber attacks. It \nrequires independent assessments of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration modernization plan and of the annual budget request for \nsustaining a strong deterrent. It aligns the Navy's long term \nshipbuilding plan with the QDR. And, it includes significant \nacquisition reform, the Improve Acquisition Act of 2010, which could \nsave as much as $135 billion over the next 5 years. That is just a \nsampling of the good work done in this bill.\n  I ask the House to support the men and women of the armed forces by \npassing this bill by unanimous consent, and ensure that the National \nDefense Authorization Act finally becomes law.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, H.R. 6523 is a strong bill \nthat is intended to provide essential funding for our nation's troops, \nincluding providing our brave men and women in uniform the tools they \nneed to succeed in our nation's missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my \nconcerns about the Senate Amendment to H.R. 6523, the Ike Skelton \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. The Senate \namendment struck Title XVII of the underlying bill, once again, denying \nthe people of Guam the promise of closure and justice on the matter of \nGuam War Claims.\n  The text of Title XVII was a compromise that eliminated payments to \ndescendents of survivors of the brutal occupation that were subjected \nto personal injury. I support that compromise; in fact, I am an \noriginal co-sponsor of H.R. 44, the Guam World War II Loyalty \nRecognition Act. It is important that we bring closure to this long \nstanding injustice for the people of Guam. It is even more important \ngiven that the realignment of Marines from Okinawa to Guam will begin \nin earnest over the coming year.\n  I have travelled to Guam on a number of occasions and have been so \nimpressed by the patriotism of the people led by Governor Felix Camacho \nand First Lady Joann Camacho, and I recognize the importance of this \nlegislation to the Chamorro people. I look forward to working with \nCongresswoman Madeleine Bordallo and Incoming Chairman Congressman Buck \nMcKeon, incoming Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to \naddress this matter in next year's defense authorization bill. It is \ntime to finally bring closure to this long standing matter for the \npeople of Guam which is so strategic for our nation's defense and where \nAmerica's day begins. I appreciate the tireless efforts of \nCongresswoman Madeleine Bordallo's service for the people of Guam.\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "IKE SKELTON NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011\n\n\tMr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 6523) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2011 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendments thereto, and concur in the Senate amendments.\n\tThe Clerk read the title of the bill.\n\tThe text of the Senate amendments is as follows:\n\n       Senate amendments:\n       Strike title XVII and corresponding table of contents on \n     page 18.\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Missouri?\n\tMs. BORDALLO. Madam Speaker, reserving the right to object, I take this moment to express great disappointment at the situation the House now finds itself. It is very unfortunate that before us is an amended version of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011.\n\tLast night, the other body struck title XVII of the version of the bill that this House passed last Friday, December 17. Title XVII, Madam Speaker, was the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, which the House has passed on multiple occasions with strong bipartisan support. Several Senators objected to its inclusion in the bill. They expressed concerns over its budgetary impact, and indicated a willingness to work toward identifying an acceptable way to authorize and pay the claims.\n\tI regret the inability to resolve this matter at this time, and I am very appreciative of the strong support from Chairman Skelton and incoming chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Mr. McKeon of California for their strong support of this provision. The unresolved nature of Guam war claims has serious implications for the military build-up on Guam. I appreciate the administration's strong support for this provision. The administration recognizes the connection between resolving this issue and successfully implementing the military build-up on Guam.\n\tWe will continue our work to bring closure to this matter of justice for the people of Guam, and to act on the legislative recommendations of the Federal Guam War Claims Review Commission that reported to Congress pursuant to Public Law 107-333. It was not for a lack of effort from this body, and we will continue to build on the progress we've made. The underlying bill is important for our national defense and for our men and women in uniform and their families, and therefore this body is left no other choice but than to concur with the Senate amendments at this time.\n\tAgain, I want to thank everyone who has assisted me, both the leaders and to the multiple staff members who have helped us through this process.\n\tMr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I'll keep my remarks brief as this is the third time that the House will debate and vote on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. They say that the third time is the charm. Let it be so this morning.\n\tI return to the floor with this bill because the Senate found it necessary to delete a portion of the House-passed bill in order to achieve the consensus needed to move the bill to final passage. The Senate amendment removes from the House bill Title 17, which dealt with Guam War Claims. I am deeply disappointed in the Senate's decision to remove this important legislation, which I strongly support and which has been so ably advocated by the delegate from Guam. However, here we are and we are out of time to engage with a back and forth with the Senate. We must move this bill to the President's desk or watch it die. That is why I ask for unanimous consent for the House to concur to the Senate amendment to H.R. 6523.\n\tLet me briefly repeat what I said the other day. This bill is must pass legislation with many provisions that cannot become law any other way. This bill stops an increase in health care fees from hitting the families of military personnel; authorizes military families to extend TRICARE coverage to their dependent children under age 26; and adopts comprehensive legislation fighting sexual assault in the military. It creates a counter-IED database and enhances the effort to develop new, lightweight body armor. It gives DOD new tools and authorities to reduce its energy demand while improving military readiness. It bolsters our defense against cyber attacks. It requires independent assessments of the National Nuclear Security Administration modernization plan and of the annual budget request for sustaining a strong deterrent. It aligns the Navy's long term shipbuilding plan with the QDR. And, it includes significant acquisition reform, the Improve Acquisition Act of 2010, which could save as much as $135 billion over the next 5 years. That is just a sampling of the good work done in this bill.\n\tI ask the House to support the men and women of the armed forces by passing this bill by unanimous consent, and ensure that the National Defense Authorization Act finally becomes law.\n\tMr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, H.R. 6523 is a strong bill that is intended to provide essential funding for our nation's troops, including providing our brave men and women in uniform the tools they need to succeed in our nation's missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\tMr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my concerns about the Senate Amendment to H.R. 6523, the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. The Senate amendment struck Title XVII of the underlying bill, once again, denying the people of Guam the promise of closure and justice on the matter of Guam War Claims.\n\tThe text of Title XVII was a compromise that eliminated payments to descendents of survivors of the brutal occupation that were subjected to personal injury. I support that compromise; in fact, I am an original co-sponsor of H.R. 44, the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act. It is important that we bring closure to this long standing injustice for the people of Guam. It is even more important given that the realignment of Marines from Okinawa to Guam will begin in earnest over the coming year.\n\tI have travelled to Guam on a number of occasions and have been so impressed by the patriotism of the people led by Governor Felix Camacho and First Lady Joann Camacho, and I recognize the importance of this legislation to the Chamorro people. I look forward to working with Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo and Incoming Chairman Congressman Buck McKeon, incoming Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to address this matter in next year's defense authorization bill.

Madam Speaker, I yield to myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 847, the \nJames Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2019. Today, this \nbody, for the third time, will vote on legislation to finally keep our \npromise and take care of the heroes of 9/11.\n  I would like to thank the bill's sponsors, Representatives Carolyn \nMaloney and Jerry Nadler, as well as my colleagues from New York on the \ncommittee, Eliot Engel and Anthony Weiner, also, for their tireless \nwork on behalf of this legislation.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill would establish the World Trade Center \nHealth Program, a program to screen, monitor and treat eligible \nresponders and survivors who are suffering from World Trade Center \nrelated diseases. It also reopens the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.\n  H.R. 847, as amended, costs $4.2 billion over 10 years. Of that \namount, $1.5 billion will go to the health program, while $2.7 billion \nwill go the VCF. Both programs are now limited to 5 years.\n  The amended bill before us today also changes how the two programs \nare paid for by a 2 percent fee on government procurement from foreign \ncompanies located in nongovernmental procurement, and a 1-year \nextension of H1-B and L-1 visa fees for outsourcing companies.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill has long been a huge priority for me and \nmany of my colleagues in the House and the Senate. I urge my colleagues \nto pass the bill.\n\n[[Page H8959]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's efforts in this regard. I \nwould like to take a few moments and clear up some of the \nmischaracterizations that have occurred, unfortunately, around the \ndebate of this bill as it has worked its way through both Houses.\n  There have been some who have claimed that my side, the Republicans, \ndo not support providing treatment for 9/11 first responders, and that \nthese first responders are currently going without treatment for the \nillnesses and injuries they suffered as a result of serving at the \nWorld Trade Center. Both of those claims are simply not true.\n  According to President Obama's administration's own Centers for \nDisease Control, the agency said, ``We will continue to provide \nmonitoring and treatment services for mental and physical health \nconditions related to World Trade Center exposures for both responders \nand for eligible non-responders. The World Trade Center program is \ncritical in meeting the ongoing and long-term specialty needs of \nindividuals that were exposed to dust, smoke, debris, and psychological \ntrauma from the World Trade Center attacks.''\n  As of September 30, 2009, the World Trade Center program had enrolled \nover 55,000 responders in its monitoring and treatment programs. This \nis in the CDC's budget justification for 2011.\n  At the Energy and Commerce Committee's markup of this legislation, \nRepublicans offered an amendment that would authorize the program that \nis already providing treatment and monitoring benefits and authorized \nfunding for the program at exactly the level that was requested by the \nPresident of the United States. That same amendment asked for real \naccountability to ensure that we knew how the tax dollars were being \nspent. Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated.\n  I am pleased that work in the Senate has yielded an amendment that \nwill provide for increased accountability and increased transparency in \nhow these funds are spent. H.R. 847 caps the number of people that can \nbe enrolled in the program but it does not require those enrolled to \nverify their citizenship.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  We offered an amendment that would require this program so that \npeople in the country without benefit of Social Security numbers would \nnot get benefits while Americans were being stuck on the waiting list. \nThis amendment was defeated.\n  As with any government spending program, there should be limitations \non who can participate. The government has limited resources, so the \nprincipal beneficiaries of the 9/11 health program should be the first \nresponders. However, H.R. 847 provides more than just benefits to first \nresponders; it also provides benefits to anyone who lives and works in \nNew York City. Under this bill, even Wall Street millionaires could \nreceive benefits with no cost to them, all done at the taxpayers' \nexpense.\n  In fact, in the Committee on Energy and Commerce I offered an \namendment that was rejected by the committee. I attempted to offer the \namendment at Rules when this legislation was brought before the House \nbefore our adjournment in September, but I was thwarted in that. But it \nremains that we ought to ensure that Federal taxpayers would not have \nto pay for the health care of millionaires.\n  The bill passed by the Senate is an improvement over what passed in \nthe House. There could have been further improvements to ensure our \nlimited resources are being spent in the most efficient manner \npossible. But all in all, the improvements that have been accomplished \nover the last 24 hours are all to the good. This is an important piece \nof legislation. This is something that this Congress or some Congress \nshould have passed in the last 8 years. And it is unconscionable that \nwe are here today at the last hour of the 111th Congress with still \nthis work pending. It's important to get this work done.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the chairman of the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nWaxman).\n  Mr. WAXMAN. I rise in strong support, Madam Speaker, of H.R. 847, the \nJames Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. I want to thank \nthe chairman of the Health Subcommittee, Frank Pallone, as well as my \ncolleagues from New York on the committee, Eliot Engel and Anthony \nWeiner, for their relentless work on behalf of this legislation, as \nwell as Representatives Maloney and Nadler, and the whole New York City \ndelegation, who were tireless in their support of this bill.\n  This is an important piece of legislation that will attempt to \nprovide the services to first responders and community residents who \ndeveloped illness as a result of their exposure to the massive toxic \ndust cloud that blanketed Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attack on \nSeptember 11, 2001. I strongly urge all Members to support this \nlegislation.\n  H.R. 847, was reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee with \nbipartisan support on May 25 by a vote of 33-12.\n  The House passed H.R. 847 on September 29; the bill received \nbipartisan support from 268 Members.\n  The version of before us this afternoon is one that has been amended \nby the Senate in order to obtain bipartisan support in that Chamber.\n  Like the House-passed version, the Senate version is fully paid for \nand will not increase the deficit. It fully complies with all pay-go \nrules.\n  The World Trade Center Health Program currently provides services to \nfirst responders and community residents who developed illnesses as a \nresult of their exposure to the massive toxic dust cloud that blanketed \nlower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.\n  The current program is not authorized. The House-passed bill \nauthorized the Health Program through FY 2019 at a federal funding \nlevel of $3.2 billion. The federal government will pay 90 percent of \nthe cost, while New York City will pay 10 percent.\n  The Senate amendment reduces the authorization period to FY 2015 and \nfederal funding to $1.5 billion. New York City would still be required \nto pay 10 percent of the costs.\n  The Senate amendment makes a number of other changes in the Health \nProgram.\n  It prohibits the Secretary of HHS from using NIOSH to administer \npayments to Centers of Excellence and other participating providers.\n  It clarifies that Centers of Excellence delivering services to \nresponders and community residents will have to provide claims-level \ndata to the Health Program Administrator.\n  It clarifies the Centers of Excellence should be paid for the costs \nof carrying out the program that are not otherwise reimbursable, such \nas outreach, data collection, social services, and development of \ntreatment protocols.\n  It authorizes the Program Administrator to contract with the VA to \nprovide services to responders enrolled in the national program through \nits facilities, but only if the VA chooses to do so.\n  Finally, the Senate amendment directs the GAO to conduct studies on \nvarious aspects of the Health Program and to report to the Committees \nof jurisdiction prior to July 1, 2011. That is the date on which \nSecretary of HHS and the WTC Administrator are responsible for \nimplementing the Health Program. In the likely event that the GAO is \nunable to complete all of its work by that date, the Program will \nnonetheless begin furnishing services to responders and survivors.\n  The Administration supports this bill for the same reason that all of \nus should: it is the right thing to do.\n  The first responders were there for us on 9-11. We should be there \nfor them today.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and send it on to the \nPresident for signature.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).\n  Mr. COLE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, long before New York City's first responders rushed to \nsave their fellow Americans in the fire and the horror of 9/11, they \ncame to help the people of Oklahoma City deal with the death and \ndestruction stemming from the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah \nFederal Building on April 19, 1995. The people of Oklahoma have never \nforgotten the help that they received in their most difficult days from \nthe first responders of New York City and their fellow first responders \nfrom all across North America.\n  When 9/11 occurred, Oklahoma's first responders were proud to join \ntheir fellow Americans and rush to the aid of a stricken New York City. \nNow it's our turn in this body to help all of those\n\n[[Page H8960]]\n\nwho answered the call of duty on 9/11. They risked themselves to save \nothers and to help one of America's great cities deal with and recover \nfrom the devastation of the greatest terrorist attack in our history. \nIt's time, as our greatest President said in an earlier era and in \nanother context, ``to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who \nshall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and for his orphan.''\n  Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 847, as amended.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to one of the sponsors \nof the bill who has worked tirelessly on this, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Nadler).\n  Mr. NADLER of New York. Madam Speaker, let me first thank everyone \nwho has worked on this bill and say the Senate passed this bill a \nlittle while ago unanimously. The most conservative Senators, Senators \nEnzi and Coburn, supported it, and I hope we can do the same.\n  Nine years ago, Madam Speaker, the heroes of 9/11 ran into the \nbuildings, they rushed into the burning buildings, and they worked in a \ntoxic environment for weeks and months. They have suffered for that. \nThey have suffered for their service to this country by getting sick, \nby dying, by being sick. It is now up to us to see that the United \nStates honors its heroes, that the United States does not turn its back \non those who served us.\n  When we pass this bill, we will answer the question of whether the \nUnited States honors its heroes, and whether the United States honors \nitself. Let us pass this bill, let us redeem the honor of the United \nStates after all these years, let us show the world that the United \nStates looks after its own. That's what this bill is. I urge everyone \nto support it.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Brady), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I too support the goal of ensuring \nthat the brave men and women that acted as first responders at the \nWorld Trade Center attack are fairly treated and compensated. But I \nrise today to oppose the troubling provisions the majority has attached \nto pay for this bill.\n  This measure would impose a 2 percent tax on goods and services that \nare produced or provided in certain foreign countries from firms that \nare based in foreign countries that are not parties to certain treaties \nor international agreements. It sounds complicated. But some analysis \nsuggests that a significant majority of this tax, at least two-thirds, \nif not more, would be raised by taxing contracts that support American \ntroops stationed in the Afghan and Iraqi theaters. Even more \nincredible, this tax could apply to American companies that are \nproviding goods and services to our troops through local subsidiaries. \nLevying additional taxes on companies that support American troops is \nboth illogical and dangerous.\n  In addition, there is no reason that other countries wouldn't copy \nthis tax and impose it on our U.S. companies that are competing to sell \ngoods and services overseas. This would hurt our U.S. economic recovery \nefforts and efforts to boost U.S. sales abroad and create American jobs \nhere at home. Moreover, I have real concerns that this excise tax could \nbe subject to legal challenge at the World Trade Organization and may \nbe inconsistent with our G-20 commitments to avoid imposing new \nprotectionist measures.\n  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote because of these provisions. \nStrangely, the proposed procurement tax doesn't include any of the \nexceptions included in our standard Buy America legislation, such as \nnon-availability, unreasonable cost and inconsistency with the public \ninterest. As a result, the bill would mandate a tax on the procurement \nof goods from a foreign producer even when U.S. goods aren't available.\n  In addition to this new tax, the bill would extend a tax on companies \nthat have more than half their employees on certain specialized visas \nto work here in the United States. This tax raises independent concerns \nunder our international obligations.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Finally, I would like to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from 10 key business associations, including the \nEmergency Committee for American Trade and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, that also oppose the use of these pay-for provisions.\n\n                                                December 21, 2010.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Republican Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leaders Reid, Boehner, and \n     McConnell: We are writing to urge you to remove from the \n     proposed amended version of H.R. 847 the Title III revenue \n     raisers related to international government procurement. \n     First, its purported revenue raising benefits are highly \n     questionable. Second, there is a high risk that it will \n     undermine the international competitiveness of American \n     companies and American workers.\n       Title III would impose an excise tax on companies that are \n     from foreign countries which are not members of the World \n     Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement \n     (GPA) or similar procurement arrangements ostensibly for the \n     purpose of helping finance health benefits for the valiant 9/\n     11 first responders. In reality, the U.S. federal government \n     is already prohibited from procuring from such countries, \n     except under very limited conditions--when the good or \n     service is not available in the United States or would cost \n     an unreasonable amount or if the procurement is required for \n     the national interest. Moreover, the amount of such \n     procurement is generally regarded as relatively small \n     compared to U.S. sales into the procurement markets of these \n     countries.\n       The procurement portions of this legislation would \n     undermine U.S. efforts to succeed in the international \n     economy by both inviting non-GPA countries to take reciprocal \n     action against U.S. companies seeking to participate in their \n     procurement markets and by opening the United States to \n     retaliation for violating its WTO obligations. While U.S. \n     companies certainly face significant and discriminatory \n     procurement barriers in China, India, Brazil and other \n     countries that are not part of the WTO procurement agreement, \n     U.S. companies are still selling more into those government \n     procurement markets than the United States is purchasing from \n     those countries. As a result, there would more than likely be \n     net loss for U.S. exports, U.S. companies and U.S. jobs if \n     this provision became a model for foreign governments.\n       Furthermore, the imposition of this discriminatory tax on \n     foreign companies may also violate U.S. international \n     commitments if implemented. If found to be contrary to U.S. \n     WTO commitments, other countries could end up being \n     authorized to retaliate directly against U.S. exports, \n     further undermining U.S. opportunities overseas.\n       For all of these reasons, we strongly urge you to remove \n     the Title III procurement provisions from this legislation.\n           Respectfully,\n         American Association of Exporters and Importers (AAEI);\n         Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM);\n         Business Roundtable;\n         Emergency Committee for American Trade (ECAT);\n         National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC);\n         National Retail Federation (NRF);\n         Organization for International Investment (OFII);\n         TechAmerica;\n         United States Council for International Business (USCIB);\n         U.S. Chamber of Commerce;\n         U.S.-China Business Council.\n\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the Speaker of the \nHouse, who has done so much to make this bill possible.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise \nto briefly congratulate and thank the Members of the New York \ndelegation and others who helped bring this legislation to the floor in \na strong bipartisan way: Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Nadler, \nCongressman King. Thank you. We thank you for giving us the opportunity \nto say ``thank you'' in a real way to our first responders, to our \nfirefighters, to those who rushed in without question to rescue their \nfellow Americans, and people from all over the country as a matter of \nfact.\n  There is an exhilaration, Madam Speaker, that you see in the Chamber, \nbecause right now we know that any discussion we have ever had about 9/\n11 has been a discussion where we have entered holy and sacred ground, \nwhere people lost their lives. Fewer did because others were willing to \nrisk theirs. For over 9 years we have been\n\n[[Page H8961]]\n\ntrying to redress the grievance that we have of people not having the \nhealth benefits and the recognition of their service, their sacrifice, \nand their courage.\n  Today Mr. King, Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Nadler--I should \nsay Congressman King, Chairman King to be--and the leadership of this \nHouse and of the United States Senate, and I thank Senator Gillibrand \nand Senator Schumer as well as Senator Reid and the Republican \nleadership in the Senate for affording us this opportunity to extend \nour patriotic appreciation to those whose love of our country, whose \ncare and commitment to their fellow person, who unquestionably made \nsacrifices, and now, almost 9\\1/2\\ years later, more than 9 years later \nwe finally are doing the right thing for them.\n\n                              {time}  1610\n\n  Every day our firefighters, our police officers, our first responders \nleave their homes, willing to risk their lives. Little did they know on \nthat day many of them would not return home. How can we ever repay \ntheir sacrifice and their courage?\n  So, today we do so, certainly not enough, but as a token of our \nappreciation for what they have done to strengthen our country.\n  Again, I thank all of those who made this important legislation \npossible.\n  Mr. BURGESS. May I inquire as to how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 7\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from New Jersey has 10\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Madam Speaker, Congressman Brady articulated very well some of the \nconcerns he has with the pay-for that is in this bill, raising new \nrevenues through tariffs, and the possibility of retaliatory efforts by \nother countries.\n  I would just point out, in section 4002 of the recently passed health \ncare law last March, there is a section that calls for a Public Health \nand Wellness Trust Fund. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has \n$15 billion in a slush fund in ObamaCare. This money could have been \neasily used to pay for this legislation. It could have been done last \nApril, and we wouldn't be here at the last minute trying to scrounge \nfor capital to pay these funds.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Maloney), who is the prime sponsor of the legislation \nand has worked so hard on this bill.\n  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her \nremarks.)\n  Mrs. MALONEY. I thank all of my colleagues, especially the New York \ndelegation and the Speaker and Leader Hoyer.\n  Today, Congress repays a long overdue debt and answers the emergency \ncalls of our ailing 9/11 first responders and survivors. This bill will \nsave lives. It has taken too long, but help finally is here for the \nthousands of Americans who are suffering because of 9/11.\n  Our bill will give support and hope to more than 36,000 Americans who \nare ailing because of the attacks on our Nation. It also says to future \ngenerations that if you are harmed in the service of our country, you \nwill be taken care of.\n  I couldn't be more proud of everyone who fought like hell to pass \nthis bill, our Senators Gillibrand and Schumer, my good friends and \ncoauthors Nadler and King, the 9/11 responders and survivors who are \nhere with us, and the thousands of their brothers and sisters who could \nnot be. John Feal, you have been a warrior for this bill. Thank you.\n  Just after the attacks, this body came together. With this bill, we \nput in law that we will never forget and do whatever it takes.\n  Madam Speaker, today, I proudly rise to support the James Zadroga 9/\n11 Health and Compensation Act. Passing this bill and getting it to the \nPresident's desk will truly be a Christmas miracle.\n  When Jerry Nadler and I first introduced a 9/11 bill, we never would \nhave thought it could take 7 years or that it could be the last \nlegislative item out the door. It should never have taken so long.\n  A TV commentator recently made a good point when he said that Pearl \nHarbor was not just a Hawaii issue and neither should caring for the \nvictims of 9/11 be a New York issue. The Twin Towers were attacked as a \nsymbol of our Nation and the sick and injured are not just from New \nYork. After the attacks, at least 10,000 brave men and women came from \nall 50 states and 428 of 435 Congressional districts.\n  I thank my colleagues from across the country for staying to complete \nthe last remaining gap in America's response to 9/11. Our bill will \ngive support and hope to the more than 36,000 Americans who are ailing \nbecause of the attacks on our Nation, and it also says to future \ngenerations that if you are harmed in the service of America, you will \nbe taken care of.\n  I especially thank my good friends and co-authors Jerry Nadler and \nPeter King, the entire New York Delegation, and Speaker Pelosi and \nMajority Leader Hoyer, who all helped pass this bill in September and \nare working on it today. I thank Senators Gillibrand and Schumer for \ntireless efforts to get this bill done.\n  This long-overdue legislation will provide health care and financial \ncompensation to the responders and survivors who are sick from exposure \nto toxins at Ground Zero. The cost of the bill has been cut almost in \nhalf to $4.3 billion from $7.4 billion. The Victim Compensation Fund \nwill be funded for 5 years at $2.8 billion and the health programs will \nbe fully funded for 5 years at $1.5 billion. I thank Members of the \nother body for coming to this bipartisan compromise.\n  The offset has been entirely replaced with two other offsets and in \naddition to fully funding this bill, the procurement payfor will put an \nestimated $450 million in extra revenue toward the deficit.\n  We are reminded this holiday season of the importance of giving. But \ntoday I ask my colleagues to remember all that the heroes of 9/11 have \nalready given. These individuals rushed to the site of immeasurable \ndanger and first gave their time, and later are giving up their health, \nand in some cases their lives.\n  Nine long years have passed since the attacks. It was never the \nintention of the bill's authors to make this a partisan issue and I \nregret that it has become wrapped in party politics.\n  I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can come \ntogether, just as we stood together on the steps of the Capitol the \nevening of September 11, 2001, to show our gratitude to the responders \nand survivors who have given so much to our country.\n  There could be no better gift to America this holiday season than \nhelping save the lives of those who came to the aid of our Nation in a \ntime of war.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nEngel) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. ENGEL. I rise in strong support of this bill. This is a fitting \nway to end the 111th Congress. This is the proudest moment I have had \nin Congress in 22 years. I believe that our hard work paid off, all of \nus together on the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the James Zadroga 9/11 \nHealth Compensation Act. As a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee I was proud to help shepherd this bill through the committee \nprocess and am proud to speak in support of this legislation yet again \non the House floor this year.\n  Two days ago, I joined New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and \nother members of the New York delegation, and first responders to urge \nswift passage of this bill in the Senate.\n  Madam speaker, it is shameful that we are approaching the 10-year \nanniversary of 9-11 next year and this bill still has not reached the \nPresident for his signature.\n  Now I am here again today to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe package that we are considering today, which rectifies some of the \nconcerns that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nexpressed.\n  This is not a partisan issue, and the package that we consider today \nreflects that.\n  People from all over the country joined to help after the attack \nwithout concern for their health or wellbeing. Now it is their \ncountry's time to step-up in their time of need. Victims of 9-11 \ncontinue to suffer from crippling physical ailments. They are dying and \nhave been ignored for almost a decade. The House noticed, once already \nthis year. I am hopeful that we can send a bill to the Senate that will \npass.\n  I look forward to casting my vote in support of the James Zadroga 9/\n11 Health Compensation Act and sending it back to the Senate.\n  I am proud of the role that we played on the Health Subcommittee and \nthe Energy and Commerce with our hearings and markups in moving this \nbill through. This is not a New\n\n[[Page H8962]]\n\nYork issue; this is an American Issue. First responders came from all \nparts of the country. The Federal Government falsely told everyone it \nwas safe to return and it wasn't.\n  Today we say thank you to our first responders--it is a fitting way \nto end the 111th Congress.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) for \nthe purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. CROWLEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, on September 11, my cousin, John Moran, \nwas at Tower Two of the World Trade Center. He said, ``Let me off here. \nI want to try and make a difference.''\n  We have made a difference today in the lives of the people we're \nsaving.\n  Today, I rise as the cousin of Battalion Chief John Moran.\n  My cousin, along with almost 3,000 others, died on September 11, \n2001.\n  His last known words were to the driver of the New York City Fire \nDepartment vehicle. As he was dropped off at World Trade Center Tower \n2, John said, `Let me off here. I am going to try to make a \ndifference.'\n  Nothing can replace the loss of my cousin or the thousands of others \nwho were killed that day. Nothing can replace the loss of those who \nhave perished since.\n  But, today we can make proud his memory and the memory of all those \nwho served on September 11th and the days following.\n  Enactment of the James Zadroga 9-11 Health and Compensation Act \nfulfills a commitment to those who served our Nation honorably, \ntirelessly and without pause.\n  Today, I am proud to stand before my colleagues as the cousin of \nBattalion Chief John Moran, and I am proud, in the words of John, to \n`make a difference' for the many heroes who have suffered long enough \nbecause of their service to our great country.\n\n\n                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A Member asking to insert remarks may \ninclude a simple declaration of sentiment toward the question under \ndebate but should not embellish the request with extended oratory.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) \nfor the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Ms. SLAUGHTER asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. \nA lot of us are going to sleep a lot better now knowing that this bill \nhas been passed.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York \n(Mr. Rangel) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. RANGEL. All of us from the City of New York and around the Nation \nare so proud to be a Member of this body.\n\n\n                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will repeat that a Member asking \nto insert remarks may include a simple declaration of sentiment toward \nthe question under debate but should not embellish the request with \nextended oratory.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. McMahon) for \nthe purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. McMAHON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McMAHON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill on behalf \nof the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn, New York, all of them, and \nin particular Trish and Marty Fullam.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey will be \ncharged with the time consumed.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman) \nfor the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. ACKERMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Eshoo) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Ms. ESHOO asked and was given permission to revise and extend her \nremarks.)\n  Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for \nthis. How proud I am to have voted as a Californian for the Americans \nthat went and took care and did their job.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will be charged with the time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for \nthe purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill \nas a big thank you from a very, very grateful Nation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey will be \ncharged.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) \nfor the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise \nand extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I thank the distinguished gentleman, and I \nrise to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 847, to be able to thank \nCarolyn Maloney for the enormous work and to also cite those who I saw \ndying that they might live.\n  Madam Speaker I rise today in strong support of H.R. 847, the ``James \nZadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.'' This bill has been a long \ntime coming, and I am glad that it is finally here for us to provide \nmedical monitoring and treatment benefits to eligible emergency \nresponders and recovery and cleanup workers who responded to the \nSeptember 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. This legislation also allows for \ninitial health evaluation, monitoring, and treatment benefits to \nresidents and other building occupants and area workers in New York \nCity who were directly impacted and adversely affected by the 9/11 \nterrorist attacks.\n  I have met firsthand many of these first responders and workers, and \nI know the patriotic sacrifices they have made for their fellow \nAmericans. These brave, selfless individuals who put aside their own \nneeds and fears to come to the aid of their fellow Americans put their \nlives at risk. They ventured into the wreckage and dust of the World \nTrade Center, not worrying about their own well being, but rather, \nhoping that they could save the lives of strangers. As a result of \ntheir fearless acts, many of these emergency workers and first \nresponders were exposed to airborne toxins and other hazards. Providing \nmedical services, including clinical examinations, long-term health \nmonitoring, mental health care and necessary prescription drug \ncoverage, is the least we can do to repay them for their efforts.\n  The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act will provide both \ninitial and follow-up medical services for World Trade Center \nresponders and workers whose physical and mental health were impacted \nby the 9/11 attacks. H.R. 847 will also establish an outreach program \nto potentially eligible individuals.\n  September 11, 2001, is a day that is indelibly etched in the psyche \nof every American and most of the world. Much like the unprovoked \nattack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, September 11 is a day that \nwill live in infamy. And as much as Pearl Harbor changed the course of \nworld history by precipitating the global struggle between totalitarian \nfascism and representative democracy, the transformative impact of \nSeptember 11 in the course of American and human history is indelible. \nSeptember 11 was not only the beginning of the Global War on Terror, \nbut moreover, it was the day of innocence lost for a new generation of \nAmericans.\n  Just like my fellow Americans, I remember September 11 as vividly as \nif it was yesterday. In my mind's eye, I can still remember being \nmesmerized by the television as the two airliners crashed into the Twin \nTowers of the World Trade Center, and I remember the sense of terror we \nexperienced when we realized that this was no accident, that we had \nbeen attacked, and that the world as we know it had changed forever. \nThe moment in which the Twin Towers collapsed and the nearly 3,000 \ninnocent Americans died haunts me until this day.\n  At this moment, I decided that the protection of our homeland would \nbe at the forefront of my legislative agenda. I knew that all of our\n\n[[Page H8963]]\n\ncollective efforts as Americans would all be in vain if we did not \nachieve our most important priority: the security of our nation. \nAccordingly, I became then and continue to this day to be an active and \nengaged Member of the Committee on Homeland Security who considers our \nnational security paramount.\n  Our nation's collective response to the tragedy of September 11 \nexemplified what has been true of the American people since the \ninception of our Republic--in times of crisis, we come together and \nalways persevere. Despite the depths of our anguish on the preceding \nday, on September 12, the American people demonstrated their compassion \nand solidarity for one another as we began the process of response, \nrecovery, and rebuilding. We transcended our differences and came \ntogether to honor the sacrifices and losses sustained by the countless \nvictims of September 11. Let us honor those who served and sacrificed \nby passing H.R. 847.\n  Madam Speaker, as I stand here today, my heart still grieves for \nthose who perished on flights United Airlines 93, American Airlines 77, \nAmerican Airlines 11, and United Airlines 175. When the sun rose on the \nmorning of September 11, none of us knew that it would end in an \ninferno in the magnificent World Trade Center Towers in New York City, \nthe Pentagon in Washington, DC, and in the grassy fields of \nShanksville, Pennsylvania. How I wish we could have hugged and kissed \nand held each of the victims one last time.\n  I stand here remembering those who still suffer, whose hearts still \nache over the loss of so many innocent and interrupted lives. My prayer \nis that for those who lost a father, a mother, a husband, a wife, a \nchild, or a friend will in the days and years ahead take comfort in the \ncertain knowledge that they have gone on to claim the greatest prize, a \nplace in the Lord's loving arms. And down here on the ground, their \nmemory will never die so long as any of the many of us who loved them \nlives.\n  Again, I would like to reiterate my strong support for H.R. 847, the \nJames Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, for it is important \nthat we take care of those who take care of us in our time of need.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey will be \ncharged.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. King).\n  Mr. KING of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I will keep \nmy remarks very brief.\n  I thank the Congress of the United States for what it is going to do \ntoday. Especially I want to thank Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler for \nthe tremendous work they have done on this bill over the years from the \nvery start. I want to thank Congressman Vito Fossella, who was also an \noriginal cosponsor of this. I want to thank the Speaker of the House, \nMs. Pelosi, for doing so much to bring this bill forward, and also the \nRepublican leader, who this summer managed to have this bill come up in \na way that was not going to be disruptive at all.\n\n                              {time}  1620\n\n  I want to thank all the members of the New York delegation. Most \nimportantly, I want to thank the firefighters, the police officers, the \nconstruction workers, and all of those who came forward to answer the \nNation's call on September 11. This is a great victory for the American \npeople. It's a great victory for the Congress of the United States. And \nit sends a signal that we stand by those who come to our Nation's \ndefense in time of trouble and, indeed, in time of war, because this \nwas the first battle of the great war of the 21st century.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  This is an important bill. It's something that should have been done \na long time ago. I credit a former New York fireman, Richard Lasky, who \nis now my fire chief in Lewisville, Texas, for helping me understand \nthe importance of this bill as it has gone forward. It has been \ndifficult. In my opinion, there were better ways to do this bill, but \nit's before us today.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, we need to ensure that the \nfirst responders and individuals who were in the vicinity of the World \nTrade Center have access to the specialized medical treatment they need \nand that means ensuring these programs are properly funded.\n  H.R. 847 accomplishes that goal and I am proud to be a cosponser of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois. I find it appalling that a bill of this \nmagnitude was amended in the Senate just hours before the House was \nasked to vote on it, with no Member having had the chance to review and \ndeliberate on what we were voting on and enacting into law. When \nearlier versions of this bill were brought to the floor I had some \nmajor reservations and with no way to know if all of these were \naddressed I would not feel comfortable voting yes or no on this bill.\n  Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to \nthe Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. As a cosponsor of \nthe House bill, I urge passage of this important bill.\n  Today, we have the opportunity to honor the rescue and recovery \nworkers who served our nation after the devastating attacks at the \nWorld Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and, more important than empty \nhonor, to provide for their care. My district suffered casualities that \nday and nine years later, the memory of that terrible day is still \nfresh in our minds.\n  Along with the victims of 9/11, there were thousands of rescue and \nrecovery workers who came to the aid of our nation that day. These \nbrave women and men rushed to Ground Zero to help the fallen and to \nparticipate in the clean-up effort without thinking about their health \nor safety. These workers were exposed to environmental hazards and have \ndeveloped significant respiratory illnesses, chronic infections, and \nother medical conditions. Further, many first responders are only now \nbeing diagnosed with illnesses that are related to their exposure at \nGround Zero.\n  This bill would create the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) \nthat would provide medical monitoring and treatment benefits to first \nresponders and workers who were directly affected by the attacks. \nAdditionally, the program would establish education and outreach \nprograms and conduct research on physical and mental health conditions \nrelated to the 9/11 attacks. The WTCHP program would serve more than \n75,000 survivors, recovery workers, and members of the affected \ncommunities.\n  Additionally, this bill provides long-term health care and \ncompensation for thousands of responders and survivors. By passing this \nbill, we will be paying tribute to the sacrifice and courage of these \nwomen and men and we will be paying a debt. This bill will be paid for \nwith a partnership with New York City and by reducing government \nprocurement payments and the extension of fees for outsourcing \ncompanies.\n  Unfortunately, this bill is a weaker version of the bill that I \ncosponsored and that the House passed in September. The bill caps \nfederal funding for health programs over five years and allows first \nresponders only five years to file claims. Unfortunately, some put \npolitics over these brave first responders. Although this bill is a \nreduced version of the original bill, we must honor the rescue and \nrecovery workers by providing them with the much needed health care. We \ncannot let our first responders down.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, I was absent for legislative \nbusiness and missed rollcall vote 663 on December 21, 2010, and \nrollcall vote 664 on December 22, 2010. Had I been present, I would \nhave voted ``yes'' on H.R. 6547, the Protecting Students from Sexual \nand Violent Predators Act, and ``no'' on rollcall vote 664 (H.R. 847).\n  The vote I wish to discuss is the bill H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/\n11 Health and Compensation Act. Without a doubt, Republicans and \nDemocrats can agree that both the victims of the attacks on September \n11, 2001, and the first responders who bravely served following the \nattacks deserve to be fairly treated and compensated. However, this \nbill would create a new health care entitlement, the World Trade Center \nHealth Program, while also extending eligibility for compensation under \nthe September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. As a result, had I \nbeen present, I would have voted against passage of the bill.\n  Since the terrorist attacks occurred nearly nine years ago, I have \nsupported legislation to ensure that these individuals are cared for \nand receive access to the services they deserve. However, rather than \nworking with Republicans to craft a bill which truly addressed the \nshortcomings in care provided to those directly impacted by the \nSeptember 11th terrorist attacks, the Majority instead rushed this bill \nto the floor in the waning hours of the 111th Congress, refusing to \nallow an open debate or consider amendments.\n  The result is a deeply flawed bill. H.R. 847 creates yet another \nmandatory spending program--increasing spending by $4.2 billion dollars \nover 10 years--and paying for it by an excise tax on foreign \nmanufacturers, an extension of Travel Promotion Act fees, and the \nextension of HI-B visa fees.\n  There is no doubt that we owe a debt of gratitude to those who came \nto the rescue of countless individuals following the attacks on \nSeptember 11, 2001, but these provisions distort that noble goal. At a \ntime when our budget\n\n[[Page H8964]]\n\ndeficit is $1.3 trillion and our national debt stands at $13.8 \ntrillion, we must accurately account for those programs that take \npriority. I remain hopeful that as the 112th Congress convenes, my \ncolleagues and I can work together to reform some of my concerns with \nthis proposal and truly provide the services these first responders \ndeserve.\n  Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, with the ninth anniversary \nof September 11th having passed, it is important to remember not only \nthose who were lost that tragic day, but also the sense of purpose and \ntogetherness that shined in the aftermath of, no doubt, one of the most \ndifficult days in our nation's history. Heroic first responders deserve \nutmost recognition for selflessly digging through the ruins of Lower \nManhattan in hope of finding survivors. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health \nand Compensation Act, a bill that I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of, provides just that by extending and improving protections \nand services to individuals directly impacted by the terrorist attacks \non September 11, 2001.\n  Since our inception, we, as a nation, have grown stronger by \nprotecting and honoring the sacrifices of our citizenry. This \nlegislation is the embodiment of that mantra. As a New Yorker, not a \nday passes without thought of the horrific attacks of September 11th, \nthis legislation will no doubt go a long way to provide first-\nresponders with peace of mind.\n  During House floor consideration and passage of the James Zadroga 9/\n11 Health and Compensation Act on Wednesday, I was unavoidably absent \nfrom Washington due to a family health emergency. I have had the \nprivilege of working closely with my New York colleagues in both the \nHouse and Senate on this legislation, and I am extraordinarily happy \nthat the Congress was able to pass this bill before the adjournment of \nthe 111th Congress.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of legislation that \nwould help thousands of first responders who were exposed to hazardous \nhealth conditions in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks.\n  Many first responders bravely answered the call of duty and rushed to \nthe scene of the attacks. While they were helping out the victims, the \nresponders unknowingly were exposed to long-term physical and mental \nhealth problems due to the residual dust, toxins, and chemicals from \nthe attacks. Congress and the federal government have an obligation and \na responsibility to care and help those who responded to the September \n11th attacks.\n  Madam Speaker, let us not forget the sacrifice and service of those \nbrave individuals who responded to one of the worst attacks in American \nhistory. I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate were able to \ncome to a bipartisan agreement on this bill. I urge my House colleagues \nto support this legislation so that the thousands of 9/11 responders \ncan get the help they need.\n  Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today, nine years after the tragic \nevents of September 11, to recognize the passage of a bill that will \nallow the first responders who rushed to the scene that day to now be \nable to get the health care resources they need.\n  Today, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate approved \nan amended version, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act \nthat would provide medical treatment for the ailing first responders \nand recovery workers who were exposed to toxic dust following the \ncollapse of the Twin Towers in New York City on September 11, 2001.\n  This victory is for what is right; a long overdue thank you to those \nwho rushed in to help after what was one of our nation's biggest \ntragedies. After nine long years, these unsung heroes and their \nfamilies no longer have to worry about how they are going to get the \ncare and resources they so desperately need.\n  The Zadraga bill originally passed the House in September, but had \nbeen held up in the Senate due to various partisan concerns. It now \ngoes to President Barack Obama, who is expected to sign the bill into \nlaw before the end of the holiday season.\n  This should have never been about the money, but about what we should \ndo to honor those who thought of their country first and not \nthemselves. They answered the call when their country needed them and \nwe are all a better nation for it.\n  Thanks to the hard work of so many people--from legislators, like our \nMayor Michael Bloomberg, the New York Congressional Delegation and \nHouse Leadership, to the NYS AFL-CIO President Dennis Hughes, the 32nd \nFire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano and the countless union officials \nand 911 families that traveled to Washington to lobby on the bill's \nbehalf--these patriotic Americans can spend the holiday seasons with \nsome peace of mind.\n  What the law would do: Under an agreement worked out by New York \nSenators Charles Schumer and Kristen Gillibrand, the James Zadroga 9/11 \nHealth and Compensation Act would: provide a total of $4.3 billion in \nfunding for the health and compensation titles of the bill; cap federal \nfunding for the health program over five years at $1.5 billion (New \nYork City will contribute 10% of the cost). Any funds not spent in the \nfirst five years may be carried over and expended in the sixth year of \nthe program; reopen the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) for five years \nto file claims, with payments to be made over six years. Fund the VCF \nat $2.8 billion for six years, with $.8 billion available for payments \nin the first five years and $2.0 billion available for payment in year \nsix. Claims will be paid in 2 installments--one payment in the first \nfive years, and a second payment in the sixth year of the program; the \npay for the House-passed version of the bill has been replaced by a 2 \npercent fee on government procurement from foreign companies located in \nnon-GPA countries and a one-year extension of H-B 1 and L-1 Visa fees \nfor outsourcing companies. These are estimated by CBO to collect $4.59 \nbillion over the 10-year scoring period for the bill.\n  Others changes made in the bill to address Republican concerns: \nrequiring that the Centers of Excellence report claims data to HHS so \nthat costs and utilization of services can be fully monitored; \nspecifying the non-treatment services furnished by Centers of \nExcellence to be funded under the health program (e.g., outreach, \nsocial services, data collection, and development of treatment \nprotocols); authorizing the World Trade Center Program Administrator to \ndesignate the Veteran's Administration as a provider for WTC health \nservices; directing the Special Master to develop rules to implement \nthe VCF within 180 days of passage of the legislation.\n  Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise yet again in the strongest \npossible support of the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, H.R. 847.\n  Today, we must show the American people that their representatives \ncan put away their differences and work together to pass this bill. \nOver the past few weeks, this clearly was not the case. Some Members of \nCongress have played political games with this legislation, delaying \nits passage for dubious reasons and causing the measure to be watered \ndown. The sick and injured don't care about offsets and they don't care \nwhether this is a $6 billion bill or a $7 billion bill. They just care \nabout getting the medical care they need, the medical care they rightly \ndeserve.\n  So Madam Speaker, we are here for the third and I hope final time on \nthe floor of the House to consider doing the decent thing: helping the \nliving victims of 9/11 who continue to suffer the terrible effects of \nthat day. The Federal Government has not stepped up enough to help the \nresponders, volunteers, workers and residents that went to Ground Zero \nduring and after the horrific 9/11 attack. This Congress has not acted \nto help these victims on a permanent basis--we have the opportunity to \ndo that today. Tragically, some of the very people that we want to help \nwith this legislation have already died. Thousands of Americans who \nresponded need medical treatment now. Thousands more will need \ntreatment in the future.\n  So, Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the 9/11 \nHealth and Compensation Act so that all the victims of 9/11 will \nreceive the medical care and help they need and deserve. Let's pass \nthis bill.\n  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of \nH.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. This bill \nwill provide the needed assistance to the brave men and women who have \nbecome ill due to the dangerous toxins they inhaled while risking their \nlives to help out the city of New York during that tragic time in \nSeptember of 2001. This is a bipartisan bill and should be supported by \nall Members of Congress.\n  These heroes risked their lives to assist their fellow Americans and \ntheir efforts will never go unnoticed. This bill will allow health \nbenefits to a wide range of first responders such as firefighters, \nconstruction workers, residents, area workers and even school \nchildren--all of whom have been affected by the toxins that filled the \nair after the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001.\n  We all witnessed the terrible attacks on America, September 11, 2001 \nand we also witnessed the acts of bravery by our first responders. I \nsupport the passage of the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the James \nZadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. Every American remembers the \nday the Twin Towers fell and the unparalleled heroism of the first \nresponders who saved countless lives without any regard for their own. \nThey showed courage in the face of terror and strength in a path of \ndestruction. Too many of these brave men and women didn't make it out \nof the wreckage in time. Those who did returned every day for months, \nsifting through rubble, recovering victims and restoring order to \nGround Zero with little consideration for their own welfare or safety.\n  Tragically, many of these selfless workers are now suffering chronic, \ndisabling health conditions as a direct result of injuries or toxic \nexposure sustained at the site. The bill before\n\n[[Page H8965]]\n\nus creates a program to provide medical services and health monitoring \nfor first responders and others who have medical conditions related to \nthe September 11 terrorist attacks. Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure and finally show these heroes the \nsame honor and respect they showed us, our families, our friends and \nour country.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I am proud to say that we are finally \ndoing the right thing to support our heroes from 9/11. The agreement we \nhave here today is much less than we originally hoped for--but more \nthan four and a half years after the death of NYPD Det. James Zadroga--\nI am here to say that we need to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and \nCompensation Act right now because we are losing these brave souls as \nwe speak.\n  I'm sad to say its now been nine years since 9/11 and it has taken \nthis long to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act--\nnine years is too long to wait and watch as our first responders from \nthat day continue to suffer physically and emotionally--nine years is \nlate, BUT its not too late to do the right thing. We need to pass this \nbill and we need to pass it now. Nine years ago we gave those brave \nsouls the `all clear' sign, but we now know that we were exposing those \nmen and women to a poisonous dust that would stay with them for the \nrest of their lives.\n  I am proud to say that we found a way to pay for this bill so that we \ncan do the right thing for our 9/11 workers AND for our children who \nwill bear the debt of the decisions we make today.\n  Let me be clear, this isn't just a bill for New York and New Jersey--\nthis is a bill for all Americans. We know that people from all 50 \nstates were in lower Manhattan on or after 9/11 and now are facing \nserious health concerns--there are 435 Congressional Districts and 431 \nof them are represented by the names of constituents on the World Trade \nCenter Health Registry.\n  After 9/11 we all said we would be there for these brave first \nresponders--but today if we vote against this bill we are asking those \nsame brave individuals to come to Washington, year after year to fight \nfor their health benefits--do we expect them to come here ten years \nfrom now? By then it may be too late for many of these men and women \nwho responded to their nation's call of duty.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and \nCompensation Act--once and for all let us stand up for these brave \nAmericans.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, today the House will consider the James \nZadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.\n  More than 70,000 Americans from every state descended upon ground \nzero to help recover and rebuild after 9/11. Some have died from \nillnesses as a result and more than 17,000 who are ill lack the care \nthey need.\n  Just as we provide medical care for our troops, we must care for \nthose who heroically responded.\n  Passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act is a \nmilestone for our nation, as we finally fulfill our obligation to those \nwho sacrificed so much for us. Our nation owes a debt of gratitude that \ncan never be fully repaid to the September 11 responders who died or \nwere sickened as a result of their brave and selfless actions.\n  Nearly all of us represent a responder, and almost nine years later, \nhave a duty to do what is right--vote for this bill today.\n  Mr. BURGESS. I yield back the balance of my time and urge support of \nthe bill.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I would urge passage of this bill and \nsend it to the President.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the order of the House of today, the previous question is \nordered.\n  The question is on the motion by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPallone).\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 206, \nnays 60, not voting 168, as follows:\n\n

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and include extraneous material in the Record.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New Jersey?\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tMr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield to myself such time as I may consume.\n\tI rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2019. Today, this body, for the third time, will vote on legislation to finally keep our promise and take care of the heroes of 9/11.\n\tI would like to thank the bill's sponsors, Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler, as well as my colleagues from New York on the committee, Eliot Engel and Anthony Weiner, also, for their tireless work on behalf of this legislation.\n\tMadam Speaker, this bill would establish the World Trade Center Health Program, a program to screen, monitor and treat eligible responders and survivors who are suffering from World Trade Center related diseases. It also reopens the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.\n\tH.R. 847, as amended, costs $4.2 billion over 10 years. Of that amount, $1.5 billion will go to the health program, while $2.7 billion will go the VCF. Both programs are now limited to 5 years.\n\tThe amended bill before us today also changes how the two programs are paid for by a 2 percent fee on government procurement from foreign companies located in nongovernmental procurement, and a 1-year extension of H1-B and L-1 visa fees for outsourcing companies.\n\tMadam Speaker, this bill has long been a huge priority for me and many of my colleagues in the House and the Senate. I urge my colleagues to pass the bill. \n\tI reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMadam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's efforts in this regard. I would like to take a few moments and clear up some of the mischaracterizations that have occurred, unfortunately, around the debate of this bill as it has worked its way through both Houses.\n\tThere have been some who have claimed that my side, the Republicans, do not support providing treatment for 9/11 first responders, and that these first responders are currently going without treatment for the illnesses and injuries they suffered as a result of serving at the World Trade Center. Both of those claims are simply not true.\n\tAccording to President Obama's administration's own Centers for Disease Control, the agency said, ``We will continue to provide monitoring and treatment services for mental and physical health conditions related to World Trade Center exposures for both responders and for eligible non-responders. The World Trade Center program is critical in meeting the ongoing and long-term specialty needs of individuals that were exposed to dust, smoke, debris, and psychological trauma from the World Trade Center attacks.''\n\tAs of September 30, 2009, the World Trade Center program had enrolled over 55,000 responders in its monitoring and treatment programs. This is in the CDC's budget justification for 2011.\n\tAt the Energy and Commerce Committee's markup of this legislation, Republicans offered an amendment that would authorize the program that is already providing treatment and monitoring benefits and authorized funding for the program at exactly the level that was requested by the President of the United States. That same amendment asked for real accountability to ensure that we knew how the tax dollars were being spent. Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated.\n\tI am pleased that work in the Senate has yielded an amendment that will provide for increased accountability and increased transparency in how these funds are spent. H.R. 847 caps the number of people that can be enrolled in the program but it does not require those enrolled to verify their citizenship.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n\tWe offered an amendment that would require this program so that people in the country without benefit of Social Security numbers would not get benefits while Americans were being stuck on the waiting list. This amendment was defeated.\n\tAs with any government spending program, there should be limitations on who can participate. The government has limited resources, so the principal beneficiaries of the 9/11 health program should be the first responders. However, H.R. 847 provides more than just benefits to first responders; it also provides benefits to anyone who lives and works in New York City. Under this bill, even Wall Street millionaires could receive benefits with no cost to them, all done at the taxpayers' expense.\n\tIn fact, in the Committee on Energy and Commerce I offered an amendment that was rejected by the committee. I attempted to offer the amendment at Rules when this legislation was brought before the House before our adjournment in September, but I was thwarted in that. But it remains that we ought to ensure that Federal taxpayers would not have to pay for the health care of millionaires.\n\tThe bill passed by the Senate is an improvement over what passed in the House. There could have been further improvements to ensure our limited resources are being spent in the most efficient manner possible. But all in all, the improvements that have been accomplished over the last 24 hours are all to the good. This is an important piece of legislation. This is something that this Congress or some Congress should have passed in the last 8 years. And it is unconscionable that we are here today at the last hour of the 111th Congress with still this work pending. It's important to get this work done.\n\tI reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman).\n\tMr. WAXMAN. I rise in strong support, Madam Speaker, of H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. I want to thank the chairman of the Health Subcommittee, Frank Pallone, as well as my colleagues from New York on the committee, Eliot Engel and Anthony Weiner, for their relentless work on behalf of this legislation, as well as Representatives Maloney and Nadler, and the whole New York City delegation, who were tireless in their support of this bill.\n\tThis is an important piece of legislation that will attempt to provide the services to first responders and community residents who developed illness as a result of their exposure to the massive toxic dust cloud that blanketed Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001. I strongly urge all Members to support this legislation.\n\tH.R. 847, was reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee with bipartisan support on May 25 by a vote of 33-12.\n\tThe House passed H.R. 847 on September 29; the bill received bipartisan support from 268 Members.\n\tThe version of before us this afternoon is one that has been amended by the Senate in order to obtain bipartisan support in that Chamber.\n\tLike the House-passed version, the Senate version is fully paid for and will not increase the deficit. It fully complies with all pay-go rules.\n\tThe World Trade Center Health Program currently provides services to first responders and community residents who developed illnesses as a result of their exposure to the massive toxic dust cloud that blanketed lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\tThe current program is not authorized. The House-passed bill authorized the Health Program through FY 2019 at a federal funding level of $3.2 billion. The federal government will pay 90 percent of the cost, while New York City will pay 10 percent.\n\tThe Senate amendment reduces the authorization period to FY 2015 and federal funding to $1.5 billion. New York City would still be required to pay 10 percent of the costs.\n\tThe Senate amendment makes a number of other changes in the Health Program.\n\tIt prohibits the Secretary of HHS from using NIOSH to administer payments to Centers of Excellence and other participating providers.\n\tIt clarifies that Centers of Excellence delivering services to responders and community residents will have to provide claims-level data to the Health Program Administrator.\n\tIt clarifies the Centers of Excellence should be paid for the costs of carrying out the program that are not otherwise reimbursable, such as outreach, data collection, social services, and development of treatment protocols.\n\tIt authorizes the Program Administrator to contract with the VA to provide services to responders enrolled in the national program through its facilities, but only if the VA chooses to do so.\n\tFinally, the Senate amendment directs the GAO to conduct studies on various aspects of the Health Program and to report to the Committees of jurisdiction prior to July 1, 2011. That is the date on which Secretary of HHS and the WTC Administrator are responsible for implementing the Health Program. In the likely event that the GAO is unable to complete all of its work by that date, the Program will nonetheless begin furnishing services to responders and survivors.\n\tThe Administration supports this bill for the same reason that all of us should: it is the right thing to do.\n\tThe first responders were there for us on 9-11. We should be there for them today.\n\tI urge my colleagues to pass this bill and send it on to the President for signature.\n\tMr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).\n\tMr. COLE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.\n\tMadam Speaker, long before New York City's first responders rushed to save their fellow Americans in the fire and the horror of 9/11, they came to help the people of Oklahoma City deal with the death and destruction stemming from the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building on April 19, 1995. The people of Oklahoma have never forgotten the help that they received in their most difficult days from the first responders of New York City and their fellow first responders from all across North America.\n\tWhen 9/11 occurred, Oklahoma's first responders were proud to join their fellow Americans and rush to the aid of a stricken New York City. Now it's our turn in this body to help all of those who answered the call of duty on 9/11. They risked themselves to save others and to help one of America's great cities deal with and recover from the devastation of the greatest terrorist attack in our history. It's time, as our greatest President said in an earlier era and in another context, ``to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and for his orphan.''\n\tMadam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 847, as amended.\n\tMr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to one of the sponsors of the bill who has worked tirelessly on this, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n\tMr. NADLER of New York. Madam Speaker, let me first thank everyone who has worked on this bill and say the Senate passed this bill a little while ago unanimously. The most conservative Senators, Senators Enzi and Coburn, supported it, and I hope we can do the same.\n\tNine years ago, Madam Speaker, the heroes of 9/11 ran into the buildings, they rushed into the burning buildings, and they worked in a toxic environment for weeks and months. They have suffered for that. They have suffered for their service to this country by getting sick, by dying, by being sick. It is now up to us to see that the United States honors its heroes, that the United States does not turn its back on those who served us.\n\tWhen we pass this bill, we will answer the question of whether the United States honors its heroes, and whether the United States honors itself. Let us pass this bill, let us redeem the honor of the United States after all these years, let us show the world that the United States looks after its own. That's what this bill is. I urge everyone to support it.\n\tMr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n\tMr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I too support the goal of ensuring that the brave men and women that acted as first responders at the World Trade Center attack are fairly treated and compensated. But I rise today to oppose the troubling provisions the majority has attached to pay for this bill.\n\tThis measure would impose a 2 percent tax on goods and services that are produced or provided in certain foreign countries from firms that are based in foreign countries that are not parties to certain treaties or international agreements. It sounds complicated. But some analysis suggests that a significant majority of this tax, at least two-thirds, if not more, would be raised by taxing contracts that support American troops stationed in the Afghan and Iraqi theaters. Even more incredible, this tax could apply to American companies that are providing goods and services to our troops through local subsidiaries. Levying additional taxes on companies that support American troops is both illogical and dangerous.\n\tIn addition, there is no reason that other countries wouldn't copy this tax and impose it on our U.S. companies that are competing to sell goods and services overseas. This would hurt our U.S. economic recovery efforts and efforts to boost U.S. sales abroad and create American jobs here at home. Moreover, I have real concerns that this excise tax could be subject to legal challenge at the World Trade Organization and may be inconsistent with our G-20 commitments to avoid imposing new protectionist measures.\n\tMadam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote because of these provisions. Strangely, the proposed procurement tax doesn't include any of the exceptions included in our standard Buy America legislation, such as non-availability, unreasonable cost and inconsistency with the public interest. As a result, the bill would mandate a tax on the procurement of goods from a foreign producer even when U.S. goods aren't available.\n\tIn addition to this new tax, the bill would extend a tax on companies that have more than half their employees on certain specialized visas to work here in the United States. This tax raises independent concerns under our international obligations.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n\tMr. BRADY of Texas. Finally, I would like to have printed in the Record a letter from 10 key business associations, including the Emergency Committee for American Trade and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, that also oppose the use of these pay-for provisions.\n\n                                                December 21, 2010.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Republican Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leaders Reid, Boehner, and \n     McConnell: We are writing to urge you to remove from the \n     proposed amended version of H.R. 847 the Title III revenue \n     raisers related to international government procurement. \n     First, its purported revenue raising benefits are highly \n     questionable. Second, there is a high risk that it will \n     undermine the international competitiveness of American \n     companies and American workers.\n       Title III would impose an excise tax on companies that are \n     from foreign countries which are not members of the World \n     Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement \n     (GPA) or similar procurement arrangements ostensibly for the \n     purpose of helping finance health benefits for the valiant 9/\n     11 first responders. In reality, the U.S. federal government \n     is already prohibited from procuring from such countries, \n     except under very limited conditions--when the good or \n     service is not available in the United States or would cost \n     an unreasonable amount or if the procurement is required for \n     the national interest. Moreover, the amount of such \n     procurement is generally regarded as relatively small \n     compared to U.S. sales into the procurement markets of these \n     countries.\n       The procurement portions of this legislation would \n     undermine U.S. efforts to succeed in the international \n     economy by both inviting non-GPA countries to take reciprocal \n     action against U.S. companies seeking to participate in their \n     procurement markets and by opening the United States to \n     retaliation for violating its WTO obligations. While U.S. \n     companies certainly face significant and discriminatory \n     procurement barriers in China, India, Brazil and other \n     countries that are not part of the WTO procurement agreement, \n     U.S. companies are still selling more into those government \n     procurement markets than the United States is purchasing from \n     those countries. As a result, there would more than likely be \n     net loss for U.S. exports, U.S. companies and U.S. jobs if \n     this provision became a model for foreign governments.\n       Furthermore, the imposition of this discriminatory tax on \n     foreign companies may also violate U.S. international \n     commitments if implemented. If found to be contrary to U.S. \n     WTO commitments, other countries could end up being \n     authorized to retaliate directly against U.S. exports, \n     further undermining U.S. opportunities overseas.\n       For all of these reasons, we strongly urge you to remove \n     the Title III procurement provisions from this legislation.\n           Respectfully,\n         American Association of Exporters and Importers (AAEI);\n         Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM);\n         Business Roundtable;\n         Emergency Committee for American Trade (ECAT);\n         National Foreign Trade Council (NFTC);\n         National Retail Federation (NRF);\n         Organization for International Investment (OFII);\n         TechAmerica;\n         United States Council for International Business (USCIB);\n         U.S. Chamber of Commerce;\n         U.S.-China Business Council.\n\n\tMr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the Speaker of the House, who has done so much to make this bill possible.\n\tMs. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise to briefly congratulate and thank the Members of the New York delegation and others who helped bring this legislation to the floor in a strong bipartisan way: Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Nadler, Congressman King. Thank you. We thank you for giving us the opportunity to say ``thank you'' in a real way to our first responders, to our firefighters, to those who rushed in without question to rescue their fellow Americans, and people from all over the country as a matter of fact.\n\tThere is an exhilaration, Madam Speaker, that you see in the Chamber, because right now we know that any discussion we have ever had about 9/11 has been a discussion where we have entered holy and sacred ground, where people lost their lives. Fewer did because others were willing to risk theirs. For over 9 years we have been trying to redress the grievance that we have of people not having the health benefits and the recognition of their service, their sacrifice, and their courage.\n\tToday Mr. King, Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Nadler--I should say Congressman King, Chairman King to be--and the leadership of this House and of the United States Senate, and I thank Senator Gillibrand and Senator Schumer as well as Senator Reid and the Republican leadership in the Senate for affording us this opportunity to extend our patriotic appreciation to those whose love of our country, whose care and commitment to their fellow person, who unquestionably made sacrifices, and now, almost 9\\1/2\\ years later, more than 9 years later we finally are doing the right thing for them.\n\n                              {time}  1610\n\n\tEvery day our firefighters, our police officers, our first responders leave their homes, willing to risk their lives. Little did they know on that day many of them would not return home. How can we ever repay their sacrifice and their courage?\n\tSo, today we do so, certainly not enough, but as a token of our appreciation for what they have done to strengthen our country.\n\tAgain, I thank all of those who made this important legislation possible.\n\tMr. BURGESS. May I inquire as to how much time remains?\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining, and the gentleman from New Jersey has 10\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I yield myself 30 seconds.\n\tMadam Speaker, Congressman Brady articulated very well some of the concerns he has with the pay-for that is in this bill, raising new revenues through tariffs, and the possibility of retaliatory efforts by other countries.\n\tI would just point out, in section 4002 of the recently passed health care law last March, there is a section that calls for a Public Health and Wellness Trust Fund. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has $15 billion in a slush fund in ObamaCare. This money could have been easily used to pay for this legislation. It could have been done last April, and we wouldn't be here at the last minute trying to scrounge for capital to pay these funds.\n\tMr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney), who is the prime sponsor of the legislation and has worked so hard on this bill.\n  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)\n\tMrs. MALONEY. I thank all of my colleagues, especially the New York delegation and the Speaker and Leader Hoyer.\n\tToday, Congress repays a long overdue debt and answers the emergency calls of our ailing 9/11 first responders and survivors. This bill will save lives. It has taken too long, but help finally is here for the thousands of Americans who are suffering because of 9/11.\n\tOur bill will give support and hope to more than 36,000 Americans who are ailing because of the attacks on our Nation. It also says to future generations that if you are harmed in the service of our country, you will be taken care of.\n\tI couldn't be more proud of everyone who fought like hell to pass this bill, our Senators Gillibrand and Schumer, my good friends and coauthors Nadler and King, the 9/11 responders and survivors who are here with us, and the thousands of their brothers and sisters who could not be. John Feal, you have been a warrior for this bill. Thank you.\n\tJust after the attacks, this body came together. With this bill, we put in law that we will never forget and do whatever it takes.\n\tMadam Speaker, today, I proudly rise to support the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. Passing this bill and getting it to the President's desk will truly be a Christmas miracle.\n\tWhen Jerry Nadler and I first introduced a 9/11 bill, we never would have thought it could take 7 years or that it could be the last legislative item out the door. It should never have taken so long.\n\tA TV commentator recently made a good point when he said that Pearl Harbor was not just a Hawaii issue and neither should caring for the victims of 9/11 be a New York issue. The Twin Towers were attacked as a symbol of our Nation and the sick and injured are not just from New York. After the attacks, at least 10,000 brave men and women came from all 50 states and 428 of 435 Congressional districts.\n\tI thank my colleagues from across the country for staying to complete the last remaining gap in America's response to 9/11. Our bill will give support and hope to the more than 36,000 Americans who are ailing because of the attacks on our Nation, and it also says to future generations that if you are harmed in the service of America, you will be taken care of.\n\tI especially thank my good friends and co-authors Jerry Nadler and Peter King, the entire New York Delegation, and Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Hoyer, who all helped pass this bill in September and are working on it today. I thank Senators Gillibrand and Schumer for tireless efforts to get this bill done.\n\tThis long-overdue legislation will provide health care and financial compensation to the responders and survivors who are sick from exposure to toxins at Ground Zero. The cost of the bill has been cut almost in half to $4.3 billion from $7.4 billion. The Victim Compensation Fund will be funded for 5 years at $2.8 billion and the health programs will be fully funded for 5 years at $1.5 billion. I thank Members of the other body for coming to this bipartisan compromise.\n\tThe offset has been entirely replaced with two other offsets and in addition to fully funding this bill, the procurement payfor will put an estimated $450 million in extra revenue toward the deficit.\n\tWe are reminded this holiday season of the importance of giving. But today I ask my colleagues to remember all that the heroes of 9/11 have already given. These individuals rushed to the site of immeasurable danger and first gave their time, and later are giving up their health, and in some cases their lives.\n\tNine long years have passed since the attacks. It was never the intention of the bill's authors to make this a partisan issue and I regret that it has become wrapped in party politics.\n\tI hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can come together, just as we stood together on the steps of the Capitol the evening of September 11, 2001, to show our gratitude to the responders and survivors who have given so much to our country.\n\tThere could be no better gift to America this holiday season than helping save the lives of those who came to the aid of our Nation in a time of war.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. ENGEL. I rise in strong support of this bill. This is a fitting way to end the 111th Congress. This is the proudest moment I have had in Congress in 22 years. I believe that our hard work paid off, all of us together on the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\tI urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n\tMadam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health Compensation Act. As a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee I was proud to help shepherd this bill through the committee process and am proud to speak in support of this legislation yet again on the House floor this year.\n\tTwo days ago, I joined New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and other members of the New York delegation, and first responders to urge swift passage of this bill in the Senate.\n\tMadam speaker, it is shameful that we are approaching the 10-year anniversary of 9-11 next year and this bill still has not reached the President for his signature.\n\tNow I am here again today to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the package that we are considering today, which rectifies some of the concerns that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have expressed.\n\tThis is not a partisan issue, and the package that we consider today reflects that.\n\tPeople from all over the country joined to help after the attack without concern for their health or wellbeing. Now it is their country's time to step-up in their time of need. Victims of 9-11 continue to suffer from crippling physical ailments. They are dying and have been ignored for almost a decade. The House noticed, once already this year. I am hopeful that we can send a bill to the Senate that will pass.\n\tI look forward to casting my vote in support of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health Compensation Act and sending it back to the Senate.\n\tI am proud of the role that we played on the Health Subcommittee and the Energy and Commerce with our hearings and markups in moving this bill through. This is not a New York issue; this is an American Issue. First responders came from all parts of the country. The Federal Government falsely told everyone it was safe to return and it wasn't.\n\tToday we say thank you to our first responders--it is a fitting way to end the 111th Congress.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. CROWLEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, on September 11, my cousin, John Moran, was at Tower Two of the World Trade Center. He said, ``Let me off here. I want to try and make a difference.''\n\tWe have made a difference today in the lives of the people we're saving.\n\tToday, I rise as the cousin of Battalion Chief John Moran.\n\tMy cousin, along with almost 3,000 others, died on September 11, 2001.\n\tHis last known words were to the driver of the New York City Fire Department vehicle. As he was dropped off at World Trade Center Tower 2, John said, `Let me off here. I am going to try to make a difference.'\n\tNothing can replace the loss of my cousin or the thousands of others who were killed that day. Nothing can replace the loss of those who have perished since.\n\tBut, today we can make proud his memory and the memory of all those who served on September 11th and the days following.\n\tEnactment of the James Zadroga 9-11 Health and Compensation Act fulfills a commitment to those who served our Nation honorably, tirelessly and without pause.\n\tToday, I am proud to stand before my colleagues as the cousin of Battalion Chief John Moran, and I am proud, in the words of John, to `make a difference' for the many heroes who have suffered long enough because of their service to our great country.\n\n\n                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. A Member asking to insert remarks may include a simple declaration of sentiment toward the question under debate but should not embellish the request with extended oratory.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Ms. SLAUGHTER asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)\n\tMs. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill. A lot of us are going to sleep a lot better now knowing that this bill has been passed.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. RANGEL. All of us from the City of New York and around the Nation are so proud to be a Member of this body.\n\n\n                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair will repeat that a Member asking to insert remarks may include a simple declaration of sentiment toward the question under debate but should not embellish the request with extended oratory.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. McMahon) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. McMAHON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. McMAHON. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill on behalf of the people of Staten Island and Brooklyn, New York, all of them, and in particular Trish and Marty Fullam.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey will be charged with the time consumed.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Ackerman) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. ACKERMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Ms. ESHOO asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)\n\tMs. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this. How proud I am to have voted as a Californian for the Americans that went and took care and did their job.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will be charged with the time.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Scott) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Mr. SCOTT of Georgia asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. SCOTT of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill as a big thank you from a very, very grateful Nation.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey will be charged.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)\n\tMs. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I thank the distinguished gentleman, and I rise to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 847, to be able to thank Carolyn Maloney for the enormous work and to also cite those who I saw dying that they might live.\n\tMadam Speaker I rise today in strong support of H.R. 847, the ``James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.'' This bill has been a long time coming, and I am glad that it is finally here for us to provide medical monitoring and treatment benefits to eligible emergency responders and recovery and cleanup workers who responded to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. This legislation also allows for initial health evaluation, monitoring, and treatment benefits to residents and other building occupants and area workers in New York City who were directly impacted and adversely affected by the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\tI have met firsthand many of these first responders and workers, and I know the patriotic sacrifices they have made for their fellow Americans. These brave, selfless individuals who put aside their own needs and fears to come to the aid of their fellow Americans put their lives at risk. They ventured into the wreckage and dust of the World Trade Center, not worrying about their own well being, but rather, hoping that they could save the lives of strangers. As a result of their fearless acts, many of these emergency workers and first responders were exposed to airborne toxins and other hazards. Providing medical services, including clinical examinations, long-term health monitoring, mental health care and necessary prescription drug coverage, is the least we can do to repay them for their efforts.\n\tThe James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act will provide both initial and follow-up medical services for World Trade Center responders and workers whose physical and mental health were impacted by the 9/11 attacks. H.R. 847 will also establish an outreach program to potentially eligible individuals.\n\tSeptember 11, 2001, is a day that is indelibly etched in the psyche of every American and most of the world. Much like the unprovoked attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, September 11 is a day that will live in infamy. And as much as Pearl Harbor changed the course of world history by precipitating the global struggle between totalitarian fascism and representative democracy, the transformative impact of September 11 in the course of American and human history is indelible. September 11 was not only the beginning of the Global War on Terror, but moreover, it was the day of innocence lost for a new generation of Americans.\n\tJust like my fellow Americans, I remember September 11 as vividly as if it was yesterday. In my mind's eye, I can still remember being mesmerized by the television as the two airliners crashed into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, and I remember the sense of terror we experienced when we realized that this was no accident, that we had been attacked, and that the world as we know it had changed forever. The moment in which the Twin Towers collapsed and the nearly 3,000 innocent Americans died haunts me until this day.\n\tAt this moment, I decided that the protection of our homeland would be at the forefront of my legislative agenda. I knew that all of our collective efforts as Americans would all be in vain if we did not achieve our most important priority: the security of our nation. Accordingly, I became then and continue to this day to be an active and engaged Member of the Committee on Homeland Security who considers our national security paramount.\n\tOur nation's collective response to the tragedy of September 11 exemplified what has been true of the American people since the inception of our Republic--in times of crisis, we come together and always persevere. Despite the depths of our anguish on the preceding day, on September 12, the American people demonstrated their compassion and solidarity for one another as we began the process of response, recovery, and rebuilding. We transcended our differences and came together to honor the sacrifices and losses sustained by the countless victims of September 11. Let us honor those who served and sacrificed by passing H.R. 847.\n\tMadam Speaker, as I stand here today, my heart still grieves for those who perished on flights United Airlines 93, American Airlines 77, American Airlines 11, and United Airlines 175. When the sun rose on the morning of September 11, none of us knew that it would end in an inferno in the magnificent World Trade Center Towers in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, DC, and in the grassy fields of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. How I wish we could have hugged and kissed and held each of the victims one last time.\n\tI stand here remembering those who still suffer, whose hearts still ache over the loss of so many innocent and interrupted lives. My prayer is that for those who lost a father, a mother, a husband, a wife, a child, or a friend will in the days and years ahead take comfort in the certain knowledge that they have gone on to claim the greatest prize, a place in the Lord's loving arms. And down here on the ground, their memory will never die so long as any of the many of us who loved them lives.\n\tAgain, I would like to reiterate my strong support for H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, for it is important that we take care of those who take care of us in our time of need.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey will be charged.\n\tMr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King).\n\tMr. KING of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I will keep my remarks very brief.\n\tI thank the Congress of the United States for what it is going to do today. Especially I want to thank Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler for the tremendous work they have done on this bill over the years from the very start. I want to thank Congressman Vito Fossella, who was also an original cosponsor of this. I want to thank the Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi, for doing so much to bring this bill forward, and also the Republican leader, who this summer managed to have this bill come up in a way that was not going to be disruptive at all.\n\n                              {time}  1620\n\n\tI want to thank all the members of the New York delegation. Most importantly, I want to thank the firefighters, the police officers, the construction workers, and all of those who came forward to answer the Nation's call on September 11. This is a great victory for the American people. It's a great victory for the Congress of the United States. And it sends a signal that we stand by those who come to our Nation's defense in time of trouble and, indeed, in time of war, because this was the first battle of the great war of the 21st century.\n\tMr. PALLONE. I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n\tThis is an important bill. It's something that should have been done a long time ago. I credit a former New York fireman, Richard Lasky, who is now my fire chief in Lewisville, Texas, for helping me understand the importance of this bill as it has gone forward. It has been difficult. In my opinion, there were better ways to do this bill, but it's before us today.\n\tMr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, we need to ensure that the first responders and individuals who were in the vicinity of the World Trade Center have access to the specialized medical treatment they need and that means ensuring these programs are properly funded.\n\tH.R. 847 accomplishes that goal and I am proud to be a cosponser of this bill.\n\tMr. JOHNSON of Illinois. I find it appalling that a bill of this magnitude was amended in the Senate just hours before the House was asked to vote on it, with no Member having had the chance to review and deliberate on what we were voting on and enacting into law. When earlier versions of this bill were brought to the floor I had some major reservations and with no way to know if all of these were addressed I would not feel comfortable voting yes or no on this bill.\n\tMr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to the Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. As a cosponsor of the House bill, I urge passage of this important bill.\n\tToday, we have the opportunity to honor the rescue and recovery workers who served our nation after the devastating attacks at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and, more important than empty honor, to provide for their care. My district suffered casualities that day and nine years later, the memory of that terrible day is still fresh in our minds.\n\tAlong with the victims of 9/11, there were thousands of rescue and recovery workers who came to the aid of our nation that day. These brave women and men rushed to Ground Zero to help the fallen and to participate in the clean-up effort without thinking about their health or safety. These workers were exposed to environmental hazards and have developed significant respiratory illnesses, chronic infections, and other medical conditions. Further, many first responders are only now being diagnosed with illnesses that are related to their exposure at Ground Zero.\n\tThis bill would create the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) that would provide medical monitoring and treatment benefits to first responders and workers who were directly affected by the attacks. Additionally, the program would establish education and outreach programs and conduct research on physical and mental health conditions related to the 9/11 attacks. The WTCHP program would serve more than 75,000 survivors, recovery workers, and members of the affected communities.\n\tAdditionally, this bill provides long-term health care and compensation for thousands of responders and survivors. By passing this bill, we will be paying tribute to the sacrifice and courage of these women and men and we will be paying a debt. This bill will be paid for with a partnership with New York City and by reducing government procurement payments and the extension of fees for outsourcing companies.\n\tUnfortunately, this bill is a weaker version of the bill that I cosponsored and that the House passed in September. The bill caps federal funding for health programs over five years and allows first responders only five years to file claims. Unfortunately, some put politics over these brave first responders. Although this bill is a reduced version of the original bill, we must honor the rescue and recovery workers by providing them with the much needed health care. We cannot let our first responders down.\n\tMr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, I was absent for legislative business and missed rollcall vote 663 on December 21, 2010, and rollcall vote 664 on December 22, 2010. Had I been present, I would have voted ``yes'' on H.R. 6547, the Protecting Students from Sexual and Violent Predators Act, and ``no'' on rollcall vote 664 (H.R. 847).\n\tThe vote I wish to discuss is the bill H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. Without a doubt, Republicans and Democrats can agree that both the victims of the attacks on September 11, 2001, and the first responders who bravely served following the attacks deserve to be fairly treated and compensated. However, this bill would create a new health care entitlement, the World Trade Center Health Program, while also extending eligibility for compensation under the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. As a result, had I been present, I would have voted against passage of the bill.\n\tSince the terrorist attacks occurred nearly nine years ago, I have supported legislation to ensure that these individuals are cared for and receive access to the services they deserve. However, rather than working with Republicans to craft a bill which truly addressed the shortcomings in care provided to those directly impacted by the September 11th terrorist attacks, the Majority instead rushed this bill to the floor in the waning hours of the 111th Congress, refusing to allow an open debate or consider amendments.\n\tThe result is a deeply flawed bill. H.R. 847 creates yet another mandatory spending program--increasing spending by $4.2 billion dollars over 10 years--and paying for it by an excise tax on foreign manufacturers, an extension of Travel Promotion Act fees, and the extension of HI-B visa fees.\n\tThere is no doubt that we owe a debt of gratitude to those who came to the rescue of countless individuals following the attacks on September 11, 2001, but these provisions distort that noble goal. At a time when our budget deficit is $1.3 trillion and our national debt stands at $13.8 trillion, we must accurately account for those programs that take priority. I remain hopeful that as the 112th Congress convenes, my colleagues and I can work together to reform some of my concerns with this proposal and truly provide the services these first responders deserve.\n\tMrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, with the ninth anniversary of September 11th having passed, it is important to remember not only those who were lost that tragic day, but also the sense of purpose and togetherness that shined in the aftermath of, no doubt, one of the most difficult days in our nation's history. Heroic first responders deserve utmost recognition for selflessly digging through the ruins of Lower Manhattan in hope of finding survivors. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, a bill that I am proud to be an original cosponsor of, provides just that by extending and improving protections and services to individuals directly impacted by the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.\n\tSince our inception, we, as a nation, have grown stronger by protecting and honoring the sacrifices of our citizenry. This legislation is the embodiment of that mantra. As a New Yorker, not a day passes without thought of the horrific attacks of September 11th, this legislation will no doubt go a long way to provide first-responders with peace of mind.\n\tDuring House floor consideration and passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act on Wednesday, I was unavoidably absent from Washington due to a family health emergency. I have had the privilege of working closely with my New York colleagues in both the House and Senate on this legislation, and I am extraordinarily happy that the Congress was able to pass this bill before the adjournment of the 111th Congress.\n\tMr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of legislation that would help thousands of first responders who were exposed to hazardous health conditions in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks.\n\tMany first responders bravely answered the call of duty and rushed to the scene of the attacks. While they were helping out the victims, the responders unknowingly were exposed to long-term physical and mental health problems due to the residual dust, toxins, and chemicals from the attacks. Congress and the federal government have an obligation and a responsibility to care and help those who responded to the September 11th attacks.\n\tMadam Speaker, let us not forget the sacrifice and service of those brave individuals who responded to one of the worst attacks in American history. I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate were able to come to a bipartisan agreement on this bill. I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation so that the thousands of 9/11 responders can get the help they need.\n\tMr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today, nine years after the tragic events of September 11, to recognize the passage of a bill that will allow the first responders who rushed to the scene that day to now be able to get the health care resources they need.\n\tToday, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate approved an amended version, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act that would provide medical treatment for the ailing first responders and recovery workers who were exposed to toxic dust following the collapse of the Twin Towers in New York City on September 11, 2001.\n\tThis victory is for what is right; a long overdue thank you to those who rushed in to help after what was one of our nation's biggest tragedies. After nine long years, these unsung heroes and their families no longer have to worry about how they are going to get the care and resources they so desperately need.\n\tThe Zadraga bill originally passed the House in September, but had been held up in the Senate due to various partisan concerns. It now goes to President Barack Obama, who is expected to sign the bill into law before the end of the holiday season.\n\tThis should have never been about the money, but about what we should do to honor those who thought of their country first and not themselves. They answered the call when their country needed them and we are all a better nation for it.\n\tThanks to the hard work of so many people--from legislators, like our Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the New York Congressional Delegation and House Leadership, to the NYS AFL-CIO President Dennis Hughes, the 32nd Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano and the countless union officials and 911 families that traveled to Washington to lobby on the bill's behalf--these patriotic Americans can spend the holiday seasons with some peace of mind.\n\tWhat the law would do: Under an agreement worked out by New York Senators Charles Schumer and Kristen Gillibrand, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act would: provide a total of $4.3 billion in funding for the health and compensation titles of the bill; cap federal funding for the health program over five years at $1.5 billion (New York City will contribute 10% of the cost). Any funds not spent in the first five years may be carried over and expended in the sixth year of the program; reopen the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) for five years to file claims, with payments to be made over six years. Fund the VCF at $2.8 billion for six years, with $.8 billion available for payments in the first five years and $2.0 billion available for payment in year six. Claims will be paid in 2 installments--one payment in the first five years, and a second payment in the sixth year of the program; the pay for the House-passed version of the bill has been replaced by a 2 percent fee on government procurement from foreign companies located in non-GPA countries and a one-year extension of H-B 1 and L-1 Visa fees for outsourcing companies. These are estimated by CBO to collect $4.59 billion over the 10-year scoring period for the bill.\n\tOthers changes made in the bill to address Republican concerns: requiring that the Centers of Excellence report claims data to HHS so that costs and utilization of services can be fully monitored; specifying the non-treatment services furnished by Centers of Excellence to be funded under the health program (e.g., outreach, social services, data collection, and development of treatment protocols); authorizing the World Trade Center Program Administrator to designate the Veteran's Administration as a provider for WTC health services; directing the Special Master to develop rules to implement the VCF within 180 days of passage of the legislation.\n\tMr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise yet again in the strongest possible support of the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, H.R. 847.\n\tToday, we must show the American people that their representatives can put away their differences and work together to pass this bill. Over the past few weeks, this clearly was not the case. Some Members of Congress have played political games with this legislation, delaying its passage for dubious reasons and causing the measure to be watered down. The sick and injured don't care about offsets and they don't care whether this is a $6 billion bill or a $7 billion bill. They just care about getting the medical care they need, the medical care they rightly deserve.\n\tSo Madam Speaker, we are here for the third and I hope final time on the floor of the House to consider doing the decent thing: helping the living victims of 9/11 who continue to suffer the terrible effects of that day. The Federal Government has not stepped up enough to help the responders, volunteers, workers and residents that went to Ground Zero during and after the horrific 9/11 attack. This Congress has not acted to help these victims on a permanent basis--we have the opportunity to do that today. Tragically, some of the very people that we want to help with this legislation have already died. Thousands of Americans who responded need medical treatment now. Thousands more will need treatment in the future.\n\tSo, Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act so that all the victims of 9/11 will receive the medical care and help they need and deserve. Let's pass this bill.\n\tMr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. This bill will provide the needed assistance to the brave men and women who have become ill due to the dangerous toxins they inhaled while risking their lives to help out the city of New York during that tragic time in September of 2001. This is a bipartisan bill and should be supported by all Members of Congress.\n\tThese heroes risked their lives to assist their fellow Americans and their efforts will never go unnoticed. This bill will allow health benefits to a wide range of first responders such as firefighters, construction workers, residents, area workers and even school children--all of whom have been affected by the toxins that filled the air after the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001.\n\tWe all witnessed the terrible attacks on America, September 11, 2001 and we also witnessed the acts of bravery by our first responders. I support the passage of the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.\n\tMr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. Every American remembers the day the Twin Towers fell and the unparalleled heroism of the first responders who saved countless lives without any regard for their own. They showed courage in the face of terror and strength in a path of destruction. Too many of these brave men and women didn't make it out of the wreckage in time. Those who did returned every day for months, sifting through rubble, recovering victims and restoring order to Ground Zero with little consideration for their own welfare or safety.\n\tTragically, many of these selfless workers are now suffering chronic, disabling health conditions as a direct result of injuries or toxic exposure sustained at the site. The bill before us creates a program to provide medical services and health monitoring for first responders and others who have medical conditions related to the September 11 terrorist attacks. Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this measure and finally show these heroes the same honor and respect they showed us, our families, our friends and our country.\n\tMr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I am proud to say that we are finally doing the right thing to support our heroes from 9/11. The agreement we have here today is much less than we originally hoped for--but more than four and a half years after the death of NYPD Det. James Zadroga--I am here to say that we need to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act right now because we are losing these brave souls as we speak.\n\tI'm sad to say its now been nine years since 9/11 and it has taken this long to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act--nine years is too long to wait and watch as our first responders from that day continue to suffer physically and emotionally--nine years is late, BUT its not too late to do the right thing. We need to pass this bill and we need to pass it now. Nine years ago we gave those brave souls the `all clear' sign, but we now know that we were exposing those men and women to a poisonous dust that would stay with them for the rest of their lives.\n\tI am proud to say that we found a way to pay for this bill so that we can do the right thing for our 9/11 workers AND for our children who will bear the debt of the decisions we make today.\n\tLet me be clear, this isn't just a bill for New York and New Jersey--this is a bill for all Americans. We know that people from all 50 states were in lower Manhattan on or after 9/11 and now are facing serious health concerns--there are 435 Congressional Districts and 431 of them are represented by the names of constituents on the World Trade Center Health Registry.\n\tAfter 9/11 we all said we would be there for these brave first responders--but today if we vote against this bill we are asking those same brave individuals to come to Washington, year after year to fight for their health benefits--do we expect them to come here ten years from now? By then it may be too late for many of these men and women who responded to their nation's call of duty.\n\tI urge all my colleagues to support the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act--once and for all let us stand up for these brave Americans.\n\tMrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, today the House will consider the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.\n\tMore than 70,000 Americans from every state descended upon ground zero to help recover and rebuild after 9/11. Some have died from illnesses as a result and more than 17,000 who are ill lack the care they need.\n\tJust as we provide medical care for our troops, we must care for those who heroically responded.\n\tPassage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act is a milestone for our nation, as we finally fulfill our obligation to those who sacrificed so much for us. Our nation owes a debt of gratitude that can never be fully repaid to the September 11 responders who died or were sickened as a result of their brave and selfless actions.\n\tNearly all of us represent a responder, and almost nine years later, have a duty to do what is right--vote for this bill today.\n\tMr. BURGESS. I yield back the balance of my time and urge support of the bill.\n\tMr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I would urge passage of this bill and send it to the President.\n\tI yield back the balance of my time.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n\tPursuant to the order of the House of today, the previous question is ordered.\n\tThe question is on the motion by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n\tThe question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.\n\tMr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n\tThe yeas and nays were ordered.\n\tThe vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 206, nays 60, not voting 168, as follows:\n\n

Madam Speaker, I have an amenment at the desk.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment offered by Mr. Van Hollen:\n       Page 36, strike line 20 and all that follows through page \n     68, line 23.\n       Page 69, line 1, strike ``TITLE III'' and insert ``TITLE \n     II''.\n       Page 69, line 3, strike ``SEC. 301.'' and insert ``SEC. \n     201.''.\n       Page 69, line 7, strike ``SEC. 302.'' and insert ``SEC. \n     202.''.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, as Chairman of the Committee on Oversight \nand Government Reform, I rise in strong support of S. 372, the \nWhistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.\n  I want to congratulate Senator Akaka and the other Senate sponsors of \nS. 372 for their efforts. I commend the persistence they have \ndemonstrated in championing this good government bill.\n  I'm proud to be an original co-sponsor of H.R. 1507, the bipartisan \ncompanion bill to S. 372. H.R. 1507 was introduced by Representative \nVan Hollen last year. I want to thank Mr. Van Hollen and all the co-\nsponsors of H.R. 1507, including Mr. Platts of Pennsylvania. They have \ndemonstrated exceptional leadership in support of government \nwhistleblowers.\n  This legislation is long overdue. Different versions of this \nlegislation have been introduced in every Congress for the last 12 \nyears.\n  The Oversight Committee has long-recognized that enhancing \nwhistleblower protections will help the Congress to fulfill its role in \nbringing about more honest, accountable, and effective government for \nthe American people.\n  Federal employees are often the first to witness abuses or misconduct \nthat presents a risk to the taxpayers. Providing strong protections for \nthose who disclose misconduct helps to promote a more accountable and \ntransparent federal bureaucracy. This legislation provides a means of \nsecuring justice to those individuals who are punished for doing the \nright thing.\n  During Committee hearings on this legislation, we heard from \ncourageous government workers who risked their careers to promote the \ncommon good.\n  Mr. Franz Gayl, a civilian employee in the Marine Corps, testified \nabout the retaliation he faced. Mr. Gayl blew the whistle on \nsignificant delays in the acquisition process--delays that were costing \nMarines their lives in Iraq. Defense Secretary Gates ultimately agreed \nwith the proposals put forth by Mr. Gayl on troop protection. However, \nMr. Gayl remains at risk of losing his job. This bill will help Mr. \nGayl, and many others like him.\n  We have heard from dozens of whistleblowers who support this bill. I \nwant to acknowledge one in particular. Mr. Robert Maclean is a former \nFederal Air Marshal who was fired after disclosing a threat to aviation \nsafety. Mr. MacLean's case has been lingering for far too long under \nthe current system. He has championed this bill because he knows first \nhand that the current system is broken. I thank him for his efforts on \nbehalf of the country.\n  As many of you remember, the House of Representatives passed similar \nlegislation by a 331-94 vote in the 110th Congress. The House also \nunanimously passed whistleblower protections as an amendment to the \nRecovery Act at the beginning of this Congress. Unfortunately, that \namendment was stripped out in conference with the Senate.\n  After a long process in the Senate, this bill comes before the House \nfor a third time. I am pleased the House-Senate compromise we are \nconsidering includes important provisions from the House bill. For the \nfirst time, the bill will allow Federal workers the right to a jury \ntrial in Federal Court under some circumstances.\n  The legislation we're considering today is a good compromise. \nHowever, I'm disappointed that the Senate did not agree to extend \nsimilar\n\n[[Page H8974]]\n\nwhistleblower protections to government contractors.\n  I am also disappointed that we could not come to an agreement with \nthe Republican side on extending protections to employees in the \nIntelligence Community.\n  In spite of the bill's imperfections and limitations, I \nwholeheartedly endorse this agreement. This is a good government bill \nthat will help to curb waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I encourage the Senate to act quickly on our modifications, and send \nthe bill to President Obama without further delay.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 372, \nthe Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.\n  I would like to thank Senator Akaka, and the other Senators who have \nworked so hard to advance this bill to provide stronger whistleblower \nprotections. This effort has spanned over a decade, and I am hopeful \nthat it will come to a successful conclusion today.\n  Whistleblower protections are a critical component in bringing about \na more effective and accountable government. As the Congress considers \nproposals to address the deficit, our work needs to be pursued on \nnumerous fronts. Whistleblowers risk their careers to challenge abuses, \nand gross waste of government resources. They deserve to be protected \nso they can carry out their important work conscientiously, and with \nthe taxpayers best interests in mind.\n  By providing new rights, remedies, and protections for government \nwhistleblowers, this bill takes an important step toward curbing waste, \nfraud, and abuse. This will aid our deficit reduction efforts.\n  S. 372, as passed by the Senate, reflects a bipartisan compromise \nbetween the original Senate bill and H.R. 1507, legislation I sponsored \nwith Representatives Platts, Chairman Towns, and Representatives Waxman \nand Braley.\n  The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has reported similar \nlegislation, on a bipartisan basis, in each of the last two Congresses. \nThe House of Representatives has twice passed similar bills, once in \n2007 with 331 votes and again as a bipartisan amendment to the Recovery \nAct.\n  Unfortunately, H.R. 1507 was stripped out of the Recovery Act during \nthe conference with the Senate.\n  Over the course of the last two years, we have worked with the Obama \nadministration and the Senate to work out a compromise that retains the \ncore protections for federal workers and national security personnel \nthat were included in bills passed by the House in 2007 and 2009.\n  The bill before us today restores Congress' intent to protect an \nemployee for any lawful disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, or \nillegality. S. 372 addresses several court decisions that have limited \nthe protections Congress made available to federal employees under the \n1989 Whistleblower Protection Act. These decisions quite frankly have \ngutted the protections available to federal employees.\n  This bill provides the opportunity for whistleblower cases before the \nMerit Systems Protection Board to be reviewed by all of the Federal \nCircuits. Moreover it provides an opportunity for certain cases to \nreceive jury trials. This expansion of opportunity for judicial review \nis critical. While I would have preferred broader criteria for review \nand that this enhanced judicial review be made permanent, I have \nreluctantly accepted the changes made by the Senate to narrow the \ncircumstances under which cases can receive judicial review and to \nsunset these provisions in 5 years.\n  This legislation also protects federal employees for disclosures \nrelated to distortions of government science and extends to employees \nof the Transportation Security Administration.\n  S. 372 is a good bipartisan, bicameral compromise, and should be sent \nto the President without further delay. This bill, as passed by the \nSenate, included important protections for national security employees. \nThese provisions had been included with significant input from the \nnational security community and passed the Senate by unanimous consent. \nUnfortunately, jurisdictional disputes within the House have prompted \nus to remove these protections in the interest of passing the rest of \nthese essential reforms. I regret the loss of these provisions and look \nforward to working with incoming Chairman Issa to advance these \nprotections for national security employees in the next Congress.\n  I want to thank my cosponsor and partner on this bill, Todd Platts \nfor his assistance and strong leadership. I also want to thank Chairman \nTowns and Ranking Member Issa for their strong support throughout this \nCongress to advance this important legislation.\n  I'll close by simply noting that this legislation is long overdue. \nWithout whistleblowers and the unfiltered information that government \ninsiders can provide, the oversight functions vested in Congress would \nbe seriously compromised, as would our efforts to rein in the federal \nbudget deficit. I encourage all Members to support this important bill.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of \nthe S. 372, the ``Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.''\n  S. 372 amends the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) and strengthens \nthe rights and protections of Federal employees who come forward to \ndisclose government waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. The House \nhas passed similar legislation on a bipartisan basis in 2007 (H.R. 985) \nand 2009, as an amendment to the Recovery Act.\n  I am a staunch advocate for protecting Federal employees from \nretaliation when they come forward to disclose waste, fraud, abuse and \nmismanagement. Whistleblowers are among the most patriotic and \nconscientious Federal employees. They take great risks to make certain \nthat our Federal Government is functioning properly and effectively for \nall taxpayers. They serve as indispensable guardians for the efficient \nuse of taxpayer funds. This is an especially valuable service during \nthis vital period of national economic recovery.\n  Unhindered exposure of waste, fraud and abuse identifies expensive \nbreak-downs in the functioning of our Federal Government while also \npreserving the Federal funds we require to effectively serve our \ncitizens. In some instances, conscientious whistleblowers protect \nothers from harm and actually save lives. So, we must protect these \nattentive Federal employees who expose systemic lapses and protect the \nintegrity and proper functioning of our Federal Government.\n  Discrimination and retaliation against Federal employees contravenes \nFederal law, puts the public at risk, and costs taxpayers millions of \ndollars. Retaliation and discrimination also breed a myriad of other \ncosts that cannot be quantified in the toll exacted on the health, \nmorale, and well-being of Federal employees who are entrusted to \nprotect and serve our Nation. Federal managers and supervisors who \nengage in discriminatory conduct must be judiciously and expeditiously \ndisciplined.\n  S. 372, the ``Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010'' \nenhances the protection of Federal employees. It restores Congress' \nintent to protect an employee who makes any lawful disclosure of waste, \nfraud, abuse, or illegality. S. 372 addresses court decisions that have \nlimited the protections Congress made available to Federal employees \nunder the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act.\n  This legislation will improve the administration of justice. It will \nallow non-intelligence whistleblowers to bring their cases before a \njury under certain circumstances. The current administrative system \nwill be further strengthened by allowing a limited number of more \ncomplex whistleblower cases to be considered in Federal court by \njuries. The bill also will allow whistleblower appeals to be heard by \nthe regional Federal appellate courts.\n  This bill further expands upon the protections for Federal employees \nin additional necessary and meaningful ways. It extends whistleblower \nprotections to employees at the Transportation Security Administration. \nIt clarifies that whistleblowers may disclose evidence of censorship of \nscientific or technical information under the same standards that apply \nto disclosures of other kinds of waste, fraud, and abuse. It enhances \nprotections for employees facing retaliation after refusing to violate \nthe law or participating in an Inspector General investigation.\n  This legislation will codify and strengthen rules that preempt \nagencies from issuing regulations or directives that interfere with \nwhistleblower protections. I am also pleased to say, that for the first \ntime, S. 327 will make compensatory damage awards available to \nwhistleblowers. This is a key component in ensuring a whistleblower is \nmade whole after suffering retaliation. This bill will also make it \neasier for the Office of Special Counsel to discipline agency managers \nwho are found to retaliate against employees.\n  It is my fervent expectation that this legislation will meaningfully \nadvance our national integrity by deterring Federal managers from \nviolating the civil rights and civil liberties of their fellow Federal \nworkers, especially whistleblowers.\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with me today and vote in favor of S. \n327.\n  The bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third \ntime, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2010\n\n\tMr. VAN HOLLEN.

Madam Speaker, I have an amenment at the desk.\n\tThe Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment offered by Mr. Van Hollen:\n       Page 36, strike line 20 and all that follows through page \n     68, line 23.\n       Page 69, line 1, strike ``TITLE III'' and insert ``TITLE \n     II''.\n       Page 69, line 3, strike ``SEC. 301.'' and insert ``SEC. \n     201.''.\n       Page 69, line 7, strike ``SEC. 302.'' and insert ``SEC. \n     202.''.\n\tThe amendment was agreed to.\n\tMr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, as Chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, I rise in strong support of S. 372, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.\n\tI want to congratulate Senator Akaka and the other Senate sponsors of S. 372 for their efforts. I commend the persistence they have demonstrated in championing this good government bill.\n\tI'm proud to be an original co-sponsor of H.R. 1507, the bipartisan companion bill to S. 372. H.R. 1507 was introduced by Representative Van Hollen last year. I want to thank Mr. Van Hollen and all the co-sponsors of H.R. 1507, including Mr. Platts of Pennsylvania. They have demonstrated exceptional leadership in support of government whistleblowers.\n\tThis legislation is long overdue. Different versions of this legislation have been introduced in every Congress for the last 12 years.\n\tThe Oversight Committee has long-recognized that enhancing whistleblower protections will help the Congress to fulfill its role in bringing about more honest, accountable, and effective government for the American people.\n\tFederal employees are often the first to witness abuses or misconduct that presents a risk to the taxpayers. Providing strong protections for those who disclose misconduct helps to promote a more accountable and transparent federal bureaucracy. This legislation provides a means of securing justice to those individuals who are punished for doing the right thing.\n\tDuring Committee hearings on this legislation, we heard from courageous government workers who risked their careers to promote the common good.\n\tMr. Franz Gayl, a civilian employee in the Marine Corps, testified about the retaliation he faced. Mr. Gayl blew the whistle on significant delays in the acquisition process--delays that were costing Marines their lives in Iraq. Defense Secretary Gates ultimately agreed with the proposals put forth by Mr. Gayl on troop protection. However, Mr. Gayl remains at risk of losing his job. This bill will help Mr. Gayl, and many others like him.\n\tWe have heard from dozens of whistleblowers who support this bill. I want to acknowledge one in particular. Mr. Robert Maclean is a former Federal Air Marshal who was fired after disclosing a threat to aviation safety. Mr. MacLean's case has been lingering for far too long under the current system. He has championed this bill because he knows first hand that the current system is broken. I thank him for his efforts on behalf of the country.\n\tAs many of you remember, the House of Representatives passed similar legislation by a 331-94 vote in the 110th Congress. The House also unanimously passed whistleblower protections as an amendment to the Recovery Act at the beginning of this Congress. Unfortunately, that amendment was stripped out in conference with the Senate.\n\tAfter a long process in the Senate, this bill comes before the House for a third time. I am pleased the House-Senate compromise we are considering includes important provisions from the House bill. For the first time, the bill will allow Federal workers the right to a jury trial in Federal Court under some circumstances.\n\tThe legislation we're considering today is a good compromise. However, I'm disappointed that the Senate did not agree to extend similar whistleblower protections to government contractors.\n\tI am also disappointed that we could not come to an agreement with the Republican side on extending protections to employees in the Intelligence Community.\n\tIn spite of the bill's imperfections and limitations, I wholeheartedly endorse this agreement. This is a good government bill that will help to curb waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government.\n\tI encourage the Senate to act quickly on our modifications, and send the bill to President Obama without further delay.\n\tMr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 372, the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.\n\tI would like to thank Senator Akaka, and the other Senators who have worked so hard to advance this bill to provide stronger whistleblower protections. This effort has spanned over a decade, and I am hopeful that it will come to a successful conclusion today.\n\tWhistleblower protections are a critical component in bringing about a more effective and accountable government. As the Congress considers proposals to address the deficit, our work needs to be pursued on numerous fronts. Whistleblowers risk their careers to challenge abuses, and gross waste of government resources. They deserve to be protected so they can carry out their important work conscientiously, and with the taxpayers best interests in mind.\n\tBy providing new rights, remedies, and protections for government whistleblowers, this bill takes an important step toward curbing waste, fraud, and abuse. This will aid our deficit reduction efforts.\n\tS. 372, as passed by the Senate, reflects a bipartisan compromise between the original Senate bill and H.R. 1507, legislation I sponsored with Representatives Platts, Chairman Towns, and Representatives Waxman and Braley.\n\tThe Oversight and Government Reform Committee has reported similar legislation, on a bipartisan basis, in each of the last two Congresses. The House of Representatives has twice passed similar bills, once in 2007 with 331 votes and again as a bipartisan amendment to the Recovery Act.\n\tUnfortunately, H.R. 1507 was stripped out of the Recovery Act during the conference with the Senate.\n\tOver the course of the last two years, we have worked with the Obama administration and the Senate to work out a compromise that retains the core protections for federal workers and national security personnel that were included in bills passed by the House in 2007 and 2009.\n\tThe bill before us today restores Congress' intent to protect an employee for any lawful disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, or illegality. S. 372 addresses several court decisions that have limited the protections Congress made available to federal employees under the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act. These decisions quite frankly have gutted the protections available to federal employees.\n\tThis bill provides the opportunity for whistleblower cases before the Merit Systems Protection Board to be reviewed by all of the Federal Circuits. Moreover it provides an opportunity for certain cases to receive jury trials. This expansion of opportunity for judicial review is critical. While I would have preferred broader criteria for review and that this enhanced judicial review be made permanent, I have reluctantly accepted the changes made by the Senate to narrow the circumstances under which cases can receive judicial review and to sunset these provisions in 5 years.\n\tThis legislation also protects federal employees for disclosures related to distortions of government science and extends to employees of the Transportation Security Administration.\n\tS. 372 is a good bipartisan, bicameral compromise, and should be sent to the President without further delay. This bill, as passed by the Senate, included important protections for national security employees. These provisions had been included with significant input from the national security community and passed the Senate by unanimous consent. Unfortunately, jurisdictional disputes within the House have prompted us to remove these protections in the interest of passing the rest of these essential reforms. I regret the loss of these provisions and look forward to working with incoming Chairman Issa to advance these protections for national security employees in the next Congress.\n\tI want to thank my cosponsor and partner on this bill, Todd Platts for his assistance and strong leadership. I also want to thank Chairman Towns and Ranking Member Issa for their strong support throughout this Congress to advance this important legislation.\n\tI'll close by simply noting that this legislation is long overdue. Without whistleblowers and the unfiltered information that government insiders can provide, the oversight functions vested in Congress would be seriously compromised, as would our efforts to rein in the federal budget deficit. I encourage all Members to support this important bill.\n\tMs. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the S. 372, the ``Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.''\n\tS. 372 amends the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) and strengthens the rights and protections of Federal employees who come forward to disclose government waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. The House has passed similar legislation on a bipartisan basis in 2007 (H.R. 985) and 2009, as an amendment to the Recovery Act.\n\tI am a staunch advocate for protecting Federal employees from retaliation when they come forward to disclose waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. Whistleblowers are among the most patriotic and conscientious Federal employees. They take great risks to make certain that our Federal Government is functioning properly and effectively for all taxpayers. They serve as indispensable guardians for the efficient use of taxpayer funds. This is an especially valuable service during this vital period of national economic recovery.\n\tUnhindered exposure of waste, fraud and abuse identifies expensive break-downs in the functioning of our Federal Government while also preserving the Federal funds we require to effectively serve our citizens. In some instances, conscientious whistleblowers protect others from harm and actually save lives. So, we must protect these attentive Federal employees who expose systemic lapses and protect the integrity and proper functioning of our Federal Government.\n\tDiscrimination and retaliation against Federal employees contravenes Federal law, puts the public at risk, and costs taxpayers millions of dollars. Retaliation and discrimination also breed a myriad of other costs that cannot be quantified in the toll exacted on the health, morale, and well-being of Federal employees who are entrusted to protect and serve our Nation. Federal managers and supervisors who engage in discriminatory conduct must be judiciously and expeditiously disciplined.\n\tS. 372, the ``Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010'' enhances the protection of Federal employees. It restores Congress' intent to protect an employee who makes any lawful disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, or illegality. S. 372 addresses court decisions that have limited the protections Congress made available to Federal employees under the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act.\n\tThis legislation will improve the administration of justice. It will allow non-intelligence whistleblowers to bring their cases before a jury under certain circumstances. The current administrative system will be further strengthened by allowing a limited number of more complex whistleblower cases to be considered in Federal court by juries. The bill also will allow whistleblower appeals to be heard by the regional Federal appellate courts.\n\tThis bill further expands upon the protections for Federal employees in additional necessary and meaningful ways. It extends whistleblower protections to employees at the Transportation Security Administration. It clarifies that whistleblowers may disclose evidence of censorship of scientific or technical information under the same standards that apply to disclosures of other kinds of waste, fraud, and abuse. It enhances protections for employees facing retaliation after refusing to violate the law or participating in an Inspector General investigation.\n\tThis legislation will codify and strengthen rules that preempt agencies from issuing regulations or directives that interfere with whistleblower protections. I am also pleased to say, that for the first time, S. 327 will make compensatory damage awards available to whistleblowers. This is a key component in ensuring a whistleblower is made whole after suffering retaliation. This bill will also make it easier for the Office of Special Counsel to discipline agency managers who are found to retaliate against employees.\n\tIt is my fervent expectation that this legislation will meaningfully advance our national integrity by deterring Federal managers from violating the civil rights and civil liberties of their fellow Federal workers, especially whistleblowers.\n\tI ask my colleagues to stand with me today and vote in favor of S. 327.\n\tThe bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Chris Van Hollen", "Edolphus Towns", "Sheila Jackson Lee"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "156 Cong.

PAYGO COMPLIANCE.\n\n       The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of \n     complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall \n     be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \n     ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, \n     submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the \n     Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such \n     statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, the Removal Clarification Act \nof 2010 will enable Federal officials--Federal officers, in the words \nof the statute--to remove cases filed against them to Federal court in \naccordance with the spirit and intent of the current Federal officer \nremoval statute.\n  Under the Federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. 1442(a), Federal \nofficers are able to remove a case out of State court and into Federal \ncourt when it involves the Federal officer's exercise of his or her \nofficial responsibilities.\n  However, more than 40 States have pre-suit discovery procedures that \nrequire individuals to submit to deposition or respond to discovery \nrequests even when a civil action has not yet been filed.\n  Courts are split on whether the current Federal officer removal \nstatute applies to pre-suit discovery. This means that Federal officers \ncan be forced to litigate in State court despite the Federal statute's \ncontrary intent.\n  This bill will clarify that a Federal officer may remove any legally \nenforceable demand for his or her testimony or documents, if the basis \nfor contesting the demand has to do with the officer's exercise of his \nor her official responsibilities. It will also allow for appeal to the \nFederal circuit court if the district court remands the matter back to \nthe State court over the objection of the Federal officer.\n  When a similar bill passed the House in July, I explained that the \nbill will not result in the removal of the entire case when a Federal \nofficer is merely served with a discovery request. The version of the \nbill we consider today reflects refinements proposed by the\n\n[[Page H8977]]\n\nSenate to make that even clearer.

PAYGO COMPLIANCE.\n\n       The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of \n     complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall \n     be determined by reference to the latest statement titled \n     ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, \n     submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the \n     Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such \n     statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.\n\n\tMr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, the Removal Clarification Act of 2010 will enable Federal officials--Federal officers, in the words of the statute--to remove cases filed against them to Federal court in accordance with the spirit and intent of the current Federal officer removal statute.\n\tUnder the Federal officer removal statute, 28 U.S.C. 1442(a), Federal officers are able to remove a case out of State court and into Federal court when it involves the Federal officer's exercise of his or her official responsibilities.\n\tHowever, more than 40 States have pre-suit discovery procedures that require individuals to submit to deposition or respond to discovery requests even when a civil action has not yet been filed.\n\tCourts are split on whether the current Federal officer removal statute applies to pre-suit discovery. This means that Federal officers can be forced to litigate in State court despite the Federal statute's contrary intent.\n\tThis bill will clarify that a Federal officer may remove any legally enforceable demand for his or her testimony or documents, if the basis for contesting the demand has to do with the officer's exercise of his or her official responsibilities. It will also allow for appeal to the Federal circuit court if the district court remands the matter back to the State court over the objection of the Federal officer.\n\tWhen a similar bill passed the House in July, I explained that the bill will not result in the removal of the entire case when a Federal officer is merely served with a discovery request. The version of the bill we consider today reflects refinements proposed by the Senate to make that even clearer. The bill now states that ``[i]f there is no other basis for removal, only that proceeding may be removed to the district court.'' This makes very clear that the Federal court must consider the discovery request served on the Federal official as a separate proceeding from the underlying State court case.\n\tThis bill continues to have strong bipartisan support, and I would like to thank Chairman Conyers, Ranking Member Smith, and the Ranking Member of the Courts Subcommittee, Howard Coble of North Carolina, for their work on this bill. I would also like to thank Courts Subcommittee counsel Liz Stein for all her tremendous work on this bill over several months.\n\tI urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\tThe bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Henry C. \"Hank\" Johnson, Jr."], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "156 Cong.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                S. 3481\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR STORMWATER \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 313 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1323) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Reasonable Service Charges.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For the purposes of this Act, reasonable \n     service charges described in subsection (a) include any \n     reasonable nondiscriminatory fee, charge, or assessment that \n     is--\n       ``(A) based on some fair approximation of the proportionate \n     contribution of the property or facility to stormwater \n     pollution (in terms of quantities of pollutants, or volume or \n     rate of stormwater discharge or runoff from the property or \n     facility); and\n       ``(B) used to pay or reimburse the costs associated with \n     any stormwater management program (whether associated with a \n     separate storm sewer system or a sewer system that manages a \n     combination of stormwater and sanitary waste), including the \n     full range of programmatic and structural costs attributable \n     to collecting stormwater, reducing pollutants in stormwater, \n     and reducing the volume and rate of stormwater discharge, \n     regardless of whether that reasonable fee, charge, or \n     assessment is denominated a tax.\n       ``(2) Limitation on accounts.--\n       ``(A) Limitation.--The payment or reimbursement of any fee, \n     charge, or assessment described in paragraph (1) shall not be \n     made using funds from any permanent authorization account in \n     the Treasury.\n       ``(B) Reimbursement or payment obligation of federal \n     government.--Each department, agency, or instrumentality of \n     the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the \n     Federal Government, as described in subsection (a), shall not \n     be obligated to pay or reimburse any fee, charge, or \n     assessment described in paragraph (1), except to the extent \n     and in an amount provided in advance by any appropriations \n     Act to pay or reimburse the fee, charge, or assessment.''.\n  Mr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3481, a \nbill to amend the Clean Water Act to clarify Federal responsibility for \nstormwater pollution.\n  I applaud the outstanding work of the sponsors of this legislation, \nthe distinguished Senator from the State of Maryland (Mr. Cardin), as \nwell as the sponsor of the House companion bill (H.R. 5724), the \nDelegate from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), for their efforts \nto move this important legislation for the protection of our Nation's \nwaters.\n  Simply put, this legislation clarifies that Federal agencies and \ndepartments are financially responsible for any reasonable Federal, \nstate, or locally derived charges for treating or otherwise addressing \nstormwater pollution that emanates from Federal property.\n  Madam Speaker, over the past 4 years, the Committee on Transportation \nand Infrastructure has examined the progress made over the past few \ndecades in improving the overall quality of the Nation's waters, as \nwell as the challenges that remain to achieving the goals of ``fishable \nand swimmable waters'' called for in the enactment of the 1972 Clean \nWater Act.\n  Although significant progress has been made in the past four decades, \napproximately 40 percent of the Nation's assessed rivers, lakes, and \ncoastal waters still do not meet water quality standards. States, \nterritories, Tribes, and other jurisdictions report that poor water \nquality continues to affect aquatic life, fish consumption, swimming, \nand sources of drinking water in all types of waterbodies.\n  In a recent report on the National Water Quality Inventory, States, \nterritories, Tribes, and interstate commissions report that they \nmonitor only 33 percent of the Nation's waters. Of those, about 44 \npercent of streams, 64 percent of lakes, and 30 percent of estuaries \nwere not clean enough to support their designated uses (e.g., fishing \nand swimming).\n  While these numbers highlight the remaining need to improve the \nquality of the Nation's waters, they also demonstrate how this \ncountry's record on improving water quality is slipping--demonstrating \na slight, but significant reversal of efforts to clean up the Nation's \nwaters over the past 30 years.\n  For example, in the 1996 National Water Quality Inventory report, \nStates reported that of the 3.6 million miles of rivers and streams \nthat were assessed, 64 percent were either fully supporting all \ndesignated uses or were threatened for one or more of those uses. In \nthe 1998 report, this number improved to 65 percent of assessed rivers \nand streams. However, in the 2000 National Water Quality Inventory \nreport, this number slipped to only 61 percent of assessed rivers and \nstreams either meeting water quality standards or being threatened for \none or more of the waterbodies' designated uses, and in the 2004 \nInventory, this number slipped again, to 53 percent of rivers and \nstreams fully supporting their designated uses--a significant reversal \nin the trend toward meeting the goals of the Clean Water Act.\n  According to information from the Environmental Protection Agency, \nstormwater remains a leading cause of water quality impairment. For \nexample, in the 2004 Water Quality Inventory, discharges of urban \nstormwater are the leading source of impairment to 22,559 miles (or 9.2 \npercent) of all impaired rivers and streams, 701,024 acres (or 6.7 \npercent) of all impaired lakes, and 867 square miles (or 11.3 percent) \nof all impaired estuaries.\n  The continuing negative environmental impacts of stormwater are \nechoed in a National Academy of Sciences 2009 report that expressed \nconcern about the ``unprecedented pace'' of urbanization in the United \nStates. According to this report, ``the creation of impervious surfaces \nthat accompanies urbanization profoundly affects how water moves both \nabove and below ground during and following storm events, the quality \nof stormwater, and the ultimate condition of nearby rivers, lakes, and \nestuaries.''\n  Madam Speaker, this National Academy of Sciences report made several \nfindings on national efforts to understand and manage urban stormwater. \nA key finding was a lack of available resources to implement and \nenforce Federal and state stormwater control programs. According to the \nreport, ``State and local governments do not have adequate financial \nsupport to the stormwater program in a rigorous way.'' While the report \nrecommended that the Federal Government provide more financial support \nto state and local efforts to regulate stormwater, such as through \nincreased funding of existing Clean Water Act authorities, the report \nalso highlights the importance of Federal agencies contributing to the \ncosts of environmental and water quality protections, including the \ncosts of addressing sources of pollution originating or emanating from \nFederal facilities.\n  This finding echoes concerns raised by numerous state and local \ngovernmental officials over how some Federal agencies have seemingly \nrejected local efforts to assess service fees to curb stormwater \npollution originating or emanating from Federal facilities.\n  Several states and municipalities, including the District of \nColumbia, have taken aggressive action to address ongoing sources of \nstormwater pollution. Yet, when a significant percentage of Federal \nproperty owners take the position that they cannot be held responsible \nfor their pollution, it places a greater financial burden on our \nstates, cities, communities, and local ratepayers, and makes it less\n\n[[Page H8979]]\n\nlikely that significant reductions in stormwater pollution can be \nachieved.\n  For example, in April 2010, the Regional Commissioner of the U.S. \nGeneral Services Administration, GSA, rejected efforts by the District \nof Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, DCWASA, to collect an assessment \nunder its Impervious Surface Area Billing Program for impervious \nsurfaces under the control of GSA. According to DCWASA, this charge is \na ``fair way to distribute the cost of maintaining storm sewers and \nprotecting area waterways because it is based on a property's \ncontribution of rainwater to the District's sewer system.''\n  S. 3481 amends section 313 of the Clean Water Act to clarify that \n``reasonable service charges'' for addressing pollution from Federal \nfacilities includes reasonable nondiscriminatory fees, charges, or \nassessments that are based on the proportion of stormwater emanating \nfrom the facility and used to pay (or reimburse) costs associated with \nany stormwater management program.\n  This is a simple effort to clarify, again, that the Federal \nGovernment bears a proportional responsibility for addressing pollution \noriginating from its facilities, and should remain an active \nparticipant in improving the nation's water quality and the overall \nenvironment.\n  The intent of subsection (c)(2)(A) of Section 313 of the Clean Water \nAct, as added by S. 3481, is to ensure that there is no increase in \nmandatory spending pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's permanent authority \nto pay, without further appropriation, the water and sewer service \ncharges imposed by the government of the District of Columbia. The \nreference in such section to ``any permanent authorization account in \nthe Treasury'' refers to any account for which a permanent \nappropriation exists, such as the U.S. Treasury account entitled \n``Federal Payment for Water and Sewer Services'', and does not imply \nthat GSA's Federal Buildings Fund may not be used to make such \npayments.\n  In addition, the intent of subsection (c)(2)(B) of Section 313 of the \nClean Water Act, as added by S. 3481, is to require that Congress make \navailable, in appropriations acts, the funds that could be used to pay \nstormwater fees, but not that the appropriations act would need to \nstate specifically or expressly that the funds could be used to pay \nthese charges.\n  Nothing in S. 3481 affects the payment by the United States or any \ndepartment, independent establishment, or agency thereof of any \nsanitary sewer services furnished by the sanitary sewage works of the \nDistrict of Columbia through any connection thereto for direct use by \nthe government of the United States or any department, independent \nestablishment, or agency thereof. The rules for those payments are set \nforth in law, codified at section 34-2112 of the D.C. Code, and nothing \nin this bill amends or otherwise affects those rules.\n  Madam Speaker, this legislation has the strong support of several \norganizations representing state and local elected officials, including \nthe National Governors Association, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, the Council of State Governments, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National League of Cities, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and the International City/County Management \nAssociation. It also has been endorsed by the National Association of \nClean Water Agencies, NACWA.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 3481.\n  Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3481 \nto amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which clarifies that \nthe Federal Government, like private citizens and businesses, must take \nresponsibility for the pollution it produces. This bill is the Senate \ncompanion to my bill, H.R. 5724, cosponsored by my good friends from \nVirginia and Arizona, Representative Jim Moran and Representative \nGabrielle Giffords. The bill passed the Senate with strong bipartisan \nsupport because the Senate understood that this is simply an issue of \nfairness and equity to users and a matter of managing pollution and \nprotecting the environment. In fact, this bill simply clarifies current \nlaw, that the Federal Government has a responsibility to pay its normal \nand customary fees assessed by local governments for managing polluted \nstormwater runoff from Federal properties, just as private citizens \npay. The consequence of failing to pass this bill is that we give the \nFederal Government a free ride and pass its fees on to our constituents \nthroughout the United States.\n  Section 313 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act states, ``Each \ndepartment, agency, or instrumentality . . . of the Federal Government \n. . . shall be subject to, and comply with all Federal, State, \ninterstate, and local requirements . . . in the same manner, and to the \nsame extent as any nongovernmental entity including the payment of \nreasonable service charges.'' However, the Government Accountability \nOffice issued letters to Federal agencies in the District of Columbia \ninstructing them not to pay the District of Columbia's Water and Sewer \nAuthority's, D.C. Water's, Impervious Area Charge. D.C. Water \ncalculates the charges to manage stormwater runoff based on the amount \nof impervious land occupied by the landowner. Impervious surfaces, such \nas roofs, parking lots, sidewalks and other hardened surfaces are the \nmajor contributors to stormwater runoff entering the sewer system and \nlocal rivers, lakes and streams, causing significant amounts of \npollutants to enter these waters. This bill clarifies that in my \ndistrict and all other congressional districts, Federal agencies must \ncontinue to pay their utility fees instead of passing the fees to our \nconstituents.\n  Nothing in this Act was intended to affect the payment by the United \nStates or any department, independent establishment, or agency thereof \nof any sanitary sewer services furnished by the sanitary sewage works \nof the District through any connection thereto for direct use by the \ngovernment of the United States or any department, independent \nestablishment, or agency thereof. The rules for those payments are set \nforth in law codified at section 34-2112 of the D.C. Code and nothing \nin this Act amends or otherwise affects those rules. This bill requires \nthat Congress make available, in appropriations acts, the funds that \ncould be used to pay for stormwater management charges, but not that \nthe appropriations act would need to state specifically or expressly \nthat the funds could be used to pay these charges.\n  This bill is supported by The National Governors Association, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State \nGovernments, the National Association of Counties, the National League \nof Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the International City/County \nManagement Associations, as well as the National Association of Clean \nWater Agencies. All of these national groups understand that stormwater \nmanagement fees, without any exceptions, are necessary for managing and \nreducing water pollution caused by stormwater runoff. Moreover, they \nunderstand that many agencies in states and localities may stop paying \ntheir water and stormwater management fees if we do not act, putting \neven more financial burden on residents.\n  Federal law has mandated that these local governments must collect \nthese fees. No exemption has been granted to Federal facilities. Please \nsupport S. 3481 to clarify the original intent of the law.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong \nsupport of S. 3481, a bill that would clarify Federal responsibility \nfor stormwater runoff from buildings, facilities, and lands owned or \noperated by the Federal government. This commonsense bill ensures that \nthe Federal Government maintains its equitable responsibility for \nstormwater pollution runoff originating or emanating from its property.\n  I applaud the outstanding work of the sponsors of this legislation, \nthe distinguished Senator from the State of Maryland (Mr. Cardin), as \nwell as the sponsor of the House companion for this bill, the Delegate \nfrom the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), for their efforts to move \nthis legislation so quickly to the President's desk.\n  Madam Speaker, simply put, this legislation clarifies that Federal \nagencies and departments are financially responsible for any reasonable \nFederal, State, or locally derived charges for treating or otherwise \naddressing stormwater pollution that emanates from Federal property.\n  Existing section 313 of the Clean Water Act states that ``Each \ndepartment, agency, or instrumentality . . . of the Federal Government \n. . . shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, \ninterstate, and local requirements . . . including the payment of \nreasonable service charges.''\n  Unfortunately, over the past few months, Congress has learned of \nseveral Federal agencies, including some here in the Nation's Capital, \nthat have made the determination that stormwater management fees are \n``taxes'' for which the agencies have claimed sovereign immunity and \nhave refused to pay.\n  This has left several State and local municipalities with the \nfinancial responsibility of addressing ongoing sources of pollution to \nthe Nation's waters that any other private business, landowner, or \nhomeowner would otherwise be responsible for paying.\n  Polluted runoff from urban areas is the fastest growing source of \nwater pollution in America. As urbanization increases, impervious \nsurfaces such as highways, roads, parking lots, and buildings replace \nnon-impervious surfaces that absorb stormwater.\n  Runoff from impervious surfaces is a central cause of pollution for \nthe Nation's waters, and is estimated to be the primary source of \nimpairment for 13 percent of rivers, 18 percent of lakes, and 32 \npercent of estuaries in the United States. These are significant \nfigures, especially given that urban areas cover only 3 percent of the \nland mass of the country.\n  Even here, in the Nation's Capital, pollution from stormwater runoff \nposes a significant\n\n[[Page H8980]]\n\nchallenge to the quality of local receiving waters, and negatively \nimpacts the overall environmental health of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  According to the Environmental Protection Agency, stormwater runoff \nfrom urban and suburban areas is ``a significant source of impairment \nto the Chesapeake Bay.'' According to Agency statistics, 17 percent of \nphosphorus, 11 percent of nitrogen, and 9 percent of sediment loads to \nthe Bay come from stormwater runoff.\n  In addition, chemical contaminants from runoff can rival or exceed \nthe amount reaching local waterways from industries, Federal \nfacilities, and wastewater treatment plants.\n  Several states and municipalities, including the District of \nColumbia, have taken aggressive action to address these ongoing sources \nof pollution. Yet, when a significant percentage of property owners \ntake the position that they cannot be held responsible for their \npollution, it places a greater financial burden on our States, cities, \ncommunities, and local-ratepayers, and makes it less likely that \nsignificant reductions in stormwater pollution can be achieved.\n  S. 3481 amends section 313 of the Clean Water Act to clarify that \n``reasonable service charges'' for addressing pollution from Federal \nfacilities includes reasonable nondiscriminatory fees, charges, or \nassessments that are based on the proportion of stormwater emanating \nfrom the facility and used to pay (or reimburse) costs associated with \nany stormwater management program.\n  Madam Speaker, in the amendment to section 313 of the Clean Water \nAct, a provision was included to rectify a specific problem in the \nDistrict of Columbia, where the U.S. Department of the Treasury has \nbeen paying some stormwater fees. The provision simply says that \nagencies and departments should use their annual appropriated funds to \npay for stormwater fees. This is exactly what they all do today in \npaying for their drinking water and wastewater bills or any other \nutility bill. This new language requires that Congress make available, \nin appropriations acts, the funds that could be used for this purpose. \nIt should not be interpreted as requiring appropriations act to state \nspecifically or expressly that the funds could be used to pay these \ncharges. The statutory language does not require this, and such a \nrestrictive reading is not intended.\n  Madam Speaker, this legislation is a simple effort to clarify, again, \nthat the Federal Government bears a proportional responsibility for \naddressing pollution originating from its facilities, and should remain \nan active participant in improving National water quality and the \noverall environment.\n  I urge passage of this bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third \ntime, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "CLARIFYING FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR STORMWATER POLLUTION\n\n\tMr. PERRIELLO.

FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY FOR STORMWATER \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       Section 313 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1323) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Reasonable Service Charges.--\n       ``(1) In general.--For the purposes of this Act, reasonable \n     service charges described in subsection (a) include any \n     reasonable nondiscriminatory fee, charge, or assessment that \n     is--\n       ``(A) based on some fair approximation of the proportionate \n     contribution of the property or facility to stormwater \n     pollution (in terms of quantities of pollutants, or volume or \n     rate of stormwater discharge or runoff from the property or \n     facility); and\n       ``(B) used to pay or reimburse the costs associated with \n     any stormwater management program (whether associated with a \n     separate storm sewer system or a sewer system that manages a \n     combination of stormwater and sanitary waste), including the \n     full range of programmatic and structural costs attributable \n     to collecting stormwater, reducing pollutants in stormwater, \n     and reducing the volume and rate of stormwater discharge, \n     regardless of whether that reasonable fee, charge, or \n     assessment is denominated a tax.\n       ``(2) Limitation on accounts.--\n       ``(A) Limitation.--The payment or reimbursement of any fee, \n     charge, or assessment described in paragraph (1) shall not be \n     made using funds from any permanent authorization account in \n     the Treasury.\n       ``(B) Reimbursement or payment obligation of federal \n     government.--Each department, agency, or instrumentality of \n     the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the \n     Federal Government, as described in subsection (a), shall not \n     be obligated to pay or reimburse any fee, charge, or \n     assessment described in paragraph (1), except to the extent \n     and in an amount provided in advance by any appropriations \n     Act to pay or reimburse the fee, charge, or assessment.''.\n\tMr. OBERSTAR. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3481, a bill to amend the Clean Water Act to clarify Federal responsibility for stormwater pollution.\n\tI applaud the outstanding work of the sponsors of this legislation, the distinguished Senator from the State of Maryland (Mr. Cardin), as well as the sponsor of the House companion bill (H.R. 5724), the Delegate from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), for their efforts to move this important legislation for the protection of our Nation's waters.\n\tSimply put, this legislation clarifies that Federal agencies and departments are financially responsible for any reasonable Federal, state, or locally derived charges for treating or otherwise addressing stormwater pollution that emanates from Federal property.\n\tMadam Speaker, over the past 4 years, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure has examined the progress made over the past few decades in improving the overall quality of the Nation's waters, as well as the challenges that remain to achieving the goals of ``fishable and swimmable waters'' called for in the enactment of the 1972 Clean Water Act.\n\tAlthough significant progress has been made in the past four decades, approximately 40 percent of the Nation's assessed rivers, lakes, and coastal waters still do not meet water quality standards. States, territories, Tribes, and other jurisdictions report that poor water quality continues to affect aquatic life, fish consumption, swimming, and sources of drinking water in all types of waterbodies.\n\tIn a recent report on the National Water Quality Inventory, States, territories, Tribes, and interstate commissions report that they monitor only 33 percent of the Nation's waters. Of those, about 44 percent of streams, 64 percent of lakes, and 30 percent of estuaries were not clean enough to support their designated uses (e.g., fishing and swimming).\n\tWhile these numbers highlight the remaining need to improve the quality of the Nation's waters, they also demonstrate how this country's record on improving water quality is slipping--demonstrating a slight, but significant reversal of efforts to clean up the Nation's waters over the past 30 years.\n\tFor example, in the 1996 National Water Quality Inventory report, States reported that of the 3.6 million miles of rivers and streams that were assessed, 64 percent were either fully supporting all designated uses or were threatened for one or more of those uses. In the 1998 report, this number improved to 65 percent of assessed rivers and streams. However, in the 2000 National Water Quality Inventory report, this number slipped to only 61 percent of assessed rivers and streams either meeting water quality standards or being threatened for one or more of the waterbodies' designated uses, and in the 2004 Inventory, this number slipped again, to 53 percent of rivers and streams fully supporting their designated uses--a significant reversal in the trend toward meeting the goals of the Clean Water Act.\n\tAccording to information from the Environmental Protection Agency, stormwater remains a leading cause of water quality impairment. For example, in the 2004 Water Quality Inventory, discharges of urban stormwater are the leading source of impairment to 22,559 miles (or 9.2 percent) of all impaired rivers and streams, 701,024 acres (or 6.7 percent) of all impaired lakes, and 867 square miles (or 11.3 percent) of all impaired estuaries.\n\tThe continuing negative environmental impacts of stormwater are echoed in a National Academy of Sciences 2009 report that expressed concern about the ``unprecedented pace'' of urbanization in the United States. According to this report, ``the creation of impervious surfaces that accompanies urbanization profoundly affects how water moves both above and below ground during and following storm events, the quality of stormwater, and the ultimate condition of nearby rivers, lakes, and estuaries.''\n\tMadam Speaker, this National Academy of Sciences report made several findings on national efforts to understand and manage urban stormwater. A key finding was a lack of available resources to implement and enforce Federal and state stormwater control programs. According to the report, ``State and local governments do not have adequate financial support to the stormwater program in a rigorous way.'' While the report recommended that the Federal Government provide more financial support to state and local efforts to regulate stormwater, such as through increased funding of existing Clean Water Act authorities, the report also highlights the importance of Federal agencies contributing to the costs of environmental and water quality protections, including the costs of addressing sources of pollution originating or emanating from Federal facilities.\n\tThis finding echoes concerns raised by numerous state and local governmental officials over how some Federal agencies have seemingly rejected local efforts to assess service fees to curb stormwater pollution originating or emanating from Federal facilities.\n\tSeveral states and municipalities, including the District of Columbia, have taken aggressive action to address ongoing sources of stormwater pollution. Yet, when a significant percentage of Federal property owners take the position that they cannot be held responsible for their pollution, it places a greater financial burden on our states, cities, communities, and local ratepayers, and makes it less likely that significant reductions in stormwater pollution can be achieved.\n\tFor example, in April 2010, the Regional Commissioner of the U.S. General Services Administration, GSA, rejected efforts by the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority, DCWASA, to collect an assessment under its Impervious Surface Area Billing Program for impervious surfaces under the control of GSA. According to DCWASA, this charge is a ``fair way to distribute the cost of maintaining storm sewers and protecting area waterways because it is based on a property's contribution of rainwater to the District's sewer system.''\n\tS. 3481 amends section 313 of the Clean Water Act to clarify that ``reasonable service charges'' for addressing pollution from Federal facilities includes reasonable nondiscriminatory fees, charges, or assessments that are based on the proportion of stormwater emanating from the facility and used to pay (or reimburse) costs associated with any stormwater management program.\n\tThis is a simple effort to clarify, again, that the Federal Government bears a proportional responsibility for addressing pollution originating from its facilities, and should remain an active participant in improving the nation's water quality and the overall environment.\n\tThe intent of subsection (c)(2)(A) of Section 313 of the Clean Water Act, as added by S. 3481, is to ensure that there is no increase in mandatory spending pursuant to the U.S. Treasury's permanent authority to pay, without further appropriation, the water and sewer service charges imposed by the government of the District of Columbia. The reference in such section to ``any permanent authorization account in the Treasury'' refers to any account for which a permanent appropriation exists, such as the U.S. Treasury account entitled ``Federal Payment for Water and Sewer Services'', and does not imply that GSA's Federal Buildings Fund may not be used to make such payments.\n\tIn addition, the intent of subsection (c)(2)(B) of Section 313 of the Clean Water Act, as added by S. 3481, is to require that Congress make available, in appropriations acts, the funds that could be used to pay stormwater fees, but not that the appropriations act would need to state specifically or expressly that the funds could be used to pay these charges.\n\tNothing in S. 3481 affects the payment by the United States or any department, independent establishment, or agency thereof of any sanitary sewer services furnished by the sanitary sewage works of the District of Columbia through any connection thereto for direct use by the government of the United States or any department, independent establishment, or agency thereof. The rules for those payments are set forth in law, codified at section 34-2112 of the D.C. Code, and nothing in this bill amends or otherwise affects those rules.\n\tMadam Speaker, this legislation has the strong support of several organizations representing state and local elected officials, including the National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State Governments, the National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the International City/County Management Association. It also has been endorsed by the National Association of Clean Water Agencies, NACWA.\n\tI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 3481.\n\tMs. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3481 to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, which clarifies that the Federal Government, like private citizens and businesses, must take responsibility for the pollution it produces. This bill is the Senate companion to my bill, H.R. 5724, cosponsored by my good friends from Virginia and Arizona, Representative Jim Moran and Representative Gabrielle Giffords. The bill passed the Senate with strong bipartisan support because the Senate understood that this is simply an issue of fairness and equity to users and a matter of managing pollution and protecting the environment. In fact, this bill simply clarifies current law, that the Federal Government has a responsibility to pay its normal and customary fees assessed by local governments for managing polluted stormwater runoff from Federal properties, just as private citizens pay. The consequence of failing to pass this bill is that we give the Federal Government a free ride and pass its fees on to our constituents throughout the United States.\n\tSection 313 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act states, ``Each department, agency, or instrumentality . . . of the Federal Government . . . shall be subject to, and comply with all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements . . . in the same manner, and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity including the payment of reasonable service charges.'' However, the Government Accountability Office issued letters to Federal agencies in the District of Columbia instructing them not to pay the District of Columbia's Water and Sewer Authority's, D.C. Water's, Impervious Area Charge. D.C. Water calculates the charges to manage stormwater runoff based on the amount of impervious land occupied by the landowner. Impervious surfaces, such as roofs, parking lots, sidewalks and other hardened surfaces are the major contributors to stormwater runoff entering the sewer system and local rivers, lakes and streams, causing significant amounts of pollutants to enter these waters. This bill clarifies that in my district and all other congressional districts, Federal agencies must continue to pay their utility fees instead of passing the fees to our constituents.\n\tNothing in this Act was intended to affect the payment by the United States or any department, independent establishment, or agency thereof of any sanitary sewer services furnished by the sanitary sewage works of the District through any connection thereto for direct use by the government of the United States or any department, independent establishment, or agency thereof. The rules for those payments are set forth in law codified at section 34-2112 of the D.C. Code and nothing in this Act amends or otherwise affects those rules. This bill requires that Congress make available, in appropriations acts, the funds that could be used to pay for stormwater management charges, but not that the appropriations act would need to state specifically or expressly that the funds could be used to pay these charges.\n\tThis bill is supported by The National Governors Association, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State Governments, the National Association of Counties, the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the International City/County Management Associations, as well as the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. All of these national groups understand that stormwater management fees, without any exceptions, are necessary for managing and reducing water pollution caused by stormwater runoff. Moreover, they understand that many agencies in states and localities may stop paying their water and stormwater management fees if we do not act, putting even more financial burden on residents.\n\tFederal law has mandated that these local governments must collect these fees. No exemption has been granted to Federal facilities. Please support S. 3481 to clarify the original intent of the law.\n\tI urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\tMs. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3481, a bill that would clarify Federal responsibility for stormwater runoff from buildings, facilities, and lands owned or operated by the Federal government. This commonsense bill ensures that the Federal Government maintains its equitable responsibility for stormwater pollution runoff originating or emanating from its property.\n\tI applaud the outstanding work of the sponsors of this legislation, the distinguished Senator from the State of Maryland (Mr. Cardin), as well as the sponsor of the House companion for this bill, the Delegate from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton), for their efforts to move this legislation so quickly to the President's desk.\n\tMadam Speaker, simply put, this legislation clarifies that Federal agencies and departments are financially responsible for any reasonable Federal, State, or locally derived charges for treating or otherwise addressing stormwater pollution that emanates from Federal property.\n\tExisting section 313 of the Clean Water Act states that ``Each department, agency, or instrumentality . . . of the Federal Government . . . shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements . . . including the payment of reasonable service charges.''\n\tUnfortunately, over the past few months, Congress has learned of several Federal agencies, including some here in the Nation's Capital, that have made the determination that stormwater management fees are ``taxes'' for which the agencies have claimed sovereign immunity and have refused to pay.\n\tThis has left several State and local municipalities with the financial responsibility of addressing ongoing sources of pollution to the Nation's waters that any other private business, landowner, or homeowner would otherwise be responsible for paying.\n\tPolluted runoff from urban areas is the fastest growing source of water pollution in America. As urbanization increases, impervious surfaces such as highways, roads, parking lots, and buildings replace non-impervious surfaces that absorb stormwater.\n\tRunoff from impervious surfaces is a central cause of pollution for the Nation's waters, and is estimated to be the primary source of impairment for 13 percent of rivers, 18 percent of lakes, and 32 percent of estuaries in the United States. These are significant figures, especially given that urban areas cover only 3 percent of the land mass of the country.\n\tEven here, in the Nation's Capital, pollution from stormwater runoff poses a significant challenge to the quality of local receiving waters, and negatively impacts the overall environmental health of the Chesapeake Bay.\n\tAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, stormwater runoff from urban and suburban areas is ``a significant source of impairment to the Chesapeake Bay.'' According to Agency statistics, 17 percent of phosphorus, 11 percent of nitrogen, and 9 percent of sediment loads to the Bay come from stormwater runoff.\n\tIn addition, chemical contaminants from runoff can rival or exceed the amount reaching local waterways from industries, Federal facilities, and wastewater treatment plants.\n\tSeveral states and municipalities, including the District of Columbia, have taken aggressive action to address these ongoing sources of pollution. Yet, when a significant percentage of property owners take the position that they cannot be held responsible for their pollution, it places a greater financial burden on our States, cities, communities, and local-ratepayers, and makes it less likely that significant reductions in stormwater pollution can be achieved.\n\tS. 3481 amends section 313 of the Clean Water Act to clarify that ``reasonable service charges'' for addressing pollution from Federal facilities includes reasonable nondiscriminatory fees, charges, or assessments that are based on the proportion of stormwater emanating from the facility and used to pay (or reimburse) costs associated with any stormwater management program.\n\tMadam Speaker, in the amendment to section 313 of the Clean Water Act, a provision was included to rectify a specific problem in the District of Columbia, where the U.S. Department of the Treasury has been paying some stormwater fees. The provision simply says that agencies and departments should use their annual appropriated funds to pay for stormwater fees. This is exactly what they all do today in paying for their drinking water and wastewater bills or any other utility bill. This new language requires that Congress make available, in appropriations acts, the funds that could be used for this purpose. It should not be interpreted as requiring appropriations act to state specifically or expressly that the funds could be used to pay these charges. The statutory language does not require this, and such a restrictive reading is not intended.\n\tMadam Speaker, this legislation is a simple effort to clarify, again, that the Federal Government bears a proportional responsibility for addressing pollution originating from its facilities, and should remain an active participant in improving National water quality and the overall environment.\n\tI urge passage of this bill.\n\tThe bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Thomas S.P.

I will not object.\n  Finally, I thank the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nI assure my colleagues that the controversial aspects of this \nlegislation have been removed, and only the essential parts remain.

Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \nesteemed chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator \nLevin.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that there are objections to bringing up a \nbill dealing with the Air Force KC-X tanker competition requiring the \nSecretary of Defense to take into account any unfair competitive \nadvantages given to any of the competitors for the contract. This \nprovision has passed twice on the House side now by overwhelming \nmajorities and I am shocked that the same language cannot be included \nin the Defense authorization bill or passed as a stand-alone bill. \nThese are legitimate concerns being brushed under the rug rather than \ndealt with head on. I recognize that with such a short amount of time \nleft in this Congress we will have trouble convincing our colleagues \nthat we are allowing a terrible precedent to be set and an expensive \ninjustice is being done to American workers and taxpayers. In the last \ncompetition, GAO found multiple instances of uneven treatment that when \ncompiled showed a pervasive bias in support of EADS/Airbus. \nUnfortunately, we now are seeing a similar pattern of behavior emerging \nand I have concerns about the conduct of the competition by the \nPentagon for this U.S. taxpayer-funded $35 billion contract. At every \nturn, it seems the Pentagon has gone out of its way to advantage EADS/\nAirbus for example, the Pentagon has structured the competition in ways \nthat minimize the cost advantages of an American-made tanker; extended \ndeadlines to accommodate EADS/Airbus; adjusted analytical models in the \ncompetition in ways that favor only the EADS/Airbus tanker; and, most \nrecently decided to continue using the so-called IFARA war scenario \nmodel in the competition despite having inadvertently released \nproprietary information that disclosed Boeing's scores to EADS/Airbus. \nIn recent press stories EADS/Airbus officials claimed they did not look \nat Boeing's proprietary information but it has now come out that in \nfact EADS/Airbus did look at it. This type of behavior is unacceptable.\n  In light of the serious national security and economic implications \nof the KC-X Tanker competition, I am respectfully requesting that the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee initiate an investigation into \nthese issues--in particular the inadvertent release of proprietary \ndata--to determine whether or not laws and fair competition regulations \nhave been appropriately followed. Further, I am seeking the chairman's \nassurance today that he intends to call departmental witnesses before \nthe Armed Services Committee to ensure that the committee is fully \ninformed on the progress, status, and conclusions regarding the \naforementioned investigation and any other DOD investigations into this \nand related matters.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am prepared to direct staff immediately to initiate an \ninvestigation into the release of proprietary data to determine if laws \nand fair competition regulations have been appropriately followed. I \nalso intend to hold one or more hearings by February 1 to consider \nthese issues and to review the propriety of the procurement process of \nthe KC-X tanker competition as it relates to this issue.\n\n\n                       Pay For Nonregular Service\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to comment on a provision in the \nfiscal year 2011 NDAA which the Senate passed today.\n  Section 635 of H.R. 6523, The Ike Skelton National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2011, contains a sense of Congress \nconcerning age and service requirements for retired pay for nonregular \nservice. The sense of Congress serves to clarify a provision which I \nauthored and which is contained in section 647 of the fiscal year 2008 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. I appreciate the committee's desire \nto clarify the intent of that provision and ensure proper credit is \ngiven to members of the Reserve.\n  As can be inferred from the title of the provision in the fiscal year \n2008 NDAA, the intent of the provision is to provide earlier retired \npay to members of the Ready Reserve who serve in active Federal status \nor perform active\n\n[[Page S10937]]\n\nduty for significant periods. The sense of Congress in the fiscal year \n2011 NDAA notes that the intent of the original provision was for \nreservists to begin receiving retired pay according to time spent \ndeployed, by 3 months for every 90-day period spent on active duty over \nthe course of a career, rather than limiting qualifying time to such \nperiods wholly served within the same fiscal year. I agree with this \nsense of the Congress to the extent that reservists should receive \ncredit for each 90-day period of continuous duty even though that duty \nmay span 2 different fiscal years.\n  However, the original intent of the provision, as I authored it, was \nnot to give credit for any 90 days of duty served anytime in one's \ncareer, regardless of whether or not that duty was served \nconsecutively. This would not be ``active Federal status or active duty \nfor significant periods,'' it would just be the normal accumulation of \ndays served over the course of a reservists career.\n  My intent in the original provision was to reward reservists who were \ndeploying or serving an active duty tour for a significant period of \ntime. It was not to allow for early receipt of retired pay simply \nbecause, over the course of a reservist's career, the number of days \nserved added up to 90.\n  I would like to yield to the honorable ranking member of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Arizona, and solicit his perspective on \nthis matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Georgia and appreciate his \ndesire to clarify this provision.\n  I agree, as the title of the provision in the fiscal year 2008 NDAA \nmakes clear, that the intent of the change to the law was to expand \neligibility for earlier retired pay to members of the Ready Reserve who \ndeploy on active duty in support of contingency operations for \nsignificant periods. It is unfortunate that some reservists who perform \n90 days of deployed, consecutive duty or more that has spanned two \nfiscal years have not received credit under this provision. The sense \nof the Congress in section 635 of the fiscal year 2011 NDAA seeks to \nclarify this, and I agree with the Senator from Georgia that the duty \nneeds to be ``for significant periods''--it should not simply be the \naccumulation of 90 days of duty over the course of a reservists' \ncareer.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the ranking member for his comments and I \nappreciate his willingness to clarify this issue.\n\n\n                             Land Transfer\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue \nrelated to the fiscal year 2011 National Defense Authorization Act. \nChairman Levin has worked incredibly hard to get this bill passed by \nunanimous consent, and I appreciate his efforts, the efforts of Senator \nMcCain and the efforts of rest of the Armed Services Committee members.\n  In the fiscal year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act, the \nchairman helped me to include language that would allow for a land \nexchange between Camp Joseph T. Robinson, which is an Army National \nGuard facility, and their neighbor, the city of North Little Rock, AR. \nThis land conveyance is in the best interest of the military for a \ncouple of reasons. First, the land that the Arkansas National Guard is \ngiving up is so steep that it cannot be used for mounted or dismounted \ntraining. Second, the land cannot be totally secured due to extremely \nrugged terrain. Lastly, due to the lack of complete security, there is \na possibility that a civilian could enter the property and be seriously \ninjured. The land that would be gained by the Arkansas National Guard \nis well suited for mounted and dismounted training and able to be \nsecured.\n  As all entities were working in good faith toward executing this land \nexchange, it was brought to my attention that we need one minor \nadjustment to this language. This adjustment would be a technical \ncorrection that would specify that the land exchange is to occur \nbetween the city of North Little Rock, AR, and the Military Department \nof Arkansas, rather than between the city of North Little Rock, AR, and \nthe United States of America. This clarification is necessary since \nCamp Joseph T. Robinson is an entity of the State of Arkansas rather \nthan an entity of the United States of America.\n  I understand that there was a timing issue this year and a need to \npass the bill by unanimous consent in the Senate so we did not have a \nformal amendment process during consideration of the bill. However, \nthis technical correction is important to Arkansas. I would ask for the \nchairman's assistance in addressing this issue at the first opportunity \nnext year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the Senator from Arkansas bringing this issue \nto my attention, and I will work with him next year to find a \nresolution.\n  Mr. PRYOR. I appreciate the remarks of the chairman and thank him for \nhis help on this matter. His leadership on military issues is \ninvaluable in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that H.R. 6523, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, includes a \nsection to prohibit the transfer of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo \nBay to the United States to face prosecution. This section takes away \none of the greatest tools we have to protect our national security--our \nability to prosecute terrorism defendants in Federal courts. The result \nis to make it more likely that terrorists will not be brought to \njustice.\n  Current law allows for the transfer of these terrorist suspects for \nprosecution in the Federal courts. This is a policy that I strongly \nsupport. I want to see those who have committed acts of terrorism \nconvicted in our justice system and sentenced to long terms in prison.\n  Our Federal judges and Federal prosecutors have extraordinary \nexperience dealing with complex terrorism and conspiracy cases. The \nrecord speaks for itself. Since September 11, 2001, over 425 persons \nhave been convicted on terrorism related charges in the Federal \ncourts--including more than 70 defendants since President Obama took \noffice in January 2009.\n  And yet, despite this strong record, Congress continues to try to tie \nthe hands of law enforcement and other security agencies. The \nprohibition contained in section 1032 of H.R. 6523 is a complete bar on \ntransfers of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay to the United States. \nThere are no exceptions to this prohibition for Federal prosecutions. \nRather than addressing the question of how to close the prison facility \nat Guantanamo Bay once and for all, Congress is obstructing efforts to \nbring these criminals to justice.\n  In a letter to the Senate leadership dated December 9, 2010, Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder warned that this provision would ``set a dangerous \nprecedent with serious implications for the impartial administration of \njustice.'' The Attorney General further stated that, by restricting the \ndiscretion of the executive branch to prosecute terrorists in Article \nIII courts, Congress would ``tie the hands of the President and his \nnational security advisers'' and would be ``taking away one of our most \npotent weapons in the fight against terrorism,'' Accordingly, this \nprovision is short-sighted and unwise.\n  This prohibition language also sets a dangerous political precedent. \nOnce the Senate votes in favor of a total bar to transfers, even for \ncriminal trial, we will see it offered again and again. This is a door \nthat, once opened, will not easily be closed.\n  I can think of only two possible motivations for including this ban \nof all transfers to the United States. One is to ensure that the \ndetainees being held at Guantanamo Bay, some for years without charge, \ncan only be tried by military commissions. The other is to ensure that \nthese suspects are simply held in military detention at Guantanamo Bay \nindefinitely. The very strict restrictions on transfers of suspects \nfrom Guantanamo Bay to other nations in section 1033 of H.R. 6523 \nsuggests that indefinite detention is, in fact, the goal of these \nprovisions.\n  For those who wish to see terrorism suspects tried only in military \ncommissions, I urge them to study the record. The military commissions \ndevised by the prior administration were plagued with problems and \nrepeatedly overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Obama \nadministration has worked hard to revise the military commissions to \nmake sure they meet constitutional standards. However, the new system \nis still largely untested, and the rules for these commissions were \nonly just released earlier this year.\n  Military commissions have achieved only five convictions since the \nSeptember 11, 2001, attacks. Four of the\n\n[[Page S10938]]\n\nfive resulted from pleas. The sentences handed down in these five cases \nhave been much shorter than those meted out in Federal court \nconvictions. In contrast, our Federal courts have a long and \ndistinguished history of successfully prosecuting even the most \natrocious violent acts, and our judicial system is respected throughout \nthe world.\n  The vital role of the rule of law and our judicial system in the \nfight against terrorism is also strongly supported by leaders of our \nmilitary who served honorably to protect our nation and uphold the \nConstitution. On December 10, 2010, a group of retired generals and \nadmirals voiced their opposition against restricting law enforcement's \nability to try terrorists in Federal criminal courts, and wrote that, \n``By trying terrorist suspects in civilian courts we deprive them of \nthe warrior status they crave and treat them as the criminals and thugs \nthey are. As long as Guantanamo is open it offers America's enemies a \npropaganda tool that is being used effectively to recruit others to \ntheir cause and undermines U.S. efforts to win support in the \ncommunities where our troops most need local cooperation to succeed.''\n  I believe strongly, as all Americans do, that we must do everything \nwe can to prevent terrorism, and we must ensure severe punishment is \nimposed upon those who do us harm. As a former prosecutor, I have made \ncertain that perpetrators of violent crimes receive serious punishment. \nI also believe strongly that we can ensure our safety and security, and \nbring terrorists to justice, in ways that are consistent with our laws \nand values. Congress should not limit law enforcement's ability to do \njust that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the proud tradition our committee has \nmaintained every year since 1961 continues with the Senate's passage of \nthis, the 49th consecutive national defense authorization bill. We \nalways have to work long and hard to pass this bill, but it is worth \nevery bit of the effort we put into it because it is for our troops and \ntheir families as well as, obviously, our Nation. I thank all Senators \nfor their roles in keeping this tradition going.\n  Our bipartisanship on this committee makes this moment, as late as it \nis, possible. I am proud to serve with Senator McCain and am grateful \nfor his partnership.\n  I thank all our committee staff members. With their extraordinary \ndrive and many personal sacrifices to get this bill done--and we had to \nget it done twice because we had to modify the bill that was originally \npresented to the Senate, as everybody here knows. Our staff has given \nanother meaning to this season of giving. Led by Rick DeBobes, our \ncommittee's staff director, and Joe Bowab, our Republican staff \ndirector, they have given everything imaginable, and some things \nunimaginable, to get this bill passed.

I thank the ranking member for his comments and I appreciate his willingness to clarify this issue.\n\n\n                             Land Transfer\n\n\tMr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue related to the fiscal year 2011 National Defense Authorization Act. Chairman Levin has worked incredibly hard to get this bill passed by unanimous consent, and I appreciate his efforts, the efforts of Senator McCain and the efforts of rest of the Armed Services Committee members.\n\tIn the fiscal year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act, the chairman helped me to include language that would allow for a land exchange between Camp Joseph T. Robinson, which is an Army National Guard facility, and their neighbor, the city of North Little Rock, AR. This land conveyance is in the best interest of the military for a couple of reasons. First, the land that the Arkansas National Guard is giving up is so steep that it cannot be used for mounted or dismounted training. Second, the land cannot be totally secured due to extremely rugged terrain. Lastly, due to the lack of complete security, there is a possibility that a civilian could enter the property and be seriously injured. The land that would be gained by the Arkansas National Guard is well suited for mounted and dismounted training and able to be secured.\n\tAs all entities were working in good faith toward executing this land exchange, it was brought to my attention that we need one minor adjustment to this language. This adjustment would be a technical correction that would specify that the land exchange is to occur between the city of North Little Rock, AR, and the Military Department of Arkansas, rather than between the city of North Little Rock, AR, and the United States of America. This clarification is necessary since Camp Joseph T. Robinson is an entity of the State of Arkansas rather than an entity of the United States of America.\n\tI understand that there was a timing issue this year and a need to pass the bill by unanimous consent in the Senate so we did not have a formal amendment process during consideration of the bill. However, this technical correction is important to Arkansas. I would ask for the chairman's assistance in addressing this issue at the first opportunity next year.\n\tMr. LEVIN. I appreciate the Senator from Arkansas bringing this issue to my attention, and I will work with him next year to find a resolution.\n\tMr. PRYOR. I appreciate the remarks of the chairman and thank him for his help on this matter. His leadership on military issues is invaluable in the U.S. Senate.\n\tMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that H.R. 6523, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011, includes a section to prohibit the transfer of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay to the United States to face prosecution. This section takes away one of the greatest tools we have to protect our national security--our ability to prosecute terrorism defendants in Federal courts. The result is to make it more likely that terrorists will not be brought to justice.\n\tCurrent law allows for the transfer of these terrorist suspects for prosecution in the Federal courts. This is a policy that I strongly support. I want to see those who have committed acts of terrorism convicted in our justice system and sentenced to long terms in prison.\n\tOur Federal judges and Federal prosecutors have extraordinary experience dealing with complex terrorism and conspiracy cases. The record speaks for itself. Since September 11, 2001, over 425 persons have been convicted on terrorism related charges in the Federal courts--including more than 70 defendants since President Obama took office in January 2009.\n\tAnd yet, despite this strong record, Congress continues to try to tie the hands of law enforcement and other security agencies. The prohibition contained in section 1032 of H.R. 6523 is a complete bar on transfers of terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay to the United States. There are no exceptions to this prohibition for Federal prosecutions. Rather than addressing the question of how to close the prison facility at Guantanamo Bay once and for all, Congress is obstructing efforts to bring these criminals to justice.\n\tIn a letter to the Senate leadership dated December 9, 2010, Attorney General Eric Holder warned that this provision would ``set a dangerous precedent with serious implications for the impartial administration of justice.'' The Attorney General further stated that, by restricting the discretion of the executive branch to prosecute terrorists in Article III courts, Congress would ``tie the hands of the President and his national security advisers'' and would be ``taking away one of our most potent weapons in the fight against terrorism,'' Accordingly, this provision is short-sighted and unwise.\n\tThis prohibition language also sets a dangerous political precedent. Once the Senate votes in favor of a total bar to transfers, even for criminal trial, we will see it offered again and again. This is a door that, once opened, will not easily be closed.\n\tI can think of only two possible motivations for including this ban of all transfers to the United States. One is to ensure that the detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay, some for years without charge, can only be tried by military commissions. The other is to ensure that these suspects are simply held in military detention at Guantanamo Bay indefinitely. The very strict restrictions on transfers of suspects from Guantanamo Bay to other nations in section 1033 of H.R. 6523 suggests that indefinite detention is, in fact, the goal of these provisions.\n\tFor those who wish to see terrorism suspects tried only in military commissions, I urge them to study the record. The military commissions devised by the prior administration were plagued with problems and repeatedly overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. The Obama administration has worked hard to revise the military commissions to make sure they meet constitutional standards. However, the new system is still largely untested, and the rules for these commissions were only just released earlier this year.\n\tMilitary commissions have achieved only five convictions since the September 11, 2001, attacks. Four of the five resulted from pleas. The sentences handed down in these five cases have been much shorter than those meted out in Federal court convictions. In contrast, our Federal courts have a long and distinguished history of successfully prosecuting even the most atrocious violent acts, and our judicial system is respected throughout the world.\n\tThe vital role of the rule of law and our judicial system in the fight against terrorism is also strongly supported by leaders of our military who served honorably to protect our nation and uphold the Constitution. On December 10, 2010, a group of retired generals and admirals voiced their opposition against restricting law enforcement's ability to try terrorists in Federal criminal courts, and wrote that, ``By trying terrorist suspects in civilian courts we deprive them of the warrior status they crave and treat them as the criminals and thugs they are. As long as Guantanamo is open it offers America's enemies a propaganda tool that is being used effectively to recruit others to their cause and undermines U.S. efforts to win support in the communities where our troops most need local cooperation to succeed.''\n\tI believe strongly, as all Americans do, that we must do everything we can to prevent terrorism, and we must ensure severe punishment is imposed upon those who do us harm. As a former prosecutor, I have made certain that perpetrators of violent crimes receive serious punishment. I also believe strongly that we can ensure our safety and security, and bring terrorists to justice, in ways that are consistent with our laws and values. Congress should not limit law enforcement's ability to do just that.\n\tMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the proud tradition our committee has maintained every year since 1961 continues with the Senate's passage of this, the 49th consecutive national defense authorization bill. We always have to work long and hard to pass this bill, but it is worth every bit of the effort we put into it because it is for our troops and their families as well as, obviously, our Nation. I thank all Senators for their roles in keeping this tradition going.\n\tOur bipartisanship on this committee makes this moment, as late as it is, possible. I am proud to serve with Senator McCain and am grateful for his partnership.\n\tI thank all our committee staff members. With their extraordinary drive and many personal sacrifices to get this bill done--and we had to get it done twice because we had to modify the bill that was originally presented to the Senate, as everybody here knows. Our staff has given another meaning to this season of giving. Led by Rick DeBobes, our committee's staff director, and Joe Bowab, our Republican staff director, they have given everything imaginable, and some things unimaginable, to get this bill passed.

The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with the \nmodernization of our nuclear weapons enterprise. It is a subject with \nwhich we began this debate. As we get toward the end of the debate, it \nremains a piece of unfinished business with which I think we need to \ndeal. Remember, the nuclear enterprise we are talking about consists \nprimarily of the facilities that are used to work on our nuclear \nweapons, as well as the weapons and importantly the scientists who work \nin those facilities. They represent our National Laboratories, as well \nas other production facilities and related facilities.\n  The point I think is important for people to remember is that unlike \nall of the other nuclear powers in the world today, the United States \ndoes not have an active modernization program for our nuclear \ndeterrent, a program which enables us, for example, to remanufacture a \ncomponent of a weapon and replace an existing weapon with that.\n  The need for this has been made very clear by all of the people in \nthe administration who have considered this, including Secretary of \nDefense Gates. The Secretary, remember, is, in effect, the customer for \nthe Department of Energy, which is the Department responsible for \nproducing these weapons. The budget we talk about is a Department of \nEnergy budget, but it is really to produce weapons for use by the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  Here is what he said about the need to modernize the production \ncomplex, which is what we call that group of facilities, as well as the \nstockpile:\n\n       To be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a \n     credible deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our \n     stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile \n     or pursuing a modernization program.\n\n  Each year, our Laboratory Directors and the Secretary of Energy are \nrequired to provide a certification to the President that certifies the \nstatus of the weapons in the stockpile and makes determinations as to \nwhether those weapons are safe, secure, and reliable without the need \nfor testing.\n  Each year, as we discussed in our closed session, there are reports \nabout the status of these weapons. I will talk in a moment about the \nmaterial we discussed in the closed session. But suffice it to say here \nthat there is a great need for us to move with alacrity to bring up to \ndate the weapons that are in our stockpile and that requires \nmodernization of the facilities and related equipment to accomplish \nthat task.\n  This will require a substantial investment over the next decade. \nUnfortunately, over the years, these facilities have been allowed to \ndeteriorate, our capacity to atrophy, and our scientists to retire \nwithout doing what is necessary to bring these weapons up to date.\n  The current budget projection, as expressed in the 1251 report \nupdate, which was dated November 17, 2010, initiates that modernization \nbut clearly cannot accurately predict future requirements. This is the \nproblem we have dealt with here.\n  The report acknowledges that we have a problem and can estimate today \nwhat we think we can spend over the next few years--say, 5 years--but \nit is hard to estimate beyond that as to what the exact cost of this is \ngoing to be. I try to deal with that in this particular amendment.\n  The Laboratory Directors responsible for certifying our nuclear \nweapons recently wrote in a letter:\n\n       As we emphasized in our testimonies, implementation of the \n     future vision of the nuclear deterrent . . . will require \n     sustained attention and continued refinement.\n\n  In other words, each year they can get their estimates more accurate, \nas one might expect, and define more specifically what the exact \nrequirements are. In this case, that generally means an increase in \ncosts in one area or another. In fact, Vice President Biden, speaking \nto this precise problem, said:\n\n       [W]e expect that funding requirements will increase in \n     future budget years.\n\n  We know that is going to happen. The question is, can we be any more \nparticular in the funding that we require. My amendment seeks to be a \nlittle bit more precise or a little bit more specific than the current \nlanguage.\n  At the crux of this modernization program is a need for a firm \ncommitment for the construction of two critical manufacturing \nfacilities. They are called the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \nReplacement, or CMRR, plutonium facility--that is at Los Alamos \nLaboratory--and the Uranium Processing Facility, or UPF at the so-\ncalled Y-12 facility at Oak Ridge, TN. Without these, the capacity to \nperform stockpile maintenance will be lost by 2020 and there will be no \ncapability to modernize our aging stockpile.\n  For Members to recall briefly, these are, in many cases, facilities \nthat go all the way back to the Manhattan Project, the project that \ncreated the atomic weapons that enabled us to conclude World War II. \nSome of these buildings were built as early as 1942, and they are not \nin good shape. In fact, when I was with one of my colleagues from \nTennessee visiting the Y-12 facility, I asked one of the people \nresponsible for a particular part of the facility what his biggest \nconcern was. He said: My biggest concern is keeping this thing going \nfor another 10 or 12 years. When you see the facility, you can see \nthat. And that is no way to deal with the most sophisticated weapons \nthat mankind has ever invented.\n  As I said, the current plan is a big improvement over what we had \njust a year or so ago. We got together with the administration and \nasked them to relook at the plan they had submitted and identify areas \nwhere there were deficiencies in funding or planning. They came back \nwith an updated report that revealed funding requirements that had \npreviously not been dealt with. There was a little over $4 billion in \nfunding added to the first 5 years of the 10-year program we are \nlooking at as a result.\n  But even there, there was an argument that there were uncertainties, \nthey were only at a certain point in the planning of these two large \nfacilities, and that those funds would be inadequate.\n  To note something for our colleagues and of which the Presiding \nOfficer is very well aware, being one of the two Senators responsible \nfor the Los Alamos facilities, he will recall both he and his colleague \nand others of us, in visiting Los Alamos, were told about the problems \nof building a facility there where there theoretically could be an \nearthquake in the near vicinity and the costs of construction have \nincreased dramatically because of the physical needs to protect that \nfacility against any conceivable kind of physical problem. That has \nincreased the cost of the facilities, and they are trying to get a \nhandle on how much they will actually be. They are pretty clear about a \nball-park estimate, but a ball-park estimate is not quite good enough \nfor these purposes, as we know.\n  I will conclude by saying I am a little distressed by the news \nstories. We cannot expect the news media to have gotten into the detail \nrequired to actually make policy. They put it in a political context \nthat the administration put another $4 billion into the pot and why \nshouldn't that satisfy people like me.\n  Of course, that is totally beside the point. We are simply trying to \nget a better handle on how much money will\n\n[[Page S10940]]\n\nbe needed and to be able to plan for that funding in a way that gets it \nto the facilities in the most expeditious way possible so that, A, we \ncan complete the work that has to be done in time and, B, that will \nsave a lot of money, about $200 million a year.\n  There is every reason to want to understand how much it will cost and \nget it done quickly. It is not about adding $4 billion. That does not \nbegin to cover the cost of these items.\n  It is not a matter of some kind of negotiation that additional money \nwas thrown in the pot and is that not good enough. It is a matter of \ncontinuing to focus as the cost of these facilities evolves and as the \nrequirements evolve, so that Congress, with the administration's \nrequest in its budgets, can provide the funding that is necessary when \nit is necessary to get these facilities completed as quickly as \npossible in order to achieve our modernization goals.\n  There is no dispute about the fact that there will be additional \nmoney required. It is just a question of what to do about it.\n  The updated budget, while committing additional funds to repairing \nthese facilities, will not be able to eliminate even over 10 years, for \nexample, the more than $2 billion of documented maintenance issues. \nThere are some things that are simply outside the budget and need to be \ndealt with.\n  My biggest concern in the updated modernization plan is actually that \nit added to the delays. What we should be doing is trying to telescope \nthese projects as much as possible so we can meet the deadlines for the \nrefurbishing of our weapons--or maintenance of our weapons, I should \nsay--rather--than extending the time for the completion of the \nfacilities. But unfortunately, that is what the latest report did. \nInstead of accelerating construction of these two most critical \nfacilities, the CMRR and the UPF, the updated plan now delays \ncompletion to 2023 and 2024, respectively, rather than 2020.\n  As we recall from the executive session we had a couple of days ago, \nthere was information presented as to why these facilities absolutely \nneeded to be completed by 2020 in order to accomplish the life \nextension projects for some of our weapons.\n  Delay in these facilities will hamper efforts to perform these \ncritical life extensions of our warheads and not inconsequentially add \nsignificant costs, again, primarily to keep these aging facilities \noperational.\n  As an example, we have to put a brandnew roof on the facility at Los \nAlamos even though the facility in 10 or 12 years is no longer going to \nbe used because it will be replaced. But the roof is so bad that the \nwork we have to do in there is affected by the weather, and so we have \nto build a roof. That is an expenditure one hates to make because in 10 \nor 12 years that building is not going to be used anymore. But that is \nthe state of repair we are in.\n  Each year of delay adds to those kinds of maintenance costs. Senator \nCorker and I and Senator Alexander were told at the Y-12 facility that \nit is about a $200-million-a-year cost to keep these aging facilities \ngoing that we can eliminate if we can complete the construction of \nthese two large facilities.\n  One-fourth of the newest increase of this $4.1 billion, of which I \nspoke, for the next 4 years does not even go to the buildings or the \nfacility. It simply meets an obligation for unfunded pensions that have \nbeen allowed to accumulate over the years. The only good news about \nthat is, I guess, they would probably have stolen the money from one of \nthe accounts that directly deals with the modernization of our weapons \nin order to meet those unfunded pension obligations. So I am glad we \nwere able to put the billion dollars in there. But when they talk about \n$4 billion more for science work on these weapons, that is not true. \nFully one-fourth of it goes to meet these unfunded pension obligations.\n  There is a need for things outside the science, but clearly the \nscience requirements are the key ones we are trying to get money to as \nmuch as we can.\n  The key point also is that the modernization is independent of the \nratification of the treaty. It is true that as we reduce the number of \nwarheads, there is even more of a requirement that we know the warheads \nwe have will do their job because we do not have a backup warhead \nsitting in a storeroom, basically in the event something does not work \nif that is deployed right now. It is true that as we reduce the number, \nwe have to pay even more attention to whether they are all safe, \nsecure, and reliable. But it is also a fact that the modernization is \nindependent of the ratification of the treaty.\n  During the hearings that were conducted on this treaty, all 16 \nexperts who provided testimony spoke of the requirement for \nmodernization. Many indicated it is a requirement irrespective of \nSTART. That is a point that has been made by others as well.\n  For example, former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham in an op-ed \nrecently said:\n\n       The Obama administration's decision to support increased \n     investment in the maintenance of our nuclear weapons lab and \n     stockpile is correct and long overdue . . . But the fact that \n     the administration has revised its policy for the better is \n     in itself no reason for any Senator to endorse START . . . \n     The START treaty and beefed up funding for our nuclear \n     enterprise are two separate issues that should remain \n     distinct.\n\n  The point was also made by the person responsible for this \nmodernization program--Deputy NNSA Administrator Tom D'Agostino. He \nsaid: ``Our plans for investment in and modernization of the modern \nsecurity enterprise are essential, irrespective of whether or not the \nSTART treaty is ratified.''\n  So this has to be done whether the treaty is ratified or not, and I \nthink everybody acknowledges that fact.\n  So we believe the resolution of ratification needs to address these \nissues by providing a couple conditions, and we have modified the \noriginal language in order to try to get an agreement. If we can't, we \nwill vote on it and see what happens, but I am hoping my colleagues \nwill agree.\n  The first is something I know has been agreed to; that is, a \ncondition the President will provide an annual update of the section \n1251 report.\n  The administration is agreeable to this, and it is the way for \nCongress to be annually advised of the status of this construction, the \nstatus of the facilities, and what more may need to be done on that. \nPresumably, that will be provided at or about the time the budget is \nsent to Congress from the administration.\n  Secondly, a condition the President will certify, prior to entry into \nforce of the treaty, that the President intends--so this is not a \nrequirement that he has achieved a particular result, but he intends to \naccelerate the design and engineering phase, to the extent possible, of \nthe CMRR and UPF.\n  In other words, we are not asking the impossible be done, just that \nto the extent we can possibly do it, we accelerate the design and \nengineering of these two facilities so they can get done on time, \nrather than with the delays.\n  Third, that the administration--or the President--request advance \nfunding, including on a multiyear basis, for these two facilities--the \nCMRR and the UPF--upon completion of the design and engineering phase \nof the planning.\n  What that means is, we are not asking them to provide advance funding \nfor the entire projects, as is done, for example, when we construct an \naircraft carrier. We are not asking it be done now, when there are \nstill some uncertainties about exactly what these facilities need and \nhow much they will cost. Los Alamos is still being tweaked, among other \nthings, as I said, because of the need to make it earthquake-proof. \nWhat we are saying is, upon completion of the design and engineering \nphase of planning, then the administration requests advance funding and \non a multiyear basis.\n  What that means is--and this is frequently done with large Defense \nDepartment contracts, in order to get them done as quickly as possible \nand as inexpensively as possible--there are multiyear advances of \nfunding so the money can be spent, let us just say hypothetically, \nwithin a 5-year period by the Defense Department for an aircraft \ncarrier, for example. Instead of having the Appropriations committees \neach year appropriate a particular amount of money, and the work that \nis done can only be done within the constraints of that particular \namount of money appropriated in that particular year, what they say \nis--and I am just\n\n[[Page S10941]]\n\nspeaking hypothetically--the cost is, let's say, $4 billion, and we \nknow it is going to take about 4 years to do this. Instead of saying: \nWell, we are going to do $1 billion of appropriations each year, what \nthey say is: All right. You have $4 billion, and if you can get it done \nmore quickly by spending this money more quickly, fine. That will save \nus money and it will get the project done quicker. If you can't, then \nyou can't. But that money is set aside in an account for that purpose.\n  That is all we are asking be done here too. These two facilities are \nboth, in terms of order of magnitude, about $5 billion facilities. They \nmight be a little less. They are likely to be a little more--\npotentially, in the neighborhood of $6 billion or so. Originally, when \nthe administration presented its first 1251 report, the entire 10-year \nprogram was set at $10 billion. We knew that wasn't adequate. We went \nto the administration, they recalculated everything, brought their \nestimates up to date, and said: That is right, $10 billion is not going \nto be enough. We will add another $4 billion to $6 billion over the \nfirst 4 to 6 years.\n  Undoubtedly, the cost will increase above that, as has been testified \nto. My guess is, just in terms of order of magnitude, you are looking \nat roughly $20 billion over 10 to 12 years. We will know more each year \nthis goes forward. But to construct these two facilities, if we could \nadvance fund at least some money--let's say, 3 years' worth of the \nmoney--then it will be possible for the people who are responsible for \nthe construction of those facilities, if they can get 15 months of work \nout of the first 12 months and spend more than 12 months' worth of \nmoney to get that done, that is great. They will have been able to \naccomplish their job more quickly. Each month that goes by adds costs \nto the program. So if we can provide them advance funding of some \namount--we are not specifying it in here--they can probably get the \nproject done more quickly and less expensively, and that should be a \ngood thing. I think everybody agrees this would be the way to do it.\n  There have been two objections posited, to my knowledge. First, the \nDepartment of Energy has never done it this way. That, of course, is \nnot the way for us to set policy. I saw my colleague on television this \nmorning saying what we need is a plan. We are too focused always on \nwhat is right in front of our face. A lot of times, if we have a basic \nplan everybody knows we are trying to work toward, it is amazing how \nmuch you can accomplish in terms of the details. Well, this is the \nbasic plan.\n  The Department of Defense does this every year because they have \nlarge-cost construction projects. The Department of Energy has never \ndone it that way--except I am not sure that is true. Before there was a \nDepartment of Energy, the Manhattan Project was being built, and GEN \nLeslie Groves, who is sort of the father of the Manhattan Project, \ndidn't have any problem at all about advance funding. He went to the \nPresident and the Congress and said: I need this money. They said: What \ndo you need it for? He said: Don't ask questions, it is secret, and he \ngot the money. That is an oversimplification, but he got that project \ndone in less time than anybody could have possibly imagined because he \nhad the resources provided to him to get it done.\n  So when they say it has never been done before, well, actually, it \nhas been done before on this exact--on this exact--national defense \nitem; namely, our nuclear enterprise. It is just that it was back in \nthe early 1940s when people were not so, I guess, concerned about each \nyear's budget and the appropriations that would accompany those \nbudgets.\n  Secondly, the argument is made that--and this one may surprise \nfolks--well, if we have, let's say, 3 years' worth of funding out there \nand that money is provided to the Department of Energy, the Members of \nCongress who are on the Appropriations Committee will grab that money--\nor parts of it that are unspent--and apply it to other things.\n  Think about that for a minute. The very people responsible for \nfunding these projects in the Congress, who know they have to be done \nand who have agreed to the advanced funding in the first place, I think \nare highly unlikely, after that money has been provided, to say: Well, \nwe need money for some water projects or something so we will go grab \nsome of that money that isn't spent. The whole reason it isn't spent is \nbecause you have provided multiyear funding for the project for \nefficiency purposes. So I don't think that is a reason for us to not \nadvance funds.\n  I would like to call to my colleagues' attention--and I will let my \ncolleague, Senator Corker, put this in the Record because I think \neither he or Senator Alexander might talk about it--a letter signed by \nSenators Inouye, Feinstein, Cochran, and Alexander, who presumably, in \nthe next Congress, will be the chairmen and ranking members of the full \ncommittee and subcommittees responsible for this funding. This letter \nmakes it clear they are committed to the full funding of the \nmodernization of our nuclear weapons arsenal and that they are asking \nthe President to submit budgets which will provide for the necessary \nfunding for this and they commit themselves to support that funding.\n  That is important, and I don't think we can attribute a motive to \nSenators like this, who we all know are entirely trustworthy, that \nsomehow after this money is advance funded, that Congress or \nappropriators are going to reach back and grab money they have already \nprovided because they think there is another purpose they want to spend \nit for right now. So those are the reasons why I don't think that is a \nprincipled argument for why we shouldn't do this. Having this advance \nfunding could complete these facilities on time, rather than with a 2- \nor 3-year delay, and we could save literally hundreds of millions of \ndollars.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nsome additional quotations on the need for modernization from former \nlaboratory Directors, an Under Secretary of Defense, the current \nSecretary of Defense, the former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, \nand there are many more we could produce.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Additional Quotes on Modernization\n\n       Former laboratory directors: ``However, we believe there \n     are serious shortfalls in stockpile surveillance activities, \n     personnel, infrastructure, and the basic sciences necessary \n     to recover from the successive budget reductions of the last \n     five years.'' \\7\\\n       Secretary Kissinger: ``As part of a number of \n     recommendations, my colleagues, Bill Perry, George Shultz, \n     Sam Nunn, and I have called for significant investments in a \n     repaired and modernized nuclear weapons infrastructure and \n     added resources for the three national laboratories.'' \\8\\\n       Under Secretary Joseph: ``New START must be assessed in the \n     context of a robust commitment to maintain the necessary \n     nuclear offensive capabilities required to meet today's \n     threats and those that may emerge. . . This is a long-term \n     commitment, not a one-year budget bump-up'' \\9\\\n       Secretary Gates: ``This calls for a reinvigoration of our \n     nuclear weapons complex that is our infrastructure and our \n     science technology and engineering base. And I might just \n     add, I've been up here for the last four springs trying to \n     get money for this and this is the first time I think I've \n     got a fair shot of actually getting money for our nuclear \n     arsenal.\\10\\\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       \\7\\ Harold Agnew et al., Letter from 10 Former National \n     Laboratory Directors to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and \n     Secretary of Energy Steven Chu.

I thank the Chair, and I will have more to say, but I will \nlet other Senators speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, as I did yesterday on the floor, I wish to \nsay I cannot thank, and I hope the Senate will feel the same way--I \nthink our country will when they understand what Senator Kyl has done--\nI cannot thank him enough for his thoughtful, dogged, persistent \nefforts as it relates to modernizing our nuclear arsenal. As a matter \nof fact, the Presiding Officer and I accompanied Senator Kyl on a \nbipartisan trip to Sandia and Los Alamos to look at some of the many \nneeds we have throughout our complex in our country, which resides at \nseven facilities across the country. It is that foresight that Senator \nKyl has displayed,\n\n[[Page S10942]]\n\nbeginning years ago but especially focused over this last year, that I \nthink has led to incredible results.\n  While the Senator and I are obviously going to end up in different \nplaces, it appears, on this treaty--and there is no question the treaty \nand modernization are two very different things--there is no question \nin my mind that we would not have the modernization commitments we have \nin hand today if it were not for the treaty. So, for me, it is this \nwhole body of work that works together, and in my opinion makes this \ndecision one that is very easy to make because of the entire body of \nwork.\n  I wish to say that Senator Kyl, through his efforts, has caused there \nto be two updates to what is called the Defense authorization 1251. \nThat is something that is required by our Defense authorization bill. \nIt focuses on expenditures to our nuclear arsenal.\n  I think people will realize, over the next decade, as a result of \nSenator Kyl's efforts--and Senator Kerry's cooperation and the \nappropriators and the President and others--that $86 billion will be \ninvested in modernizing our nuclear arsenal, and $100 billion will be \ninvested in those delivery vehicles that relate to our warheads. I \nthink people realize that while we are talking about 1,550 warheads \nbeing our deployed limit, we have 3,500 other warheads that are \nstockpiled all across our country and those also need to be modernized. \nWe need to know they are available.\n  I think the Presiding Officer and I were able to see where neutron \ngenerators were going to expire, where the guidance system that guides \nmany of our missiles is far less sophisticated than the cell phones we \nhave today. In some cases, they still had tubes, such as we had in our \nold black-and-white televisions.\n  So I wish to thank the Senator from Arizona for everything he has \ndone to cause there to be focus on this and for the fact he has caused \nit to be dovetailed; the fact we have an updated 1251 that reflects the \nneeds of our country; the fact that we have four appropriators who now \nhave committed to the President they will support this effort; the fact \nthe President has said to them--and all this has been entered into the \nRecord--that he will ask for these moneys to modernize our nuclear \narsenal.\n  So, again, Senator Kyl has done incredible work in this regard. I \nthink he has informed this body, and I think it is due to his efforts \nand those of us who have supported his efforts that have helped to find \ngaps in our modernization program. We have been able to talk to the \nhead of the NNSA and the Lab Directors to focus on those gaps.\n  The senior Senator from Tennessee has helped tremendously in that \nregard. He and Senator Kyl and Senator Lugar have actually gone through \nother sites--sites I did not go through with Senator Kyl myself. So \nthis has been a collective effort led by Senator Kyl.\n  Again, I know we will end up in a different place on the treaty as a \nwhole, but it is my hope that the administration and Senator Kerry will \naccept the changes Senator Kyl has put forth in his amendment. It is my \nhope that by unanimous consent we can add this to the treaty. Even if \nthat does not occur, there is no question that the contributions of \nSenator Kyl to the commitments that are so important to ensuring our \ncountry is safe and secure by virtue of having a reliable, safe, \ndependable, nuclear arsenal not only will be evident today, but they \nwill be evident for generations to come. For that, I thank him deeply.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I came to the floor to express my \nadmiration for the Senator from Arizona. I was listening to his address \nand I heard my colleague from Tennessee.\n  Senator Kyl's work on nuclear modernization is no surprise to any of \nus who know him very well because his approach to issues is a \nprincipled one, and once he determines the principle, he is dogged. He \nis a determined person. He basically took this issue of nuclear \nmodernization, which is not on the lips of very many people in the \nUnited States--the question of whether our nuclear weapons are safe and \nreliable, whether they will work--he pulled it out of a trash bin and \nput it on the front page of a national debate.\n  He did it in connection with the START treaty, but as he said in his \nown remarks, this should be done whether you are for the START treaty \nor against the START treaty. It is completely independent, in that \nsense.\n  In my view, under no circumstances should the START treaty be \nratified without doing this. That would be like reducing our weapons \nand leaving us with a collection of wet matches. We need to make sure \nwhat we have left works. But this is sort of the showhorse/workhorse \nSenator distinction. This is an issue on the back burner. It is an \nunpleasant issue. No one likes to talk about making nuclear weapons, \neach one of which could be 30 times as powerful as the bomb that was \ndropped on Hiroshima and ended the war, but it is a part of the reality \nin the United States and in the world today.\n  As Senator Corker was saying and as Senator Kyl said when each of us \nvisited in different times, different places--Senator Kyl came to \nTennessee. I was with him there. He has talked to many more people than \nI have on this subject--these weapons are being modernized in \nfacilities that are completely outdated. It would be as if we were \nmaking Corvettes in a Model T factory.\n  Worse than that, it is not just an inconvenience to the workers \nthere, it is a threat to their safety, and it is a waste of taxpayers' \nmoney. As the Senator from Arizona said, after a certain number of \nyears--I am not sure of the exact number anymore, maybe 15 years, some \nnumber of years--this pays for itself. The modernization of these \nfacilities, the bringing them up to date, means the taxpayers will pay \njust as much to operate these old facilities as they would to spend $5 \nbillion or $6 billion or whatever it is to improve these two big new \nfacilities and the other infrastructure and the other things we need to \ndo.\n  It ought to be said as well that not one of these facilities is in \nArizona. This is not home cooking by Jon Kyl. This is a man who, for a \ncouple decades, has made our nuclear posture his business and has made \nsure he knows as much about it as anyone and has made sure the rest of \nus paid attention to it when we might be more interested in the issue \nof the moment. So it is an example of a Senator doing his job very \nwell. I am deeply grateful for that and I am proud to serve in the \nSenate with such a person.\n  I would like to mention the letters I had printed in the Record \nyesterday. They are such an integral part of the remarks of Senator Kyl \nand Senator Corker--the letter to the President of December 16, from \nSenators Inouye and Cochran, the ranking members of the Appropriations \nCommittee on both sides of the aisle, and Senator Feinstein and I, who \nare both members of the appropriate subcommittee for dealing with this, \nas well as the President's response of December 20.\n  In concluding my remarks, I would like to also congratulate Senator \nKyl for his comments about advanced funding. We want to do things in an \norderly way in government, but it makes no sense for us to build \nbuildings in the most expensive way, particularly when there is an \nurgent deadline that is in the national interest. So if indeed by \nbuilding these buildings more rapidly and saving the annual maintenance \ncosts we could save the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars at a \ntime when we are borrowing 42 cents out of every $1 and every one of us \nis going to be looking for ways to save money, Senator Kyl's suggestion \nabout advanced funding, which may not be the way the Department of \nEnergy has done it before, ought to be the way we do it now. We didn't \nused to have a big dip like we do now. Let's look for ways to save \nhundreds of millions of dollars. We know we are going to have to \nmodernize these weapons, START treaty or no START treaty, as the \nSenator said. We know we are going to have to save money. Let's accept \nthe Senator's suggestion about advanced funding of these large \nfacilities. As one member of the appropriations committee, I am going \nto do my best to follow his suggestion.\n  I am here to congratulate him for a superior, statesmanlike piece of \nwork, both on the treaty which he has\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\nworked to improve but also on the nuclear modernization issue which he \nsingle-handedly has put upfront before those of us in the Senate and \nthe American people and it makes our country safer and more secure.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to thank both my colleagues from \nTennessee for their very kind remarks. Actually, the place we have \ngotten, what we have achieved, is due to the efforts of a lot of \npeople. It starts with Secretary Gates in the Department of Defense; \nSecretary Chu; Tom D'Agostino; his Deputy Director of NNSA, Don Cook; \nthe Lab Directors who are incredible public servants. We visited with \nthem. These are some of the brightest people in the country and the \nfolks who work with them, many of whom, almost all of whom are about \nready to retire, those people who actually designed and developed the \nweapons we now have. There are a lot of people who devoted their lives \nto what very few people know or understand. They are now being asked to \ndo a very difficult and complicated job in very difficult surroundings.\n  Part of what we are asking for--it is not just a matter of \nconvenience, as Senator Alexander said, it is a matter of absolute \nnecessity that these facilities be capable of dealing with these \ncomplex weapons. That is why they are expensive, but they are \nabsolutely needed. I thank both my colleagues for having devoted a lot \nof their own time and attention to this issue and in supporting the \nefforts of modernization so we can get this job done properly. I \nappreciate their remarks.\n  I also would like to proffer a unanimous consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent to yield 1 hour of the time allocated to the \nRepublican leader postcloture to Senator Kyl.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I do want to rise in support of the Kyl \namendment No. 4892 and echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague \nfrom Tennessee about the good work of the Senator from Arizona. He has \nbeen a tireless advocate for modernization. It is something that needed \nto happen, irrespective of whether there was a treaty, but it certainly \nbecame a condition in order to have a treaty. If you are talking about \nreducing the number of your nuclear weapons, you certainly want to \nimprove the quality of the ones you have.\n  Unlike other nuclear powers, the United States has not had an active \nmodernization program for our nuclear deterrent.\n  We have heard from people who recognize the importance of modernizing \nour nuclear deterrent. I will not reiterate all of those, but I wish to \npoint out, Secretary Gates said recently--he couldn't be any more clear \nthat nuclear modernization is a prerequisite to nuclear reductions when \nhe said:\n\n       To be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a \n     credible deterrent and reduce the numbers of weapons in our \n     stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile \n     or pursuing a modernization program.\n\n  Similarly, Thomas D'Agostino, the head of the National Security \nAdministration or NNSA said nuclear modernization is a prerequisite to \nnuclear reductions, stating: `` . . . as our stockpile gets smaller, it \nbecomes increasingly important that our remaining forces are safe, \nsecure and effective.''\n  In the same speech I just quoted from by Secretary Gates, he pointed \nout: ``Currently, the United States is the only declared nuclear power \nthat is neither modernizing its nuclear arsenal nor has the capability \nto produce a new nuclear warhead.''\n  It is difficult to overstate the dire condition of the U.S. nuclear \nweapons complex. Its physical infrastructure is crumbling and its \nintellectual edifice is aging. The Strategic Posture Commission, \nchaired by William Perry and James Schlesinger, found that certain \nfacilities of the nuclear weapons complex are ``genuinely decrepit'' \nand the complex's ``intellectual infrastructure . . . is in serious \ntrouble.''\n  I met with experts throughout the Senate's consideration of New \nSTART, and they confirm for me the accuracy of these descriptions. I \nmight say to the Presiding Officer, whose State is home to Los Alamos \nand Sandia National Laboratories, we were able to visit those along \nwith Senator Kyl, the Senator from Tennessee and others, and had an \nopportunity to observe some of the facilities and buildings which are \nreferenced in this amendment. It is absolutely clear, beyond the shadow \nof a doubt, that we have to make the necessary upgrades and \nimprovements if we intend to keep our nuclear arsenal modern and \nprepared to deal with the threats we might face in the future.\n  The idea that the modernization of the U.S. nuclear complex and \ndelivery force is an absolute prerequisite for nuclear reductions \nenvisioned in New START has been clear to the Obama administration \nthroughout the New START process. In fact, in December of 2009, 41 \nSenators wrote to the President and said in that letter:\n\n       Funding for such a modernization program beginning in \n     earnest in your 2011 budget is needed as the United States \n     considers the further nuclear weapons reductions proposed in \n     the START follow-on negotiations.\n\n  Just to be clear, what is modernization? This includes improvements \nto the physical elements of the nuclear weapons complex. It involves \nthe warheads and delivery vehicles themselves as well as facility \ninfrastructure. Modernization also requires maintenance of the \nintellectual capacity and capabilities underlying that complex; namely, \nthe designer and technical workforce.\n  The amendment, as proposed by Senator Kyl, makes clear in the \nresolution of ratification how critical modernization is to the United \nStates while it is reducing its nuclear arsenal. First, the amendment \nplaces a condition in the resolution of ratification requiring the \nPresident to submit an annual update to the section 1251 report. The \n1251 report is something annually that comes up here that gives us an \nupdate on the nuclear weapons arsenal. Now we will have, thanks to the \namendment adopted earlier, a certification with regard to the necessary \ninvestment in delivery vehicle modernization, which is an issue I \naddressed in an amendment earlier in this debate and a critically \nimportant one. The Senator has already addressed that in a previous \namendment that was accepted by the proponents of the treaty. That was \nan important step forward.\n  This particular amendment deals with the facilities and is also \ncritically important. What it will do is require, in the 1251 report, \nthat the President, when he submits his 10-year plan with budget \nestimates for modernization of the U.S. nuclear complex, that he also \npresents an accelerated design and engineering plan for the nuclear \nfacilities and a commitment to funding those.\n  So this amendment, such as the one that would call for modernization \nof the delivery vehicles, is a critical part of the nuclear complex we \nhave, of making sure it is reliable, that it works, and that it is \nready and prepared for whatever challenge may face us in the future. As \nI said earlier, there are many of the experts, and you talk to the Lab \nDirectors themselves, who recognize the importance of making the \ninvestments that need to be made in this if we are going to keep that \nnuclear arsenal ready.\n  I wish to read one other quote again. Deputy Administrator D'Agostino \nsaid:\n\n       Our plans for investment in and modernization of the modern \n     security enterprise are essential, irrespective of whether or \n     not the START treaty is ratified.\n\n  I suspect before all is said and done, the START treaty will be \nratified. But in any event, this process needed to be undertaken \nirrespective of whether there is a treaty because it is that important \nto the future of our country and our national security.\n  Again, if I might point out, very briefly, what this amendment does, \nthe resolution of ratification must clearly call for a condition that \nthe President will provide an annual update to the section 1251 report \nin that as a condition the President will certify prior to entry into \nforce of the treaty that he intends to accelerate the design and \nengineering phase of the chemical facility and the uranium processing \nfacility, request full funding for both of those facilities upon \ncompletion of the design and engineering phase of the plan, and an \nunderstanding that failure to fund the modernization plan would\n\n[[Page S10944]]\n\nconstitute a basis for withdrawal from the START treaty.\n  This is, again, a fairly straightforward amendment. The Senator from \nArizona has done, as has already been noted, a superb job of putting on \nthe radar screen of all Members of the Senate the essential and \ncritical nature of getting this issue of modernization addressed. He \ndeserves great credit for doing that. I appreciate the work of the \nSenator from Massachusetts in cooperating with him in this treaty \nprocess to have these amendments and this language accepted because it \nis essential.\n  I think it will make not only this treaty stronger, but it will also \nmake the nuclear complex that much stronger. And that, of course, is \nabsolutely essential when it comes to America's national security \ninterests.\n  So I support the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. I hope it \nwill be accepted and adopted in the resolution of ratification, and \nthat before this treaty is adopted this essential issue will be not \nonly addressed, as it is in the underlying treaty, but addressed--that \nlanguage even strengthened and made more durable by these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.) The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I yield my hour of \npostcloture time to Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico very \nmuch. I do not intend to use that much time, but we will see what \ndevelops here.\n  Let me speak quickly to this amendment. I want to begin by saying \neveryone in this Senate is respectful of how hard the Senator from \nArizona has worked to bring attention, appropriate attention, to the \neffort to keep up our nuclear deterrent. He has pushed to correct what \nthis administration saw as too many years of neglect for the work of \nthe nuclear weapons complex. I am glad to say this administration has \nnot only heard him, but many other Members of the Senate, from both \nsides of the aisle, have joined in this effort to call attention to the \nmodernization needs of our nuclear deterrent.\n  The administration has appropriately pushed hard for an unprecedented \nlevel of funding for this work. In these difficult budgetary times, I \ndo not think anybody here would argue that moving a 10-year budget from \n$70 billion to over $85 billion, which they have done, what President \nObama has done, shows an extraordinary commitment to this enterprise by \nthis administration.\n  That is why the three directors of the nuclear laboratories told \nSenator Lugar and me, ``The proposed budgets provide adequate support \nto sustain the safety, security, reliability and effectiveness of \nAmerica's nuclear deterrent within the limit of 1,550 deployed \nstrategic warheads established by the New START treaty, with adequate \nconfidence and acceptable risk.''\n  That is also why Tom D'Agostino, the head of the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration, could say a few days ago, ``Having been \nappointed to my position by President George W. Bush, and reappointed \nby President Barack Obama, I can say with certainty that our nuclear \ninfrastructure has never received the level of support that we have \ntoday.''\n  Given all that has happened in the past year, all that has been \ncertified and pledged, and all that we know the administration \nabsolutely plans to do, it is hard to understand why anyone has a \nquestion about the nuclear stockpile provision at this point in time.\n  This particular amendment, unnecessary therefore in the light of what \nI have just said, does not present fundamental problems in terms of the \nwords ``to the extent possible we should accelerate.'' That is exactly \nwhat they are doing. They are accelerating, to the extent possible.\n  But paragraph B presents a number of different issues. Most \nimportantly, the amendment itself requires that the treaty not go into \nforce until all of the these additional certifications are made. The \nadministration has made it crystal clear that it is committed to \nfunding these facilities. If you read the update section of the 1251 \nreport that the administration provided, at Senator Kyl's request, and \nthey provided that in November, here is what they say: The \nadministration is committed to fully fund the construction of the \nuranium processing facility and the chemistry-metallurgy research \nreplacement, and is doing so in a manner that does not redirect funding \nfrom the core mission of managing the stockpile and sustaining the \nscience, technology, and engineering foundation.\n  So before we come to this moment, Senators were concerned about \nwhether the administration was committed to the facilities. Then the \nadministration made it very clear they are committed. The President \nmade that commitment as clear as could be in 1251. Now the concern is, \nthey are not building the facilities fast enough.\n  Well, that runs completely contrary to what the people designing it \nthink is happening and want to do. And, incidentally, if you put \nadditional funding into hiring additional people, by the time you find \nthem and get them, and they are qualified and they come, they are going \nto be finished with the job of the additional design and early \nconstruction planning.\n  If this were a post office we were trying to think about building, \nmaybe you could be a little more sanguine about saying, go ahead and \naccelerate it. But we are talking about multibillion-dollar, \ncomplicated facilities that require very significant, sensitive, \ndifficult substances management. They are going to take a certain \nnumber of years to build. That is a reality. That is how complex and \nchallenging the task is.\n  The early cost and design estimates are that the uranium facility is \ngoing to cost somewhere between $4 billion and $6 billion, and the \nplutonium facility is going to cost about the same. So we all remember \nthe old saying around here, we have got a lot of Senators who are \ntalking about waste in the process of governance. The last thing we \nwant to do in this budget, in my judgment, is create an environment of \nhaste that does not measure properly what we are doing. We ought to \nlisten to the experts on this a little bit, the people who are doing \nthe design and the engineering, who tell us it is no simple matter in \nthe world of nuclear weapons production. It involves hundreds of \nscientists and engineers working on every single aspect of the plant, \nin order to make sure it is going to work, that it is going to be \nsecure, and it is going to be as safe as humanly possible.\n  You cannot just throw money at an ongoing design and engineering \neffort and then automatically expect it can accelerate beyond an \nalready significant increase. We have gone up $15 billion. If you hire \na whole bunch of engineers who are new to the project, they do not know \nwhat they are doing yet. That is a recipe for both inefficiency and \npossibly even the increase of design risks or other kinds of issues.\n  The truth is, if you cram all of these billions into a very short \nfiscal period, in addition to that, as this amendment seeks to try to \nforce, you could unnecessarily create competition within other nuclear \nweapons activities, such as the ongoing warhead life extension \nprograms, and our critical warhead surveillance efforts.\n  The bottom line here is there is a place and a way to do this. We \nhave an authorizing committee. The Armed Services Committee is the \ncommittee that ought to be doing this, not some amendment that comes in \nattached to the treaty, and linking the treaty going into force to all \nof these other things being certified.\n  I think the Appropriations Committee, as well as the Armed Services \nCommittee, would powerfully endorse that notion here on the floor at \nthis point in time. We can compel the President to ask for upfront \nfunding. But that does not guarantee that the President is necessarily \ngoing to receive it. And this links it to the notion he can certify \nthat he has.\n  So I agree with my colleague, the last administration took way too \nlong to focus on this issue, and Senator Kyl has done an important \nservice to the Senate, to the country, and to this process, to help to \nfocus on it. But it makes no sense to use a resolution on a treaty to \nlock the President into doing something he cannot necessarily do \nbecause of the Congress and other things that are tied to it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page S10945]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to have 4 or 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I listened to Senator Kerry's remarks just now. This \nis an excellent discussion. Not only do I applaud Senator Kyl for \nresurrecting the whole focus on nuclear modernization, I applaud the \nPresident for the updated report that was received on November 17. A \nlot of work was done. This is a lot of money to say we want to make \nsure these nuclear weapons work and we are going to spend $85 billion \nover 10 years.\n  The intent of Senator Kyl's amendment, though, is not to tie the \nPresident's hands, it is to give him more options. I think it is to \nencourage this big, slow-moving government not to waste the money but \nto save money. The language says: The President shall certify to the \nSenate the President intends to accelerate, to the extent possible, the \ndesign and engineering phase.\n  At the Oak Ridge facilities, which Senator Kyl visited, he was told \nthat the savings annually to taxpayers of having the new facility \nversus the old facility are in excess of $200 million. So every year we \ndo it, every year this is completed, the taxpayers save $200 million. \nSo if the President and the Appropriations Committee should decide that \na 2-year or 3-year advanced funding will save $200 million a year at a \ntime when we are all dedicated to trying to save money, we should do \nthat.\n  You might say, well, why do we need to say this in the Senate? The \nanswer is, we have never done it before. And the U.S. Government, if \nyou have never done it before, takes a little nudge to pay attention to \nit.\n  So Senator Kyl has made an amendment, and if I understand it \ncorrectly, Senator Kerry amended the amendment a little bit to make it \nsofter, to say, the President intends to accelerate, to the extent \npossible. So this is suggesting to the Department of Energy, which has \nnever done it this way before, that we think it is a good idea, if it \nis practical, and if it saves money.\n  There is also the matter of getting it done on time. Senator Kyl \ntalked about that, the dates we talked about in the executive session. \nSo I would argue to my colleagues that the Kyl amendment is respectful \nof the President's prerogatives, which he ought to have. He is the \nmanager of the government. He is the Commander in Chief. But it says: \nIf we can think of a way to do this in a way that saves $200 million a \nyear, year after year after year, why should we not do it?\n  I will bet during the next session of Congress, if we do our job \nproperly in this body, we are going to be competing with each other to \nfind ways to save $10 million a year, $20 million a year, $100 million \na year, because of the incredible deficit. We have got bipartisan \nconcern about that deficit. We had two Democratic Senators and three \nRepublican Senators support the debt commission.\n  I would suggest to my friend from Massachusetts it is not possible \nthat you have modified the Kyl amendment to the extent it ought to be \naccepted, so that the President can get a signal from the Senate that \nif he thinks he can do this, to the extent possible, that accelerating \nthe building of these big facilities by 2 or 3 years, if it would save \n$400, $500, $600 million, that we want to encourage him to do that. \nThat is my only thought.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much for his \nparticipation and contribution to this effort. I am trying to work to \nsee if--as I have said, there are certain components of this that make \nit difficult to accept, that multiyear piece and so forth.\n  But the notion of reaffirming the commitment the President has made \nis not difficult to make. From our judgment, the President has really \naddressed this as significantly as one can by putting the $85 billion \nthere, by making it clear they are moving forward, they are going to \nfully fund it, and by helping the Appropriations Committee members to \nprovide the letter which speaks to their good faith going forward. All \nof those steps have taken place.\n  We just don't want to get into a situation where we are creating \nanother hurdle to get over before the treaty goes into effect. If we \ncould find a way as a declaration or some way to reframe this \ncondition--I am working with the administration to see if we can do \nthat--we would be happy to try to restate it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. No one is doubting the \nPresident's commitment. He has made an extraordinary commitment. I \ncongratulate him for that. It is just the suggestion of doing it a \nlittle differently, if the President thinks it is practical, because it \nmight save $200 million a year, year after year after year. A \nsuggestion from us like that could make the difference in those \nsavings. I thank the Senator for working in that spirit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, as we continue to work through the \namendments, I rise to outline what is at stake in the debate and \ndescribe what the world would be like without the New START treaty \naccord.\n  Every Senator here took an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. We have an \nobligation to support a strong national defense.\n  First, a world without New START is one in which more nuclear \nmissiles are pointed at Americans. This treaty reduces that number.\n  A world without a New START accord is one in which we have no nuclear \ninspectors on the ground in Russia. These inspectors have more than a \ndecade of experience inspecting Russian nuclear sites. They were \ninvolved in the negotiation process to ensure that there are strong \ninspection provisions in the treaty. But without New START, these \ninspectors would not be able to return to work. Furthermore, without \nonsite inspections, our intelligence services will still be required to \ncollect information on Russia's nuclear weapons infrastructure.\n  On December 20 of this year, ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, wrote to the Senate:\n\n       An extended delay in ratification may eventually force an \n     inordinate and unwise shift in scarce resources from other \n     high priority requirements to maintain adequate awareness of \n     Russian nuclear forces.\n\n  In a world without New START, our intelligence capabilities will be \nstretched, which could give the enemies of our troops on the ground an \nadvantage. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  These are just some of the direct effects. What about some of the \nindirect effects of a world without New START? The cascade effect on \nU.S. national security interests without New START is substantial.\n  A world without New START is one in which the Russians are less \nlikely to provide land and air access to supply U.S. troops in \nAfghanistan. The Northern Distribution Network is a crucial supply \nroute for our troops in Afghanistan. This means that just as we have \nreached full troop strength in Afghanistan, supply lines would become \nincreasingly strained. Today, supply routes through Pakistan are \nincreasingly dangerous. Just the other day, two fuel tankers meant to \nsupply our troops were attacked and the drivers were killed in \nPakistan. This is one of the reasons the leadership of our uniformed \nmilitary want New START ratified.\n  A world without New START is one in which there is more Russian \nfissile material in existence, material which could be stolen for use \nin a terrorist attack.\n  There are many reasons top U.S. counterterrorism officials in the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency want New START ratified.\n  A world without New START is one in which Russia's Government is \nperhaps less likely to help stop Iran's nuclear weapons program. A \nworld without New START is one in which Iran perhaps is given access to \nRussian S-300 missiles, a weapon capable of reaching the State of \nIsrael. This is one reason the Anti-Defamation League, B'nai B'rith, \nthe American Jewish Committee, and other prominent pro-Israel groups \nwant New START ratified.\n\n[[Page S10946]]\n\n  In a world without New START, there is no way the Russians will agree \nto decrease their tactical nuclear weapons. Our friends in Eastern \nEurope and those across the continent will be less secure in the \nknowledge that threats to their security are not diminishing but could, \nin fact, be growing. That is the reason 25 European Foreign Ministers \nwant this treaty ratified.\n  A world without New START is one in which the 1970 Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, the so-called NPT, the cornerstone of preventing \nnuclear weapons states, is severely threatened. What does this mean in \npractical terms? The New START accord is a clear demonstration that the \nUnited States is upholding our obligations under the NPT, which in turn \ncan help secure support from other countries for a strong arms control \nregime and assistance on other nonproliferation issues. Many countries \nsee nuclear terrorism as a problem for the United States and for the \nWest. In a world without New START, these countries would seriously \nquestion our commitment to the NPT. These countries would question that \nright away.\n  Without New START, government officials around the world will \nquestion the U.S. commitment to nonproliferation itself. They will ask: \nIf the United States is not seriously committed to arms control and \nnonproliferation, why should we be?\n  A world without New START contains many hard realities for the United \nStates. Ratification of this treaty is not a political victory for one \nparty or another; it is a national security victory for our great \nNation, for our nuclear security--from nuclear security, to the \nsecurity of our troops in Afghanistan, to the security of our ally \nIsrael.\n  A world without New START is one in which the enemies of America will \nbreathe a little easier. Strained U.S. supply lines make life easier \nfor the Taliban. Fewer available intelligence capabilities would make \nlife easier for al-Qaida terrorists in Pakistan tribal areas. A \nstrained U.S.-Russian relationship makes life easier for the government \nof the regime in Iran.\n  A world without New START makes life easier for terrorists \ntrafficking in fissile material to travel across borders.\n  A world without New START means no negotiations with the Russians to \ndecrease their tactical nuclear weapons.\n  The world I just described isn't a world we have to settle for. A \nworld without New START is not a world we have to accept. We must give \nthe American people some peace of mind as to our national security. \nThat is a world with a New START treaty. We must ratify this treaty and \ndiminish the number of nuclear weapons pointed at the United States \ntoday. We must deploy nuclear inspectors to Russia, thus returning \nstability and transparency to our nuclear relationship, and take the \nburden off of our intelligence agencies.\n  A world with New START means a more constructive relationship with \nRussia, which is good for our troops in Afghanistan and bad for the \nregime in Iran.\n  A world with New START means the beginning of a conversation with the \nRussians on tactical nuclear weapons.\n  A world with New START is one in which there is less fissile material \nfor terrorists to steal or buy on the black market.\n  A world with New START means increased cooperation with countries \ncombating nuclear terrorism. The most serious threat to U.S. national \nsecurity is the threat of nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists. \nIn 1961, at the United Nations, President John F. Kennedy said:\n\n       Every man, woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of \n     Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of \n     being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by \n     madness.\n\n  Some have observed that in this post-9/11 era of increased terrorism, \nwe may be more vulnerable to a nuclear attack than we were during the \nCold War. Today, the sword of Damocles still hangs by the slenderest of \nthreads, but we have the ability to prevent this threat by minimizing \naccess terrorists would have to nuclear material.\n  President Obama's nuclear security summit earlier this year was a \nhistoric event. It helped create a foundation upon which other \ncountries will take up the challenge of nuclear security and cooperate \nwith the United States to accomplish the President's goal of securing \nall fissile material in 4 years. We cannot do this alone. In order to \nconfront this most serious threat to U.S. national security, we need to \nbuild stronger ties with our allies around the world, and part of \nbuilding that trust is rebuilding our own credibility on \nnonproliferation issues. This New START agreement is a very positive \nstep in that direction. It is an essential predicate for fulfilling our \ncommitments under the nonproliferation treaty--a key marker for many \npotential allies on a range of nuclear security issues. Upon \nratification of New START, we must make progress on securing fissile \nmaterial around the world.\n  This is a strong resolution of ratification. It passed out of the \nForeign Relations Committee by a bipartisan vote of 14 to 4. It \nincludes strong language on missile defense, verification, and tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  Finally, the American people are watching. According to a November \n2010 CNN poll, 73 percent of Americans support ratification of this \ntreaty. They understand the implications of a world without the New \nSTART agreement.\n  In a hurricane of partisan rancor and political battles, the national \nsecurity consensus is as strong as an oak tree in support of the New \nSTART agreement--all six living former Secretaries of State, five \nformer Secretaries of Defense, three former National Security Advisers, \nseven former commanders of the U.S. Strategic Command, the entire Joint \nChiefs of Staff, our intelligence services, the President, and three \nformer Presidents.\n  The American people have a right to expect ratification of New START. \nThey want New START and will hold us accountable if we do not ratify \nit. Let's vote for New START's resolution of ratification and cast a \nstrong bipartisan vote in favor of our national security.\n  I close with commendations for both our chairman, Senator Kerry, and \nRanking Member Lugar and so many others who have worked so hard to make \nsure we can ratify this treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire, is there any time \nlimitation on Senators at this point?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is operating \npostcloture, and each Senator has up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair. I assure my colleagues, I will not use \nthe full hour, which I am sure is good news.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the ratification of the New START treaty for \nthe reasons many of my colleagues have articulated and to which I have \npreviously spoken. The treaty requires unilateral reductions of the \nUnited States on strategic nuclear weapons. It fails to address \ntactical nuclear weapons--an area in which the Russian Federation has a \n10-to-1 advantage. This is not an idle or incidental matter.\n  GEN Nikolai Patrusheb, Secretary of the Russian National Security \nCouncil, a body in charge of military doctrine, has declared that \nRussia may not only use nuclear weapons preemptively in local conflicts \nsuch as Georgia or Chechnya but may deliver a nuclear blow against the \naggressor in a critical situation, based on intelligence evaluations of \nhis intentions.\n  I submit also that the verification provisions of this treaty are \nweak, allowing only 18 inspections a year for an arsenal of more than \n1,500 weapons. Obviously, the ability to get more than a sampling of \nRussian Federation compliance would be impossible given the relatively \nfew number of inspections permitted under the treaty.\n  As we have discussed off and on over the last few days, the preamble \nof the treaty itself is ambiguous and has been construed by the \nRussians themselves as limiting the ability of the United States to \nexpand its own missile defense system.\n  I realize the President of the United States has submitted a letter \nstating his unilateral opinion of what that treaty obligation means, \nbut, of course, treaty obligations are not unilateral declarations, \nthey are bilateral agreements. Of course, the consequence of a\n\n[[Page S10947]]\n\nmisunderstanding over this important issue of missile defense could \nallow either side to withdraw from the treaty and, indeed, the threat \nof withdrawal from the treaty because of this misunderstanding is \nsomething that could be avoided in the first instance if, in fact, some \nof the amendments addressing missile defense were allowed and the \ntreaty modified to that extent. At that time, the Russians could then \nbe asked: Will you agree with this modification, and we would know \nupfront, not on the back end, their sincere intentions.\n  But I would say that the New START treaty has flaws when you look at \nit, not only in its various provisions; that is, when you reason from \nthe whole to its parts, but I would suggest the treaty also fails when \nyou look at it the other way around, when you reason from the parts to \nthe whole, when you see this treaty is another example, another \nsymptom, of a foreign policy that sends a message of timidity, even \nambivalence, not only about our own security but about America's \nleadership role in a very dangerous world.\n  This larger strategic context is what we need to keep in mind. We all \nknow that President Obama has set incredibly high expectations for his \nPresidency in terms of how he would conduct American foreign policy. In \nan early Presidential debate, for example, he promised to meet with the \nleaders of five rogue nations--Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba, and North \nKorea--``without precondition during the first year of [his] \nadministration.'' Well, we now know that never happened.\n  After he won the nomination, you will recall, in his famous speech he \ngave in the city of Berlin, while still a candidate for the Presidency, \nhe declared he was a ``citizen of the world.'' Also, he said: ``This is \nthe moment when we must come together to save this planet.''\n  President Obama was not the only one promoting a grandiose vision of \nhis Presidency. Remember the Nobel Prize Committee received his \nnomination for the Peace Prize less than 6 weeks after President Obama \ntook office. In the citation for the award last year, they said:\n\n       [President] Obama has as President created a new climate in \n     international politics. . . .\n       Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama \n     captured the world's attention and given its people hope for \n     a better future.\n\n  You might ask, What relevance does this have to our consideration of \nthe START treaty? The relevance is that a big part of this utopian \ndream of a ``new climate in international politics'' has been the \nelimination of all nuclear weapons.\n  In that Berlin speech, then-Senator Obama said that one of his \npriorities was to ``renew the goal of a world without nuclear \nweapons.''\n  The citation for the Nobel Peace Prize included this observation:\n\n       The Committee has attached special importance to Obama's \n     vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.\n       The vision of a world free from nuclear arms has powerfully \n     stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations.\n\n  Indeed, in an op-ed piece, authored by the Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton, dated April 7, 2010, in the Guardian, she argues that the \nSTART treaty is an important step toward a nuclear-free world.\n  So you might ask, what is wrong with a vision of the world without \nnuclear weapons? Can't we hope and dream? Of course, even without \nnuclear weapons, we know that in World War I and World War II tens of \nmillions of people lost their lives in armed conflict. So it is not as \nif a world without nuclear weapons is a world without war and a world \nwithout danger for peace-loving nations such as ours and our allies.\n  We also know that any number of foreign policy experts have expressed \nserious reservations about indulging in this fantasy of a world without \nnuclear weapons.\n  George Kennan has said:\n\n       The evil of these utopian enthusiasms was not only or even \n     primarily the wasted time, the misplaced emphasis, the \n     encouragement of false hopes. The evil lay primarily in the \n     fact that those enthusiasms distracted our gaze for the real \n     things that were happening. . . .The cultivation of these \n     utopian schemes, flattering to our own image of ourselves, \n     took place at the expense of our feeling for reality.\n\n  The President of the United States has not only mused about fantastic \nnotions that have no basis in the real world, he has criticized his own \ncountry on foreign soil so often that some called that particular trip \n``the world apology tour.''\n  So what should our competitors and would-be adversaries make of these \nstatements of a fantasy world that is nuclear free and a President who \ntravels abroad and apologizes for America's strength? Regretfully, I \ncan only conclude it sends an impression of weakness and a lack of \ndetermination to maintain America's leadership in the world. We know \nthere are dangerous consequences associated with an interpretation by \nothers that America has lost its resolve to lead the world or to \nmaintain its own security and to protect its allies.\n  President Reagan said famously:\n\n       We maintain the peace through our strength; weakness only \n     invites aggression.\n\n  Experience has proven the truth of those words.\n  We should recall that the President of the United States conducted \nYouTube diplomacy by recording a video for Iran's leaders--but then \nwithheld comment when those same leaders were brutally crushing a pro-\ndemocracy movement and their own people's hopes for freedom.\n  The President has treated several of our allies without the respect \nthey deserve. Some have been, like Britain, slighted; others, like \nIsrael, have been lectured; and other of our allies have been thrown \nunder the bus on missile defense, like Poland and the Czech Republic.\n  He has been so idealistic and naive, you might say, about the subject \nof nuclear weapons that President Sarkozy of France remarked about it \npublicly at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. He said:\n\n       We live in the real world, not in a virtual one. . . .\n       President Obama himself has said that he dreams of a world \n     without nuclear weapons.\n       Before our very eyes, two countries are doing exactly the \n     opposite at this very moment.\n\n  President Sarkozy said:\n\n       Since 2005, Iran has violated five Security Council \n     Resolutions. . . .\n\n  He said:\n\n       I support America's ``extended hand.'' But what have these \n     proposals for dialogue produced for the international \n     community?\n       Nothing but more enriched uranium and more centrifuges.\n       And last but not least, it has resulted in a statement by \n     Iranian leaders calling for wiping off the map a Member of \n     the United Nations.\n\n  I fear the New START treaty will serve as another data point in the \nnarrative of weakness, pursuing diplomacy for its own sake--or \nindulging in a utopian dream of a world without nuclear weapons, \ndivorced from hard reality.\n  Last week, I mentioned that Doug Feith, formerly of the Defense \nDepartment, helped negotiate the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, \nknown as the SORT treaty. Mr. Feith said that during the negotiations \nof the SORT treaty, the Russians were constantly trying to get the \nUnited States to negotiate away our right to defend ourselves from \nmissile attacks through a robust missile defense program.\n  The Bush administration rightly rejected those Russian demands and--\nyou know what--we got a good treaty anyway. The Obama administration, \non the other hand, gave Russia what it wanted--or what it says it \nwanted--among other concessions. But that is not the only concession \nthat was given under the New START treaty.\n\n  I would ask my colleagues, Where are the concessions that Russia made \nto us in this treaty? Where are the concessions that Russia made to us? \nAnd what in the treaty is a good deal for the United States?\n  But my colleagues may reply, So what. So what if the Obama \nadministration's world view is a little bit naive. So what if the \nRussians negotiated a much better deal for themselves than the Obama \nadministration got for the United States. Shouldn't we go ahead and \napprove the treaty anyway? What harm could it do? Couldn't it help \nbuild a better relationship with the Russian Federation and help \ntransform America's reputation in the world?\n  Those are actually good questions. But the answers are sobering. The \nadministration has long argued that its approach to diplomacy was not \nonly\n\n[[Page S10948]]\n\ngood for its own sake, but it would strengthen relationships with \nnations all around the world. I would ask you, how has that worked out?\n  Charles Krauthammer reviewed the global response to President Obama's \ndiplomatic overtures in this way. He said:\n\n       Unilateral American concessions and offers of unconditional \n     engagement have moved neither Iran nor Russia nor North Korea \n     to accommodate us.\n       Nor have the Arab states--or even the powerless Palestinian \n     Authority--offered so much as a gesture of accommodation in \n     response to heavy and gratuitous American pressure on Israel.\n       Nor have even our Europe allies responded: They have anted \n     up essentially nothing in response to our pleas for more \n     assistance in Afghanistan.\n\n  And, of course, we could look at the results of the New START treaty \nitself. Russian leaders have responded to American concessions with \ncontempt. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said that the \ntreaty ``cannot be opened up and become the subject of new \nnegotiations.'' Prime Minister Putin has threatened a new arms race if \nRussia does not get its way with this version of the treaty. Russian \nleaders have the temerity to lecture and attempt to intimidate the \nSenate from discharging our constitutional responsibilities. We should \nnot succumb.\n  In deciding whether to vote for the treaty, I would respectfully ask \nwhether some Senators have been asking themselves the wrong question. \nInstead of asking ourselves the question, Why not ratify? What is the \nharm? I would suggest that the better question is, Why should we? I \nwould urge my colleagues to vote against this treaty not because I do \nnot care about the message it will send to Russia and other nations but \nbecause I do care about that message, and it is time we stop sending a \nmessage of weakness that only encourages our adversaries.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this treaty, to require the \nadministration to go back to the negotiating table with the Russians, \nto get a better deal for the United States, and to make clear that the \nera of unilateral American concessions is over.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would simply ask to get a sense of how \nlong the Senator thinks he might speak. We might line up the next \nspeaker.\n  Mr. VITTER. Five minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenator from Louisiana is finished, the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nNelson, be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I too am opposing the ratification of this \nNew START treaty because I think it makes us less secure, not more \nsecure, as a nation. Of course, that has to be the ultimate test.\n  A toughly negotiated, balanced treaty with Russia which allowed for \nadequate and reliable inspections and data exchange could make us more \nsecure. But this is not such a treaty. It is clear to me that President \nObama went into negotiations willing to give up almost anything for a \ntreaty, and that basic posture produced what it always will--a bad deal \nfor us.\n  The proponents of the treaty suggest as much when they lay out as \ntheir top arguments for ratification: a better relationship with \nRussia, the help from Russia on other issues that ratification could \nengender, and progress with world opinion.\n  I think it is dangerous to count on any of that or to look at all \nbeyond the four corners of the treaty--the pros and cons of the details \nand the substance of the treaty itself.\n  When I look within the four corners of the treaty, I am particularly \nconcerned about four cons of the treaty.\n  First, serious roadblocks to missile defense: I think it is a \nfundamental mistake and a dangerous precedent for any treaty on \noffensive arms to even mention missile defense, and Russia has made it \nclear that any major progress on U.S. missile defense will cause them \nto leave the treaty. Particularly with President Obama in office, this \ncreates real political obstacles to the full missile defense I support \nand the American people support in great numbers. Indeed, President \nObama has already abandoned our missile defense sites in Eastern Europe \nto help produce an agreement on this treaty by the Russians.\n  Second, fundamentally imbalanced arms reductions: In this treaty, we \nreduce our nuclear arms significantly; Russia stays where they already \nare. Meanwhile, we still aren't getting to the issue of tactical \nweapons, a category where Russia has a huge 10-to-1 advantage. We have \ntalked about that for decades, and we still aren't getting there. \nClearly, when the United States has leverage to commit Russia to reduce \ntheir tactical nuclear weapons as we do right now before this treaty, \nand those nuclear weapons are the most vulnerable to end up in \nterrorists' hands, we must use that leverage and not throw it away for \nU.S. and global security. Instead, proponents of this treaty argue that \na further treaty addressing tactical nuclear weapons in the future will \nmaterialize, but the leverage we have to get there is being given up, \nessentially, with this treaty.\n  Third, inability to verify: This treaty does not give us the \ninspections and data we need to verify Russian compliance, and we know \nRussia has cheated on every previous arms control treaty with us. \nVerification is clearly less under New START than in START I, but it \nnow needs to be greater because the nuclear deterrent under this treaty \nwould be much smaller and thus produce much less room for error.\n  Fourth and finally, major but ultimately inadequate progress on \nnuclear modernization: Now, major progress has been made during the \nratification debate on the administration's commitment and concrete \nplans for nuclear modernization. I thank everyone who has helped \nproduce that, particularly the leader in that effort, Senator Jon Kyl, \nfor his work which, again, did produce real progress. But, ultimately, \nneither the specificity of the administration's commitment, including \non the nuclear triad issue, nor the proposed schedule is adequate to \nour security needs, so I will certainly continue fighting to get where \nwe need to be.\n  So, in closing, I urge my colleagues to look hard at this treaty and \nto ask the only ultimate question: Does it make us less secure or more \nsecure? I think clearly for the four major reasons I have outlined, and \nothers, it makes us less secure, and we need to do far better.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise in support of the New \nSTART treaty. I wish to make a comment. I was raised in a time that \nwhen the President of the United States went abroad, he spoke for our \ncountry and there was no partisanship when that occurred.\n  It is troubling to this Senator to hear comments about our President \nwhen he goes abroad in an apology tour. I would beg to differ, and I \nthink we ought to rise above that partisanship when issues of national \nsecurity are at stake.\n  Now to the treaty. This agreement with Russia is going to strengthen \nour national security. Look at all the people in the Pentagon who have \nembraced it--the former Secretaries of State, the former Secretaries of \nDefense, from both sides of the political aisle, and it deserves our \nsupport too. I expect today we are going to get an overwhelming \nbipartisan vote in favor of this treaty.\n  I wish to specifically address the question that has been raised \nabout modernization of our nuclear stockpile--an issue I had the \nprivilege, as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed \nServices Committee, to be engaged in over a 4-year period. Arguments \nhave been made that somehow this treaty is going to interfere with the \nmodernization of our nuclear weapons infrastructure. Well, it is \nexactly the opposite. Ratification of this treaty is so important to \ngive security and stability to the question of the use of those nuclear \nweapons that it will allow us to spend the needed resources on the \nmodernization of our nuclear complex, which is an equally important \nmatter.\n  As part of this year's Nuclear Posture Review, the administration has\n\n[[Page S10949]]\n\nmade a commitment to modernize our nuclear weapons arsenal and the \ncomplex. We must do so to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent because \nas these weapons in stockpile age, we have to update them and we have \nto modernize them so they are effective, secure, but also safe. We need \nto be sure our nuclear weapons are going to work as designed and that \nthey will remain stable and secure.\n  In the past, when we maintained a larger and more expensive nuclear \nstockpile, our weapons were developed and tested frequently. That is \nvery expensive. By the mid-1990s, we had developed sophisticated \ncomputer models that can identify and resolve the problems without the \nnuclear testing. Unfortunately, because of lessened funding back in the \nera of about 2006 that research diminished, resulting in the layoffs of \na lot of the people in our National Labs. I have had the privilege of \nvisiting those three National Labs. There is an incredible array of \ntalent, but that is what happened back in 2006.\n  I think we have, especially in this administration, a new resolve to \nturning the situation around and to modernizing the nuclear complex. So \nwhat does this modernization entail? The comprehensive plan includes an \n$85 billion investment over the next decade and a $4 billion increase \nover the next 5 years, and that investment is going to accomplish \nseveral things. It is going to fund the construction of the 21st \ncentury uranium and plutonium processing facilities, it is going to \nspur a reinvestment in the scientists and engineers who perform the \nmission, and it is going to enhance the lifetime extension program for \nour nuclear weapons. By the way, it is not only just extending the life \nof those weapons, it is also making them safer.\n  Some Senators have expressed concerns about the level of funding for \nthis modernization. I believe our President and this administration \nhave adequately addressed those concerns, and I would note that the \nDirectors of the three labs--Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and \nSandia--all believe the administration's current plan will allow them \nto execute their requirements for ensuring a safe, secure, reliable, \nand effective stockpile.\n  While we move forward with that modernization program, we should also \nmove forward--it is a separate issue--with the treaty. Passing this \ntreaty is going to safeguard our national security while demonstrating \nto the men and women of our nuclear complex that we have reached a \nnational consensus on nuclear sustainability.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that cosponsors be \nadded to Corker amendment No. 4904, as modified, as follows: Senator \nLieberman, Senator Brown of Massachusetts, and Senator Murkowski.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are awaiting the Senator from Arizona \nwho, I know, is working on a couple of things right now. We need to \nclear a couple of things with the Senator, and we are working on the \npossibility of accepting his amendment. We just need to tie up those \nloose ends.\n  So I think the Senator from Wyoming may have had a request he wanted \nto make. We can do that now, and then we will see where we are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the importance \nof Minutemen III intercontinental ballistic missiles, known as ICBMs, \nand an amendment I intend to offer. The ICBM is just one leg of our \nnuclear triad. The nuclear triad spans sea, air, and land. It relies on \nmobile bombers, hard-to-detect ballistic missile submarines, and ICBMs. \nThey all work together to complicate and deter any attempt at a \nsuccessful first strike on our country. Like a stool, if you shorten \njust one leg too much, the stool will become unstable.\n  Our nuclear triad is not just a weapons system, it is a deterrent. \nThe further we weaken our nuclear forces, the less of a deterrent our \ntriad will become.\n  Those folks who believe in nuclear zero and arms control seek a world \nwithout nuclear weapons at any expense--in my opinion, never at the \nexpense of our national security. The fact is, for over 50 years our \nICBM force has deterred a nuclear attack against the United States and \nour allies.\n  Some arms control supporters claim our ICBMs are on ``hair-trigger \nalert.'' They believe an ICBM can be launched by simply pushing a \nbutton. This misleading claim that an unauthorized launch can destroy \nthe world in a matter of minutes could not be further from the truth.\n  GEN Kevin Chilton, the outgoing commander of STRATCOM, once described \nour nuclear posture as:\n\n       The weapon is in the holster . . . the holster has two \n     combination locks on it, it takes two people to open those \n     locks, and they can't do it without authenticated orders from \n     the President of the United States.\n\n  The Minuteman III ICBM force is the most stabilizing leg of the \nnuclear triad.\n  ICBMs are strategically located and broadly dispersed in order to \nprevent them from successfully being attacked. The ICBMs protect the \nsurvivability of other legs of the triad as a deterrent. They offer an \numbrella of protection to our most-valued allies. ICBMs also represent \nthe most cost-effective delivery systems the United States processes. \nUnlike a bomber, ICBMs ensure a second attack capability.\n  As required by section 1251 of the 2010 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, earlier this year, the administration submitted its \nforce structure plan. The President's 1251 force structure plan \nprovides up to 420 ICBMs, 14 submarines carrying up to 240 submarine-\nlaunched ballistic missiles or SLBMs, and up to 60 nuclear-capable \nheavy bombers.\n  We are being asked to ratify this treaty without knowing what our \nforce structure will actually be. We are being told: Pass the treaty, \nand then we will tell you what the force structure will actually look \nlike.\n  The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review laid out our force structure in plain \nview, while the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review is silent on the force \nstructure.\n  This report also laid out the administration's plan to modernize and \nmaintain our nuclear delivery vehicles.\n  With respect to the next generation of ICBMs, the update states:\n\n       While a decision on an ICBM follow-on is not needed for \n     several years, preparatory analysis is needed and is in fact \n     now underway. This work will consider a range of deployment \n     options, with the objective of defining a cost-effective \n     approach for an ICBM follow-on that supports continued \n     reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons while promoting stable \n     deterrence.\n\n  The amendment I plan to offer has no impact on the treaty. It simply \nrequires the President to certify that further reductions in our land-\nbased strategic nuclear deterrent will not be considered when reviewing \nthe options for a follow-on ICBM. This is something I have worked on \nwith Senator Conrad. He has a second-degree amendment to mine, and it \nis something we both support.\n  LTG Frank Klotz, the new commander of Global Strike Command, was \nquoted last year at the Air Force Air and Space Conference and \nTechnology Exposition here in Washington, DC, as saying:\n\n       Continuously on alert and deployed in 450 widely dispersed \n     locations, the size and characteristics of the overall \n     Minuteman III force presents any potential adversary with an \n     almost insurmountable challenge should he contemplate \n     attacking the United States. Because he cannot disarm the \n     ICBM force without nearly exhausting his own forces in the \n     process, and at the same time, leaving himself vulnerable to \n     our sea-launched ballistic missiles and bombers, he has no \n     incentive to strike in the first place. In this case, numbers \n     do matter . . . and the ICBM thus contributes immeasurably to \n     both deterrence and stability in a crisis.\n\n  The force structure of our nuclear triad is critical to maintaining \nan effective deterrent.\n  In 2008, Secretary Gates coauthored a white paper titled ``National \nSecurity and Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century.'' This paper argued \nfor a strong nuclear deterrent. The forward stated:\n\n       We believe the logic presented here provides a sound basis \n     on which this and future administrations can consider further \n     adjustments to U.S. nuclear weapons policy, strategy, and \n     force structure.\n\n  The white paper by Secretary Gates recommended a U.S. strategic \nnuclear force baseline that includes 450 Minuteman III ICBMs, 14 Ohio \nclass submarines, and 76 bombers, 20 B-2 and 26\n\n[[Page S10950]]\n\nB-52 bombers, for a total of 862. The administration cannot explain how \nthe threat environment has changed since the 2008 recommendation to \nmaintain 862 delivery vehicles. They cannot explain what has changed to \nallow our nuclear deterrent to be reduced to 700 delivery vehicles.\n  It sounds to me as if this administration has been a little too eager \nin negotiating the treaty.\n  James Woolsey, in a recent Wall Street Journal article, described his \nexperiences negotiating with the Russians. He said:\n\n       The Soviets taught me that, when dealing with Russian \n     counterparts, don't appear eager--friendly, yes, eager, \n     never.\n\n  I think Mr. Woolsey would know; he was involved in the SALT I treaty \nin 1970 and many more arms control agreements with the Russians before \nhe took over as the Director of Central Intelligence.\n  I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 4880, a Barrasso-\nEnzi amendment, and then a second-degree by Senator Conrad.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the Senator knows, we had a discussion \nabout this, and I am constrained to object. I think he understands why. \nI welcome further debate if he would like, but I must object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the issue, as it is \nimportant. I understand its importance to the part of the country where \nthose particular weapons are housed today. I am confident--and I know \nthis--that the administration, because we have talked about it, has a \nplan that I think will meet with the consent and approval of the \nSenators' concern, but they need to go through the further evaluation \nand analysis of all of these decisions. Decisions have not yet been \nmade, and it would be inappropriate at this time to constrain the \nlatitude they need in order to be able to make those judgments. It is \nan important issue, but I think it is inappropriate for us to constrain \nthem and particularly to do so in the context of the treaty itself.\n  Mr. President, we are working with our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle to really try to get the final agreement as to how we are \ngoing to proceed. I believe it is going to be possible for us to work \nout the issues with Senator Kyl and his amendment. So I hope we will \nnot need any other votes other than the final vote on the treaty. That \nis our hope at this point. We will try to work through that over the \ncourse of the next few minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, knowing that we are getting to that moment \nat which point we are going to have an understanding of how we are \nproceeding forward and knowing that because of the 30-hour limitation, \nno matter what, we are getting toward the end, rather than chew up time \nfor Senators later on, I thought I would take a moment now to say thank \nyou to a few folks involved in this process. Before I do that, I also \nwill reserve some time, as I will for Senator Kyl and Senator Lugar--\nand this, I assume, will be part of the agreement we are going to \nreach--to speak to the substance of the treaty at the appropriate time \nbefore we vote.\n  It has been an incredible team effort by an awful lot of people over \nthe course of a lot of months. I wish to thank all of them for their \ninvolvement.\n  Senator Lugar has been an unbelievable partner and a visionary with \nrespect to these issues but, importantly, just a very steady, wise, and \nthoughtful collaborator in the effort to get the treaty to where we are \ntoday. It hasn't always been easy for him because there were times when \nhe was a lonely voice with respect to those who were prepared to \nsupport this treaty. I wish to pay tribute to his statesmanship and his \npersonal courage in steadily hanging in there with us.\n  I thank President Obama for his determination to make certain that \nthis was the priority that he felt it was and that I think it is. He \nand so many folks in the administration have been helpful in this \neffort.\n  I will reserve some comments later more specifically, but I think the \nVice President has been, at the President's request, an invaluable \ncollaborator in this effort. He has talked to any number of colleagues, \nmade any number of phone calls, been involved in any number of \nstrategic choices here, and I am deeply grateful to him for taking his \nprior stewardship of this committee and being as thoughtful as he has \nbeen in the way he has approached this particular treaty.\n  Secretary Clinton likewise has dedicated herself and her staff to the \neffort to work through unbelievable numbers of questions, to make \nthemselves available and to make herself available to talk with \ncolleagues.\n  This has been a tremendous team effort with Secretary Gates, \nSecretary Chu, Admiral Mullen, General Chilton, LTG O'Reilly, and \nothers. None of these things can happen if there isn't a team pulling \ntogether to answer questions and deal with the issues colleagues have.\n  At the State Department, Assistant Secretary Rose Gottemoeller has \nbeen unbelievably available, patient, thoughtful, and very detailed in \nher efforts to answer the questions of Senators and be precise about \nthis negotiation. She led a tremendous team and worked very closely \nwith Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs Rich Verma, \nwho likewise helped coordinate and pull people together to deal with \nthe issues we faced. Dave Turk, Terri Lodge, Paul Dean, and Marcie Ries \nhave all been key members of that team, and we thank them for their \namazing commitment of hours and the dedication they have shown to the \neffort to try to get us to where we are today, to this final vote.\n  Likewise, at the Pentagon, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Jim \nMiller; the chief Defense Department representative on the negotiating \nteam, Ted Warner; Marcell Lettre; Eric Pierce; Michael Elliott; and \nChris Comeau--all of them, together with the State Department, provided \nthe kind of linkage we needed and the consistent effort to answer \nquestions and deal with their principals in order to get the \ninformation necessary for Senators to be able to make good judgments.\n  At the Energy Department, Tom D'Agostino and Kurt Siemon were also \nconstantly available.\n  At the White House, I thank Pete Rouse, chief of staff, and Tom \nDonilon, the National Security Adviser, and I especially thank Brian \nMcKeon, Vice President Biden's National Security Deputy, who has just \ndone an extraordinary job of helping to provide the bridge between \nvarious agencies, as well as strategy, and has been consistently \navailable to us. Louisa Terrell and Jon Wolfsthal have been part of \nthat team. We are very grateful to all of them.\n  On the Foreign Relations Committee, it has been a great team effort \nwith Senator Lugar. The chief of staff of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Frank Lowenstein, has worked countless hours on this treaty, \ntogether with Doug Frantz, Ed Levine, and Anthony Wier. These two \ngentlemen, Ed Levine and Anthony Wier, are unbelievable veterans of \nthis kind of effort. They worked with Senator Biden for years. I am \ndelighted they were willing to stay over and continue with the \ncommittee.\n  In the case of Ed Levine, he lost his dad during the course of this \ndebate a few days ago and, nevertheless, hung in there with us and \nstayed right at it. The wisdom and experience he has brought to this \ntask is invaluable, together with his collaborator Anthony Wier. Peter \nScoblic, Andrew Keller, Jason Bruder, and Jen Berlin have been enormous \ncontributors to this effort. I am grateful to all of them.\n  On the Republican side, Ken Myers--Ken brings so much experience and \nwisdom to this task. He has been with Senator Lugar for a long time. \nWhat he has done to help us bridge the divide is immeasurable. Tom \nMoore and Mike Mattler worked with him.\n  Our staff in S-116, which has sort of been headquarters for us, Meg \nMurphy\n\n[[Page S10951]]\n\nand Matt Dixon have put up with strange hours and interruptions. We are \neternally grateful to them.\n  Obviously, nothing happens in the Senate without the floor staff, the \nfolks who put in these long hours. Jessica Lewis and Tommy Ross on \nSenator Reid's staff have been invaluable to us. Lula Davis, Tim \nMitchell, and Stacy Rich are invaluable on every issue here. The Senate \nwould not work without them. We are deeply grateful to all these \npeople.\n  I am glad the schedule allows us a moment where we can actually thank \nthem all publicly. They do a service for our country that many people \nin the country never have a sense of. They do not see it. Government \ngets a lot of criticism, but let me tell you, these folks work as hard \nas any people I know anywhere, and a lot of things could not happen \nwithout them.\n  As I said, I wish to speak to the substance of the treaty before we \nvote, but for the moment I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to seize the moment, along with my \ndistinguished chairman, because we are indebted to all the great people \nhe has enumerated, to embellish his congratulations by mentioning that \nwe are grateful, first of all, that the President invited Senator Kerry \nand me to be part of conversations on two occasions during the \nnegotiation of the treaty. That, we thought, was very valuable and gave \nus some insight as to where the negotiators were headed and to offer \nwhat counsel we could about those issues we felt were important and \nthose issues we were certain all Senators would feel were important as \nwe sought ratification of the New START treaty.\n  Likewise, those conversations were carried on rigorously by the Vice \nPresident, our former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Joe Biden, who has worked with Senator Kerry and with me \nover the course of three decades or so of active participation and \nseveral arms control treaties. Vice President Biden has a very good \nidea of how the ratification process works and what counsel he can \ngive, not only to us but to all Members and colleagues with whom he has \nworked so well in the past.\n  I am especially pleased, likewise, that Rose Gottemoeller, who headed \nthe negotiation team, has been very available to Senators throughout \nthe time of the negotiation abroad and during her trips to Washington \nand certainly throughout the hearings the Foreign Relations Committee \nheld.\n  We are indebted, in fact, to all the witnesses who came before our \ncommittee in the 16 hearings that have often been enumerated in \nconversation on the floor. The witnesses were generous with their time, \nvery forthcoming with their testimony and followup questions the \nSenators had. Because of that testimony, there is a very solid block of \nsupport for the treaty based upon these distinguished Americans who \nhave had enormous experience, not only with arms control treaties but \nthe actual implementation of these with the former Soviet Union--and \nnow with Russia--in the past.\n  I am indebted, as John Kerry is, to Ken Myers, Tom Moore and Mike \nMattler of our staff and to Marik String and Corey Gill. I cite these \nfive members of a very devoted staff who have devoted extraordinary \ntalents and time and devotion to the treaty formulation and to the \ncounsel they have given me, for which I am very much indebted.\n  Finally, I thank all the members of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee for their diligence and attendance at hearings and their \nquestioning of each other, as well as the witnesses and the discussions \nwe have had both in informal and formal sessions. We have had a \ndifference of opinions. Our views were not unanimous in the 14-to-4 \nvote by which the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent this New \nSTART treaty to the floor. But I respect deeply each of those views, \nand I respect the ways in which members of the committee have \nparticipated during this very important debate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I say Merry Christmas to all my \ncolleagues. We never expected to find ourselves here this time of year, \nbut obviously there are very important issues to discuss.\n  On November 2, Americans made a pretty historic statement. After 2 \nyears of many things being crammed down their throat that they did not \nlike, they made historic changes in the House and the Senate. I think \nall expectations were that the new Congress would come in and begin to \nchange things. Very few Americans--and I think very few of us in the \nSenate--actually thought we would use the time between that election \nand the swearing in of the new Members of Congress to continue to cram \nthrough more things America does not want.\n  Most businesses have learned that if they ever have to make the \ndifficult decision of firing someone, it is very important that person \nbe sent home right away because getting fired usually makes people \nangry and less loyal to the company that fired them. Instead of dealing \nwith all the mischief that might occur, the fired employee is sent home \nright away.\n  We are a fired Congress in a lot of ways. America has sent us home. \nMany people who set the policies for the last 2 years have been \nunelected. Some have retired. But the decisions that are being made now \nin this Congress are decisions being made by people who have either \nretired or who have been turned out of office. So much is being pushed \nthrough because of the fear that if we actually let the newly elected \nCongressmen and Senators be sworn in before we take up these important \nissues that they will actually reflect the opinions of the American \npeople and stop what we are doing.\n\n  We have decided to use this lameduck session to push many items \nthrough. It is a very unaccountable Congress. We tried to push through \na huge omnibus spending bill with thousands of earmarks, exactly the \nthing about which Americans have said no more. Thankfully, Republicans \nstood together to stop that bill.\n  We needed to extend our current tax rates, but even in order to get a \ntemporary extension, we in the minority had to agree to more deficit \nspending. In this lameduck session, we have pushed our political \ncorrectness on to our military by repealing don't ask, don't tell \nwithout the proper studies, without the proper phase-in time, and no \nrational approach to this. It was just check the box of another \npolitical payback.\n  In another check the box of amnesty, the DREAM Act, which was brought \nup and fortunately Republicans stood against something that again \navoided the big issue of border security. This Congress has \ncontinuously rejected the idea of carrying through on our own law to \ncomplete the double-layer fencing we put into law to protect the \nsouthern border. Thousands of people are being killed on the border \nbecause we refuse to take action. Yet we are continuing to try to \nexpand the problem with more amnesty and citizenship and public \nbenefits to those who came here illegally.\n  The threat is now to keep us here until Christmas or beyond to pass \nwhat we are calling a 9/11 bill. Every Member of this Chamber--\nRepublicans and Democrats--wants to do what is right for the first \nresponders who may have been injured after 9/11. But we owe it to the \nAmerican people to be accountable to how we spend money. To put a bill \non the floor, in an unaccountable lameduck Congress, that has not been \nthrough hearings, when we do not know how the millions of dollars have \nbeen used that we have already given to the same cause certainly is \nworth a few weeks of committee hearings and understanding exactly how \nto spend taxpayer money effectively in a way we know will help the \npeople who have been injured.\n  But, no, we have to push that through in a fired, unaccountable \nCongress. Of course, now the big issue of the day is somehow, in a time \nof economic recession and so many people being out of work, that we \nwant to use this lameduck, unaccountable Congress to push through a \nmajor arms control treaty with Russia. Somehow that ended up on the top \nof our priority list, using Christmas as a backstop to try to force us \nto pass this bill.\n  It is pretty interesting how this has progressed. The treaty had no \nchance of ratification until the President\n\n[[Page S10952]]\n\nagreed to billions of dollars in modernization of our nuclear weapons.\n  We have to stop and ask ourselves: Why should we have to have \nbackroom trading going on to modernize our nuclear weapons? That should \nbe something the President is committed to, that we are committed to. \nWe should not have to trade for modernization. But now we appear to \nhave enough Republicans who have decided this is a good treaty to \nratify a few days before Christmas in a fired, unaccountable Congress, \nwith the need to push it through before America's representatives \nactually get here the first of January. The sense here is if we let the \npeople America just elected come, that maybe the treaty will need some \nmodifications.\n  There have been many questions expressed about the treaty. I think \nsome of them are very legitimate. Clearly, missile defense is a \nproblem. The Russians have expressed that Americans cannot develop any \nkind of comprehensive missile defense system under this treaty. We say: \nNo, no. We can develop a limited missile defense system. We are going \nthrough all kinds of convoluted language to put things in nonbinding \nareas of this agreement, to say we are committed or we are going to \ncommunicate to the Russians that we are committed, but we even were \nunwilling to put it in the preamble that there is no linkage between \nthe development of our missile defense system and this treaty \nagreement. Clearly, there is a linkage. The Russians believe there is a \nlinkage.\n  All the correspondence from the President says ``limited missile \ndefense system.'' We obviously have agreed to it. We never could get \nthe negotiating records to confirm that, but everything suggests there \nis an implicit and explicit agreement that America will not attempt to \ndevelop a missile defense system capable of defending against Russian \nmissiles. Perhaps capable of defending against a rogue missile launch \nor an accidental missile launch, but the language in this treaty, \ncommunications from the White House, the hearings all say we will only \nhave a limited missile defense system.\n  There should be no mistake, there should be no confusion, the \nagreement to this treaty is an agreement for America not to develop a \ncomprehensive missile defense system. If that is satisfactory, then \nlet's ratify. Clearly, there are holes in the verification process of \nthis treaty. The growing and biggest threat is tactical nuclear \nweapons. Shorter range missiles, ground-based, sub-based are not even \nincluded in this agreement. The Russians are fine with this. They were \ngoing down to the same long-range missile count we require in this \ntreaty anyway. They give up nothing. We don't restrict any of their \ntactical developments. The verification is less stringent than in START \nI, with fewer inspections, and the ability to actually look at things \nsuch as telemetry are obviously omitted here.\n\n  We can't ratify this treaty with any pretense that America is going \nto be any safer. In fact, I think the biggest problem with this treaty \nis the whole presumption it is built on--that America should be at \nparity with Russia. We have talked about it here in this Chamber, that \nwe do not have the same role as Russia in this world. Russia is a \nprotector of none and a threat to many. America is the protector of \nmany and a threat to none. Over 30 countries live in peace under our \nnuclear umbrella, but we are saying we are going to reduce it, with a \nlot of questions as to whether we are going to modernize it, and we are \ntelling our allies that tactical nuclear weapons are not going to be \nrestricted in any way, which is probably their biggest concern because \nof their contiguous location to Russia.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. When you talk about the missile defense aspect of this, I \nwonder if it has occurred to a lot of people that maybe this treaty is \nwith the wrong people. We know right now that Iran is going to have the \ncapability--and this is not even classified--of a nuclear weapon, a \ndelivery system, by 2015. I think one of the worst things for America--\nand this President did it--was to take down the sites we were planning \nin Poland that would give us this protection.\n  My point I want to make, and then to ask the Senator about, is that \nin the event this is ratified and we are restricted in any way from \ndeveloping further our missile defense system, doesn't that put us \ndirectly in an impaired position in terms of North Korea, maybe Syria, \nbut definitely Iran, that has already indicated and already has the \ncapability of reaching us by that time?\n  It is interesting that the site would have been in effect to knock \ndown a missile coming from Iran by 2015, the same year our intelligence \ncommunity tells us they will have that capability. Isn't that the \nthreat we are concerned about, more than Russia?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I want to thank the Senator from Oklahoma for bringing \nout another very important point. We are laser focused on this treaty \nwith Russia, which obviously restricts our ability to develop missile \ndefense. Yet we all seem to acknowledge the greatest growing threat in \nthis world is from Iran and North Korea and other rogue nations that \ncan develop nuclear technology.\n  It is almost like watching a magician at play here, of getting us to \nlook at one hand while other things are going on. We are not paying \nattention to the Nation's business here, and I am afraid this is just \nanother ``check the box''--a foreign policy victory for the \nadministration. If it did not have so many questions related to it, \nthat would be fine, but not to jam this through with a fired, \nunaccountable Congress, and rushing it through before the \nrepresentatives America just elected have been sworn in, and doing it \nas part of a list of legislation--a long list over the last 2 years--\nthat America does not want.\n  I want good relations with Russia and countries all over the world, \nbut I am afraid this is part of a continued effort of accommodation and \nappeasement; that if we show weakness, other countries will accommodate \nus. We need Russia to cooperate--with Russia and North Korea. Folks, I \ndon't think this is the way to get it, and I don't think we are going \nto gain respect for our process of trying to do this under the cover of \na distraction of a major holiday with a lameduck, unaccountable \nCongress.\n  In the way this is being presented, it is a mockery of the debate \nprocess here in the Senate. We are not amending a treaty. We were told \nat the outset it is ``take it or leave it.'' The Russians are \nnegotiating, clearly, from a position of strength, because they said, \nhere is the treaty, take it or leave it; any changes and the treaty is \ndead. Is that the way America needs to deal with other countries? Is \nthat the way the Senate should debate a major arms control agreement, \nwhere the majority party is saying, you can go talk about it if you \nwant, but we are going to kill every amendment, even though we say we \nagree with a lot of them. There will be no changes in this.\n  We are trying to stick some things in here in the areas of the treaty \nthat have no binding aspect and say we have covered it, but we are \nmaking a mockery of the whole debate and ratification processes with an \nunaccountable, fired Congress, under the cover of Christmas, and a \ndebate where we have been told ``take it or leave it.'' This is not \nwhat the Senate is about, this is not what Congress is supposed to be \nabout, and certainly we should not be passing major legislation at this \ntime of year with this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I still hope my \ncolleagues will come to their senses and show the American people that \nwe are going to act in a responsible way that respects what they told \nus on November 2; that this Congress needs to go, a new one needs to \ncome in, and we need to stop cramming things down their throats they do \nnot want.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet of Colorado). The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are now in the final throes of getting \ntogether a unanimous consent request. The leadership has asked us to \nproceed forward on the amendment. Senator Kyl has asked me--I think he \nwanted to be here when we do his amendment on modernization, which we \nare now prepared to accept, with further modification. So I will wait \nfor Senator Kyl in order to do that.\n  In the meantime, I understand we also have an agreement on the \nmissile\n\n[[Page S10953]]\n\ndefense amendment, and that amendment is now going to be cosponsored by \nSenator Lieberman and Senator McCain. So if the Senator from Tennessee \nwants to talk about that amendment, we are prepared to accept it. I \nthink we should have the discussion of that amendment at this point in \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to at this moment ask unanimous \nconsent to change the name of the amendment to McCain-Lieberman-Corker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. I would also ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nJohanns, Levin, and Bayh as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4904, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would send to the desk the amendment, as \nmodified, and as I understand it, this has been accepted by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Hearing no objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subsection (a) of the Resolution of \n     Ratification, add the following:\n       (11) Effectiveness and viability of new start treaty and \n     united states missile defenses.--Prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate, and at the time of the exchange of instruments of \n     ratification shall communicate to the Russian Federation, \n     that it is the policy of the United States to continue \n     development and deployment of United States missile defense \n     systems to defend against missile threats from nations such \n     as North Korea and Iran, including qualitative and \n     quantitative improvements to such systems. Such systems \n     include all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defenses in Europe, the modernization of the Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense System, and the continued development of \n     the Two-stage Ground-based Interceptor as a technological and \n     strategic hedge. The United States believes that these \n     systems do not and will not threaten the strategic balance \n     with the Russian Federation. Consequently, while the United \n     States cannot circumscribe the sovereign rights of the \n     Russian Federation under paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the \n     Treaty, the United States believes continued improvement and \n     deployment of United States missile defense systems do not \n     constitute a basis for questioning the effectiveness and \n     viability of the Treaty, and therefore would not give rise to \n     circumstances justifying the withdrawal of the Russian \n     Federation from the Treaty.\n       At the end of subsection (b)(1)(C), strike ``United \n     States.'' and insert the following: ``United States; and\n       (D) the preamble of the New START Treaty does not impose a \n     legal obligation on the parties.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would ask, before we proceed on that--\nbecause Senator Kyl is now here, so we could quickly accept his \namendment and dispose of that--I ask unanimous consent that we call up \nKyl amendment No. 4892, as modified--as additionally modified.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. KERRY. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4892, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe at the desk now is the Kyl \namendment, as modified.\n  I am sorry about the confusion. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that we be able to immediately proceed to the Kyl amendment. We \nwill come right back to the Corker amendment, but I ask unanimous \nconsent to proceed to the Kyl amendment, as modified, with the \nmodification that has been submitted at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4892), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subsection (a), add the following:\n       (11) Design and funding of certain facilities.--Prior to \n     the entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that the President intends to--\n       (A) accelerate to the extent possible the design and \n     engineering phase of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement (CMRR) building and the Uranium Processing \n     Facility (UPF); and\n       (B) request full funding, including on a multi-year basis \n     as appropriate, for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility upon \n     completion of the design and engineering phase for such \n     facilities.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe Senator Kyl wishes to say \nsomething.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will comment more when I make my concluding \ncomments, but what we have just done is to agree to provide a mechanism \nfor the President to certify a way forward to fund the two large \nfacilities that are part of the nuclear weapons complex in a way that \nwe hope will provide for the most efficient way to build these \nfacilities and to get them constructed as rapidly as possible.\n  The result of this is that, potentially, we could save hundreds of \nmillions of dollars and construct the facilities at an earlier date \nthan was originally intended. But to be clear, nothing in this \namendment reduces the President's decisionmaking or flexibility. It \nremains his decision as to how the funding is requested and when it is \nrequested.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I agree with the comments of the Senator. \nIt does leave the President that important ability, but it also puts \nthe question of whether this is a way that is more efficient. It is \nsomething we should be looking at, and the President intends to look at \nit. We will accept this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I don't think there is further debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4892), as further modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4904\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl and the Chair, and now, \nMr. President, I believe the Corker amendment is the pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to again say that we have asked by \nunanimous consent to change this to be the McCain-Lieberman-Corker \namendment, and we have also added Senators Alexander, Brown of \nMassachusetts,  Murkowski, Johanns, Levin, and Bayh as cosponsors.\n  As a matter of tremendous respect and courtesy, I think it would be \nbest for Senator McCain to be the first speaker on this amendment that \nhe was very involved in developing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senators Lieberman, \nand Senator Corker, I have an amendment at the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving--I believe the Senator is \nreferring to the amendment that is pending?\n  Mr. CORKER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, it is probably not too relevant, but I \nwould like to say that this should have been the Lieberman-Corker-\nMcCain or Corker-Lieberman-McCain amendment because of the distribution \nof effort that has been made on this amendment. Be that as it may, I \nthink this amendment makes some improvement that will be very helpful.\n  It has two parts. The first requires the President to certify that we \ndo not recognize Russia's argument that the treaty can only be \neffective and viable only in conditions where the United States is not \nbuilding up its missile defenses. The statement would also be \ntransmitted to the Russians when the instruments of ratification are \nexchanged. Second, the amendment would include in the instrument an \nunderstanding that the preamble is not legally binding.\n\n[[Page S10954]]\n\n  I think this is a helpful amendment, and I appreciate that it could \nbe included by the Senator from Massachusetts, but ultimately it does \nnot address my concerns that the Russians believe the treaty could be \nused to limit our missile defense. We should have removed this clause \nfrom the preamble.\n  The message sent by the first part of this amendment is positive, but \nit is not conveyed to the Duma. When we look at the fact--I understand \nwhy the proponents of this treaty would not want to transmit this \naspect of the treaty to the Duma for fear of some backlash and perhaps \nproblems in the Russian Duma, although it is not a body that is \nrenowned for its independence, to say the least. The fact is, it will \nnot be transmitted to the Duma. The fact is, if the Russians and the \nUnited States agreed to a treaty and a part of that treaty was not \ntransmitted to the Senate, I think that would be something to which \nmost of us would take strong exception.\n  I thank Senator Corker. He has worked extremely hard on this issue. \nJoe Lieberman has worked extremely hard, trying to reach a point, \nobviously, that they could agree to support this treaty. Whether they \neventually do or not is something that I neither know nor would \npredict, but I do think it shows some improvement. I still have various \nconcerns, as I have had from the beginning, on the issue of defensive \nmissile systems, how it would play, whether it is actually part of the \ntreaty and, if so, how enforceable.\n  What complicates this more than anything else is the continued \nstatements, public statements on American television a short time ago--\nVladimir Putin saying that if we move forward with improving our \nmissile defenses, they would take ``appropriate actions.'' Their \nForeign Minister has made repeated statements--not last year but last \nmonth--saying one thing and publicly declaring it while on the other \nhand we are assuming this will prevent them from doing what they say \nthey will do. That is a contradiction.\n  I understand how solemn treaties are, and I understand how binding \ntreaties are. I also understand that when the leader of a nation says \non ``Larry King Live''--God bless you, Larry, for everything you did \nfor us--that they will have to take ``appropriate actions'' if we \nimprove quantitatively or qualitatively our strategic missile defense \nsystems, then obviously you have to give some credence to that, when \npublic statements are made. Obviously, in the view of Senator Kerry, \nwho has done a masterful job in shepherding this treaty through the \nSenate in the last several days, that is not that meaningful. So we \njust have a fundamental disagreement of opinion. But I can say this: If \nwe negotiated a treaty and made certain agreements and the President of \nthe United States made public statements on national or international \ntelevision contradicting that, then I think it would give the party we \nare in negotiations with significant pause.\n  Not one statement that I have been able to find has a Russian \nleader--either Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, or Prime Minister or \nPresident--saying they will adhere to the provisions that are in this \namendment. That is a fundamental contradiction that I am sorry cannot \nbe resolved.\n  I know what the votes are going to be on this treaty. Again, I \ncongratulate Senator Kerry for the incredible job he has done and, \nfrankly, his great willingness to talk with me and negotiate with me \nand have dialog and work toward a common goal. He has done that in good \nfaith, and I am grateful for the opportunity he has given me to play a \nrole, including agreeing to this amendment which I think will improve \nthe treaty.\n  I wish to say that I know how difficult this has been for Senator \nCorker and other Members on this side.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for the continued hard work he does on this \nissue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it is very \nhelpful.\n  With that, I yield to my colleagues, cosponsors of the amendment, if \nthat is agreeable to Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Senator Corker and I had a vote--\nactually, Senator Corker, Senator McCain, and I had a vote on whose \nname should be first on this, and Senator Corker and I won, 2 to 1. \nSenator McCain's name is first because this is an amendment that \nattempts to deal in a unifying way with our concern that the Russians \nmisunderstand the impact of this treaty or the impact of our \ndevelopment of missile defenses on this treaty and that it is important \nfor us to speak out in unity, in a unified and clear voice, to the \nRussians, and no one has made that point more clearly as the treaty has \nbeen considered than Senator McCain. In fact, he offered an amendment \nearlier in our deliberations on the treaty which I supported, which did \nnot pass, which would have removed the section of the preamble that has \nobviously been put in by the Russians in the negotiations which is \nconfusing at best and downright mischievous at worst.\n  This is the section that says:\n\n       Recognizing the existence of the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that \n     this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic nuclear arms are reduced, and that current \n     strategic defensive arms do not undermine the viability and \n     effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the preamble. It strikes me as I \nread it that it will be a topic of consideration in law schools and \nclasses on international law. The first question is, What did it mean? \nBut I think the Russians had a particular intent in putting it in \nthere, and they know what they wanted it to mean.\n  What is troubling is that when the treaty was signed earlier in the \nyear in Prague, the Russian Federation issued a statement that \nbasically made these same points--that the treaty will be effective and \nviable only in conditions where there is no qualitative or quantitative \nbuildup in the missile defense system capabilities of the United States \nof America.\n  But these are two separate categories. This treaty, the START treaty, \nis all about reducing the offensive capabilities, nuclear and delivery \ncapabilities of both great powers. We are building a missile defense \nsystem. It started out as a very controversial matter. It started out a \nlong time ago--President Reagan, really, initially, and then serious \nconsideration in the 1990s when a lot of people argued against it and \nsaid it was a waste of money and it would never work technologically, \nthat you couldn't create a bullet that would hit a bullet. Yet that is \nexactly what we have done. Thank God that we invested the money and \nthat our scientists and military leaders have brought it as far it is \nbecause one of the great threats that will face the people of the \nUnited States, our national security, will come from missiles carrying \nweapons of mass destruction fired particularly by rogue nations such as \nIran and North Korea. It would be irresponsible of us not to have \ndeveloped a capacity to defend against those kinds of missile attacks. \nWe have done that.\n  The Russians keep wanting to link that to this treaty. It is not \nlinked to the treaty. Therefore, I regretted that section was in the \npreamble I read. The United States responded through the State \nDepartment to that statement by the Russian Government when they signed \nthe treaty. But it is really important for us, at the same time the \ninstruments of ratification are conveyed to the Russian Government, to \nmake a clear and direct statement of our understanding of the total \nnonrelationship between the development of our missile defense \ncapability and the START treaty.\n\n  That is what this amendment does. I am privileged to cosponsor it \nwith Senator McCain, Senator Corker, and a number of other Members of \nboth parties. Basically, it says that before the New START treaty could \nenter into force, the President shall certify to the Senate--basically, \nthis is certifying what the President said in a letter sent to Senator \nReid a few days ago--and at the time of the exchange of instruments of \nratification shall communicate directly to the Russian Federation that, \nNo. 1, we are going to continue development and deployment of a missile \ndefense system to defend against missile threats from nations such as--\nand I would add ``not limited to''--North Korea and Iran.\n  No. 2, what do we mean by qualitative and quantitative improvement\n\n[[Page S10955]]\n\nof such systems that we are going to be continuing? This is very \nimportant. We define that here to include all phases of the phased \nadaptive approach to missile defenses in Europe embraced now by our \nNATO allies; second, the modernization of the ground-based midcourse \ndefense system; and third, the continued development of the two-stage \nground-based interceptor as a technological and strategic hedge.\n  We are being as direct as we can be here to the Russians. Some of my \ncolleagues have said--and the record, unfortunately, shows it--that \ntheir record for complying with treaties is not a good one. We don't \nwant to enter into this one with any misunderstandings or covering up \nthe truth. We are saying here loudly and clearly that the United States \nis going to continue to develop all of these different forms of missile \ndefense to protect our security and that has nothing to do with this \nSTART treaty.\n  I think the third section here is very important. We say:\n\n       The U.S. believes that these systems [missile defense \n     systems] do not and will not threaten the strategic balance \n     with the Russian Federation. Consequently, while the U.S. \n     cannot circumscribe the sovereign rights of the Russian \n     Federation under paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the [START] \n     Treaty--\n\n  Which is the section that gives nations the right to withdraw under \nextraordinary circumstances--nonetheless, if we adopt this, when we \nadopt it, this amendment, we are saying here:\n\n       The United States believes continued improvement and \n     deployment of United States missile defense systems do not \n     constitute a basis for questioning the effectiveness and \n     viability of the Treaty, and therefore would not give rise to \n     circumstances justifying the withdrawal of the Russian \n     Federation from the treaty.\n\n  We are trying to manage our relationship with the Russian Federation \nin a way that is conducive to the security of our country and the \nsecurity of the world.\n  We disagree with the Russians on an awful lot of things, including \nhuman rights and values and freedom of the press--which the current \ngovernment in Russia has so aggressively suppressed. So we want to be \nhonest with them and direct with them and not enter into this important \ntreaty with any illusions. I believe we have said that clearly. If it \npasses, it will be presented to the Russian Government directly.\n  I am very pleased we have a broad, bipartisan group supporting this. \nIt is a unified way to conclude our deliberations here before we go to \nvote on ratification, and I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nBegich as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am thrilled to join with Senator McCain \nand Senator Lieberman in an amendment dealing with missile defense. \nThis is a subject that has been discussed ever since this treaty was \nfirst presented.\n  I cannot think of a better way to end this debate. I thank Senator \nKerry for having the patience of Job, having worked through this. \nSomebody mentioned deals and where they have been taking place. They \nhave been taking place on the Senate floor. We have been working on \nthis for a long time. We have gone through intelligence briefings. We \nhave gone through incredible numbers of hearings. I think this has been \ndone exactly in the right way.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership. I thank Senator Lugar for his \nleadership on nuclear armaments in general. The Senator has been \npursuing that for years.\n  So we have before us an amendment on missile defense. Again, it has \nbeen discussed in great detail. This says three things. Senator \nLieberman certainly talked about much of the detail, but the President \nthe other day sent us a letter declaring, in very strident ways, his \ncommitment to both the phased-adaptive approach to missile defense, \nwhich will take place in Europe, and our ground-based interceptors. He \nhas said that absolutely in strident terms.\n  What this amendment does is certifies to Congress--he certifies to \nCongress--that he is going to continue those efforts. He will continue \nthose efforts on phased-adaptive approach and ground-based \ninterceptors.\n  Second, we have been concerned about what Russia thinks as it relates \nto this treaty. When we exchange the instruments of ratification, when \nwe exchange the documents when ratifying this treaty, they are going to \nbe told that we, in fact, are continuing to pursue our missile defenses \nin every way possible, and that in no way affects our relationship from \nthat standpoint as it relates to this treaty. I think that is \nincredibly strong.\n  Then, third, we have talked about this preamble, and every one of us \nknows the preamble is nonbinding. But as an understanding of this \ntreaty going forward, we are telling the Russians that the preamble \nabsolutely is not binding and that we are pursuing these missile \ndefense applications that have been discussed. I am proud to join with \nSenator McCain, with Senator Lieberman, two people who care as deeply \nabout our national security as anybody in the United States, certainly \nin this Senate. I am proud to have the other Members of the Senate who \nhave joined in.\n  Let me just say in closing, I think it is absolutely appropriate that \nthe last two amendments we address are the Kyl amendment which deals \nwith modernization--the President has made incredible investments in \nmodernization that have come about through this entire process, a \ncommitment to ensure that the nuclear arsenal we have is one that \noperates, that is reliable, that is safe.\n  I think people know we have 1,550 deployed warheads--after this \ntreaty goes into effect, over a long period of time, we reduce to that \nnumber, but that we have roughly 3,500 other warheads that, again, will \ncontinue to be modernized and made available, if necessary.\n  So I want to say that in accepting the Kyl amendment and all of the \nthings that have come with it--the letter from the appropriators and \naccepting this missile defense amendment--if that ends up being the \ncase, and I hope it will be by unanimous consent shortly, I think what \nwe have done throughout this entire process has strengthened our \ncountry's national security.\n  I can say: Look, this is called the New START, but I could call this \nthe Missile Defense and Nuclear Modernization Act of 2010 because all \nof these things have come into play to make our country safer. I want \nto thank the chairman. I want to thank the administration for walking \nthrough, over the last 6 months, and helping us cross t's and dot i's. \nI think this treaty is good for our country. I think this treaty \nenhances our national security. I thank the chairman for the way he has \nworked with us to get it into that position, certainly Senators McCain \nand Lieberman for helping take the lead on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4922 to Amendment No. 4904\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the \ndesk, No. 4922.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Kirk] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4922 to Amendment No. 4904.\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide an additional understanding regarding the December \n 18, 2010, letter from President Obama to the Senate regarding missile \n                                defense)\n\n       On page 2, after line 19, add the following:\n       (2) Missile defense.--It is the understanding of the United \n     States that the advice and consent of the Senate to the New \n     START Treaty is subject to the understanding, which shall be \n     transmitted to the Russian Federation at the time of the \n     exchange of instruments of ratification, stated in the letter \n     transmitted by President Barack Obama to the Majority Leader \n     of the United States Senate on December 18, 2010, the text of \n     which is as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, December 18, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: As the Senate considers the New START \n     Treaty, I want to\n\n[[Page S10956]]\n\n     share with you my views on the issue of missile defense, \n     which has been the subject of much debate in the Senate's \n     review of the Treaty.\n       Pursuant to the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 \n     (Public Law 106-38), it has long been the policy of the \n     United States to deploy as soon as is technologically \n     possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable \n     of defending the territory of the United States against \n     limited ballistic missile attack, whether accidental, \n     unauthorized, or deliberate. Thirty ground-based interceptors \n     based at Fort Greely, Alaska, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, \n     California, are now defending the nation. All United States \n     missile defense programs--including all phases of the \n     European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense (EPAA) \n     and programs to defend United States deployed forces, allies, \n     and partners against regional threats--are consistent with \n     this policy.\n       The New START Treaty places no limitations on the \n     development or deployment of our missile defense programs. As \n     the NATO Summit meeting in Lisbon last month underscored, we \n     are proceeding apace with a missile defense system in Europe \n     designed to provide full coverage for NATO members on the \n     continent, as well as deployed U.S. forces, against the \n     growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic \n     missiles. The final phase of the system will also augment our \n     current defenses against intercontinental ballistic missiles \n     from Iran targeted against the United States.\n       All NATO allies agreed in Lisbon that the growing threat of \n     missile proliferation, and our Article 5 commitment of \n     collective defense, requires that the Alliance develop a \n     territorial missile defense capability. The Alliance further \n     agreed that the EPAA, which I announced in September 2009, \n     will be a crucial contribution to this capability. Starting \n     in 2011, we will begin deploying the first phase of the EPAA, \n     to protect large parts of southern Europe from short- and \n     medium-range ballistic missile threats. In subsequent phases, \n     we will deploy longer-range and more effective land-based \n     Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors in Romania and Poland \n     to protect Europe against medium- and intermediate-range \n     ballistic missiles. In the final phase, planned for the end \n     of the decade, further upgrades of the SM-3 interceptor will \n     provide an ascent-phase intercept capability to augment our \n     defense of NATO European territory, as well as that of the \n     United States, against future threats of ICBMs launched from \n     Iran.\n       The Lisbon decisions represent an historic achievement, \n     making clear that all NATO allies believe we need an \n     effective territorial missile defense to defend against the \n     threats we face now and in the future. The EPAA represents \n     the right response. At Lisbon, the Alliance also invited the \n     Russian Federation to cooperate on missile defense, which \n     could lead to adding Russian capabilities to those deployed \n     by NATO to enhance our common security against common \n     threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the \n     Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving \n     NATO-Russian relations.\n       This comes even as we have made clear that the system we \n     intend to pursue with Russia will not be a joint system, and \n     it will not in any way limit United States' or NATO's missile \n     defense capabilities. Effective cooperation with Russia could \n     enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of our \n     combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time \n     provide Russia with greater security. Irrespective of how \n     cooperation with Russia develops, the Alliance alone bears \n     responsibility for defending NATO's members, consistent with \n     our Treaty obligations for collective defense. The EPAA and \n     NATO's territorial missile defense capability will allow us \n     to do that.\n       In signing the New START Treaty, the Russian Federation \n     issued a statement that expressed its view that the \n     extraordinary events referred to in Article XIV of the Treaty \n     include a ``build-up in the missile defense capabilities of \n     the United States of America such that it would give rise to \n     a threat to the strategic nuclear potential of the Russian \n     Federation.'' Article XIV(3), as you know, gives each Party \n     the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it believes its \n     supreme interests are jeopardized.\n       The United States did not and does not agree with the \n     Russian statement. We believe that the continued development \n     and deployment of U.S. missile defense systems, including \n     qualitative and quantitative improvements to such systems, do \n     not and will not threaten the strategic balance with the \n     Russian Federation, and have provided policy and technical \n     explanations to Russia on why we believe that to be the case. \n     Although the United States cannot circumscribe Russia's \n     sovereign rights under Article XIV(3), we believe that the \n     continued improvement and deployment of U.S. missile defense \n     systems do not constitute a basis for questioning the \n     effectiveness and viability of the New START Treaty, and \n     therefore would not give rise to circumstances justifying \n     Russia's withdrawal from the Treaty.\n       Regardless of Russia's actions in this regard, as long as I \n     am President, and as long as the Congress provides the \n     necessary funding, the United States will continue to develop \n     and deploy effective missile defenses to protect the United \n     States, our deployed forces, and our allies and partners. My \n     Administration plans to deploy all four phases of the EPAA. \n     While advances of technology or future changes in the threat \n     could modify the details or timing of the later phases of the \n     EPAA--one reason this approach is called ``adaptive''--I will \n     take every action available to me to support the deployment \n     of all four phases.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barack Obama.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on the basis of rule XXII and the question \nof timely filing, I would object to this amendment being considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The \namendment falls.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, am I allowed to be heard on the point of \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no debate on a point of order.\n  Mr. KIRK. Roger that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I do not want the Senator to not have an \nopportunity to be able to speak to this. I think he should be able to. \nHe certainly has that right in the context of his time. I will not \nspeak very long at all.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Arizona, my long-time friend, for \nhis very generous comments. I appreciate them personally. But also I \nthank him for his willingness, under some circumstances that I know \nwere tough for him, in terms of how a lot of this played out. He \nnevertheless sat with me, worked through these issues, and obviously I \nwish we had been able to reach an agreement sometime earlier, but I am \nglad he is there now on this amendment. I am glad we are able to accept \nit.\n  I thank Senator Corker who has been a straight dealer throughout all \nof this--no histrionics, no politics. I think he has really seen his \nresponsibilities on the Foreign Relations Committee in the best way and \nhas studied and thought and worked at and tried to find a way to solve \na problem, not create a problem. So I thank him for that approach to \nthis treaty.\n  I think this amendment, if I can say--I mean, I was here in the \nSenate. I remember debating the first proposal of President Reagan with \nrespect to missile defense, which then was called the SDI, the \nStrategic Defense Initiative, and became what we called Star Wars back \nthen. We have traveled a long distance since then. The world also has \nchanged significantly since then.\n  We no longer live in that sort of bipolar East-West, Soviet-U.S.-\ndominated world. We are living in a multipolar, extraordinarily \ncomplicated and significantly changed world in the context of the \nthreats we face. The threats we now face, particularly of a rogue \nstate, or of the possibility of a terrorist group stealing or putting \ntheir hands on some loosely guarded materials and/or weapons, those are \npossibilities that are real. We need to deal with this different kind \nof threat.\n  I believe the President of the United States has been pursuing a \nplan, building on what previous administrations have done; that is, \npursuing the right kind of approach to try to figure out: How do we \nmake all of us safer? Our hope is that the Russians will understand \nthis is not directed at them. This is directed at how we together can \nbuild a structure in which all of us can share in a way that forces the \nIrans and North Koreas and others to understand the futility, indeed \nthe counterproductivity of the direction in which they are moving.\n  So I think this is a good amendment to embrace within the instrument \nof ratification what the President is doing anyway, what the \nadministration has been committed to doing anyway. I personally do not \nthink it was necessary--in order to achieve an appropriate \nunderstanding of where the administration is going--but to whatever \ndegree it gives Senators the ability in the advice and consent process \nto believe that we are appropriately putting Russians on notice as to \nthis course we are on, I think it reinforces what the President has \nalready done and said. I do not think they should view it as something \nnew or as an aberration from any course that we have been on. I \ncertainly do not view it that way.\n  I am confident they will see that we can build on this treaty in a \nway that we share in the future strategies, analyses, perhaps even \ntechnologies in the long run that will make all of us safer\n\n[[Page S10957]]\n\nand ultimately provide all of us with the ability to deal with the \nrealities of a nuclear world. Our goal is to make us safer, and we \nbelieve this helps us do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I join with the sentiments just expressed \nby the chairman. I very much appreciate the statements made by Senator \nMcCain, Senator Lieberman, and my colleague on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Corker, who has worked diligently throughout the \nhearings, the markup, and this debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the amendment \nthat they have offered, 4904, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Just briefly on the remarks about the missile defense, \nI have served as chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee and \nranking member and have been involved in it for quite a few years. I \nthink the language affirms the continued development of the two-stage, \nground-based interceptor. Then, I guess, I accept the language that \nsays ``as a technological and strategic hedge.''\n  But I would just say to my colleagues, the reason we are at this \npoint is because, during the negotiations with the Russians concerning \nthe New START treaty, the administration, responding to Russian \nobjections about missile defense--which were so unfounded and I could \nnever fathom--the administration agreed, in September of last year, \nunilaterally, and to the utter surprise of Poland and the Czech \nRepublic, to cancel the planned two-stage GBI that was to be deployed \nin 2016 in Poland.\n  It was a great embarrassment to our allies. They had been negotiating \nwith us for many years on this project. They had stood firm for it, and \nthe administration then promised this phase four SM-3 Block 2B. But it \nwas not on the drawing board, not under development, and cannot be \ncompleted until 2020 if we as a Congress fund it over that decade. The \nPresident certainly will not be in office at that time. So I am uneasy \nabout this whole matter of missile defense.\n  I think the administration made a colossal error in giving up on the \nplanned two-stage strategic policy. But this language is better than no \nlanguage. I thank my colleagues for moving forward with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from North Dakota wants \nto speak on this a little bit. I thought we might, if he was willing--\nwe could accept the amendment and then the Senator would have an \nopportunity to speak.\n  Mr. President, we are prepared to accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4904), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have an understanding--while it is not a \nunanimous consent request yet, we have an understanding with Senator \nKyl that is the last amendment. We are waiting for the agreed-upon \nlanguage from both leaderships in order to arrive at a time for the \nvote. It is our understanding that other issues that were part of the \nequation of when that vote might take place have been resolved. So, as \na result, I think Senators can anticipate that, hopefully, sometime \nsoon that unanimous consent request will be propounded.\n  Until then, Senators are free to talk on the treaty and I look \nforward to their comments.\n  Can I say one word, Mr. President? I apologize.\n  Earlier when I was thanking folks, I meant to, and I neglected to \nbecause I jumped over to thank Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher.\n  As we all know, she was a Member of the House, spent a lot of time on \nseparate issues. In fact, she chaired one of the subcommittees of the \nArmed Services Committee. She logged a lot of miles and worked her \nheart out to assist in the evolution of this treaty. She has, as we all \nknow, been fighting cancer. She just recently had cancer surgery. We \nwish her well in her recovery and express our gratitude to her for her \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and \nSenators McCain and Lieberman.\n  There are probably still some folks making up their minds on this \ntreaty. I think most people have debated this at length and discussed \nit at length off the floor.\n  Our side has raised a number of questions. We have tried to cross \nevery t and dot every i. This has been done in a very methodical way. I \nthank the chairman for the way he has worked with us. I thank Senator \nLugar for his longstanding leadership in this regard. I thank the \nadministration officials who have absolutely bent over backward to try \nto solve every problem that has come up. The administration has not \nonly solved problems for people who might vote for the treaty, they \nhave tried to solve problems for people who they know will not vote for \nthe treaty. We have some Members on our side who I know are still \nmaking up their minds. I have been involved in this for a long time. I \nenjoyed this. I think this is an incredibly serious matter.\n  I have two daughters and a wife I love. National security is \nsomething that is important to all of us. None of us wants anything bad \nto happen to this country. But to my friends on this side of the aisle \nwho still may have some questions, there is no way in the world we \nwould have the commitments we have on nuclear modernization if it were \nnot for the process of this treaty. Now with Senator Kyl's amendment \nbeing accepted, we are even fast-tracking that. There is no way in the \nworld the unilateral statements that are going to be presented to \nRussia are going to be made regarding missile defense would be \noccurring without this treaty being in place. I don't think there is a \nperson in the world who has debated seriously whether 1,550 warheads \nbeing deployed in any way affects this country's national security.\n  To those of you who may still be wavering, I believe every issue that \nhas been raised has been answered strongly and legitimately. We have \nput forth what our posture is on nuclear armaments more clearly than we \nhave done in recent times. I hope people will come to the same \nconclusion, that this is good for the country.\n  I thank all those who have allowed me to be involved the way that I \nhave. I urge support, whenever the vote occurs, for a treaty that I \nbelieve absolutely makes our country safer. With all these \naccommodations, at some point, it seems that the right thing to do is \nto say yes to yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion \nabout modernization this morning. I have listened to much of it and was \nnot going to come to the floor, but I do want the record to show \nclearly what the numbers are on modernization. It is important to the \nfuture for us to understand what has been done and what is being done \nand what will be done.\n  I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds nuclear weapons \nactivities. I have spoken about this previously. It is very important \ngoing forward that we all understand what not only this administration \nbut the previous administration has proposed with respect to \nmodernization. I agree with my colleague from Kentucky. It is \nencouraging, at the end of this debate, that two bipartisan amendments \nrepresent the conclusion of this very important debate. We often debate \nthings that are of lesser importance or of greater importance and \nsometimes don't always see the difference between the two. But this is \none of those cases where if we ratify the START agreement today, when \nall is said and done, more will have been done than said. That is very \nunusual in a political body.\n  When I say ``more will have been done than said,'' it is so \nunbelievably important to try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons \nand to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. But there is a subtext to \nall the other things we have discussed, which is why I want to put in \nthe record the funding for the nuclear weapons issues. That subtext is \nmoney, money related to national security. We are a country with a $13\n\n[[Page S10958]]\n\ntrillion debt. Modernization is expensive. Yet it relates to our \nnational security. National missile defense, which we have heard a lot \nabout, is very expensive. I understand that also relates to national \nsecurity. But this issue of getting our debt under control and our \nfiscal policy under control is just as much a part of the national \nsecurity interests of this country.\n  The subtext to these discussions--modernization, missile defense--is \nabout funding as well and getting this country's economic house in \norder.\n  Let me mention the issue of nuclear weapons modernization. In fiscal \nyear 2010, we were spending $6.3 billion on the modernization program \non nuclear weapons activities. In fiscal year 2011, it went to $7 \nbillion, up 10 percent--so a 10-percent increase for the nuclear \nweapons activities in President Obama's budget request. That 10-percent \nincrease was unusual because most accounts were flat or some had cuts. \nBut nuclear weapons got a 10-percent increase. The proposal for 2011, a \n$600 million increase but $7 billion total, was actually short-\ncircuited and put in the continuing resolution. All the other funding \nin the CR is flat funding from the previous year. But the funding for \nthe nuclear weapons programs at 10 percent higher was put into the CR. \nThose programs and those programs alone get the higher funding. That $7 \nbillion was not all that was to be spent. Another $4 billion emerged. I \nheard about that on the radio while driving in North Dakota, that \nanother $4 billion had been put into this pot for modernization. The \nadditional funding from the 1251 report, which was produced in the \nfall, means 2012 funding would go from $6.3 billion in 2010, $7 billion \nin 2011, to $7.6 billion in 2012. That is a $1.2 billion increase in 2 \nyears.\n  Linton Brooks, the fellow who ran the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration and who did a good job in that role, said:\n\n       I would've killed for this kind of budget.\n\n  He is referring to $1.12 billion increase and two 10 percent \nincreases, while much of the other budget was flat. We are talking \nabout $85 billion for the next decade on these weapons activities, an \nincrease of $8.5 billion in the next 5 years over what was portrayed in \nthe 2010 budget. We are talking about a lot of additional money that \nhas been committed. It shows a commitment to build two nuclear \nfacilities that were discussed earlier. I want to mention them because \nit is important to understand what we are doing, the uranium processing \nfacility at the Y-12 production complex and the chemistry and \nmetallurgy research replacement facility at Los Alamos. There were \nmoneys in the 2012 budget in construction funds for these two \nfacilities, not as much as some would want in the Senate. But the fact \nis, the design of these two facilities is only 45 percent complete. We \ndon't fund things that are 45 percent designed. To come out here and \nsay we ought to be providing robust funding for buildings that are not \neven designed just makes no sense. Why, NNSA can't have confidence in \nits funding needs until it reaches about a 90-percent design point and \nthat will be in 2013.\n  I listened this morning to this discussion and I think what the \nchairman has done and what Senator Kyl has done in reaching an \nagreement is fine. But I want the record to show that this \nadministration has proposed robust increases in 2010, 2011, 2012, and \nfor a 5-year period in these modernization accounts, life extension \nprograms--robust increases. Even that is not enough for some. They want \nto put money into buildings that are not yet designed. That doesn't \nmake much sense to me.\n  My point is, when we add up all of this, the subtext is how are we \ngoing to pay for it. Because it is easy to talk about authorizing, to \ntalk about appropriating. The question is, Where does the money come \nfrom at a time when we are borrowing 40 cents of everything we spend in \nthis government? The subtext of money and debt is also a significant \npart of this country's national security. If we don't get our fiscal \nhouse in order, all these debates will pale by comparison. We can't \nlose our economy and have a future collapse of the economy because the \nrest of the world has very little confidence in our ability to make \nsmart decisions. We can't risk all that and believe we are going to be \na world economic power moving forward. If we are going to remain a \nworld economic power--and we can, and I believe we will--it will be \nbecause we start making some smart, tough, courageous decisions. That \nis more than just calling for more money, more spending, which was most \nof this morning's discussion.\n  I don't object to the amendment. My colleagues have raised important \nissues. But it is important to understand we have made great progress \non the modernization funding programs in the past months, and this \nadministration has moved very aggressively to meet those needs and meet \nthose concerns. That is important with respect to the public record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have given a lot of thought to the \ntreaty, and having been involved in missile defense and nuclear issues \nserving on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of Armed Services, as \nranking member and chairman, many of the provisions in the treaty are \nacceptable and should pose no threat to our national security. But \nconsidered as part of the administration's stated foreign policy and \nstrategic policy and in relation to the reality of the world situation \ntoday, I do not believe the treaty will make us safer. I think that is \na good test.\n  I disagree with my colleagues who are overly confident that this is \ngoing to make the world safer. I believe the treaty, for that reason, \nshould be rejected.\n  Some say a defeat for the treaty would harm the United States. I \nthink the entire world would see the Senate action as a resurgence of \nAmerica's historical policy of peace through strength and a rejection \nof a leftist vision of a world without nuclear weapons. The negotiating \nposture statements and actions of Russia indicate it is regressing \nsadly into an old Soviet mindset as it views the outside world. This is \ndisappointing and indicative of anything but the positive reset we hope \nto achieve with them. It is extremely important for Russian and U.S. \nsecurity and world security, that Russia sees its role as a positive \nforce for peace and security. These negotiations, however, show the \nface of the old Soviet Union. They have been so relentless in the way \nthey have negotiated.\n  Negotiations with any mature power, especially Russia, are difficult \nand serious. This administration began with a naive expectation that a \ntreaty could be quickly achieved that would show their leadership \ntowards peace and a nuclear-free world. The Obama administration wanted \nto set an example for other nations to reduce their nuclear weapons \ntowards a world without any nuclear weapons. We have heard this \nleadership and this setting of an example theme repeatedly from the \nPresident and the administration. But Russia has not the slightest \ninterest in such vague concepts, nor in eliminating all nuclear \nweapons. They have no idea or intention ever of relinquishing nuclear \nweapons. They are focused on their own national interest, on coming out \nahead in the negotiations for military, political, psychological, and \nhegemonic reasons.\n  It seems clear to me that Russia got what it wanted and President \nObama got a treaty paper which strategically means very little but can \nbe touted as a victory for peace.\n  So this is what I have concluded during this debate--and the debate \nhas been helpful--the debate has caused me to think through a good bit \nof this. A longer debate at a different time of the year, I think, \ncould have helped all of our colleagues. I do not believe the success \nin negotiation of the treaty will in any way make the Russians more \ncooperative, as the administration has repeatedly suggested.\n  Russia has been inconsistent at best in helping the United States \nwith the danger of nuclear Iran and North Korea--the gravest threats to \npeace in the world, with military action being undertaken against our \nally, South Korea, in recent weeks, and with the real possibility of an \nattack on Iran's nuclear weapons that, hopefully, can be avoided.\n  Why has Russia not been more cooperative? They blocked a resolution \ncondemning North Korea Sunday in the U.N. Russia attacked Georgia, a \nsovereign nation, and continues to occupy Georgian territory. This \nshocking act\n\n[[Page S10959]]\n\nof aggression condemned by independent bodies goes without any real \nU.S. response. Georgia is a pro-American, free market, independent \nnation whose attack was calculated and deliberate.\n  Russia continues to work to undermine the pro-Western democracy \nmovement in the Ukraine. They continue a host of actions that evidence \na long-term plan to effect a real or de facto reabsorption of these \nthree nations into what was the old Soviet Union.\n  So these ominous trends, it seems to me, have not been seriously \nconsidered throughout this quest for the treaty. The events do not give \nme confidence that the treaty, therefore, is a positive step for the \nUnited States, the world, or for peace.\n  Secondly, as I noted, and I will not go into detail now, the \nadministration conceded the two-staged, ground-based interceptor site \nthat would have been established in Poland, that would provide \nredundant protection to the United States from an Iranian missile and \nprotected virtually all of Europe from an Iranian missile. That was \ngiven away unilaterally by the administration without prior warning to \nour allies in Poland and the Czech Republic. They heard about it in the \npaper. They realized the United States had gone behind them, our \nallies, and made a deal with the Russians. It was a very unfortunate \nevent, indeed.\n  The plan that has been talked about--the fourth phase of the SM-3 \nPhased Adaptive Approach--is not even on the drawing board and is \nunlikely to actually survive. It would be difficult to see it surviving \nin five different budget cycles over the next 10 years it would take to \ndevelop that system. We walked away from one that could be deployed \nsoon.\n  I offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to make clear the Senate \ndoes not concur in an ill-conceived vision of the administration that \nwould move us to a world without nuclear weapons. I thank Senators Kyl, \nLeMieux, Cornyn, Chambliss, and Inhofe for cosponsoring the amendment. \nWhile I will not insist on a vote at this hour, this matter will be a \nsignificant subject for the future.\n  Thirdly, I would suggest the treaty is promoted as a step towards a \nworld free of nuclear weapons. This is a fantastical idea that goes \nbeyond insignificance, it is dangerous. Basing any policy, especially a \nnuclear policy, on an idea as cockamamie as zero nuclear weapons in the \nworld can only lead to confusion and uncertainty. Confusion and \nuncertainty are the polar opposites of the necessary attributes of \nsecurity and stability. These are the essentials of good strategic \npolicy: security and stability.\n  Thus, the Obama policy creates a more dangerous world. Some say the \nPresident's zero nukes policy is just a distant vision, some vague \nwish, so don't worry. The situation would be much better if that were \nso, but it is not. President Obama has made zero nuclear weapons a \ncornerstone of our defense policy. It has, amazingly, already been made \na centerpiece of our military policy, being advanced by concrete steps \ntoday. Presidents, Commanders-in-Chief, have the power to make such \nmonumental changes in policy, and this President is certainly doing so.\n  The change is seen most seriously in the critically important Nuclear \nPosture Review produced in April 2010 by the Defense Department. This \ndocument is a formal document produced by the new administration's \nDefense Department. The determination to pursue the zero nuclear \nweapons vision is seen throughout this review. Amazingly, there are 30 \nreferences in that document to a world without nuclear weapons.\n  The NPR begins with an introductory letter from Secretary of Defense \nGates, the second sentence of which says this:\n\n       As the President said in Prague last year, a world without \n     nuclear weapons will not be achieved quickly, but we must \n     begin to take concrete steps today.\n\n  The Executive Summary further drives the issue home. The first \nsentence in the Executive Summary recalls that President Obama, in \nPrague, highlighted nuclear dangers and said:\n\n       The United States will seek the peace and security of a \n     world without nuclear weapons.\n\n  The first sentence in the second paragraph of the NPR is particularly \nominous and even chilling to me. Posture Reviews are defense reviews, \nand by their nature are bottom-up reports, driven by threat assessments \nand the requirements necessary to defend America. These reviews \nhistorically are objective analyses from experts, not political \nreports. The troubling line reads:\n\n       The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) outlines the \n     Administration's approach to promoting the President's agenda \n     for reducing nuclear dangers and pursuing the goal of a world \n     without nuclear weapons.\n\n  This statement reveals the whole truth. The NPR is the President's \npolicy, sent from the top down, not the bottom up. Stunningly, the \nreport lacks a clear focus on the only objective that counts: Securing \na nuclear arsenal second to none that can, under any circumstances, \ndeter attacks on and defend the United States and its allies.\n  Fourthly, the Obama vision of a world without nuclear weapons has not \nbeen well received. Indeed, the breadth of the criticism from experts \nand world leaders is noteworthy.\n  Two years ago, Congress adopted an amendment I proposed that called \nfor a commission to review the strategic posture of the United States. \nIt was bipartisan and chaired by former Secretaries of Defense Dr. \nWilliam Perry and Dr. James Schlesinger. The commission powerfully \ndismissed the idea of a world without nuclear weapons. In somewhat \ndiplomatic but clear and strong language, they said this:\n\n       The conditions that might make possible the global \n     elimination of nuclear weapons are not present today and \n     their creation would require a fundamental transformation of \n     the world political order.\n\n  They went on to say this:\n\n       All of the commission members believe that reaching the \n     ultimate goal of global nuclear elimination would require a \n     fundamental change in geopolitics.\n\n  Maybe the Second Coming.\n  Others have dismissed this concept as a wild chimera. French \nPresident Sarkozy, from one of our European allies, France, said this:\n\n       It [our nuclear deterrent] is neither a matter of prestige \n     nor a question of rank, it is quite simply the Nation's life \n     insurance policy.\n\n  He made clear they had no intention of giving that up.\n  Secretary James Schlesinger, back when President Reagan was meeting \nin Reykjavik over nuclear issues, made this wise comment:\n\n       Nuclear arsenals are going to be with us as long as there \n     are sovereign states with conflicting ideologies. Unlike \n     Aladdin with his lamp, we have no way to force the nuclear \n     genie back into the bottle. A world without nuclear weapons \n     is a utopian dream.\n\n  Keith Payne, who served on this nuclear commission, writing recently \nin the National Review, said:\n\n       The presumption that United States movement toward nuclear \n     disarmament will deliver nonproliferation success is a \n     fantasy. On the contrary, the United States nuclear arsenal \n     has itself been the single most important tool for \n     nonproliferation in history, and dismantling it would be a \n     huge setback.\n\n  Remember the commission.\n  Jonathan Tepperman, in Newsweek, said:\n\n       And even if Russia and China (and France, Britain, Israel, \n     India, and Pakistan) could be coaxed to abandon their \n     weapons, we'd still live with the fear that any of them could \n     quickly and secretly rearm.\n\n  Gideon Rachman, in Financial Times, said:\n\n       The idea of a world free of nuclear weapons is not so much \n     an impossible dream as an impossible nightmare.\n\n  William Kristol, writing in the Washington Post, in October, said:\n\n       Yet to justify a world without nuclear weapons, what Obama \n     would really have to envision is a world without war, or \n     without threats of war. . . .The danger is that the allure of \n     a world without nuclear weapons can be a distraction--even an \n     excuse for not acting against real nuclear threats. . . .So \n     while Obama talks of a future without nuclear weapons, the \n     trajectory we are on today is toward a nuclear--and missile-\n     capable North Korea and Iran--and a far more dangerous world.\n\n  Others have also written about this.\n  David Von Drehle, writing in Time Magazine, said:\n\n       A world with nuclear weapons in it is a scary, scary place \n     to think about. The industrialized world without nuclear \n     weapons was a scary, scary place for real. But there is no \n     way to un-ring the nuclear bell. The science and technology \n     of nuclear weapons is widespread, and if nukes are outlawed \n     someday, only outlaws will have nukes.\n\n  Kenneth Waltz, leading arms controller and professor emeritus of \npolitical science at UC Berkeley, said:\n\n\n[[Page S10960]]\n\n\n       We now have 64 years of experience since Hiroshima. It's \n     striking and against all historical precedent that for that \n     substantial period, there has not been any war among nuclear \n     states.\n\n  Importantly, the administration's planned further diminishment of our \nnuclear stockpile--further diminishing it from these numbers--and \nPresident Obama's hostility to the utility of nuclear weapons generally \nhas caused a great deal of unease among our non-nuclear allies. These \nnations are not so open about their concerns, but the problem is a very \nreal one.\n  The American nuclear umbrella, our extended deterrence, has allowed \nour allies, free democratic nations, to remain nuclear free, without \nhaving nuclear weapons. But if the Obama policy continues, the Perry-\nSchlesinger report concludes real dangers may await:\n\n       If we are unsuccessful in dealing with current challenges, \n     we may find ourselves at a tipping point, where many \n     additional states conclude that they require nuclear \n     deterrents of their own. If this tipping point is itself \n     mishandled, we may well find ourselves faced with a cascade \n     of proliferation.\n\n  The nuclear commission--President Obama appointed a number of the \nMembers on the Democratic side--said that if our allies who feel they \nhave been protected by our nuclear umbrella become uncertain, we could \nbe faced with a cascade of proliferation. Is that what we want? I know \nthe President wants nonproliferation. I know that is what he wants. I \nam not attacking his goal. Throughout my remarks, I am raising the \nquestion of whether these goals will be furthered by the actions of \nthis treaty and these policies or whether they will not.\n  One final concern. The administration has made it clear that this \ntreaty's nuclear reductions are just the first step in a long march to \na nuclear-free world. Assistant Secretary Rose Gottemoeller, who \nnegotiated the treaty, said in April:\n\n       We will also seek to include non-strategic, non-deployed \n     weapons in future reductions.\n\n  Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and \nformer Ambassador Alexander Vershbow a few weeks ago said that the \nadministration, in follow-on talks, will seek further reductions in \nstrategic, nondeployed, and nonstrategic weapons. And the President has \nsaid that repeatedly.\n  We Senators, in the end, only have our judgment. My best judgment \ntells me that if our weapons fall too low in numbers, such an event \ncould inspire rogue and dangerous lesser nuclear powers to seek to \nbecome peer nuclear competitors to the United States--a dangerous event \nfor the entire world. Thus, I must conclude that the Obama plan is to \ndiminish the power and leadership of the United States. Carefully read, \nthis is what the goal does. I think this conclusion cannot be disputed. \nThe leader of the one nation that has been the greatest force for \nfreedom and stability in the world, with our large nuclear arsenal, is \ndisplaying a naivete beyond imagining.\n  Since this treaty is a calculated step in the President's plan to \nachieve dangerous and unacceptable policies, this treaty must not be \nratified. The treaty and the policy behind it must be rejected.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. We are shortly going to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. I have been saying that a couple of times now, but we really \nare shortly going to do it. There are several Senators who wish to \nspeak. I would like to see if we could set up an order for them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Washington proceed for \n10 minutes, then the Senator from Texas for up to 10 minutes, then the \nSenator from North Dakota for 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent also \nthat each of those Senators would allow the interruption for the \npropounding of the unanimous consent request if it comes during the \ntime they are speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                    Defense Level Playing Field Act\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to call on the \nSenate to move and pass H.R. 6540, which is the Defense Level Playing \nField Act, a bill which was passed overwhelmingly by the House of \nRepresentatives yesterday.\n  This is a bill that is identical to a bipartisan provision I have \nintroduced here in the Senate with Senators Brownback, Cantwell, and \nothers from States that know the value of American aerospace. It is a \nbill that will require the Pentagon to take into account illegal \nsubsidies to foreign companies in our country, and that will finally \ndeliver an even playing field in our procurement process.\n  But above all, this is a jobs bill. It is about protecting skilled, \nfamily-wage jobs, manufacturing jobs, and engineering jobs--jobs with \ntechnical skills and expertise that are passed down from one generation \nto the next; jobs that not only support our families during a very \ndifficult economic time but are also helping to keep our communities \nabove water. These are jobs in communities in Kansas, in Connecticut, \nin California, and in my home State of Washington. They are jobs that \nsupport small businesses, they pay people's mortgages, and they create \neconomic opportunity. These jobs right now are at risk. Why? Because of \nillegal subsidies that undercut our workers and create an uneven \nplaying field for America's aerospace workers.\n  This is a commonsense, straightforward way to protect American \naerospace jobs from unfairly subsidized European competition. It is a \nbill that specifically targets a major job-creating project--the Air \nForce's aerial refueling tanker contract--as a place where we can begin \nto restore fairness for our aerospace workers. This bill says that in \nawarding that critical tanker contract, the Pentagon must consider any \nunfair competitive advantage aerospace companies have, and there is no \nbigger unfair advantage right now in the world of international \naerospace than launch aid.\n  As my colleagues may know, launch aid is direct funding that has been \nprovided to the European aerospace company Airbus from the treasuries \nof European governments. It is what supports their factories and their \nworkers and their airplanes. It is what allows them to price their \nairplanes far below those that are made here in the United States and \nstill turn a profit. It is what allows them to literally role the dice \nand lose on a product and what separates them from American aerospace \ncompanies, such as Boeing, that bet the company on each new airplane \nline they produce. In short, it is what allows them to stack the decks \nagainst American workers.\n  In July of this year, the World Trade Organization handed down a \nruling in a case that the United States brought against the European \nUnion that finally called launch aid what it really is: a trade-\ndistorting, job-killing, unfair advantage. That is what the WTO said. \nIt is one of our Nation's most important trade cases to date. The WTO \nruled very clearly that launch aid is illegal, it creates an uneven \nplaying field, it has harmed American workers and companies, and it \nneeds to end.\n  Specifically, the WTO found that European governments have provided \nAirbus with more than 15 billion Euros in launch aid, subsidizing every \nmodel of aircraft ever produced by Airbus in the last 40 years, \nincluding, by the way, the A330--the very model they are now putting \nforward in the tanker competition. The WTO ruled that France and \nGermany and Spain provided more than 1 billion Euros in infrastructure \nand infrastructure-related grants between 1989 and 2001, as well as \nanother billion in share transfers and equity infusions into Airbus. \nThey ruled that European governments provided over 1 billion in Euros \nin funding between 1986 and 2005 for research and development directed \nspecifically to the development of Airbus aircraft. In fact, the \nLexington Institute states that launch aid represents over $200 billion \nin today's dollars in total subsidies to Airbus.\n  Launch aid has very real consequences. It has created an uphill \nbattle for our American workers and American aerospace as a whole. \nBecause of launch aid, our workers are now not only competing against \nrival companies, they are competing against the treasuries of European \ngovernments. At the end of the day, that has\n\n[[Page S10961]]\n\nmeant lost jobs at our American aerospace companies and suppliers and \nthe communities that support them.\n  I have been speaking out against Europe's market-distorting actions \nfor many years because I understand that these subsidies are not only \nillegal, they are deeply unfair and anticompetitive.\n  My home State of Washington is, of course, home to much of our \ncountry's aerospace industry, and I know our workers are the best in \nthe world. On a level playing field, they can compete and win against \nabsolutely anybody. But, unfortunately, Airbus and the European Union \nhave refused to allow fair competition. Instead, they use their \naerospace industry as a government-funded jobs program, and they use \nbillions in illegal launch aid to fund it.\n  So let me be clear about one thing. The objective of this bill that \nwas passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives yesterday is \nnot to limit competition; it is to make sure everyone can compete on a \nlevel playing field. Airbus has made it clear they will go to any \nlengths to hurt our country's aerospace industry. We need to make it \nclear we will take every action to stop them because this is not only \nabout the future of aerospace; it is about jobs right now that will \nhelp our economy recover. In fact, as we look at ways to stimulate job \ngrowth and keep American companies innovating and growing, we shouldn't \nlook any further than this bill.\n  This bill is a commonsense policy. It makes sure U.S. Government \npolicy translates to Pentagon policy because the fact is that the U.S. \nGovernment, through our Trade Representative, has taken the position \nthat Airbus subsidies are illegal and unfair. Yet, on the other hand, \nthe U.S. Department of Defense is ignoring that position as we look to \npurchase a new tanker fleet, and that does not make any sense--not for \nour country, not for our military, and certainly not for our workers. \nThe WTO made a fair decision. Airbus subsidies are illegal and \nanticompetitive. Now the Department of Defense needs to take that \nruling into account.\n  When I go home and talk to our aerospace workers in Washington State, \nI want to be able to tell them we have evened the stakes. I want them \nto know their government is not looking the other way as policies \ncontinue to undercut their jobs and their opportunities. I want them to \nknow that while they are working to secure our country by producing the \nbest airplane in the world, their government is doing everything it can \nto make sure fair opportunities are there that will keep them on the \njob.\n  It is time to take these job-killing subsidies into account. It is \nthe right thing to do for our workers, for our economy, and the future \nof our airspace industry.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 6540\n\n  So I ask, as if in legislative session and as if in morning business, \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 6540, which was received from the House and is at \nthe desk; that the bill be read three times and passed; the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; \nand any statements relating to the matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the loyalty of my \ncolleague from Washington for the Boeing facility that is there. I just \nwant to say that other workers are involved, including 48,000 new jobs \nthat would be created if the plant in Alabama were to be the one \nselected in this competition.\n  As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I would note that we \nvoted a number of years ago unanimously to have a competition. There \nare only two companies in the world that can make this kind of \naircraft. It is a commercial aircraft, not a highly sophisticated \ndefense system such as a fighter. The EADS team committed to build that \nin America--bringing jobs not just to Alabama but jobs all over the \nNation, far more around the Nation than just in Alabama--and to create \na third major world aircraft facility. Congress asked that the bids be \ncompetitively let and that these two competitors be given a chance to \nsubmit the best proposal.\n  I am highly convinced that the EADS aircraft is superior--is larger, \nit is newer--and more effective in the role it is asked to fulfill.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would just ask what the order is at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator sought recognition after he \nobjected.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The unanimous consent agreement was that the Senator \nfrom Texas would proceed after I had yielded the floor, which I had not \nyielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, the Senator from Alabama was the \nonly person who sought recognition.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe there was an agreement that \nthe Senator from Texas follow my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was an order, but there was no \nobjection. There was no one who sought recognition.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will wrap up, briefly, if I could.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator from Alabama wants to finish his \nobjection--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: My understanding is \nthat the Senator from Washington had 10 minutes. My understanding is \nshe had completed that 10 minutes; am I incorrect on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Her time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I didn't hear the Chair say that. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask the Senator from Alabama, I thought he was \nobjecting on Senator Murray's time, and I was next in the unanimous \nconsent. My question is, is he finished with his objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wish 1 additional minute to wrap up, if I could, and \nthen I will yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, then I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I have the floor, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, after this competition has been going \non for quite a number of years, and both parties have been very \nseriously competing for this contract, it is expected to be awarded in \nMarch of next year. The Defense Department has considered every one of \nthese issues, including the WTO issue. The lawyers talked about it and \nwe have talked about it in the Senate and the House.\n  At this very last minute, on the eve of awarding the competition, a \nHouse bill was passed without any debate. We have not discussed it or \nhad a hearing on it. It should not be approved. I object.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we are asking for a level playing field \nwith a bill that passed the House. This is a discussion we have had \nmany times. It says that illegal subsidies from any company should be \ntaken into account on a deal in front of the Pentagon.\n  I will stand anytime and fight for fairness and competition. I am \nsorry this has been objected to, because it meant our country would \nhave a fair competition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak on the START treaty. \nI spoke on the floor Saturday stating my concerns about this treaty and \nthe need to address a number of very important issues. I had hoped that \namendments that had been offered would be able to clarify the \nposition--the United States position--on this treaty.\n  I have listened to the debate. I have watched many amendments go \ndown. The treaty supporters have said that these amendments are deal \nkillers,\n\n[[Page S10962]]\n\ntreaty killers. I disagree. I believe everybody has been sincere, but I \nam not persuaded that the Senate's role to advise and consent to \ntreaties has successfully finetuned the understanding on our part, if \nwe accept this treaty, nor the Russian positions--have they been \nclarified with our objections or disagreements with the Russian \nposition.\n  I understand it would have made it hard for the administration to \namend the text. But even amendments that would try to amend the \npreamble, or even the ratification resolution that would clarify the \nUnited States position, have caused me great pause. For instance, when \nwe are talking about missile defense, former Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, said:\n\n       Russians tend to interpret every utterance as binding \n     commitment.\n\n  She went on to write:\n\n       The Russians need to understand that the U.S. will use the \n     full range of American technology and talent to improve our \n     ability to intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of \n     hostile countries.\n\n  I am concerned that this treaty still has a lot of misunderstanding \nabout the United States missile defense capability. I am concerned that \nour capability, with the understanding of Russians, would be \nrestricted. Russia and the United States each have issued unilateral \nstatements when they signed the New START that clarified their position \non the relationship between START and missile defense. Russia stated:\n\n       The treaty can operate and be viable only if the United \n     States refrains from developing its missile defense \n     capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively.\n\n  I think we should state clearly in the resolution to ratify that it \nis not the position of the United States to place any limitations on \nmissile defense. The President wrote a letter saying he disagreed with \nthe Russian position and, yet, Senator McCain offered an amendment that \nwould have stricken language in the preamble of the treaty that would \nhave made it clear what the United States position was, and that \namendment was not adopted by this body.\n  As we speak, I don't believe Russia is our enemy. This is a 10-year \ntreaty. We don't know 10 years down the road how relationships might \nchange. I believe our relationship with Russia is important, but there \nare rogue nations in the world that are hostile to the United States, \nwhich are working in earnest to get nuclear capability and possibly \nalready have it, plus warheads to put those nuclear weapons on.\n  With the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran or North Korea, or Pakistan, \nwhich is our ally, which has a fragile government, or even Venezuela, \nwhich is working with Iran and is certainly within our hemisphere, it \nwould be unthinkable to have any kind of miscommunication about the \nUnited States capability to control its own defense capabilities. That \nis exactly what the Russian statement said we could not do.\n  U.S. planning and force requirements may have to change in the next \n10 years and, frankly, I think they ought to be going forward right now \nto ensure that we can withstand any kind of warhead, nuclear or \notherwise, that would come in from rogue nations.\n  That in itself is enough for me to say we have not fulfilled our \nresponsibility under the Constitution for advice to the President on \ntreaties. That is our solemn responsibility, and I do not think we have \nbeen successfully able to do that because we have been blocked on every \namendment, calling them deal killers.\n  I think a strong New START is in our best interest. But I believe \nthat this treaty does not address other areas of concern I have voiced \nas well. I believe this treaty could further be improved by increasing \nthe number of type one and type two inspections, as was attempted by \nthe Inhofe amendment that was defeated yesterday.\n\n  For instance, we know there are loose nukes that have come from \nRussian arsenals in the past, because the Russians have not had a clear \ncontrol, or list of, or don't seem to be totally firm about where all \nof their arsenal is, and they don't seem to have the accountability. So \nthe loose nukes, it has been reported, have shown up in other places, \nsuch as, for instance, North Korea. So I think verification becomes \nmore important, to get a true idea of exactly what the Russians have, \nso there can be an accountability going forward to assure that whatever \nnumber are in whatever place would always stay the same, unless they \nare part of the drawdown.\n  I think the verification amendment Senator Inhofe had that was \ndefeated would have improved our capability to understand exactly what \nwas out there that might loosely go to Iran or North Korea, with whom \nthe Russians have relationships, though we do not.\n  Former Secretary of State James Baker described the treaty's \nverification regime as weaker than its predecessor. I agree with his \ncomment, and I hope we can improve the situation. To be fair, Secretary \nBaker supports the treaty. But he did recognize its shortcomings, and I \nthink that should have been addressed by the Senate, without fear of \nwhat the Russians might say about our capability to defend against \nthreats, not from Russia necessarily, other than the haplessness of not \nknowing for sure where your nuclear weapons are--I don't think Russia \nis our enemy. I want a relationship with Russia.\n  The missile defense we were not able to even clarify in the \nresolution of ratification causes me great concern. The verification \nnot being as adequate as I think we need, and then the modernization, \nwhich we also address in other amendments, I think, are also \nproblematic. I believe we must know our nuclear warheads could be used \nin the worst-case circumstance, because I think that is a deterrent.\n  Because of these things, I am going to vote no today on the \nratification of the treaty. I think the Senate could have improved the \nunderstanding of this treaty. I think we could have strengthened it \nwith real amendments that would have strengthened even what the \nPresident said in his letter to the Senate, saying that he disagreed \nwith the Russian interpretation. But then when we tried to put that in \nwriting, that didn't pass. So I believe we should not pass this treaty \ntoday. I think we can fulfill our responsibility for advice and consent \nand have a more bipartisan passing of the resolution. I think we need a \ngood relationship with Russia. I think we need to protect, at all \ncosts, the United States unilateral capability for missile defense for \nour country against other nations. I don't think Russia is a threat, \nbut I do think rogue nations that have nuclear capabilities are. I \nthink the symbiotic relationship between Venezuela and Iran is a very \nreal threat to the United States. I think we need to start preparing \nmore carefully about that.\n  I know my time is up. I appreciate the time to state my reasons for \nvoting against this and hope that when it passes--which I think it \nwill--we will be more firm in clarifying with the Russians our view of \nour national security interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, first, if I can interrupt for a moment \nbefore the Senator from North Dakota speaks, according to the prior \norder. I want to inform Senators that it is now 1:15. We are awaiting \nlanguage which is forthcoming relatively soon on the 9/11 issue. I \nthink it is the intention of the majority leader to vote very quickly \nafter that unanimous consent agreement comes together. That means we \ncould have a vote, conceivably, on the final passage of the resolution \nof ratification on the treaty somewhere--this is a guess--within the \nvicinity of 1:45 to 2 o'clock. That is a guess. Senator Kyl I know \nwanted to speak prior to that taking place. We are trying to preserve \nthat within the order. That said, I yield to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we expect to have the necessary papers to \ncomplete the consent agreement within the next 15 minutes. It is 1:15 \nnow, so we hope by 1:30. Sometimes Senate time is not exactly right, \nbut we are getting very close to being able to do this consent \nagreement. It has been typed. We are waiting for the papers to come \nfrom the Hart Building.\n  We want everyone to be patient. We know how anxious everyone is to \ncomplete the business of this Congress. Just everyone understand it \nshould be not much longer.\n\n[[Page S10963]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I was not going to speak again, but I \nwas prompted to by my colleague from Alabama, a friend and someone for \nwhom I have great respect. The presentation by my colleague from \nAlabama suggested that President Obama is moving in the direction of \ndisarming us, the implication is that of injuring our national security \nby proposing that we have fewer nuclear weapons. Let me make a point \nthat I think is so important for the record.\n  I hope it is not now or ever considered a source of weakness for this \ncountry to aspire to have a planet with fewer nuclear weapons. It ought \nto be a source of strength that we understand it becomes our burden as \na world leader--an economic leader and nuclear power--to try to reduce \nthe number of nuclear weapons on this Earth.\n  This President has not proposed anything that would injure our \nnational security. He is not proposing anything that is unilateral. He \nhas negotiated and his team has negotiated a very strong arms reduction \ntreaty with the Russians.\n  I know there has been great discussion about modernization, whether \nthere is enough money, about why tactical nuclear weapons were not \nincluded, the issue of whether it limits us with respect to missile \ndefense. All of those issues have been answered. All have been \nresponded to.\n  The question, it seems to me, for us now and for all Americans, and \nparticularly those who serve in Congress in the future, is will we be a \nworld leader in pushing for a reduction in the number of nuclear \nweapons on this planet?\n  There are some 25,000 nuclear weapons on this planet. The loss of \njust one of those weapons, into the hands of a terrorist or rogue \nnation who might then explode it in a major city on Earth would change \neverything.\n  My colleagues are probably tired of hearing me say it, but in my desk \nI have kept a piece of a Soviet Union bomber, a very small piece of a \nwing strut from a Soviet Union bomber. We did not shoot it down. We \nnegotiated that bomber down by paying money to saw the wings off.\n  Nuclear arms reduction treaties work. We know they work. There are \nRussian submarines that were not destroyed in battle. We ground them up \nand took them apart. The wings were sawed off bombers, and they were \nsold for scrap. Nuclear missiles in silos with nuclear warheads aimed \nat American cities are gone.\n  I will give an example. One was in Ukraine. Now sunflower seeds adorn \nthat pasture where there was a missile with a nuclear weapon aimed at \nAmerica.\n  We know these arms reduction treaties work because we have seen them \nwork. Fewer nuclear weapons, fewer delivery vehicles, bombers, \nsubmarines, missiles--we know this works.\n  My colleague seemed to suggest that it would be a horrible thing if \nthe entire world were rid of nuclear weapons. I hope that every Senator \nwould aspire to have that be the case, a world in which there was not \none weapon left, for almost surely every offensive weapon on this \nplanet has always been used. We need to be very concerned about the \nnumber of nuclear weapons, the spread of nuclear weapons, the need, the \ndesire for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons. That is why these \ntreaties and these negotiations on arms reduction are so unbelievably \nimportant.\n  Never has it been more important because now there is a new threat. \nThey do not wear uniforms. They do not belong to one country. It is the \nterrorist threat. And they strive mightily to acquire nuclear weapons.\n  This treaty negotiated at the start by the previous President and \nconcluded by this President, in my judgment, strengthens this country, \nrepresents our best national security interests.\n  I ask the question of anyone who believes that it is a threat for us \nto begin reducing nuclear weapons through arms negotiations with others \nwho have nuclear weapons: Who, if not us, will lead the way to do that? \nIf not us, who? Is there another country they think will aspire to \nprovide leadership to reduce the number of nuclear weapons? If there \nis, tell us the name because we all know better than that.\n  This responsibility falls on our shoulders. We are the leading \nnuclear power on this Earth. It is our responsibility, it is this \ncountry's responsibility to lead. I don't ever want anybody to suggest \nit is some sort of weakness for this President or any President to \nengage in arms reduction negotiations. That is a source of strength.\n  This treaty was negotiated carefully. I was on the national security \nworking group. We had briefing after briefing in top-secret venues. \nThis treaty was carefully negotiated. It represents our best interests. \nIt represents a reduction of nuclear weapons, a reduction of delivery \nvehicles and represents, in my judgment, another step in reducing the \nnuclear threat. It is not even a giant step, but it certainly is a step \nin the right direction.\n  This represents our best national security interests, and this \nPresident has demonstrated, yes, he wants a world with fewer nuclear \nweapons. He wants a world, as would I, with no nuclear weapons at some \npoint. But this President would never allow negotiations or never allow \ncircumstances in which this country is unarmed or unprepared or unable \nto meet its national security needs. He has not done that, not in this \ntreaty, and will not do it in the future.\n  I did want to stand up and say that because of the comments earlier \nby the Senator who suggested there is some sort of weakness for a \ncountry that aspires to have a reduction of nuclear weapons on this \nplanet.\n  Let me finally say, I have spoken at length on this floor about the \nseverity of losing even just one nuclear weapon. I have told the story \nabout a CIA agent code-named Dragonfire who reported 1 month after 9/11 \nthat a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon had been stolen from Russia and that \nnuclear weapon had been smuggled into New York City and was to be \ndetonated. There was an apoplectic seizure in this town about it \nbecause no one knew what to do about it. They did not even notify the \nmayor of New York.\n  They discovered a month later that was probably not a credible piece \nof information. But as they did the diagnosis of it, they discovered it \nis plausible someone could have acquired a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon \nfrom Russia, it was plausible; if they had done that, they could have \nsmuggled it into an American city and if terrorists did that they could \nhave detonated it. Then we are not talking about 3,000 deaths, we are \ntalking about 100,000, 200,000 deaths.\n  The work we have done in so many areas, the work in this \nadministration, let me say, to secure loose nuclear materials, \ncircumstances where plutonium or highly enriched uranium in the size of \na liter or, in one case, in the size of a small can of soda, enough to \nkill tens and tens of thousands of people with a nuclear weapon--this \nis serious business. At a time when we debate a lot of issues--serious \nand not so serious--this is serious business.\n  I think the work that has been done by the chairman and ranking \nmember in recent days--I watched a lot of this and watched it over this \nyear--is extraordinary work. But so too is the work by this President, \nby the negotiators. My colleague described the folks at the State \nDepartment who had a significant role as well.\n  Let us not ever think it is a source of weakness to be negotiating \nverifiable reductions in nuclear weapons among those who possess them. \nThat is a source of strength, and it is important for our kids and \ngrandchildren who can succeed by continuing to do that with treaties \nthat make the best sense for this country's national security \ninterests.\n  I see the Senator from Massachusetts does not yet have a unanimous \nconsent request, but I know all my colleagues are anxious to see one.\n  I yield the floor, and I expect, as the majority leader indicated, \nwithin the next half hour or so we will be voting, and I think that is \ngood news. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to discuss and ask unanimous \nconsent for consideration of H.R. 6398. I\n\n[[Page S10964]]\n\nwill get to the unanimous consent language in a moment, but right now I \nwant to describe what this is about. Then I wish to yield to my \ncolleague from Georgia to add a little bit of the impact of this issue.\n  The issue is this: In all 50 States in America, lawyers have to put \nclients' funds into trust accounts. Under the law, they are not allowed \nto earn interest on these accounts. Over time, an arrangement has been \nworked out whereby the banks pay interest, but it does not go to the \nclients; it goes to fund civil legal services for those who cannot \nafford those services.\n  This arrangement is in great jeopardy if we do not pass this bill \ntoday. I will expand on that jeopardy in a moment, but at this point I \nsimply am going to yield to my colleague from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. This \nis very important work, and we are in our late hour. Sometimes we do \nour best in the late hour.\n  The unintended consequence of the Dodd-Frank legislation with regard \nto IOLTA is it not being extended and we are going to literally have \nthousands of escrow accounts held by law firms and attorneys, real \nestate transactions, dispute resolution transactions, and beneficial \nprograms that will have to be spread among many more banks because the \ninsurance level, which is now limited, drops to $250,000. It would \nforce the transfer of escrow account money out of any number of banks. \nAt a time when capital is critical in small community banks, the \nunintended consequence might have been to take them below tier one \ncapital requirements and put them in a stress situation.\n  I commend the distinguished Senator from Oregon for his work on this \nlegislation. I thank the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, for his \nconsent for us to bring this forward. I give wholehearted support to \nthe unanimous consent request.\n  I yield back to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I appreciate so much the partnership of \nmy colleague from Georgia. He has laid out clearly the impact of a \nfailure to fix this legislation on our community banks where lawyers, \nexercising their fiduciary responsibilities, would have to move their \ntrust accounts out of these special accounts where the interest goes to \nlegal services and legal education and into no-interest-bearing \naccounts so that no one gains from that movement. In the course of it, \nthey would be moving funds often from community banks to other \ninstitutions, imperiling these community banks.\n  I wish to address the other side of this issue, which is the \nimportant work these funds do in all 50 States. I will speak \nspecifically to the State of Oregon, but there are parallels because \nall 50 States participate with these accounts.\n  In Oregon, we have, first, the association of Oregon Legal Services \nProgram, its primary source of civil legal assistance available to low-\nincome Oregonians. To give a sense, if a woman is having a big \nchallenge with domestic violence, she can get legal aid through this \ntype of assistance. If a family is trying to struggle with a mistake on \na foreclosure process so they can save their home, they can get \nassistance through this program. They have 20 offices throughout the \nState of Oregon to serve Oregonians living in poverty.\n\n  Second is the Juvenile Rights Project. This provides legal services \nto children and families through individual representation in juvenile \ncourt and school proceedings to help children who are in \nextraordinarily difficult circumstances.\n  A third is Disability Rights Oregon, the Oregon Advocacy Center, \nwhich assists those who are disabled, who are victims of abuse or \nneglect, or have difficulty acquiring health care or need to exercise \ntheir rights in regard to special education. They can turn to the \nOregon Advocacy Center-Disability Rights of Oregon for help.\n  In addition, these funds pay for legal-oriented education for our K-\n12 students. Let me give an example of three programs in Oregon. These \nprograms assist 15,000 students in our State.\n  One is the High School Mock Trial Competition. This type of mock \ntrial competition is an enormous learning exercise for our students in \nhow our courts function and how the facts of a case are presented and \nhow the principles of law are applied.\n  Then we have the summer institute training for teachers so that \nsocial studies teachers can learn more about the role of law and be \nmore effective in conveying that vision to our students.\n  Then I also want to mention the We The People Program on the \nConstitution and Bill of Rights. Here in this Chamber, we discuss the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights virtually on a daily basis. \nVirtually every day on this floor, we discuss how these founding \ndocuments affect how our laws are applied and how freedoms are \nprotected in the United States of America. This program helps our \nchildren learn those fundamental principles. Sort of the heart and \nspirit of the American democratic world are conveyed through this We \nThe People Program.\n  I also wish to commend a whole host of banks in Oregon that have \nagreed not only to pay interest on these lawyer trust accounts--and \nIOLTA stands for interest on lawyer trust accounts--but to pay 1 \npercent, which is above the going rate on most types of transaction \naccounts. They do that because they benefit from the deposits, and they \nknow their communities benefit from these services and these programs.\n  This legislation will resolve a problem in which lawyers, applying \ntheir fiduciary responsibilities, would have had to withdraw their \nfunds from these accounts and put them in other non-interest-bearing \naccounts, to no benefit to anyone and to a great deal of harm to so \nmany.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \nTREATY WITH RUSSIA ON MEASURES FOR FURTHER REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF \n                        STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS\n\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to executive session to resume consideration of the following treaty, which the clerk will report.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Treaty with Russia on Measures for Further Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms.\n\n\tPending:\n\n       Corker modified amendment No. 4904, to provide a condition \n     and an additional element of the understanding regarding the \n     effectiveness and viability of the New START Treaty and \n     United States missile defense.\n\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, we currently have two amendments, one of which I believe we will be able to accept and one of which we are working on with the Senator from Arizona to determine whether it would need a vote. We should know shortly. We will begin debate on an amendment of the Senator from Arizona. Subsequently, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Corker, have an amendment they want to proceed on with respect to missile defense. Those are the only two at this time. We hope to be able to get to final passage on this treaty without delay. The Senator from Arizona assured me they are trying to work through what that means. So I think we will proceed without any attempt to pin that down with a unanimous consent agreement at this point. Obviously, for all Senators, we want to try to do this as soon as is practical.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\tMr. KYL. Mr. President, would it be in order for me to call up an amendment at this time?\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for that purpose.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4892, as Modified\n\n\tMr. KYL. I call up amendment No. 4892, as modified. The modification is at the desk.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is so modified.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, if we could begin the consideration, as I mentioned, we are working on that language. I do not want to agree to the modification yet until we have had a chance to talk with the Senator about it. I am not saying we will not agree to it. I want to see if we can get that done. If we can begin on the amendment as originally filed, we can interrupt to do it with the modification. I want a chance to clear it.\n\tMr. KYL. I am not asking at this time there be an agreement. I am simply saying that the amendment I want to bring up is the amendment I filed.\n\tMr. KERRY. I have no objection to the as modified to consider it.\n\tMr. KYL. I will describe the modifications. They were made in an effort to get agreement. If we cannot, that is fine, but I do think it makes it more palatable to Members.\n\tMay we have the amendment read.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4892, as modified.\n\n\tMr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require a certification regarding the design and funding \n                         of certain facilities)\n\n       At the end of subsection (a), add the following:\n       (11) Design and funding of certain facilities.--Prior to \n     the entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that the President intends to--\n       (A) accelerate the design and engineering phase of the \n     Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) building \n     and the Uranium Processing Facility (UPF); and\n       (B) request advanced funding, including on a multi-year \n     basis, for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement \n     building and the Uranium Processing Facility upon completion \n     of the design and engineering phase for such facilities.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\tMr. KYL. Mr. President, this amendment has to do with the modernization of our nuclear weapons enterprise. It is a subject with which we began this debate. As we get toward the end of the debate, it remains a piece of unfinished business with which I think we need to deal. Remember, the nuclear enterprise we are talking about consists primarily of the facilities that are used to work on our nuclear weapons, as well as the weapons and importantly the scientists who work in those facilities. They represent our National Laboratories, as well as other production facilities and related facilities.\n\tThe point I think is important for people to remember is that unlike all of the other nuclear powers in the world today, the United States does not have an active modernization program for our nuclear deterrent, a program which enables us, for example, to remanufacture a component of a weapon and replace an existing weapon with that.\n\tThe need for this has been made very clear by all of the people in the administration who have considered this, including Secretary of Defense Gates. The Secretary, remember, is, in effect, the customer for the Department of Energy, which is the Department responsible for producing these weapons. The budget we talk about is a Department of Energy budget, but it is really to produce weapons for use by the Secretary of Defense.\n\tHere is what he said about the need to modernize the production complex, which is what we call that group of facilities, as well as the stockpile:\n\n       To be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a \n     credible deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our \n     stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile \n     or pursuing a modernization program.\n\n\tEach year, our Laboratory Directors and the Secretary of Energy are required to provide a certification to the President that certifies the status of the weapons in the stockpile and makes determinations as to whether those weapons are safe, secure, and reliable without the need for testing.\n\tEach year, as we discussed in our closed session, there are reports about the status of these weapons. I will talk in a moment about the material we discussed in the closed session. But suffice it to say here that there is a great need for us to move with alacrity to bring up to date the weapons that are in our stockpile and that requires modernization of the facilities and related equipment to accomplish that task.\n\tThis will require a substantial investment over the next decade. Unfortunately, over the years, these facilities have been allowed to deteriorate, our capacity to atrophy, and our scientists to retire without doing what is necessary to bring these weapons up to date.\n\tThe current budget projection, as expressed in the 1251 report update, which was dated November 17, 2010, initiates that modernization but clearly cannot accurately predict future requirements. This is the problem we have dealt with here.\n\tThe report acknowledges that we have a problem and can estimate today what we think we can spend over the next few years--say, 5 years--but it is hard to estimate beyond that as to what the exact cost of this is going to be. I try to deal with that in this particular amendment.\n\tThe Laboratory Directors responsible for certifying our nuclear weapons recently wrote in a letter:\n\n       As we emphasized in our testimonies, implementation of the \n     future vision of the nuclear deterrent . . . will require \n     sustained attention and continued refinement.\n\n\tIn other words, each year they can get their estimates more accurate, as one might expect, and define more specifically what the exact requirements are. In this case, that generally means an increase in costs in one area or another. In fact, Vice President Biden, speaking to this precise problem, said:\n\n       [W]e expect that funding requirements will increase in \n     future budget years.\n\n\tWe know that is going to happen. The question is, can we be any more particular in the funding that we require. My amendment seeks to be a little bit more precise or a little bit more specific than the current language.\n\tAt the crux of this modernization program is a need for a firm commitment for the construction of two critical manufacturing facilities. They are called the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement, or CMRR, plutonium facility--that is at Los Alamos Laboratory--and the Uranium Processing Facility, or UPF at the so-called Y-12 facility at Oak Ridge, TN. Without these, the capacity to perform stockpile maintenance will be lost by 2020 and there will be no capability to modernize our aging stockpile.\n\tFor Members to recall briefly, these are, in many cases, facilities that go all the way back to the Manhattan Project, the project that created the atomic weapons that enabled us to conclude World War II. Some of these buildings were built as early as 1942, and they are not in good shape. In fact, when I was with one of my colleagues from Tennessee visiting the Y-12 facility, I asked one of the people responsible for a particular part of the facility what his biggest concern was. He said: My biggest concern is keeping this thing going for another 10 or 12 years. When you see the facility, you can see that. And that is no way to deal with the most sophisticated weapons that mankind has ever invented.\n\tAs I said, the current plan is a big improvement over what we had just a year or so ago. We got together with the administration and asked them to relook at the plan they had submitted and identify areas where there were deficiencies in funding or planning. They came back with an updated report that revealed funding requirements that had previously not been dealt with. There was a little over $4 billion in funding added to the first 5 years of the 10-year program we are looking at as a result.\n\tBut even there, there was an argument that there were uncertainties, they were only at a certain point in the planning of these two large facilities, and that those funds would be inadequate.\n\tTo note something for our colleagues and of which the Presiding Officer is very well aware, being one of the two Senators responsible for the Los Alamos facilities, he will recall both he and his colleague and others of us, in visiting Los Alamos, were told about the problems of building a facility there where there theoretically could be an earthquake in the near vicinity and the costs of construction have increased dramatically because of the physical needs to protect that facility against any conceivable kind of physical problem. That has increased the cost of the facilities, and they are trying to get a handle on how much they will actually be. They are pretty clear about a ball-park estimate, but a ball-park estimate is not quite good enough for these purposes, as we know.\n\tI will conclude by saying I am a little distressed by the news stories. We cannot expect the news media to have gotten into the detail required to actually make policy. They put it in a political context that the administration put another $4 billion into the pot and why shouldn't that satisfy people like me.\n\tOf course, that is totally beside the point. We are simply trying to get a better handle on how much money will be needed and to be able to plan for that funding in a way that gets it to the facilities in the most expeditious way possible so that, A, we can complete the work that has to be done in time and, B, that will save a lot of money, about $200 million a year.\n\tThere is every reason to want to understand how much it will cost and get it done quickly. It is not about adding $4 billion. That does not begin to cover the cost of these items.\n\tIt is not a matter of some kind of negotiation that additional money was thrown in the pot and is that not good enough. It is a matter of continuing to focus as the cost of these facilities evolves and as the requirements evolve, so that Congress, with the administration's request in its budgets, can provide the funding that is necessary when it is necessary to get these facilities completed as quickly as possible in order to achieve our modernization goals.\n\tThere is no dispute about the fact that there will be additional money required. It is just a question of what to do about it.\n\tThe updated budget, while committing additional funds to repairing these facilities, will not be able to eliminate even over 10 years, for example, the more than $2 billion of documented maintenance issues. There are some things that are simply outside the budget and need to be dealt with.\n\tMy biggest concern in the updated modernization plan is actually that it added to the delays. What we should be doing is trying to telescope these projects as much as possible so we can meet the deadlines for the refurbishing of our weapons--or maintenance of our weapons, I should say--rather--than extending the time for the completion of the facilities. But unfortunately, that is what the latest report did. Instead of accelerating construction of these two most critical facilities, the CMRR and the UPF, the updated plan now delays completion to 2023 and 2024, respectively, rather than 2020.\n\tAs we recall from the executive session we had a couple of days ago, there was information presented as to why these facilities absolutely needed to be completed by 2020 in order to accomplish the life extension projects for some of our weapons.\n\tDelay in these facilities will hamper efforts to perform these critical life extensions of our warheads and not inconsequentially add significant costs, again, primarily to keep these aging facilities operational.\n\tAs an example, we have to put a brandnew roof on the facility at Los Alamos even though the facility in 10 or 12 years is no longer going to be used because it will be replaced. But the roof is so bad that the work we have to do in there is affected by the weather, and so we have to build a roof. That is an expenditure one hates to make because in 10 or 12 years that building is not going to be used anymore. But that is the state of repair we are in.\n\tEach year of delay adds to those kinds of maintenance costs. Senator Corker and I and Senator Alexander were told at the Y-12 facility that it is about a $200-million-a-year cost to keep these aging facilities going that we can eliminate if we can complete the construction of these two large facilities.\n\tOne-fourth of the newest increase of this $4.1 billion, of which I spoke, for the next 4 years does not even go to the buildings or the facility. It simply meets an obligation for unfunded pensions that have been allowed to accumulate over the years. The only good news about that is, I guess, they would probably have stolen the money from one of the accounts that directly deals with the modernization of our weapons in order to meet those unfunded pension obligations. So I am glad we were able to put the billion dollars in there. But when they talk about $4 billion more for science work on these weapons, that is not true. Fully one-fourth of it goes to meet these unfunded pension obligations.\n\tThere is a need for things outside the science, but clearly the science requirements are the key ones we are trying to get money to as much as we can.\n\tThe key point also is that the modernization is independent of the ratification of the treaty. It is true that as we reduce the number of warheads, there is even more of a requirement that we know the warheads we have will do their job because we do not have a backup warhead sitting in a storeroom, basically in the event something does not work if that is deployed right now. It is true that as we reduce the number, we have to pay even more attention to whether they are all safe, secure, and reliable. But it is also a fact that the modernization is independent of the ratification of the treaty.\n\tDuring the hearings that were conducted on this treaty, all 16 experts who provided testimony spoke of the requirement for modernization. Many indicated it is a requirement irrespective of START. That is a point that has been made by others as well.\n\tFor example, former Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham in an op-ed recently said:\n\n       The Obama administration's decision to support increased \n     investment in the maintenance of our nuclear weapons lab and \n     stockpile is correct and long overdue . . . But the fact that \n     the administration has revised its policy for the better is \n     in itself no reason for any Senator to endorse START . . . \n     The START treaty and beefed up funding for our nuclear \n     enterprise are two separate issues that should remain \n     distinct.\n\n\tThe point was also made by the person responsible for this modernization program--Deputy NNSA Administrator Tom D'Agostino. He said: ``Our plans for investment in and modernization of the modern security enterprise are essential, irrespective of whether or not the START treaty is ratified.''\n\tSo this has to be done whether the treaty is ratified or not, and I think everybody acknowledges that fact.\n\tSo we believe the resolution of ratification needs to address these issues by providing a couple conditions, and we have modified the original language in order to try to get an agreement. If we can't, we will vote on it and see what happens, but I am hoping my colleagues will agree.\n\tThe first is something I know has been agreed to; that is, a condition the President will provide an annual update of the section 1251 report.\n\tThe administration is agreeable to this, and it is the way for Congress to be annually advised of the status of this construction, the status of the facilities, and what more may need to be done on that. Presumably, that will be provided at or about the time the budget is sent to Congress from the administration.\n\tSecondly, a condition the President will certify, prior to entry into force of the treaty, that the President intends--so this is not a requirement that he has achieved a particular result, but he intends to accelerate the design and engineering phase, to the extent possible, of the CMRR and UPF.\n\tIn other words, we are not asking the impossible be done, just that to the extent we can possibly do it, we accelerate the design and engineering of these two facilities so they can get done on time, rather than with the delays.\n\tThird, that the administration--or the President--request advance funding, including on a multiyear basis, for these two facilities--the CMRR and the UPF--upon completion of the design and engineering phase of the planning.\n\tWhat that means is, we are not asking them to provide advance funding for the entire projects, as is done, for example, when we construct an aircraft carrier. We are not asking it be done now, when there are still some uncertainties about exactly what these facilities need and how much they will cost. Los Alamos is still being tweaked, among other things, as I said, because of the need to make it earthquake-proof. What we are saying is, upon completion of the design and engineering phase of planning, then the administration requests advance funding and on a multiyear basis.\n\tWhat that means is--and this is frequently done with large Defense Department contracts, in order to get them done as quickly as possible and as inexpensively as possible--there are multiyear advances of funding so the money can be spent, let us just say hypothetically, within a 5-year period by the Defense Department for an aircraft carrier, for example. Instead of having the Appropriations committees each year appropriate a particular amount of money, and the work that is done can only be done within the constraints of that particular amount of money appropriated in that particular year, what they say is--and I am just speaking hypothetically--the cost is, let's say, $4 billion, and we know it is going to take about 4 years to do this. Instead of saying: Well, we are going to do $1 billion of appropriations each year, what they say is: All right. You have $4 billion, and if you can get it done more quickly by spending this money more quickly, fine. That will save us money and it will get the project done quicker. If you can't, then you can't. But that money is set aside in an account for that purpose.\n\tThat is all we are asking be done here too. These two facilities are both, in terms of order of magnitude, about $5 billion facilities. They might be a little less. They are likely to be a little more--potentially, in the neighborhood of $6 billion or so. Originally, when the administration presented its first 1251 report, the entire 10-year program was set at $10 billion. We knew that wasn't adequate. We went to the administration, they recalculated everything, brought their estimates up to date, and said: That is right, $10 billion is not going to be enough. We will add another $4 billion to $6 billion over the first 4 to 6 years.\n\tUndoubtedly, the cost will increase above that, as has been testified to. My guess is, just in terms of order of magnitude, you are looking at roughly $20 billion over 10 to 12 years. We will know more each year this goes forward. But to construct these two facilities, if we could advance fund at least some money--let's say, 3 years' worth of the money--then it will be possible for the people who are responsible for the construction of those facilities, if they can get 15 months of work out of the first 12 months and spend more than 12 months' worth of money to get that done, that is great. They will have been able to accomplish their job more quickly. Each month that goes by adds costs to the program. So if we can provide them advance funding of some amount--we are not specifying it in here--they can probably get the project done more quickly and less expensively, and that should be a good thing. I think everybody agrees this would be the way to do it.\n\tThere have been two objections posited, to my knowledge. First, the Department of Energy has never done it this way. That, of course, is not the way for us to set policy. I saw my colleague on television this morning saying what we need is a plan. We are too focused always on what is right in front of our face. A lot of times, if we have a basic plan everybody knows we are trying to work toward, it is amazing how much you can accomplish in terms of the details. Well, this is the basic plan.\n\tThe Department of Defense does this every year because they have large-cost construction projects. The Department of Energy has never done it that way--except I am not sure that is true. Before there was a Department of Energy, the Manhattan Project was being built, and GEN Leslie Groves, who is sort of the father of the Manhattan Project, didn't have any problem at all about advance funding. He went to the President and the Congress and said: I need this money. They said: What do you need it for? He said: Don't ask questions, it is secret, and he got the money. That is an oversimplification, but he got that project done in less time than anybody could have possibly imagined because he had the resources provided to him to get it done.\n\tSo when they say it has never been done before, well, actually, it has been done before on this exact--on this exact--national defense item; namely, our nuclear enterprise. It is just that it was back in the early 1940s when people were not so, I guess, concerned about each year's budget and the appropriations that would accompany those budgets.\n\tSecondly, the argument is made that--and this one may surprise folks--well, if we have, let's say, 3 years' worth of funding out there and that money is provided to the Department of Energy, the Members of Congress who are on the Appropriations Committee will grab that money--or parts of it that are unspent--and apply it to other things.\n\tThink about that for a minute. The very people responsible for funding these projects in the Congress, who know they have to be done and who have agreed to the advanced funding in the first place, I think are highly unlikely, after that money has been provided, to say: Well, we need money for some water projects or something so we will go grab some of that money that isn't spent. The whole reason it isn't spent is because you have provided multiyear funding for the project for efficiency purposes. So I don't think that is a reason for us to not advance funds.\n\tI would like to call to my colleagues' attention--and I will let my colleague, Senator Corker, put this in the Record because I think either he or Senator Alexander might talk about it--a letter signed by Senators Inouye, Feinstein, Cochran, and Alexander, who presumably, in the next Congress, will be the chairmen and ranking members of the full committee and subcommittees responsible for this funding. This letter makes it clear they are committed to the full funding of the modernization of our nuclear weapons arsenal and that they are asking the President to submit budgets which will provide for the necessary funding for this and they commit themselves to support that funding.\n\tThat is important, and I don't think we can attribute a motive to Senators like this, who we all know are entirely trustworthy, that somehow after this money is advance funded, that Congress or appropriators are going to reach back and grab money they have already provided because they think there is another purpose they want to spend it for right now. So those are the reasons why I don't think that is a principled argument for why we shouldn't do this. Having this advance funding could complete these facilities on time, rather than with a 2- or 3-year delay, and we could save literally hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\tMr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some additional quotations on the need for modernization from former laboratory Directors, an Under Secretary of Defense, the current Secretary of Defense, the former Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and there are many more we could produce.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                   Additional Quotes on Modernization\n\n       Former laboratory directors: ``However, we believe there \n     are serious shortfalls in stockpile surveillance activities, \n     personnel, infrastructure, and the basic sciences necessary \n     to recover from the successive budget reductions of the last \n     five years.'' \\7\\\n       Secretary Kissinger: ``As part of a number of \n     recommendations, my colleagues, Bill Perry, George Shultz, \n     Sam Nunn, and I have called for significant investments in a \n     repaired and modernized nuclear weapons infrastructure and \n     added resources for the three national laboratories.'' \\8\\\n       Under Secretary Joseph: ``New START must be assessed in the \n     context of a robust commitment to maintain the necessary \n     nuclear offensive capabilities required to meet today's \n     threats and those that may emerge. . . This is a long-term \n     commitment, not a one-year budget bump-up'' \\9\\\n       Secretary Gates: ``This calls for a reinvigoration of our \n     nuclear weapons complex that is our infrastructure and our \n     science technology and engineering base. And I might just \n     add, I've been up here for the last four springs trying to \n     get money for this and this is the first time I think I've \n     got a fair shot of actually getting money for our nuclear \n     arsenal.\\10\\\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       \\7\\ Harold Agnew et al., Letter from 10 Former National \n     Laboratory Directors to Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and \n     Secretary of Energy Steven Chu.

I thank the Chair, and I will have more to say, but I will let other Senators speak.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\tMr. CORKER. Mr. President, as I did yesterday on the floor, I wish to say I cannot thank, and I hope the Senate will feel the same way--I think our country will when they understand what Senator Kyl has done--I cannot thank him enough for his thoughtful, dogged, persistent efforts as it relates to modernizing our nuclear arsenal. As a matter of fact, the Presiding Officer and I accompanied Senator Kyl on a bipartisan trip to Sandia and Los Alamos to look at some of the many needs we have throughout our complex in our country, which resides at seven facilities across the country. It is that foresight that Senator Kyl has displayed, beginning years ago but especially focused over this last year, that I think has led to incredible results.\n\tWhile the Senator and I are obviously going to end up in different places, it appears, on this treaty--and there is no question the treaty and modernization are two very different things--there is no question in my mind that we would not have the modernization commitments we have in hand today if it were not for the treaty. So, for me, it is this whole body of work that works together, and in my opinion makes this decision one that is very easy to make because of the entire body of work.\n\tI wish to say that Senator Kyl, through his efforts, has caused there to be two updates to what is called the Defense authorization 1251. That is something that is required by our Defense authorization bill. It focuses on expenditures to our nuclear arsenal.\n\tI think people will realize, over the next decade, as a result of Senator Kyl's efforts--and Senator Kerry's cooperation and the appropriators and the President and others--that $86 billion will be invested in modernizing our nuclear arsenal, and $100 billion will be invested in those delivery vehicles that relate to our warheads. I think people realize that while we are talking about 1,550 warheads being our deployed limit, we have 3,500 other warheads that are stockpiled all across our country and those also need to be modernized. We need to know they are available.\n\tI think the Presiding Officer and I were able to see where neutron generators were going to expire, where the guidance system that guides many of our missiles is far less sophisticated than the cell phones we have today. In some cases, they still had tubes, such as we had in our old black-and-white televisions.\n\tSo I wish to thank the Senator from Arizona for everything he has done to cause there to be focus on this and for the fact he has caused it to be dovetailed; the fact we have an updated 1251 that reflects the needs of our country; the fact that we have four appropriators who now have committed to the President they will support this effort; the fact the President has said to them--and all this has been entered into the Record--that he will ask for these moneys to modernize our nuclear arsenal.\n\tSo, again, Senator Kyl has done incredible work in this regard. I think he has informed this body, and I think it is due to his efforts and those of us who have supported his efforts that have helped to find gaps in our modernization program. We have been able to talk to the head of the NNSA and the Lab Directors to focus on those gaps.\n\tThe senior Senator from Tennessee has helped tremendously in that regard. He and Senator Kyl and Senator Lugar have actually gone through other sites--sites I did not go through with Senator Kyl myself. So this has been a collective effort led by Senator Kyl.\n\tAgain, I know we will end up in a different place on the treaty as a whole, but it is my hope that the administration and Senator Kerry will accept the changes Senator Kyl has put forth in his amendment. It is my hope that by unanimous consent we can add this to the treaty. Even if that does not occur, there is no question that the contributions of Senator Kyl to the commitments that are so important to ensuring our country is safe and secure by virtue of having a reliable, safe, dependable, nuclear arsenal not only will be evident today, but they will be evident for generations to come. For that, I thank him deeply.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\tMr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I came to the floor to express my admiration for the Senator from Arizona. I was listening to his address and I heard my colleague from Tennessee.\n\tSenator Kyl's work on nuclear modernization is no surprise to any of us who know him very well because his approach to issues is a principled one, and once he determines the principle, he is dogged. He is a determined person. He basically took this issue of nuclear modernization, which is not on the lips of very many people in the United States--the question of whether our nuclear weapons are safe and reliable, whether they will work--he pulled it out of a trash bin and put it on the front page of a national debate.\n\tHe did it in connection with the START treaty, but as he said in his own remarks, this should be done whether you are for the START treaty or against the START treaty. It is completely independent, in that sense.\n\tIn my view, under no circumstances should the START treaty be ratified without doing this. That would be like reducing our weapons and leaving us with a collection of wet matches. We need to make sure what we have left works. But this is sort of the showhorse/workhorse Senator distinction. This is an issue on the back burner. It is an unpleasant issue. No one likes to talk about making nuclear weapons, each one of which could be 30 times as powerful as the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima and ended the war, but it is a part of the reality in the United States and in the world today.\n\tAs Senator Corker was saying and as Senator Kyl said when each of us visited in different times, different places--Senator Kyl came to Tennessee. I was with him there. He has talked to many more people than I have on this subject--these weapons are being modernized in facilities that are completely outdated. It would be as if we were making Corvettes in a Model T factory.\n\tWorse than that, it is not just an inconvenience to the workers there, it is a threat to their safety, and it is a waste of taxpayers' money. As the Senator from Arizona said, after a certain number of years--I am not sure of the exact number anymore, maybe 15 years, some number of years--this pays for itself. The modernization of these facilities, the bringing them up to date, means the taxpayers will pay just as much to operate these old facilities as they would to spend $5 billion or $6 billion or whatever it is to improve these two big new facilities and the other infrastructure and the other things we need to do.\n\tIt ought to be said as well that not one of these facilities is in Arizona. This is not home cooking by Jon Kyl. This is a man who, for a couple decades, has made our nuclear posture his business and has made sure he knows as much about it as anyone and has made sure the rest of us paid attention to it when we might be more interested in the issue of the moment. So it is an example of a Senator doing his job very well. I am deeply grateful for that and I am proud to serve in the Senate with such a person.\n\tI would like to mention the letters I had printed in the Record yesterday. They are such an integral part of the remarks of Senator Kyl and Senator Corker--the letter to the President of December 16, from Senators Inouye and Cochran, the ranking members of the Appropriations Committee on both sides of the aisle, and Senator Feinstein and I, who are both members of the appropriate subcommittee for dealing with this, as well as the President's response of December 20.\n\tIn concluding my remarks, I would like to also congratulate Senator Kyl for his comments about advanced funding. We want to do things in an orderly way in government, but it makes no sense for us to build buildings in the most expensive way, particularly when there is an urgent deadline that is in the national interest. So if indeed by building these buildings more rapidly and saving the annual maintenance costs we could save the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars at a time when we are borrowing 42 cents out of every $1 and every one of us is going to be looking for ways to save money, Senator Kyl's suggestion about advanced funding, which may not be the way the Department of Energy has done it before, ought to be the way we do it now. We didn't used to have a big dip like we do now. Let's look for ways to save hundreds of millions of dollars. We know we are going to have to modernize these weapons, START treaty or no START treaty, as the Senator said. We know we are going to have to save money. Let's accept the Senator's suggestion about advanced funding of these large facilities. As one member of the appropriations committee, I am going to do my best to follow his suggestion.\n\tI am here to congratulate him for a superior, statesmanlike piece of work, both on the treaty which he has worked to improve but also on the nuclear modernization issue which he single-handedly has put upfront before those of us in the Senate and the American people and it makes our country safer and more secure.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\tMr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to thank both my colleagues from Tennessee for their very kind remarks. Actually, the place we have gotten, what we have achieved, is due to the efforts of a lot of people. It starts with Secretary Gates in the Department of Defense; Secretary Chu; Tom D'Agostino; his Deputy Director of NNSA, Don Cook; the Lab Directors who are incredible public servants. We visited with them. These are some of the brightest people in the country and the folks who work with them, many of whom, almost all of whom are about ready to retire, those people who actually designed and developed the weapons we now have. There are a lot of people who devoted their lives to what very few people know or understand. They are now being asked to do a very difficult and complicated job in very difficult surroundings.\n\tPart of what we are asking for--it is not just a matter of convenience, as Senator Alexander said, it is a matter of absolute necessity that these facilities be capable of dealing with these complex weapons. That is why they are expensive, but they are absolutely needed. I thank both my colleagues for having devoted a lot of their own time and attention to this issue and in supporting the efforts of modernization so we can get this job done properly. I appreciate their remarks.\n\tI also would like to proffer a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent to yield 1 hour of the time allocated to the Republican leader postcloture to Senator Kyl.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. KYL. I thank my colleagues.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\tMr. THUNE. Mr. President, I do want to rise in support of the Kyl amendment No. 4892 and echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague from Tennessee about the good work of the Senator from Arizona. He has been a tireless advocate for modernization. It is something that needed to happen, irrespective of whether there was a treaty, but it certainly became a condition in order to have a treaty. If you are talking about reducing the number of your nuclear weapons, you certainly want to improve the quality of the ones you have.\n\tUnlike other nuclear powers, the United States has not had an active modernization program for our nuclear deterrent.\n\tWe have heard from people who recognize the importance of modernizing our nuclear deterrent. I will not reiterate all of those, but I wish to point out, Secretary Gates said recently--he couldn't be any more clear that nuclear modernization is a prerequisite to nuclear reductions when he said:\n\n       To be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a \n     credible deterrent and reduce the numbers of weapons in our \n     stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile \n     or pursuing a modernization program.\n\n\tSimilarly, Thomas D'Agostino, the head of the National Security Administration or NNSA said nuclear modernization is a prerequisite to nuclear reductions, stating: `` . . . as our stockpile gets smaller, it becomes increasingly important that our remaining forces are safe, secure and effective.''\n\tIn the same speech I just quoted from by Secretary Gates, he pointed out: ``Currently, the United States is the only declared nuclear power that is neither modernizing its nuclear arsenal nor has the capability to produce a new nuclear warhead.''\n\tIt is difficult to overstate the dire condition of the U.S. nuclear weapons complex. Its physical infrastructure is crumbling and its intellectual edifice is aging. The Strategic Posture Commission, chaired by William Perry and James Schlesinger, found that certain facilities of the nuclear weapons complex are ``genuinely decrepit'' and the complex's ``intellectual infrastructure . . . is in serious trouble.''\n\tI met with experts throughout the Senate's consideration of New START, and they confirm for me the accuracy of these descriptions. I might say to the Presiding Officer, whose State is home to Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories, we were able to visit those along with Senator Kyl, the Senator from Tennessee and others, and had an opportunity to observe some of the facilities and buildings which are referenced in this amendment. It is absolutely clear, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that we have to make the necessary upgrades and improvements if we intend to keep our nuclear arsenal modern and prepared to deal with the threats we might face in the future.\n\tThe idea that the modernization of the U.S. nuclear complex and delivery force is an absolute prerequisite for nuclear reductions envisioned in New START has been clear to the Obama administration throughout the New START process. In fact, in December of 2009, 41 Senators wrote to the President and said in that letter:\n\n       Funding for such a modernization program beginning in \n     earnest in your 2011 budget is needed as the United States \n     considers the further nuclear weapons reductions proposed in \n     the START follow-on negotiations.\n\n\tJust to be clear, what is modernization? This includes improvements to the physical elements of the nuclear weapons complex. It involves the warheads and delivery vehicles themselves as well as facility infrastructure. Modernization also requires maintenance of the intellectual capacity and capabilities underlying that complex; namely, the designer and technical workforce.\n\tThe amendment, as proposed by Senator Kyl, makes clear in the resolution of ratification how critical modernization is to the United States while it is reducing its nuclear arsenal. First, the amendment places a condition in the resolution of ratification requiring the President to submit an annual update to the section 1251 report. The 1251 report is something annually that comes up here that gives us an update on the nuclear weapons arsenal. Now we will have, thanks to the amendment adopted earlier, a certification with regard to the necessary investment in delivery vehicle modernization, which is an issue I addressed in an amendment earlier in this debate and a critically important one. The Senator has already addressed that in a previous amendment that was accepted by the proponents of the treaty. That was an important step forward.\n\tThis particular amendment deals with the facilities and is also critically important. What it will do is require, in the 1251 report, that the President, when he submits his 10-year plan with budget estimates for modernization of the U.S. nuclear complex, that he also presents an accelerated design and engineering plan for the nuclear facilities and a commitment to funding those.\n\tSo this amendment, such as the one that would call for modernization of the delivery vehicles, is a critical part of the nuclear complex we have, of making sure it is reliable, that it works, and that it is ready and prepared for whatever challenge may face us in the future. As I said earlier, there are many of the experts, and you talk to the Lab Directors themselves, who recognize the importance of making the investments that need to be made in this if we are going to keep that nuclear arsenal ready.\n\tI wish to read one other quote again. Deputy Administrator D'Agostino said:\n\n       Our plans for investment in and modernization of the modern \n     security enterprise are essential, irrespective of whether or \n     not the START treaty is ratified.\n\n\tI suspect before all is said and done, the START treaty will be ratified. But in any event, this process needed to be undertaken irrespective of whether there is a treaty because it is that important to the future of our country and our national security.\n\tAgain, if I might point out, very briefly, what this amendment does, the resolution of ratification must clearly call for a condition that the President will provide an annual update to the section 1251 report in that as a condition the President will certify prior to entry into force of the treaty that he intends to accelerate the design and engineering phase of the chemical facility and the uranium processing facility, request full funding for both of those facilities upon completion of the design and engineering phase of the plan, and an understanding that failure to fund the modernization plan would constitute a basis for withdrawal from the START treaty.\n\tThis is, again, a fairly straightforward amendment. The Senator from Arizona has done, as has already been noted, a superb job of putting on the radar screen of all Members of the Senate the essential and critical nature of getting this issue of modernization addressed. He deserves great credit for doing that. I appreciate the work of the Senator from Massachusetts in cooperating with him in this treaty process to have these amendments and this language accepted because it is essential.\n\tI think it will make not only this treaty stronger, but it will also make the nuclear complex that much stronger. And that, of course, is absolutely essential when it comes to America's national security interests.\n\tSo I support the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. I hope it will be accepted and adopted in the resolution of ratification, and that before this treaty is adopted this essential issue will be not only addressed, as it is in the underlying treaty, but addressed--that language even strengthened and made more durable by these amendments.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey.) The Senator from New Mexico.\n\tMr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I yield my hour of postcloture time to Senator Kerry.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico very much. I do not intend to use that much time, but we will see what develops here.\n\tLet me speak quickly to this amendment. I want to begin by saying everyone in this Senate is respectful of how hard the Senator from Arizona has worked to bring attention, appropriate attention, to the effort to keep up our nuclear deterrent. He has pushed to correct what this administration saw as too many years of neglect for the work of the nuclear weapons complex. I am glad to say this administration has not only heard him, but many other Members of the Senate, from both sides of the aisle, have joined in this effort to call attention to the modernization needs of our nuclear deterrent.\n\tThe administration has appropriately pushed hard for an unprecedented level of funding for this work. In these difficult budgetary times, I do not think anybody here would argue that moving a 10-year budget from $70 billion to over $85 billion, which they have done, what President Obama has done, shows an extraordinary commitment to this enterprise by this administration.\n\tThat is why the three directors of the nuclear laboratories told Senator Lugar and me, ``The proposed budgets provide adequate support to sustain the safety, security, reliability and effectiveness of America's nuclear deterrent within the limit of 1,550 deployed strategic warheads established by the New START treaty, with adequate confidence and acceptable risk.''\n\tThat is also why Tom D'Agostino, the head of the National Nuclear Security Administration, could say a few days ago, ``Having been appointed to my position by President George W. Bush, and reappointed by President Barack Obama, I can say with certainty that our nuclear infrastructure has never received the level of support that we have today.''\n\tGiven all that has happened in the past year, all that has been certified and pledged, and all that we know the administration absolutely plans to do, it is hard to understand why anyone has a question about the nuclear stockpile provision at this point in time.\n\tThis particular amendment, unnecessary therefore in the light of what I have just said, does not present fundamental problems in terms of the words ``to the extent possible we should accelerate.'' That is exactly what they are doing. They are accelerating, to the extent possible.\n\tBut paragraph B presents a number of different issues. Most importantly, the amendment itself requires that the treaty not go into force until all of the these additional certifications are made. The administration has made it crystal clear that it is committed to funding these facilities. If you read the update section of the 1251 report that the administration provided, at Senator Kyl's request, and they provided that in November, here is what they say: The administration is committed to fully fund the construction of the uranium processing facility and the chemistry-metallurgy research replacement, and is doing so in a manner that does not redirect funding from the core mission of managing the stockpile and sustaining the science, technology, and engineering foundation.\n\tSo before we come to this moment, Senators were concerned about whether the administration was committed to the facilities. Then the administration made it very clear they are committed. The President made that commitment as clear as could be in 1251. Now the concern is, they are not building the facilities fast enough.\n\tWell, that runs completely contrary to what the people designing it think is happening and want to do. And, incidentally, if you put additional funding into hiring additional people, by the time you find them and get them, and they are qualified and they come, they are going to be finished with the job of the additional design and early construction planning.\n\tIf this were a post office we were trying to think about building, maybe you could be a little more sanguine about saying, go ahead and accelerate it. But we are talking about multibillion-dollar, complicated facilities that require very significant, sensitive, difficult substances management. They are going to take a certain number of years to build. That is a reality. That is how complex and challenging the task is.\n\tThe early cost and design estimates are that the uranium facility is going to cost somewhere between $4 billion and $6 billion, and the plutonium facility is going to cost about the same. So we all remember the old saying around here, we have got a lot of Senators who are talking about waste in the process of governance. The last thing we want to do in this budget, in my judgment, is create an environment of haste that does not measure properly what we are doing. We ought to listen to the experts on this a little bit, the people who are doing the design and the engineering, who tell us it is no simple matter in the world of nuclear weapons production. It involves hundreds of scientists and engineers working on every single aspect of the plant, in order to make sure it is going to work, that it is going to be secure, and it is going to be as safe as humanly possible.\n\tYou cannot just throw money at an ongoing design and engineering effort and then automatically expect it can accelerate beyond an already significant increase. We have gone up $15 billion. If you hire a whole bunch of engineers who are new to the project, they do not know what they are doing yet. That is a recipe for both inefficiency and possibly even the increase of design risks or other kinds of issues.\n\tThe truth is, if you cram all of these billions into a very short fiscal period, in addition to that, as this amendment seeks to try to force, you could unnecessarily create competition within other nuclear weapons activities, such as the ongoing warhead life extension programs, and our critical warhead surveillance efforts.\n\tThe bottom line here is there is a place and a way to do this. We have an authorizing committee. The Armed Services Committee is the committee that ought to be doing this, not some amendment that comes in attached to the treaty, and linking the treaty going into force to all of these other things being certified.\n\tI think the Appropriations Committee, as well as the Armed Services Committee, would powerfully endorse that notion here on the floor at this point in time. We can compel the President to ask for upfront funding. But that does not guarantee that the President is necessarily going to receive it. And this links it to the notion he can certify that he has.\n\tSo I agree with my colleague, the last administration took way too long to focus on this issue, and Senator Kyl has done an important service to the Senate, to the country, and to this process, to help to focus on it. But it makes no sense to use a resolution on a treaty to lock the President into doing something he cannot necessarily do because of the Congress and other things that are tied to it.\n\tI reserve the balance of my time. \n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\tMr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent to have 4 or 5 minutes.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. ALEXANDER. I listened to Senator Kerry's remarks just now. This is an excellent discussion. Not only do I applaud Senator Kyl for resurrecting the whole focus on nuclear modernization, I applaud the President for the updated report that was received on November 17. A lot of work was done. This is a lot of money to say we want to make sure these nuclear weapons work and we are going to spend $85 billion over 10 years.\n\tThe intent of Senator Kyl's amendment, though, is not to tie the President's hands, it is to give him more options. I think it is to encourage this big, slow-moving government not to waste the money but to save money. The language says: The President shall certify to the Senate the President intends to accelerate, to the extent possible, the design and engineering phase.\n\tAt the Oak Ridge facilities, which Senator Kyl visited, he was told that the savings annually to taxpayers of having the new facility versus the old facility are in excess of $200 million. So every year we do it, every year this is completed, the taxpayers save $200 million. So if the President and the Appropriations Committee should decide that a 2-year or 3-year advanced funding will save $200 million a year at a time when we are all dedicated to trying to save money, we should do that.\n\tYou might say, well, why do we need to say this in the Senate? The answer is, we have never done it before. And the U.S. Government, if you have never done it before, takes a little nudge to pay attention to it.\n\tSo Senator Kyl has made an amendment, and if I understand it correctly, Senator Kerry amended the amendment a little bit to make it softer, to say, the President intends to accelerate, to the extent possible. So this is suggesting to the Department of Energy, which has never done it this way before, that we think it is a good idea, if it is practical, and if it saves money.\n\tThere is also the matter of getting it done on time. Senator Kyl talked about that, the dates we talked about in the executive session. So I would argue to my colleagues that the Kyl amendment is respectful of the President's prerogatives, which he ought to have. He is the manager of the government. He is the Commander in Chief. But it says: If we can think of a way to do this in a way that saves $200 million a year, year after year after year, why should we not do it?\n\tI will bet during the next session of Congress, if we do our job properly in this body, we are going to be competing with each other to find ways to save $10 million a year, $20 million a year, $100 million a year, because of the incredible deficit. We have got bipartisan concern about that deficit. We had two Democratic Senators and three Republican Senators support the debt commission.\n\tI would suggest to my friend from Massachusetts it is not possible that you have modified the Kyl amendment to the extent it ought to be accepted, so that the President can get a signal from the Senate that if he thinks he can do this, to the extent possible, that accelerating the building of these big facilities by 2 or 3 years, if it would save $400, $500, $600 million, that we want to encourage him to do that. That is my only thought.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much for his participation and contribution to this effort. I am trying to work to see if--as I have said, there are certain components of this that make it difficult to accept, that multiyear piece and so forth.\n\tBut the notion of reaffirming the commitment the President has made is not difficult to make. From our judgment, the President has really addressed this as significantly as one can by putting the $85 billion there, by making it clear they are moving forward, they are going to fully fund it, and by helping the Appropriations Committee members to provide the letter which speaks to their good faith going forward. All of those steps have taken place.\n\tWe just don't want to get into a situation where we are creating another hurdle to get over before the treaty goes into effect. If we could find a way as a declaration or some way to reframe this condition--I am working with the administration to see if we can do that--we would be happy to try to restate it.\n\tMr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator. No one is doubting the President's commitment. He has made an extraordinary commitment. I congratulate him for that. It is just the suggestion of doing it a little differently, if the President thinks it is practical, because it might save $200 million a year, year after year after year. A suggestion from us like that could make the difference in those savings. I thank the Senator for working in that spirit.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\tMr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 15 minutes.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. CASEY. Mr. President, as we continue to work through the amendments, I rise to outline what is at stake in the debate and describe what the world would be like without the New START treaty accord.\n\tEvery Senator here took an oath to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. We have an obligation to support a strong national defense.\n\tFirst, a world without New START is one in which more nuclear missiles are pointed at Americans. This treaty reduces that number.\n\tA world without a New START accord is one in which we have no nuclear inspectors on the ground in Russia. These inspectors have more than a decade of experience inspecting Russian nuclear sites. They were involved in the negotiation process to ensure that there are strong inspection provisions in the treaty. But without New START, these inspectors would not be able to return to work. Furthermore, without onsite inspections, our intelligence services will still be required to collect information on Russia's nuclear weapons infrastructure.\n\tOn December 20 of this year, ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote to the Senate:\n\n       An extended delay in ratification may eventually force an \n     inordinate and unwise shift in scarce resources from other \n     high priority requirements to maintain adequate awareness of \n     Russian nuclear forces.\n\n\tIn a world without New START, our intelligence capabilities will be stretched, which could give the enemies of our troops on the ground an advantage. We cannot allow that to happen.\n\tThese are just some of the direct effects. What about some of the indirect effects of a world without New START? The cascade effect on U.S. national security interests without New START is substantial.\n\tA world without New START is one in which the Russians are less likely to provide land and air access to supply U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The Northern Distribution Network is a crucial supply route for our troops in Afghanistan. This means that just as we have reached full troop strength in Afghanistan, supply lines would become increasingly strained. Today, supply routes through Pakistan are increasingly dangerous. Just the other day, two fuel tankers meant to supply our troops were attacked and the drivers were killed in Pakistan. This is one of the reasons the leadership of our uniformed military want New START ratified.\n\tA world without New START is one in which there is more Russian fissile material in existence, material which could be stolen for use in a terrorist attack.\n\tThere are many reasons top U.S. counterterrorism officials in the International Atomic Energy Agency want New START ratified.\n\tA world without New START is one in which Russia's Government is perhaps less likely to help stop Iran's nuclear weapons program. A world without New START is one in which Iran perhaps is given access to Russian S-300 missiles, a weapon capable of reaching the State of Israel. This is one reason the Anti-Defamation League, B'nai B'rith, the American Jewish Committee, and other prominent pro-Israel groups want New START ratified. \n\tIn a world without New START, there is no way the Russians will agree to decrease their tactical nuclear weapons. Our friends in Eastern Europe and those across the continent will be less secure in the knowledge that threats to their security are not diminishing but could, in fact, be growing. That is the reason 25 European Foreign Ministers want this treaty ratified.\n\tA world without New START is one in which the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the so-called NPT, the cornerstone of preventing nuclear weapons states, is severely threatened. What does this mean in practical terms? The New START accord is a clear demonstration that the United States is upholding our obligations under the NPT, which in turn can help secure support from other countries for a strong arms control regime and assistance on other nonproliferation issues. Many countries see nuclear terrorism as a problem for the United States and for the West. In a world without New START, these countries would seriously question our commitment to the NPT. These countries would question that right away.\n\tWithout New START, government officials around the world will question the U.S. commitment to nonproliferation itself. They will ask: If the United States is not seriously committed to arms control and nonproliferation, why should we be?\n\tA world without New START contains many hard realities for the United States. Ratification of this treaty is not a political victory for one party or another; it is a national security victory for our great Nation, for our nuclear security--from nuclear security, to the security of our troops in Afghanistan, to the security of our ally Israel.\n\tA world without New START is one in which the enemies of America will breathe a little easier. Strained U.S. supply lines make life easier for the Taliban. Fewer available intelligence capabilities would make life easier for al-Qaida terrorists in Pakistan tribal areas. A strained U.S.-Russian relationship makes life easier for the government of the regime in Iran.\n\tA world without New START makes life easier for terrorists trafficking in fissile material to travel across borders.\n\tA world without New START means no negotiations with the Russians to decrease their tactical nuclear weapons.\n\tThe world I just described isn't a world we have to settle for. A world without New START is not a world we have to accept. We must give the American people some peace of mind as to our national security. That is a world with a New START treaty. We must ratify this treaty and diminish the number of nuclear weapons pointed at the United States today. We must deploy nuclear inspectors to Russia, thus returning stability and transparency to our nuclear relationship, and take the burden off of our intelligence agencies.\n\tA world with New START means a more constructive relationship with Russia, which is good for our troops in Afghanistan and bad for the regime in Iran.\n\tA world with New START means the beginning of a conversation with the Russians on tactical nuclear weapons.\n\tA world with New START is one in which there is less fissile material for terrorists to steal or buy on the black market.\n\tA world with New START means increased cooperation with countries combating nuclear terrorism. The most serious threat to U.S. national security is the threat of nuclear weapons in the hands of terrorists. In 1961, at the United Nations, President John F. Kennedy said:\n\n       Every man, woman and child lives under a nuclear sword of \n     Damocles, hanging by the slenderest of threads, capable of \n     being cut at any moment by accident or miscalculation or by \n     madness.\n\n\tSome have observed that in this post-9/11 era of increased terrorism, we may be more vulnerable to a nuclear attack than we were during the Cold War. Today, the sword of Damocles still hangs by the slenderest of threads, but we have the ability to prevent this threat by minimizing access terrorists would have to nuclear material.\n\tPresident Obama's nuclear security summit earlier this year was a historic event. It helped create a foundation upon which other countries will take up the challenge of nuclear security and cooperate with the United States to accomplish the President's goal of securing all fissile material in 4 years. We cannot do this alone. In order to confront this most serious threat to U.S. national security, we need to build stronger ties with our allies around the world, and part of building that trust is rebuilding our own credibility on nonproliferation issues. This New START agreement is a very positive step in that direction. It is an essential predicate for fulfilling our commitments under the nonproliferation treaty--a key marker for many potential allies on a range of nuclear security issues. Upon ratification of New START, we must make progress on securing fissile material around the world.\n\tThis is a strong resolution of ratification. It passed out of the Foreign Relations Committee by a bipartisan vote of 14 to 4. It includes strong language on missile defense, verification, and tactical nuclear weapons.\n\tFinally, the American people are watching. According to a November 2010 CNN poll, 73 percent of Americans support ratification of this treaty. They understand the implications of a world without the New START agreement.\n\tIn a hurricane of partisan rancor and political battles, the national security consensus is as strong as an oak tree in support of the New START agreement--all six living former Secretaries of State, five former Secretaries of Defense, three former National Security Advisers, seven former commanders of the U.S. Strategic Command, the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff, our intelligence services, the President, and three former Presidents.\n\tThe American people have a right to expect ratification of New START. They want New START and will hold us accountable if we do not ratify it. Let's vote for New START's resolution of ratification and cast a strong bipartisan vote in favor of our national security.\n\tI close with commendations for both our chairman, Senator Kerry, and Ranking Member Lugar and so many others who have worked so hard to make sure we can ratify this treaty.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\tMr. CORNYN. Mr. President, may I inquire, is there any time limitation on Senators at this point?\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is operating postcloture, and each Senator has up to 1 hour.\n\tMr. CORNYN. I thank the Chair. I assure my colleagues, I will not use the full hour, which I am sure is good news.\n\tMr. President, I oppose the ratification of the New START treaty for the reasons many of my colleagues have articulated and to which I have previously spoken. The treaty requires unilateral reductions of the United States on strategic nuclear weapons. It fails to address tactical nuclear weapons--an area in which the Russian Federation has a 10-to-1 advantage. This is not an idle or incidental matter.\n\tGEN Nikolai Patrusheb, Secretary of the Russian National Security Council, a body in charge of military doctrine, has declared that Russia may not only use nuclear weapons preemptively in local conflicts such as Georgia or Chechnya but may deliver a nuclear blow against the aggressor in a critical situation, based on intelligence evaluations of his intentions.\n\tI submit also that the verification provisions of this treaty are weak, allowing only 18 inspections a year for an arsenal of more than 1,500 weapons. Obviously, the ability to get more than a sampling of Russian Federation compliance would be impossible given the relatively few number of inspections permitted under the treaty.\n\tAs we have discussed off and on over the last few days, the preamble of the treaty itself is ambiguous and has been construed by the Russians themselves as limiting the ability of the United States to expand its own missile defense system.\n\tI realize the President of the United States has submitted a letter stating his unilateral opinion of what that treaty obligation means, but, of course, treaty obligations are not unilateral declarations, they are bilateral agreements. Of course, the consequence of a misunderstanding over this important issue of missile defense could allow either side to withdraw from the treaty and, indeed, the threat of withdrawal from the treaty because of this misunderstanding is something that could be avoided in the first instance if, in fact, some of the amendments addressing missile defense were allowed and the treaty modified to that extent. At that time, the Russians could then be asked: Will you agree with this modification, and we would know upfront, not on the back end, their sincere intentions.\n\tBut I would say that the New START treaty has flaws when you look at it, not only in its various provisions; that is, when you reason from the whole to its parts, but I would suggest the treaty also fails when you look at it the other way around, when you reason from the parts to the whole, when you see this treaty is another example, another symptom, of a foreign policy that sends a message of timidity, even ambivalence, not only about our own security but about America's leadership role in a very dangerous world.\n\tThis larger strategic context is what we need to keep in mind. We all know that President Obama has set incredibly high expectations for his Presidency in terms of how he would conduct American foreign policy. In an early Presidential debate, for example, he promised to meet with the leaders of five rogue nations--Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea--``without precondition during the first year of [his] administration.'' Well, we now know that never happened.\n\tAfter he won the nomination, you will recall, in his famous speech he gave in the city of Berlin, while still a candidate for the Presidency, he declared he was a ``citizen of the world.'' Also, he said: ``This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet.''\n\tPresident Obama was not the only one promoting a grandiose vision of his Presidency. Remember the Nobel Prize Committee received his nomination for the Peace Prize less than 6 weeks after President Obama took office. In the citation for the award last year, they said:\n\n       [President] Obama has as President created a new climate in \n     international politics. . . .\n       Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama \n     captured the world's attention and given its people hope for \n     a better future.\n\n\tYou might ask, What relevance does this have to our consideration of the START treaty? The relevance is that a big part of this utopian dream of a ``new climate in international politics'' has been the elimination of all nuclear weapons.\n\tIn that Berlin speech, then-Senator Obama said that one of his priorities was to ``renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.''\n\tThe citation for the Nobel Peace Prize included this observation:\n\n       The Committee has attached special importance to Obama's \n     vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons.\n       The vision of a world free from nuclear arms has powerfully \n     stimulated disarmament and arms control negotiations.\n\n\tIndeed, in an op-ed piece, authored by the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, dated April 7, 2010, in the Guardian, she argues that the START treaty is an important step toward a nuclear-free world.\n\tSo you might ask, what is wrong with a vision of the world without nuclear weapons? Can't we hope and dream? Of course, even without nuclear weapons, we know that in World War I and World War II tens of millions of people lost their lives in armed conflict. So it is not as if a world without nuclear weapons is a world without war and a world without danger for peace-loving nations such as ours and our allies.\n\tWe also know that any number of foreign policy experts have expressed serious reservations about indulging in this fantasy of a world without nuclear weapons.\n\tGeorge Kennan has said:\n\n       The evil of these utopian enthusiasms was not only or even \n     primarily the wasted time, the misplaced emphasis, the \n     encouragement of false hopes. The evil lay primarily in the \n     fact that those enthusiasms distracted our gaze for the real \n     things that were happening. . . .The cultivation of these \n     utopian schemes, flattering to our own image of ourselves, \n     took place at the expense of our feeling for reality.\n\n\tThe President of the United States has not only mused about fantastic notions that have no basis in the real world, he has criticized his own country on foreign soil so often that some called that particular trip ``the world apology tour.''\n\tSo what should our competitors and would-be adversaries make of these statements of a fantasy world that is nuclear free and a President who travels abroad and apologizes for America's strength? Regretfully, I can only conclude it sends an impression of weakness and a lack of determination to maintain America's leadership in the world. We know there are dangerous consequences associated with an interpretation by others that America has lost its resolve to lead the world or to maintain its own security and to protect its allies.\n\tPresident Reagan said famously:\n\n       We maintain the peace through our strength; weakness only \n     invites aggression.\n\n\tExperience has proven the truth of those words.\n\tWe should recall that the President of the United States conducted YouTube diplomacy by recording a video for Iran's leaders--but then withheld comment when those same leaders were brutally crushing a pro-democracy movement and their own people's hopes for freedom.\n\tThe President has treated several of our allies without the respect they deserve. Some have been, like Britain, slighted; others, like Israel, have been lectured; and other of our allies have been thrown under the bus on missile defense, like Poland and the Czech Republic.\n\tHe has been so idealistic and naive, you might say, about the subject of nuclear weapons that President Sarkozy of France remarked about it publicly at a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. He said:\n\n       We live in the real world, not in a virtual one. . . .\n       President Obama himself has said that he dreams of a world \n     without nuclear weapons.\n       Before our very eyes, two countries are doing exactly the \n     opposite at this very moment.\n\n\tPresident Sarkozy said:\n\n       Since 2005, Iran has violated five Security Council \n     Resolutions. . . .\n\n\tHe said:\n\n       I support America's ``extended hand.'' But what have these \n     proposals for dialogue produced for the international \n     community?\n       Nothing but more enriched uranium and more centrifuges.\n       And last but not least, it has resulted in a statement by \n     Iranian leaders calling for wiping off the map a Member of \n     the United Nations.\n\n\tI fear the New START treaty will serve as another data point in the narrative of weakness, pursuing diplomacy for its own sake--or indulging in a utopian dream of a world without nuclear weapons, divorced from hard reality.\n\tLast week, I mentioned that Doug Feith, formerly of the Defense Department, helped negotiate the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty, known as the SORT treaty. Mr. Feith said that during the negotiations of the SORT treaty, the Russians were constantly trying to get the United States to negotiate away our right to defend ourselves from missile attacks through a robust missile defense program.\n\tThe Bush administration rightly rejected those Russian demands and--you know what--we got a good treaty anyway. The Obama administration, on the other hand, gave Russia what it wanted--or what it says it wanted--among other concessions. But that is not the only concession that was given under the New START treaty.\n\n\tI would ask my colleagues, Where are the concessions that Russia made to us in this treaty? Where are the concessions that Russia made to us? And what in the treaty is a good deal for the United States?\n\tBut my colleagues may reply, So what. So what if the Obama administration's world view is a little bit naive. So what if the Russians negotiated a much better deal for themselves than the Obama administration got for the United States. Shouldn't we go ahead and approve the treaty anyway? What harm could it do? Couldn't it help build a better relationship with the Russian Federation and help transform America's reputation in the world?\n\tThose are actually good questions. But the answers are sobering. The administration has long argued that its approach to diplomacy was not only good for its own sake, but it would strengthen relationships with nations all around the world. I would ask you, how has that worked out?\n\tCharles Krauthammer reviewed the global response to President Obama's diplomatic overtures in this way. He said:\n\n       Unilateral American concessions and offers of unconditional \n     engagement have moved neither Iran nor Russia nor North Korea \n     to accommodate us.\n       Nor have the Arab states--or even the powerless Palestinian \n     Authority--offered so much as a gesture of accommodation in \n     response to heavy and gratuitous American pressure on Israel.\n       Nor have even our Europe allies responded: They have anted \n     up essentially nothing in response to our pleas for more \n     assistance in Afghanistan.\n\n\tAnd, of course, we could look at the results of the New START treaty itself. Russian leaders have responded to American concessions with contempt. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has said that the treaty ``cannot be opened up and become the subject of new negotiations.'' Prime Minister Putin has threatened a new arms race if Russia does not get its way with this version of the treaty. Russian leaders have the temerity to lecture and attempt to intimidate the Senate from discharging our constitutional responsibilities. We should not succumb.\n\tIn deciding whether to vote for the treaty, I would respectfully ask whether some Senators have been asking themselves the wrong question. Instead of asking ourselves the question, Why not ratify? What is the harm? I would suggest that the better question is, Why should we? I would urge my colleagues to vote against this treaty not because I do not care about the message it will send to Russia and other nations but because I do care about that message, and it is time we stop sending a message of weakness that only encourages our adversaries.\n\tI urge my colleagues to vote no on this treaty, to require the administration to go back to the negotiating table with the Russians, to get a better deal for the United States, and to make clear that the era of unilateral American concessions is over.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tMr. VITTER addressed the Chair.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would simply ask to get a sense of how long the Senator thinks he might speak. We might line up the next speaker.\n\tMr. VITTER. Five minutes.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senator from Louisiana is finished, the Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, be recognized for 5 minutes.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n\tWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. KERRY. I thank my colleague.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n\tMr. VITTER. Mr. President, I too am opposing the ratification of this New START treaty because I think it makes us less secure, not more secure, as a nation. Of course, that has to be the ultimate test.\n\tA toughly negotiated, balanced treaty with Russia which allowed for adequate and reliable inspections and data exchange could make us more secure. But this is not such a treaty. It is clear to me that President Obama went into negotiations willing to give up almost anything for a treaty, and that basic posture produced what it always will--a bad deal for us.\n\tThe proponents of the treaty suggest as much when they lay out as their top arguments for ratification: a better relationship with Russia, the help from Russia on other issues that ratification could engender, and progress with world opinion.\n\tI think it is dangerous to count on any of that or to look at all beyond the four corners of the treaty--the pros and cons of the details and the substance of the treaty itself.\n\tWhen I look within the four corners of the treaty, I am particularly concerned about four cons of the treaty.\n\tFirst, serious roadblocks to missile defense: I think it is a fundamental mistake and a dangerous precedent for any treaty on offensive arms to even mention missile defense, and Russia has made it clear that any major progress on U.S. missile defense will cause them to leave the treaty. Particularly with President Obama in office, this creates real political obstacles to the full missile defense I support and the American people support in great numbers. Indeed, President Obama has already abandoned our missile defense sites in Eastern Europe to help produce an agreement on this treaty by the Russians.\n\tSecond, fundamentally imbalanced arms reductions: In this treaty, we reduce our nuclear arms significantly; Russia stays where they already are. Meanwhile, we still aren't getting to the issue of tactical weapons, a category where Russia has a huge 10-to-1 advantage. We have talked about that for decades, and we still aren't getting there. Clearly, when the United States has leverage to commit Russia to reduce their tactical nuclear weapons as we do right now before this treaty, and those nuclear weapons are the most vulnerable to end up in terrorists' hands, we must use that leverage and not throw it away for U.S. and global security. Instead, proponents of this treaty argue that a further treaty addressing tactical nuclear weapons in the future will materialize, but the leverage we have to get there is being given up, essentially, with this treaty.\n\tThird, inability to verify: This treaty does not give us the inspections and data we need to verify Russian compliance, and we know Russia has cheated on every previous arms control treaty with us. Verification is clearly less under New START than in START I, but it now needs to be greater because the nuclear deterrent under this treaty would be much smaller and thus produce much less room for error.\n\tFourth and finally, major but ultimately inadequate progress on nuclear modernization: Now, major progress has been made during the ratification debate on the administration's commitment and concrete plans for nuclear modernization. I thank everyone who has helped produce that, particularly the leader in that effort, Senator Jon Kyl, for his work which, again, did produce real progress. But, ultimately, neither the specificity of the administration's commitment, including on the nuclear triad issue, nor the proposed schedule is adequate to our security needs, so I will certainly continue fighting to get where we need to be.\n\tSo, in closing, I urge my colleagues to look hard at this treaty and to ask the only ultimate question: Does it make us less secure or more secure? I think clearly for the four major reasons I have outlined, and others, it makes us less secure, and we need to do far better.\n\tThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\tMr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise in support of the New START treaty. I wish to make a comment. I was raised in a time that when the President of the United States went abroad, he spoke for our country and there was no partisanship when that occurred.\n\tIt is troubling to this Senator to hear comments about our President when he goes abroad in an apology tour. I would beg to differ, and I think we ought to rise above that partisanship when issues of national security are at stake.\n\tNow to the treaty. This agreement with Russia is going to strengthen our national security. Look at all the people in the Pentagon who have embraced it--the former Secretaries of State, the former Secretaries of Defense, from both sides of the political aisle, and it deserves our support too. I expect today we are going to get an overwhelming bipartisan vote in favor of this treaty.\n\tI wish to specifically address the question that has been raised about modernization of our nuclear stockpile--an issue I had the privilege, as chairman of the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, to be engaged in over a 4-year period. Arguments have been made that somehow this treaty is going to interfere with the modernization of our nuclear weapons infrastructure. Well, it is exactly the opposite. Ratification of this treaty is so important to give security and stability to the question of the use of those nuclear weapons that it will allow us to spend the needed resources on the modernization of our nuclear complex, which is an equally important matter.\n\tAs part of this year's Nuclear Posture Review, the administration has made a commitment to modernize our nuclear weapons arsenal and the complex. We must do so to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent because as these weapons in stockpile age, we have to update them and we have to modernize them so they are effective, secure, but also safe. We need to be sure our nuclear weapons are going to work as designed and that they will remain stable and secure.\n\tIn the past, when we maintained a larger and more expensive nuclear stockpile, our weapons were developed and tested frequently. That is very expensive. By the mid-1990s, we had developed sophisticated computer models that can identify and resolve the problems without the nuclear testing. Unfortunately, because of lessened funding back in the era of about 2006 that research diminished, resulting in the layoffs of a lot of the people in our National Labs. I have had the privilege of visiting those three National Labs. There is an incredible array of talent, but that is what happened back in 2006.\n\tI think we have, especially in this administration, a new resolve to turning the situation around and to modernizing the nuclear complex. So what does this modernization entail? The comprehensive plan includes an $85 billion investment over the next decade and a $4 billion increase over the next 5 years, and that investment is going to accomplish several things. It is going to fund the construction of the 21st century uranium and plutonium processing facilities, it is going to spur a reinvestment in the scientists and engineers who perform the mission, and it is going to enhance the lifetime extension program for our nuclear weapons. By the way, it is not only just extending the life of those weapons, it is also making them safer.\n\tSome Senators have expressed concerns about the level of funding for this modernization. I believe our President and this administration have adequately addressed those concerns, and I would note that the Directors of the three labs--Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia--all believe the administration's current plan will allow them to execute their requirements for ensuring a safe, secure, reliable, and effective stockpile.\n\tWhile we move forward with that modernization program, we should also move forward--it is a separate issue--with the treaty. Passing this treaty is going to safeguard our national security while demonstrating to the men and women of our nuclear complex that we have reached a national consensus on nuclear sustainability.\n\tMr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\tMr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that cosponsors be added to Corker amendment No. 4904, as modified, as follows: Senator Lieberman, Senator Brown of Massachusetts, and Senator Murkowski.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe Senator from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are awaiting the Senator from Arizona who, I know, is working on a couple of things right now. We need to clear a couple of things with the Senator, and we are working on the possibility of accepting his amendment. We just need to tie up those loose ends.\n\tSo I think the Senator from Wyoming may have had a request he wanted to make. We can do that now, and then we will see where we are.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\tMr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the importance of Minutemen III intercontinental ballistic missiles, known as ICBMs, and an amendment I intend to offer. The ICBM is just one leg of our nuclear triad. The nuclear triad spans sea, air, and land. It relies on mobile bombers, hard-to-detect ballistic missile submarines, and ICBMs. They all work together to complicate and deter any attempt at a successful first strike on our country. Like a stool, if you shorten just one leg too much, the stool will become unstable.\n\tOur nuclear triad is not just a weapons system, it is a deterrent. The further we weaken our nuclear forces, the less of a deterrent our triad will become.\n\tThose folks who believe in nuclear zero and arms control seek a world without nuclear weapons at any expense--in my opinion, never at the expense of our national security. The fact is, for over 50 years our ICBM force has deterred a nuclear attack against the United States and our allies.\n\tSome arms control supporters claim our ICBMs are on ``hair-trigger alert.'' They believe an ICBM can be launched by simply pushing a button. This misleading claim that an unauthorized launch can destroy the world in a matter of minutes could not be further from the truth.\n\tGEN Kevin Chilton, the outgoing commander of STRATCOM, once described our nuclear posture as:\n\n       The weapon is in the holster . . . the holster has two \n     combination locks on it, it takes two people to open those \n     locks, and they can't do it without authenticated orders from \n     the President of the United States.\n\n\tThe Minuteman III ICBM force is the most stabilizing leg of the nuclear triad.\n\tICBMs are strategically located and broadly dispersed in order to prevent them from successfully being attacked. The ICBMs protect the survivability of other legs of the triad as a deterrent. They offer an umbrella of protection to our most-valued allies. ICBMs also represent the most cost-effective delivery systems the United States processes. Unlike a bomber, ICBMs ensure a second attack capability.\n\tAs required by section 1251 of the 2010 National Defense Authorization Act, earlier this year, the administration submitted its force structure plan. The President's 1251 force structure plan provides up to 420 ICBMs, 14 submarines carrying up to 240 submarine-launched ballistic missiles or SLBMs, and up to 60 nuclear-capable heavy bombers.\n\tWe are being asked to ratify this treaty without knowing what our force structure will actually be. We are being told: Pass the treaty, and then we will tell you what the force structure will actually look like.\n\tThe 2001 Nuclear Posture Review laid out our force structure in plain view, while the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review is silent on the force structure.\n\tThis report also laid out the administration's plan to modernize and maintain our nuclear delivery vehicles.\n\tWith respect to the next generation of ICBMs, the update states:\n\n       While a decision on an ICBM follow-on is not needed for \n     several years, preparatory analysis is needed and is in fact \n     now underway. This work will consider a range of deployment \n     options, with the objective of defining a cost-effective \n     approach for an ICBM follow-on that supports continued \n     reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons while promoting stable \n     deterrence.\n\n\tThe amendment I plan to offer has no impact on the treaty. It simply requires the President to certify that further reductions in our land-based strategic nuclear deterrent will not be considered when reviewing the options for a follow-on ICBM. This is something I have worked on with Senator Conrad. He has a second-degree amendment to mine, and it is something we both support.\n\tLTG Frank Klotz, the new commander of Global Strike Command, was quoted last year at the Air Force Air and Space Conference and Technology Exposition here in Washington, DC, as saying:\n\n       Continuously on alert and deployed in 450 widely dispersed \n     locations, the size and characteristics of the overall \n     Minuteman III force presents any potential adversary with an \n     almost insurmountable challenge should he contemplate \n     attacking the United States. Because he cannot disarm the \n     ICBM force without nearly exhausting his own forces in the \n     process, and at the same time, leaving himself vulnerable to \n     our sea-launched ballistic missiles and bombers, he has no \n     incentive to strike in the first place. In this case, numbers \n     do matter . . . and the ICBM thus contributes immeasurably to \n     both deterrence and stability in a crisis.\n\n\tThe force structure of our nuclear triad is critical to maintaining an effective deterrent.\n\tIn 2008, Secretary Gates coauthored a white paper titled ``National Security and Nuclear Weapons in the 21st Century.'' This paper argued for a strong nuclear deterrent. The forward stated:\n\n       We believe the logic presented here provides a sound basis \n     on which this and future administrations can consider further \n     adjustments to U.S. nuclear weapons policy, strategy, and \n     force structure.\n\n\tThe white paper by Secretary Gates recommended a U.S. strategic nuclear force baseline that includes 450 Minuteman III ICBMs, 14 Ohio class submarines, and 76 bombers, 20 B-2 and 26 B-52 bombers, for a total of 862. The administration cannot explain how the threat environment has changed since the 2008 recommendation to maintain 862 delivery vehicles. They cannot explain what has changed to allow our nuclear deterrent to be reduced to 700 delivery vehicles.\n\tIt sounds to me as if this administration has been a little too eager in negotiating the treaty.\n\tJames Woolsey, in a recent Wall Street Journal article, described his experiences negotiating with the Russians. He said:\n\n       The Soviets taught me that, when dealing with Russian \n     counterparts, don't appear eager--friendly, yes, eager, \n     never.\n\n\tI think Mr. Woolsey would know; he was involved in the SALT I treaty in 1970 and many more arms control agreements with the Russians before he took over as the Director of Central Intelligence.\n\tI ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 4880, a Barrasso-Enzi amendment, and then a second-degree by Senator Conrad.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, as the Senator knows, we had a discussion about this, and I am constrained to object. I think he understands why. I welcome further debate if he would like, but I must object.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n\tMr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the issue, as it is important. I understand its importance to the part of the country where those particular weapons are housed today. I am confident--and I know this--that the administration, because we have talked about it, has a plan that I think will meet with the consent and approval of the Senators' concern, but they need to go through the further evaluation and analysis of all of these decisions. Decisions have not yet been made, and it would be inappropriate at this time to constrain the latitude they need in order to be able to make those judgments. It is an important issue, but I think it is inappropriate for us to constrain them and particularly to do so in the context of the treaty itself.\n\tMr. President, we are working with our friends on the other side of the aisle to really try to get the final agreement as to how we are going to proceed. I believe it is going to be possible for us to work out the issues with Senator Kyl and his amendment. So I hope we will not need any other votes other than the final vote on the treaty. That is our hope at this point. We will try to work through that over the course of the next few minutes.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, knowing that we are getting to that moment at which point we are going to have an understanding of how we are proceeding forward and knowing that because of the 30-hour limitation, no matter what, we are getting toward the end, rather than chew up time for Senators later on, I thought I would take a moment now to say thank you to a few folks involved in this process. Before I do that, I also will reserve some time, as I will for Senator Kyl and Senator Lugar--and this, I assume, will be part of the agreement we are going to reach--to speak to the substance of the treaty at the appropriate time before we vote.\n\tIt has been an incredible team effort by an awful lot of people over the course of a lot of months. I wish to thank all of them for their involvement.\n\tSenator Lugar has been an unbelievable partner and a visionary with respect to these issues but, importantly, just a very steady, wise, and thoughtful collaborator in the effort to get the treaty to where we are today. It hasn't always been easy for him because there were times when he was a lonely voice with respect to those who were prepared to support this treaty. I wish to pay tribute to his statesmanship and his personal courage in steadily hanging in there with us.\n\tI thank President Obama for his determination to make certain that this was the priority that he felt it was and that I think it is. He and so many folks in the administration have been helpful in this effort.\n\tI will reserve some comments later more specifically, but I think the Vice President has been, at the President's request, an invaluable collaborator in this effort. He has talked to any number of colleagues, made any number of phone calls, been involved in any number of strategic choices here, and I am deeply grateful to him for taking his prior stewardship of this committee and being as thoughtful as he has been in the way he has approached this particular treaty.\n\tSecretary Clinton likewise has dedicated herself and her staff to the effort to work through unbelievable numbers of questions, to make themselves available and to make herself available to talk with colleagues.\n\tThis has been a tremendous team effort with Secretary Gates, Secretary Chu, Admiral Mullen, General Chilton, LTG O'Reilly, and others. None of these things can happen if there isn't a team pulling together to answer questions and deal with the issues colleagues have.\n\tAt the State Department, Assistant Secretary Rose Gottemoeller has been unbelievably available, patient, thoughtful, and very detailed in her efforts to answer the questions of Senators and be precise about this negotiation. She led a tremendous team and worked very closely with Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs Rich Verma, who likewise helped coordinate and pull people together to deal with the issues we faced. Dave Turk, Terri Lodge, Paul Dean, and Marcie Ries have all been key members of that team, and we thank them for their amazing commitment of hours and the dedication they have shown to the effort to try to get us to where we are today, to this final vote.\n\tLikewise, at the Pentagon, Deputy Under Secretary of Defense Jim Miller; the chief Defense Department representative on the negotiating team, Ted Warner; Marcell Lettre; Eric Pierce; Michael Elliott; and Chris Comeau--all of them, together with the State Department, provided the kind of linkage we needed and the consistent effort to answer questions and deal with their principals in order to get the information necessary for Senators to be able to make good judgments.\n\tAt the Energy Department, Tom D'Agostino and Kurt Siemon were also constantly available.\n\tAt the White House, I thank Pete Rouse, chief of staff, and Tom Donilon, the National Security Adviser, and I especially thank Brian McKeon, Vice President Biden's National Security Deputy, who has just done an extraordinary job of helping to provide the bridge between various agencies, as well as strategy, and has been consistently available to us. Louisa Terrell and Jon Wolfsthal have been part of that team. We are very grateful to all of them.\n\tOn the Foreign Relations Committee, it has been a great team effort with Senator Lugar. The chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, Frank Lowenstein, has worked countless hours on this treaty, together with Doug Frantz, Ed Levine, and Anthony Wier. These two gentlemen, Ed Levine and Anthony Wier, are unbelievable veterans of this kind of effort. They worked with Senator Biden for years. I am delighted they were willing to stay over and continue with the committee.\n\tIn the case of Ed Levine, he lost his dad during the course of this debate a few days ago and, nevertheless, hung in there with us and stayed right at it. The wisdom and experience he has brought to this task is invaluable, together with his collaborator Anthony Wier. Peter Scoblic, Andrew Keller, Jason Bruder, and Jen Berlin have been enormous contributors to this effort. I am grateful to all of them.\n\tOn the Republican side, Ken Myers--Ken brings so much experience and wisdom to this task. He has been with Senator Lugar for a long time. What he has done to help us bridge the divide is immeasurable. Tom Moore and Mike Mattler worked with him.\n\tOur staff in S-116, which has sort of been headquarters for us, Meg Murphy and Matt Dixon have put up with strange hours and interruptions. We are eternally grateful to them.\n\tObviously, nothing happens in the Senate without the floor staff, the folks who put in these long hours. Jessica Lewis and Tommy Ross on Senator Reid's staff have been invaluable to us. Lula Davis, Tim Mitchell, and Stacy Rich are invaluable on every issue here. The Senate would not work without them. We are deeply grateful to all these people.\n\tI am glad the schedule allows us a moment where we can actually thank them all publicly. They do a service for our country that many people in the country never have a sense of. They do not see it. Government gets a lot of criticism, but let me tell you, these folks work as hard as any people I know anywhere, and a lot of things could not happen without them.\n\tAs I said, I wish to speak to the substance of the treaty before we vote, but for the moment I yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\tMr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I wish to seize the moment, along with my distinguished chairman, because we are indebted to all the great people he has enumerated, to embellish his congratulations by mentioning that we are grateful, first of all, that the President invited Senator Kerry and me to be part of conversations on two occasions during the negotiation of the treaty. That, we thought, was very valuable and gave us some insight as to where the negotiators were headed and to offer what counsel we could about those issues we felt were important and those issues we were certain all Senators would feel were important as we sought ratification of the New START treaty.\n\tLikewise, those conversations were carried on rigorously by the Vice President, our former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Joe Biden, who has worked with Senator Kerry and with me over the course of three decades or so of active participation and several arms control treaties. Vice President Biden has a very good idea of how the ratification process works and what counsel he can give, not only to us but to all Members and colleagues with whom he has worked so well in the past.\n\tI am especially pleased, likewise, that Rose Gottemoeller, who headed the negotiation team, has been very available to Senators throughout the time of the negotiation abroad and during her trips to Washington and certainly throughout the hearings the Foreign Relations Committee held.\n\tWe are indebted, in fact, to all the witnesses who came before our committee in the 16 hearings that have often been enumerated in conversation on the floor. The witnesses were generous with their time, very forthcoming with their testimony and followup questions the Senators had. Because of that testimony, there is a very solid block of support for the treaty based upon these distinguished Americans who have had enormous experience, not only with arms control treaties but the actual implementation of these with the former Soviet Union--and now with Russia--in the past.\n\tI am indebted, as John Kerry is, to Ken Myers, Tom Moore and Mike Mattler of our staff and to Marik String and Corey Gill. I cite these five members of a very devoted staff who have devoted extraordinary talents and time and devotion to the treaty formulation and to the counsel they have given me, for which I am very much indebted.\n\tFinally, I thank all the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for their diligence and attendance at hearings and their questioning of each other, as well as the witnesses and the discussions we have had both in informal and formal sessions. We have had a difference of opinions. Our views were not unanimous in the 14-to-4 vote by which the Senate Foreign Relations Committee sent this New START treaty to the floor. But I respect deeply each of those views, and I respect the ways in which members of the committee have participated during this very important debate.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\tMr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I say Merry Christmas to all my colleagues. We never expected to find ourselves here this time of year, but obviously there are very important issues to discuss.\n\tOn November 2, Americans made a pretty historic statement. After 2 years of many things being crammed down their throat that they did not like, they made historic changes in the House and the Senate. I think all expectations were that the new Congress would come in and begin to change things. Very few Americans--and I think very few of us in the Senate--actually thought we would use the time between that election and the swearing in of the new Members of Congress to continue to cram through more things America does not want.\n\tMost businesses have learned that if they ever have to make the difficult decision of firing someone, it is very important that person be sent home right away because getting fired usually makes people angry and less loyal to the company that fired them. Instead of dealing with all the mischief that might occur, the fired employee is sent home right away.\n\tWe are a fired Congress in a lot of ways. America has sent us home. Many people who set the policies for the last 2 years have been unelected. Some have retired. But the decisions that are being made now in this Congress are decisions being made by people who have either retired or who have been turned out of office. So much is being pushed through because of the fear that if we actually let the newly elected Congressmen and Senators be sworn in before we take up these important issues that they will actually reflect the opinions of the American people and stop what we are doing.\n\n\tWe have decided to use this lameduck session to push many items through. It is a very unaccountable Congress. We tried to push through a huge omnibus spending bill with thousands of earmarks, exactly the thing about which Americans have said no more. Thankfully, Republicans stood together to stop that bill.\n\tWe needed to extend our current tax rates, but even in order to get a temporary extension, we in the minority had to agree to more deficit spending. In this lameduck session, we have pushed our political correctness on to our military by repealing don't ask, don't tell without the proper studies, without the proper phase-in time, and no rational approach to this. It was just check the box of another political payback.\n\tIn another check the box of amnesty, the DREAM Act, which was brought up and fortunately Republicans stood against something that again avoided the big issue of border security. This Congress has continuously rejected the idea of carrying through on our own law to complete the double-layer fencing we put into law to protect the southern border. Thousands of people are being killed on the border because we refuse to take action. Yet we are continuing to try to expand the problem with more amnesty and citizenship and public benefits to those who came here illegally.\n\tThe threat is now to keep us here until Christmas or beyond to pass what we are calling a 9/11 bill. Every Member of this Chamber--Republicans and Democrats--wants to do what is right for the first responders who may have been injured after 9/11. But we owe it to the American people to be accountable to how we spend money. To put a bill on the floor, in an unaccountable lameduck Congress, that has not been through hearings, when we do not know how the millions of dollars have been used that we have already given to the same cause certainly is worth a few weeks of committee hearings and understanding exactly how to spend taxpayer money effectively in a way we know will help the people who have been injured.\n\tBut, no, we have to push that through in a fired, unaccountable Congress. Of course, now the big issue of the day is somehow, in a time of economic recession and so many people being out of work, that we want to use this lameduck, unaccountable Congress to push through a major arms control treaty with Russia. Somehow that ended up on the top of our priority list, using Christmas as a backstop to try to force us to pass this bill.\n\tIt is pretty interesting how this has progressed. The treaty had no chance of ratification until the President agreed to billions of dollars in modernization of our nuclear weapons.\n\tWe have to stop and ask ourselves: Why should we have to have backroom trading going on to modernize our nuclear weapons? That should be something the President is committed to, that we are committed to. We should not have to trade for modernization. But now we appear to have enough Republicans who have decided this is a good treaty to ratify a few days before Christmas in a fired, unaccountable Congress, with the need to push it through before America's representatives actually get here the first of January. The sense here is if we let the people America just elected come, that maybe the treaty will need some modifications.\n\tThere have been many questions expressed about the treaty. I think some of them are very legitimate. Clearly, missile defense is a problem. The Russians have expressed that Americans cannot develop any kind of comprehensive missile defense system under this treaty. We say: No, no. We can develop a limited missile defense system. We are going through all kinds of convoluted language to put things in nonbinding areas of this agreement, to say we are committed or we are going to communicate to the Russians that we are committed, but we even were unwilling to put it in the preamble that there is no linkage between the development of our missile defense system and this treaty agreement. Clearly, there is a linkage. The Russians believe there is a linkage.\n\tAll the correspondence from the President says ``limited missile defense system.'' We obviously have agreed to it. We never could get the negotiating records to confirm that, but everything suggests there is an implicit and explicit agreement that America will not attempt to develop a missile defense system capable of defending against Russian missiles. Perhaps capable of defending against a rogue missile launch or an accidental missile launch, but the language in this treaty, communications from the White House, the hearings all say we will only have a limited missile defense system.\n\tThere should be no mistake, there should be no confusion, the agreement to this treaty is an agreement for America not to develop a comprehensive missile defense system. If that is satisfactory, then let's ratify. Clearly, there are holes in the verification process of this treaty. The growing and biggest threat is tactical nuclear weapons. Shorter range missiles, ground-based, sub-based are not even included in this agreement. The Russians are fine with this. They were going down to the same long-range missile count we require in this treaty anyway. They give up nothing. We don't restrict any of their tactical developments. The verification is less stringent than in START I, with fewer inspections, and the ability to actually look at things such as telemetry are obviously omitted here.\n\n\tWe can't ratify this treaty with any pretense that America is going to be any safer. In fact, I think the biggest problem with this treaty is the whole presumption it is built on--that America should be at parity with Russia. We have talked about it here in this Chamber, that we do not have the same role as Russia in this world. Russia is a protector of none and a threat to many. America is the protector of many and a threat to none. Over 30 countries live in peace under our nuclear umbrella, but we are saying we are going to reduce it, with a lot of questions as to whether we are going to modernize it, and we are telling our allies that tactical nuclear weapons are not going to be restricted in any way, which is probably their biggest concern because of their contiguous location to Russia.\n\tMr. INHOFE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\tMr. DeMINT. Yes.\n\tMr. INHOFE. When you talk about the missile defense aspect of this, I wonder if it has occurred to a lot of people that maybe this treaty is with the wrong people. We know right now that Iran is going to have the capability--and this is not even classified--of a nuclear weapon, a delivery system, by 2015. I think one of the worst things for America--and this President did it--was to take down the sites we were planning in Poland that would give us this protection.\n\tMy point I want to make, and then to ask the Senator about, is that in the event this is ratified and we are restricted in any way from developing further our missile defense system, doesn't that put us directly in an impaired position in terms of North Korea, maybe Syria, but definitely Iran, that has already indicated and already has the capability of reaching us by that time?\n\tIt is interesting that the site would have been in effect to knock down a missile coming from Iran by 2015, the same year our intelligence community tells us they will have that capability. Isn't that the threat we are concerned about, more than Russia?\n\tMr. DeMINT. I want to thank the Senator from Oklahoma for bringing out another very important point. We are laser focused on this treaty with Russia, which obviously restricts our ability to develop missile defense. Yet we all seem to acknowledge the greatest growing threat in this world is from Iran and North Korea and other rogue nations that can develop nuclear technology.\n\tIt is almost like watching a magician at play here, of getting us to look at one hand while other things are going on. We are not paying attention to the Nation's business here, and I am afraid this is just another ``check the box''--a foreign policy victory for the administration. If it did not have so many questions related to it, that would be fine, but not to jam this through with a fired, unaccountable Congress, and rushing it through before the representatives America just elected have been sworn in, and doing it as part of a list of legislation--a long list over the last 2 years--that America does not want.\n\tI want good relations with Russia and countries all over the world, but I am afraid this is part of a continued effort of accommodation and appeasement; that if we show weakness, other countries will accommodate us. We need Russia to cooperate--with Russia and North Korea. Folks, I don't think this is the way to get it, and I don't think we are going to gain respect for our process of trying to do this under the cover of a distraction of a major holiday with a lameduck, unaccountable Congress.\n\tIn the way this is being presented, it is a mockery of the debate process here in the Senate. We are not amending a treaty. We were told at the outset it is ``take it or leave it.'' The Russians are negotiating, clearly, from a position of strength, because they said, here is the treaty, take it or leave it; any changes and the treaty is dead. Is that the way America needs to deal with other countries? Is that the way the Senate should debate a major arms control agreement, where the majority party is saying, you can go talk about it if you want, but we are going to kill every amendment, even though we say we agree with a lot of them. There will be no changes in this.\n\tWe are trying to stick some things in here in the areas of the treaty that have no binding aspect and say we have covered it, but we are making a mockery of the whole debate and ratification processes with an unaccountable, fired Congress, under the cover of Christmas, and a debate where we have been told ``take it or leave it.'' This is not what the Senate is about, this is not what Congress is supposed to be about, and certainly we should not be passing major legislation at this time of year with this Congress.\n\tMr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. I still hope my colleagues will come to their senses and show the American people that we are going to act in a responsible way that respects what they told us on November 2; that this Congress needs to go, a new one needs to come in, and we need to stop cramming things down their throats they do not want.\n\tWith that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet of Colorado). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are now in the final throes of getting together a unanimous consent request. The leadership has asked us to proceed forward on the amendment. Senator Kyl has asked me--I think he wanted to be here when we do his amendment on modernization, which we are now prepared to accept, with further modification. So I will wait for Senator Kyl in order to do that.\n\tIn the meantime, I understand we also have an agreement on the missile defense amendment, and that amendment is now going to be cosponsored by Senator Lieberman and Senator McCain. So if the Senator from Tennessee wants to talk about that amendment, we are prepared to accept it. I think we should have the discussion of that amendment at this point in time.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\tMr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to at this moment ask unanimous consent to change the name of the amendment to McCain-Lieberman-Corker.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. CORKER. I would also ask unanimous consent to add Senators Johanns, Levin, and Bayh as cosponsors.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\tMr. KERRY. No objection.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4904, as Further Modified\n\n\tMr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would send to the desk the amendment, as modified, and as I understand it, this has been accepted by both sides.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n\tHearing no objection, the amendment is modified.\n\tThe amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subsection (a) of the Resolution of \n     Ratification, add the following:\n       (11) Effectiveness and viability of new start treaty and \n     united states missile defenses.--Prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate, and at the time of the exchange of instruments of \n     ratification shall communicate to the Russian Federation, \n     that it is the policy of the United States to continue \n     development and deployment of United States missile defense \n     systems to defend against missile threats from nations such \n     as North Korea and Iran, including qualitative and \n     quantitative improvements to such systems. Such systems \n     include all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defenses in Europe, the modernization of the Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense System, and the continued development of \n     the Two-stage Ground-based Interceptor as a technological and \n     strategic hedge. The United States believes that these \n     systems do not and will not threaten the strategic balance \n     with the Russian Federation. Consequently, while the United \n     States cannot circumscribe the sovereign rights of the \n     Russian Federation under paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the \n     Treaty, the United States believes continued improvement and \n     deployment of United States missile defense systems do not \n     constitute a basis for questioning the effectiveness and \n     viability of the Treaty, and therefore would not give rise to \n     circumstances justifying the withdrawal of the Russian \n     Federation from the Treaty.\n       At the end of subsection (b)(1)(C), strike ``United \n     States.'' and insert the following: ``United States; and\n       (D) the preamble of the New START Treaty does not impose a \n     legal obligation on the parties.\n\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would ask, before we proceed on that--because Senator Kyl is now here, so we could quickly accept his amendment and dispose of that--I ask unanimous consent that we call up Kyl amendment No. 4892, as modified--as additionally modified.\n\tMr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\tMr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tMr. KERRY. Objection.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4892, as Further Modified\n\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe at the desk now is the Kyl amendment, as modified.\n\tI am sorry about the confusion. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we be able to immediately proceed to the Kyl amendment. We will come right back to the Corker amendment, but I ask unanimous consent to proceed to the Kyl amendment, as modified, with the modification that has been submitted at the desk.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\tWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe amendment (No. 4892), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subsection (a), add the following:\n       (11) Design and funding of certain facilities.--Prior to \n     the entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that the President intends to--\n       (A) accelerate to the extent possible the design and \n     engineering phase of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement (CMRR) building and the Uranium Processing \n     Facility (UPF); and\n       (B) request full funding, including on a multi-year basis \n     as appropriate, for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility upon \n     completion of the design and engineering phase for such \n     facilities.\n\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe Senator Kyl wishes to say something.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\tMr. KYL. Mr. President, I will comment more when I make my concluding comments, but what we have just done is to agree to provide a mechanism for the President to certify a way forward to fund the two large facilities that are part of the nuclear weapons complex in a way that we hope will provide for the most efficient way to build these facilities and to get them constructed as rapidly as possible.\n\tThe result of this is that, potentially, we could save hundreds of millions of dollars and construct the facilities at an earlier date than was originally intended. But to be clear, nothing in this amendment reduces the President's decisionmaking or flexibility. It remains his decision as to how the funding is requested and when it is requested.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I agree with the comments of the Senator. It does leave the President that important ability, but it also puts the question of whether this is a way that is more efficient. It is something we should be looking at, and the President intends to look at it. We will accept this amendment.\n\tMr. President, I don't think there is further debate.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\tThe amendment (No. 4892), as further modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4904\n\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl and the Chair, and now, Mr. President, I believe the Corker amendment is the pending business.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\tThe Senator from Tennessee.\n\tMr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to again say that we have asked by unanimous consent to change this to be the McCain-Lieberman-Corker amendment, and we have also added Senators Alexander, Brown of Massachusetts,  Murkowski, Johanns, Levin, and Bayh as cosponsors.\n\tAs a matter of tremendous respect and courtesy, I think it would be best for Senator McCain to be the first speaker on this amendment that he was very involved in developing.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\tMr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senators Lieberman, and Senator Corker, I have an amendment at the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving--I believe the Senator is referring to the amendment that is pending?\n\tMr. CORKER. That is correct.\n\tMr. KERRY. It is the pending amendment.\n\tMr. McCAIN. First of all, it is probably not too relevant, but I would like to say that this should have been the Lieberman-Corker-McCain or Corker-Lieberman-McCain amendment because of the distribution of effort that has been made on this amendment. Be that as it may, I think this amendment makes some improvement that will be very helpful.\n\tIt has two parts. The first requires the President to certify that we do not recognize Russia's argument that the treaty can only be effective and viable only in conditions where the United States is not building up its missile defenses. The statement would also be transmitted to the Russians when the instruments of ratification are exchanged. Second, the amendment would include in the instrument an understanding that the preamble is not legally binding. \n\tI think this is a helpful amendment, and I appreciate that it could be included by the Senator from Massachusetts, but ultimately it does not address my concerns that the Russians believe the treaty could be used to limit our missile defense. We should have removed this clause from the preamble.\n\tThe message sent by the first part of this amendment is positive, but it is not conveyed to the Duma. When we look at the fact--I understand why the proponents of this treaty would not want to transmit this aspect of the treaty to the Duma for fear of some backlash and perhaps problems in the Russian Duma, although it is not a body that is renowned for its independence, to say the least. The fact is, it will not be transmitted to the Duma. The fact is, if the Russians and the United States agreed to a treaty and a part of that treaty was not transmitted to the Senate, I think that would be something to which most of us would take strong exception.\n\tI thank Senator Corker. He has worked extremely hard on this issue. Joe Lieberman has worked extremely hard, trying to reach a point, obviously, that they could agree to support this treaty. Whether they eventually do or not is something that I neither know nor would predict, but I do think it shows some improvement. I still have various concerns, as I have had from the beginning, on the issue of defensive missile systems, how it would play, whether it is actually part of the treaty and, if so, how enforceable.\n\tWhat complicates this more than anything else is the continued statements, public statements on American television a short time ago--Vladimir Putin saying that if we move forward with improving our missile defenses, they would take ``appropriate actions.'' Their Foreign Minister has made repeated statements--not last year but last month--saying one thing and publicly declaring it while on the other hand we are assuming this will prevent them from doing what they say they will do. That is a contradiction.\n\tI understand how solemn treaties are, and I understand how binding treaties are. I also understand that when the leader of a nation says on ``Larry King Live''--God bless you, Larry, for everything you did for us--that they will have to take ``appropriate actions'' if we improve quantitatively or qualitatively our strategic missile defense systems, then obviously you have to give some credence to that, when public statements are made. Obviously, in the view of Senator Kerry, who has done a masterful job in shepherding this treaty through the Senate in the last several days, that is not that meaningful. So we just have a fundamental disagreement of opinion. But I can say this: If we negotiated a treaty and made certain agreements and the President of the United States made public statements on national or international television contradicting that, then I think it would give the party we are in negotiations with significant pause.\n\tNot one statement that I have been able to find has a Russian leader--either Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, or Prime Minister or President--saying they will adhere to the provisions that are in this amendment. That is a fundamental contradiction that I am sorry cannot be resolved.\n\tI know what the votes are going to be on this treaty. Again, I congratulate Senator Kerry for the incredible job he has done and, frankly, his great willingness to talk with me and negotiate with me and have dialog and work toward a common goal. He has done that in good faith, and I am grateful for the opportunity he has given me to play a role, including agreeing to this amendment which I think will improve the treaty.\n\tI wish to say that I know how difficult this has been for Senator Corker and other Members on this side.\n\tI thank Senator Lieberman for the continued hard work he does on this issue.\n\tI urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it is very helpful.\n\tWith that, I yield to my colleagues, cosponsors of the amendment, if that is agreeable to Senator Kerry.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\tMr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, Senator Corker and I had a vote--actually, Senator Corker, Senator McCain, and I had a vote on whose name should be first on this, and Senator Corker and I won, 2 to 1. Senator McCain's name is first because this is an amendment that attempts to deal in a unifying way with our concern that the Russians misunderstand the impact of this treaty or the impact of our development of missile defenses on this treaty and that it is important for us to speak out in unity, in a unified and clear voice, to the Russians, and no one has made that point more clearly as the treaty has been considered than Senator McCain. In fact, he offered an amendment earlier in our deliberations on the treaty which I supported, which did not pass, which would have removed the section of the preamble that has obviously been put in by the Russians in the negotiations which is confusing at best and downright mischievous at worst.\n\tThis is the section that says:\n\n       Recognizing the existence of the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that \n     this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic nuclear arms are reduced, and that current \n     strategic defensive arms do not undermine the viability and \n     effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties.\n\n\tThat is the end of the quote from the preamble. It strikes me as I read it that it will be a topic of consideration in law schools and classes on international law. The first question is, What did it mean? But I think the Russians had a particular intent in putting it in there, and they know what they wanted it to mean.\n\tWhat is troubling is that when the treaty was signed earlier in the year in Prague, the Russian Federation issued a statement that basically made these same points--that the treaty will be effective and viable only in conditions where there is no qualitative or quantitative buildup in the missile defense system capabilities of the United States of America.\n\tBut these are two separate categories. This treaty, the START treaty, is all about reducing the offensive capabilities, nuclear and delivery capabilities of both great powers. We are building a missile defense system. It started out as a very controversial matter. It started out a long time ago--President Reagan, really, initially, and then serious consideration in the 1990s when a lot of people argued against it and said it was a waste of money and it would never work technologically, that you couldn't create a bullet that would hit a bullet. Yet that is exactly what we have done. Thank God that we invested the money and that our scientists and military leaders have brought it as far it is because one of the great threats that will face the people of the United States, our national security, will come from missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction fired particularly by rogue nations such as Iran and North Korea. It would be irresponsible of us not to have developed a capacity to defend against those kinds of missile attacks. We have done that.\n\tThe Russians keep wanting to link that to this treaty. It is not linked to the treaty. Therefore, I regretted that section was in the preamble I read. The United States responded through the State Department to that statement by the Russian Government when they signed the treaty. But it is really important for us, at the same time the instruments of ratification are conveyed to the Russian Government, to make a clear and direct statement of our understanding of the total nonrelationship between the development of our missile defense capability and the START treaty.\n\n\tThat is what this amendment does. I am privileged to cosponsor it with Senator McCain, Senator Corker, and a number of other Members of both parties. Basically, it says that before the New START treaty could enter into force, the President shall certify to the Senate--basically, this is certifying what the President said in a letter sent to Senator Reid a few days ago--and at the time of the exchange of instruments of ratification shall communicate directly to the Russian Federation that, No. 1, we are going to continue development and deployment of a missile defense system to defend against missile threats from nations such as--and I would add ``not limited to''--North Korea and Iran.\n\tNo. 2, what do we mean by qualitative and quantitative improvement of such systems that we are going to be continuing? This is very important. We define that here to include all phases of the phased adaptive approach to missile defenses in Europe embraced now by our NATO allies; second, the modernization of the ground-based midcourse defense system; and third, the continued development of the two-stage ground-based interceptor as a technological and strategic hedge.\n\tWe are being as direct as we can be here to the Russians. Some of my colleagues have said--and the record, unfortunately, shows it--that their record for complying with treaties is not a good one. We don't want to enter into this one with any misunderstandings or covering up the truth. We are saying here loudly and clearly that the United States is going to continue to develop all of these different forms of missile defense to protect our security and that has nothing to do with this START treaty.\n\tI think the third section here is very important. We say:\n\n       The U.S. believes that these systems [missile defense \n     systems] do not and will not threaten the strategic balance \n     with the Russian Federation. Consequently, while the U.S. \n     cannot circumscribe the sovereign rights of the Russian \n     Federation under paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the [START] \n     Treaty--\n\n\tWhich is the section that gives nations the right to withdraw under extraordinary circumstances--nonetheless, if we adopt this, when we adopt it, this amendment, we are saying here:\n\n       The United States believes continued improvement and \n     deployment of United States missile defense systems do not \n     constitute a basis for questioning the effectiveness and \n     viability of the Treaty, and therefore would not give rise to \n     circumstances justifying the withdrawal of the Russian \n     Federation from the treaty.\n\n\tWe are trying to manage our relationship with the Russian Federation in a way that is conducive to the security of our country and the security of the world.\n\tWe disagree with the Russians on an awful lot of things, including human rights and values and freedom of the press--which the current government in Russia has so aggressively suppressed. So we want to be honest with them and direct with them and not enter into this important treaty with any illusions. I believe we have said that clearly. If it passes, it will be presented to the Russian Government directly.\n\tI am very pleased we have a broad, bipartisan group supporting this. It is a unified way to conclude our deliberations here before we go to vote on ratification, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\tI thank the Chair and yield the floor to the Senator from Tennessee.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\tMr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Begich as a cosponsor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. CORKER. Mr. President, I am thrilled to join with Senator McCain and Senator Lieberman in an amendment dealing with missile defense. This is a subject that has been discussed ever since this treaty was first presented.\n\tI cannot think of a better way to end this debate. I thank Senator Kerry for having the patience of Job, having worked through this. Somebody mentioned deals and where they have been taking place. They have been taking place on the Senate floor. We have been working on this for a long time. We have gone through intelligence briefings. We have gone through incredible numbers of hearings. I think this has been done exactly in the right way.\n\tI thank the Senator for his leadership. I thank Senator Lugar for his leadership on nuclear armaments in general. The Senator has been pursuing that for years.\n\tSo we have before us an amendment on missile defense. Again, it has been discussed in great detail. This says three things. Senator Lieberman certainly talked about much of the detail, but the President the other day sent us a letter declaring, in very strident ways, his commitment to both the phased-adaptive approach to missile defense, which will take place in Europe, and our ground-based interceptors. He has said that absolutely in strident terms.\n\tWhat this amendment does is certifies to Congress--he certifies to Congress--that he is going to continue those efforts. He will continue those efforts on phased-adaptive approach and ground-based interceptors.\n\tSecond, we have been concerned about what Russia thinks as it relates to this treaty. When we exchange the instruments of ratification, when we exchange the documents when ratifying this treaty, they are going to be told that we, in fact, are continuing to pursue our missile defenses in every way possible, and that in no way affects our relationship from that standpoint as it relates to this treaty. I think that is incredibly strong.\n\tThen, third, we have talked about this preamble, and every one of us knows the preamble is nonbinding. But as an understanding of this treaty going forward, we are telling the Russians that the preamble absolutely is not binding and that we are pursuing these missile defense applications that have been discussed. I am proud to join with Senator McCain, with Senator Lieberman, two people who care as deeply about our national security as anybody in the United States, certainly in this Senate. I am proud to have the other Members of the Senate who have joined in.\n\tLet me just say in closing, I think it is absolutely appropriate that the last two amendments we address are the Kyl amendment which deals with modernization--the President has made incredible investments in modernization that have come about through this entire process, a commitment to ensure that the nuclear arsenal we have is one that operates, that is reliable, that is safe.\n\tI think people know we have 1,550 deployed warheads--after this treaty goes into effect, over a long period of time, we reduce to that number, but that we have roughly 3,500 other warheads that, again, will continue to be modernized and made available, if necessary.\n\tSo I want to say that in accepting the Kyl amendment and all of the things that have come with it--the letter from the appropriators and accepting this missile defense amendment--if that ends up being the case, and I hope it will be by unanimous consent shortly, I think what we have done throughout this entire process has strengthened our country's national security.\n\tI can say: Look, this is called the New START, but I could call this the Missile Defense and Nuclear Modernization Act of 2010 because all of these things have come into play to make our country safer. I want to thank the chairman. I want to thank the administration for walking through, over the last 6 months, and helping us cross t's and dot i's. I think this treaty is good for our country. I think this treaty enhances our national security. I thank the chairman for the way he has worked with us to get it into that position, certainly Senators McCain and Lieberman for helping take the lead on this amendment.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4922 to Amendment No. 4904\n\n\tMr. KIRK. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the desk, No. 4922.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Kirk] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4922 to Amendment No. 4904.\n\n\tMr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe amendment is as follows:\n(Purpose: To provide an additional understanding regarding the December \n 18, 2010, letter from President Obama to the Senate regarding missile \n                                defense)\n\n       On page 2, after line 19, add the following:\n       (2) Missile defense.--It is the understanding of the United \n     States that the advice and consent of the Senate to the New \n     START Treaty is subject to the understanding, which shall be \n     transmitted to the Russian Federation at the time of the \n     exchange of instruments of ratification, stated in the letter \n     transmitted by President Barack Obama to the Majority Leader \n     of the United States Senate on December 18, 2010, the text of \n     which is as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, December 18, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid: As the Senate considers the New START \n     Treaty, I want to \n     share with you my views on the issue of missile defense, \n     which has been the subject of much debate in the Senate's \n     review of the Treaty.\n       Pursuant to the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 \n     (Public Law 106-38), it has long been the policy of the \n     United States to deploy as soon as is technologically \n     possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable \n     of defending the territory of the United States against \n     limited ballistic missile attack, whether accidental, \n     unauthorized, or deliberate. Thirty ground-based interceptors \n     based at Fort Greely, Alaska, and Vandenberg Air Force Base, \n     California, are now defending the nation. All United States \n     missile defense programs--including all phases of the \n     European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense (EPAA) \n     and programs to defend United States deployed forces, allies, \n     and partners against regional threats--are consistent with \n     this policy.\n       The New START Treaty places no limitations on the \n     development or deployment of our missile defense programs. As \n     the NATO Summit meeting in Lisbon last month underscored, we \n     are proceeding apace with a missile defense system in Europe \n     designed to provide full coverage for NATO members on the \n     continent, as well as deployed U.S. forces, against the \n     growing threat posed by the proliferation of ballistic \n     missiles. The final phase of the system will also augment our \n     current defenses against intercontinental ballistic missiles \n     from Iran targeted against the United States.\n       All NATO allies agreed in Lisbon that the growing threat of \n     missile proliferation, and our Article 5 commitment of \n     collective defense, requires that the Alliance develop a \n     territorial missile defense capability. The Alliance further \n     agreed that the EPAA, which I announced in September 2009, \n     will be a crucial contribution to this capability. Starting \n     in 2011, we will begin deploying the first phase of the EPAA, \n     to protect large parts of southern Europe from short- and \n     medium-range ballistic missile threats. In subsequent phases, \n     we will deploy longer-range and more effective land-based \n     Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors in Romania and Poland \n     to protect Europe against medium- and intermediate-range \n     ballistic missiles. In the final phase, planned for the end \n     of the decade, further upgrades of the SM-3 interceptor will \n     provide an ascent-phase intercept capability to augment our \n     defense of NATO European territory, as well as that of the \n     United States, against future threats of ICBMs launched from \n     Iran.\n       The Lisbon decisions represent an historic achievement, \n     making clear that all NATO allies believe we need an \n     effective territorial missile defense to defend against the \n     threats we face now and in the future. The EPAA represents \n     the right response. At Lisbon, the Alliance also invited the \n     Russian Federation to cooperate on missile defense, which \n     could lead to adding Russian capabilities to those deployed \n     by NATO to enhance our common security against common \n     threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the \n     Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving \n     NATO-Russian relations.\n       This comes even as we have made clear that the system we \n     intend to pursue with Russia will not be a joint system, and \n     it will not in any way limit United States' or NATO's missile \n     defense capabilities. Effective cooperation with Russia could \n     enhance the overall effectiveness and efficiency of our \n     combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time \n     provide Russia with greater security. Irrespective of how \n     cooperation with Russia develops, the Alliance alone bears \n     responsibility for defending NATO's members, consistent with \n     our Treaty obligations for collective defense. The EPAA and \n     NATO's territorial missile defense capability will allow us \n     to do that.\n       In signing the New START Treaty, the Russian Federation \n     issued a statement that expressed its view that the \n     extraordinary events referred to in Article XIV of the Treaty \n     include a ``build-up in the missile defense capabilities of \n     the United States of America such that it would give rise to \n     a threat to the strategic nuclear potential of the Russian \n     Federation.'' Article XIV(3), as you know, gives each Party \n     the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it believes its \n     supreme interests are jeopardized.\n       The United States did not and does not agree with the \n     Russian statement. We believe that the continued development \n     and deployment of U.S. missile defense systems, including \n     qualitative and quantitative improvements to such systems, do \n     not and will not threaten the strategic balance with the \n     Russian Federation, and have provided policy and technical \n     explanations to Russia on why we believe that to be the case. \n     Although the United States cannot circumscribe Russia's \n     sovereign rights under Article XIV(3), we believe that the \n     continued improvement and deployment of U.S. missile defense \n     systems do not constitute a basis for questioning the \n     effectiveness and viability of the New START Treaty, and \n     therefore would not give rise to circumstances justifying \n     Russia's withdrawal from the Treaty.\n       Regardless of Russia's actions in this regard, as long as I \n     am President, and as long as the Congress provides the \n     necessary funding, the United States will continue to develop \n     and deploy effective missile defenses to protect the United \n     States, our deployed forces, and our allies and partners. My \n     Administration plans to deploy all four phases of the EPAA. \n     While advances of technology or future changes in the threat \n     could modify the details or timing of the later phases of the \n     EPAA--one reason this approach is called ``adaptive''--I will \n     take every action available to me to support the deployment \n     of all four phases.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Barack Obama.\n\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, on the basis of rule XXII and the question of timely filing, I would object to this amendment being considered.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is well taken. The amendment falls.\n\tMr. KIRK. Mr. President, am I allowed to be heard on the point of order?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no debate on a point of order.\n\tMr. KIRK. Roger that.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I do not want the Senator to not have an opportunity to be able to speak to this. I think he should be able to. He certainly has that right in the context of his time. I will not speak very long at all.\n\tI want to thank the Senator from Arizona, my long-time friend, for his very generous comments. I appreciate them personally. But also I thank him for his willingness, under some circumstances that I know were tough for him, in terms of how a lot of this played out. He nevertheless sat with me, worked through these issues, and obviously I wish we had been able to reach an agreement sometime earlier, but I am glad he is there now on this amendment. I am glad we are able to accept it.\n\tI thank Senator Corker who has been a straight dealer throughout all of this--no histrionics, no politics. I think he has really seen his responsibilities on the Foreign Relations Committee in the best way and has studied and thought and worked at and tried to find a way to solve a problem, not create a problem. So I thank him for that approach to this treaty.\n\tI think this amendment, if I can say--I mean, I was here in the Senate. I remember debating the first proposal of President Reagan with respect to missile defense, which then was called the SDI, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and became what we called Star Wars back then. We have traveled a long distance since then. The world also has changed significantly since then.\n\tWe no longer live in that sort of bipolar East-West, Soviet-U.S.-dominated world. We are living in a multipolar, extraordinarily complicated and significantly changed world in the context of the threats we face. The threats we now face, particularly of a rogue state, or of the possibility of a terrorist group stealing or putting their hands on some loosely guarded materials and/or weapons, those are possibilities that are real. We need to deal with this different kind of threat.\n\tI believe the President of the United States has been pursuing a plan, building on what previous administrations have done; that is, pursuing the right kind of approach to try to figure out: How do we make all of us safer? Our hope is that the Russians will understand this is not directed at them. This is directed at how we together can build a structure in which all of us can share in a way that forces the Irans and North Koreas and others to understand the futility, indeed the counterproductivity of the direction in which they are moving.\n\tSo I think this is a good amendment to embrace within the instrument of ratification what the President is doing anyway, what the administration has been committed to doing anyway. I personally do not think it was necessary--in order to achieve an appropriate understanding of where the administration is going--but to whatever degree it gives Senators the ability in the advice and consent process to believe that we are appropriately putting Russians on notice as to this course we are on, I think it reinforces what the President has already done and said. I do not think they should view it as something new or as an aberration from any course that we have been on. I certainly do not view it that way.\n\tI am confident they will see that we can build on this treaty in a way that we share in the future strategies, analyses, perhaps even technologies in the long run that will make all of us safer and ultimately provide all of us with the ability to deal with the realities of a nuclear world. Our goal is to make us safer, and we believe this helps us do that.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\tMr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I join with the sentiments just expressed by the chairman. I very much appreciate the statements made by Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman, and my colleague on the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Corker, who has worked diligently throughout the hearings, the markup, and this debate.\n\tI ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to the amendment that they have offered, 4904, as modified.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe Senator from Alabama.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Just briefly on the remarks about the missile defense, I have served as chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee and ranking member and have been involved in it for quite a few years. I think the language affirms the continued development of the two-stage, ground-based interceptor. Then, I guess, I accept the language that says ``as a technological and strategic hedge.''\n\tBut I would just say to my colleagues, the reason we are at this point is because, during the negotiations with the Russians concerning the New START treaty, the administration, responding to Russian objections about missile defense--which were so unfounded and I could never fathom--the administration agreed, in September of last year, unilaterally, and to the utter surprise of Poland and the Czech Republic, to cancel the planned two-stage GBI that was to be deployed in 2016 in Poland.\n\tIt was a great embarrassment to our allies. They had been negotiating with us for many years on this project. They had stood firm for it, and the administration then promised this phase four SM-3 Block 2B. But it was not on the drawing board, not under development, and cannot be completed until 2020 if we as a Congress fund it over that decade. The President certainly will not be in office at that time. So I am uneasy about this whole matter of missile defense.\n\tI think the administration made a colossal error in giving up on the planned two-stage strategic policy. But this language is better than no language. I thank my colleagues for moving forward with it.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from North Dakota wants to speak on this a little bit. I thought we might, if he was willing--we could accept the amendment and then the Senator would have an opportunity to speak.\n\tMr. President, we are prepared to accept this amendment.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\tThe amendment (No. 4904), as further modified, was agreed to.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have an understanding--while it is not a unanimous consent request yet, we have an understanding with Senator Kyl that is the last amendment. We are waiting for the agreed-upon language from both leaderships in order to arrive at a time for the vote. It is our understanding that other issues that were part of the equation of when that vote might take place have been resolved. So, as a result, I think Senators can anticipate that, hopefully, sometime soon that unanimous consent request will be propounded.\n\tUntil then, Senators are free to talk on the treaty and I look forward to their comments.\n\tCan I say one word, Mr. President? I apologize.\n\tEarlier when I was thanking folks, I meant to, and I neglected to because I jumped over to thank Under Secretary of State Ellen Tauscher.\n\tAs we all know, she was a Member of the House, spent a lot of time on separate issues. In fact, she chaired one of the subcommittees of the Armed Services Committee. She logged a lot of miles and worked her heart out to assist in the evolution of this treaty. She has, as we all know, been fighting cancer. She just recently had cancer surgery. We wish her well in her recovery and express our gratitude to her for her work.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\tMr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts and Senators McCain and Lieberman.\n\tThere are probably still some folks making up their minds on this treaty. I think most people have debated this at length and discussed it at length off the floor.\n\tOur side has raised a number of questions. We have tried to cross every t and dot every i. This has been done in a very methodical way. I thank the chairman for the way he has worked with us. I thank Senator Lugar for his longstanding leadership in this regard. I thank the administration officials who have absolutely bent over backward to try to solve every problem that has come up. The administration has not only solved problems for people who might vote for the treaty, they have tried to solve problems for people who they know will not vote for the treaty. We have some Members on our side who I know are still making up their minds. I have been involved in this for a long time. I enjoyed this. I think this is an incredibly serious matter.\n\tI have two daughters and a wife I love. National security is something that is important to all of us. None of us wants anything bad to happen to this country. But to my friends on this side of the aisle who still may have some questions, there is no way in the world we would have the commitments we have on nuclear modernization if it were not for the process of this treaty. Now with Senator Kyl's amendment being accepted, we are even fast-tracking that. There is no way in the world the unilateral statements that are going to be presented to Russia are going to be made regarding missile defense would be occurring without this treaty being in place. I don't think there is a person in the world who has debated seriously whether 1,550 warheads being deployed in any way affects this country's national security.\n\tTo those of you who may still be wavering, I believe every issue that has been raised has been answered strongly and legitimately. We have put forth what our posture is on nuclear armaments more clearly than we have done in recent times. I hope people will come to the same conclusion, that this is good for the country.\n\tI thank all those who have allowed me to be involved the way that I have. I urge support, whenever the vote occurs, for a treaty that I believe absolutely makes our country safer. With all these accommodations, at some point, it seems that the right thing to do is to say yes to yes.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\tMr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a great deal of discussion about modernization this morning. I have listened to much of it and was not going to come to the floor, but I do want the record to show clearly what the numbers are on modernization. It is important to the future for us to understand what has been done and what is being done and what will be done.\n\tI chair the Appropriations Subcommittee that funds nuclear weapons activities. I have spoken about this previously. It is very important going forward that we all understand what not only this administration but the previous administration has proposed with respect to modernization. I agree with my colleague from Kentucky. It is encouraging, at the end of this debate, that two bipartisan amendments represent the conclusion of this very important debate. We often debate things that are of lesser importance or of greater importance and sometimes don't always see the difference between the two. But this is one of those cases where if we ratify the START agreement today, when all is said and done, more will have been done than said. That is very unusual in a political body.\n\tWhen I say ``more will have been done than said,'' it is so unbelievably important to try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. But there is a subtext to all the other things we have discussed, which is why I want to put in the record the funding for the nuclear weapons issues. That subtext is money, money related to national security. We are a country with a $13 trillion debt. Modernization is expensive. Yet it relates to our national security. National missile defense, which we have heard a lot about, is very expensive. I understand that also relates to national security. But this issue of getting our debt under control and our fiscal policy under control is just as much a part of the national security interests of this country.\n\tThe subtext to these discussions--modernization, missile defense--is about funding as well and getting this country's economic house in order.\n\tLet me mention the issue of nuclear weapons modernization. In fiscal year 2010, we were spending $6.3 billion on the modernization program on nuclear weapons activities. In fiscal year 2011, it went to $7 billion, up 10 percent--so a 10-percent increase for the nuclear weapons activities in President Obama's budget request. That 10-percent increase was unusual because most accounts were flat or some had cuts. But nuclear weapons got a 10-percent increase. The proposal for 2011, a $600 million increase but $7 billion total, was actually short-circuited and put in the continuing resolution. All the other funding in the CR is flat funding from the previous year. But the funding for the nuclear weapons programs at 10 percent higher was put into the CR. Those programs and those programs alone get the higher funding. That $7 billion was not all that was to be spent. Another $4 billion emerged. I heard about that on the radio while driving in North Dakota, that another $4 billion had been put into this pot for modernization. The additional funding from the 1251 report, which was produced in the fall, means 2012 funding would go from $6.3 billion in 2010, $7 billion in 2011, to $7.6 billion in 2012. That is a $1.2 billion increase in 2 years.\n\tLinton Brooks, the fellow who ran the National Nuclear Security Administration and who did a good job in that role, said:\n\n       I would've killed for this kind of budget.\n\n\tHe is referring to $1.12 billion increase and two 10 percent increases, while much of the other budget was flat. We are talking about $85 billion for the next decade on these weapons activities, an increase of $8.5 billion in the next 5 years over what was portrayed in the 2010 budget. We are talking about a lot of additional money that has been committed. It shows a commitment to build two nuclear facilities that were discussed earlier. I want to mention them because it is important to understand what we are doing, the uranium processing facility at the Y-12 production complex and the chemistry and metallurgy research replacement facility at Los Alamos. There were moneys in the 2012 budget in construction funds for these two facilities, not as much as some would want in the Senate. But the fact is, the design of these two facilities is only 45 percent complete. We don't fund things that are 45 percent designed. To come out here and say we ought to be providing robust funding for buildings that are not even designed just makes no sense. Why, NNSA can't have confidence in its funding needs until it reaches about a 90-percent design point and that will be in 2013.\n\tI listened this morning to this discussion and I think what the chairman has done and what Senator Kyl has done in reaching an agreement is fine. But I want the record to show that this administration has proposed robust increases in 2010, 2011, 2012, and for a 5-year period in these modernization accounts, life extension programs--robust increases. Even that is not enough for some. They want to put money into buildings that are not yet designed. That doesn't make much sense to me.\n\tMy point is, when we add up all of this, the subtext is how are we going to pay for it. Because it is easy to talk about authorizing, to talk about appropriating. The question is, Where does the money come from at a time when we are borrowing 40 cents of everything we spend in this government? The subtext of money and debt is also a significant part of this country's national security. If we don't get our fiscal house in order, all these debates will pale by comparison. We can't lose our economy and have a future collapse of the economy because the rest of the world has very little confidence in our ability to make smart decisions. We can't risk all that and believe we are going to be a world economic power moving forward. If we are going to remain a world economic power--and we can, and I believe we will--it will be because we start making some smart, tough, courageous decisions. That is more than just calling for more money, more spending, which was most of this morning's discussion.\n\tI don't object to the amendment. My colleagues have raised important issues. But it is important to understand we have made great progress on the modernization funding programs in the past months, and this administration has moved very aggressively to meet those needs and meet those concerns. That is important with respect to the public record.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have given a lot of thought to the treaty, and having been involved in missile defense and nuclear issues serving on the Strategic Forces Subcommittee of Armed Services, as ranking member and chairman, many of the provisions in the treaty are acceptable and should pose no threat to our national security. But considered as part of the administration's stated foreign policy and strategic policy and in relation to the reality of the world situation today, I do not believe the treaty will make us safer. I think that is a good test.\n\tI disagree with my colleagues who are overly confident that this is going to make the world safer. I believe the treaty, for that reason, should be rejected.\n\tSome say a defeat for the treaty would harm the United States. I think the entire world would see the Senate action as a resurgence of America's historical policy of peace through strength and a rejection of a leftist vision of a world without nuclear weapons. The negotiating posture statements and actions of Russia indicate it is regressing sadly into an old Soviet mindset as it views the outside world. This is disappointing and indicative of anything but the positive reset we hope to achieve with them. It is extremely important for Russian and U.S. security and world security, that Russia sees its role as a positive force for peace and security. These negotiations, however, show the face of the old Soviet Union. They have been so relentless in the way they have negotiated.\n\tNegotiations with any mature power, especially Russia, are difficult and serious. This administration began with a naive expectation that a treaty could be quickly achieved that would show their leadership towards peace and a nuclear-free world. The Obama administration wanted to set an example for other nations to reduce their nuclear weapons towards a world without any nuclear weapons. We have heard this leadership and this setting of an example theme repeatedly from the President and the administration. But Russia has not the slightest interest in such vague concepts, nor in eliminating all nuclear weapons. They have no idea or intention ever of relinquishing nuclear weapons. They are focused on their own national interest, on coming out ahead in the negotiations for military, political, psychological, and hegemonic reasons.\n\tIt seems clear to me that Russia got what it wanted and President Obama got a treaty paper which strategically means very little but can be touted as a victory for peace.\n\tSo this is what I have concluded during this debate--and the debate has been helpful--the debate has caused me to think through a good bit of this. A longer debate at a different time of the year, I think, could have helped all of our colleagues. I do not believe the success in negotiation of the treaty will in any way make the Russians more cooperative, as the administration has repeatedly suggested.\n\tRussia has been inconsistent at best in helping the United States with the danger of nuclear Iran and North Korea--the gravest threats to peace in the world, with military action being undertaken against our ally, South Korea, in recent weeks, and with the real possibility of an attack on Iran's nuclear weapons that, hopefully, can be avoided.\n\tWhy has Russia not been more cooperative? They blocked a resolution condemning North Korea Sunday in the U.N. Russia attacked Georgia, a sovereign nation, and continues to occupy Georgian territory. This shocking act of aggression condemned by independent bodies goes without any real U.S. response. Georgia is a pro-American, free market, independent nation whose attack was calculated and deliberate.\n\tRussia continues to work to undermine the pro-Western democracy movement in the Ukraine. They continue a host of actions that evidence a long-term plan to effect a real or de facto reabsorption of these three nations into what was the old Soviet Union.\n\tSo these ominous trends, it seems to me, have not been seriously considered throughout this quest for the treaty. The events do not give me confidence that the treaty, therefore, is a positive step for the United States, the world, or for peace.\n\tSecondly, as I noted, and I will not go into detail now, the administration conceded the two-staged, ground-based interceptor site that would have been established in Poland, that would provide redundant protection to the United States from an Iranian missile and protected virtually all of Europe from an Iranian missile. That was given away unilaterally by the administration without prior warning to our allies in Poland and the Czech Republic. They heard about it in the paper. They realized the United States had gone behind them, our allies, and made a deal with the Russians. It was a very unfortunate event, indeed.\n\tThe plan that has been talked about--the fourth phase of the SM-3 Phased Adaptive Approach--is not even on the drawing board and is unlikely to actually survive. It would be difficult to see it surviving in five different budget cycles over the next 10 years it would take to develop that system. We walked away from one that could be deployed soon.\n\tI offered a sense-of-the-Senate resolution to make clear the Senate does not concur in an ill-conceived vision of the administration that would move us to a world without nuclear weapons. I thank Senators Kyl, LeMieux, Cornyn, Chambliss, and Inhofe for cosponsoring the amendment. While I will not insist on a vote at this hour, this matter will be a significant subject for the future.\n\tThirdly, I would suggest the treaty is promoted as a step towards a world free of nuclear weapons. This is a fantastical idea that goes beyond insignificance, it is dangerous. Basing any policy, especially a nuclear policy, on an idea as cockamamie as zero nuclear weapons in the world can only lead to confusion and uncertainty. Confusion and uncertainty are the polar opposites of the necessary attributes of security and stability. These are the essentials of good strategic policy: security and stability.\n\tThus, the Obama policy creates a more dangerous world. Some say the President's zero nukes policy is just a distant vision, some vague wish, so don't worry. The situation would be much better if that were so, but it is not. President Obama has made zero nuclear weapons a cornerstone of our defense policy. It has, amazingly, already been made a centerpiece of our military policy, being advanced by concrete steps today. Presidents, Commanders-in-Chief, have the power to make such monumental changes in policy, and this President is certainly doing so.\n\tThe change is seen most seriously in the critically important Nuclear Posture Review produced in April 2010 by the Defense Department. This document is a formal document produced by the new administration's Defense Department. The determination to pursue the zero nuclear weapons vision is seen throughout this review. Amazingly, there are 30 references in that document to a world without nuclear weapons.\n\tThe NPR begins with an introductory letter from Secretary of Defense Gates, the second sentence of which says this:\n\n       As the President said in Prague last year, a world without \n     nuclear weapons will not be achieved quickly, but we must \n     begin to take concrete steps today.\n\n\tThe Executive Summary further drives the issue home. The first sentence in the Executive Summary recalls that President Obama, in Prague, highlighted nuclear dangers and said:\n\n       The United States will seek the peace and security of a \n     world without nuclear weapons.\n\n\tThe first sentence in the second paragraph of the NPR is particularly ominous and even chilling to me. Posture Reviews are defense reviews, and by their nature are bottom-up reports, driven by threat assessments and the requirements necessary to defend America. These reviews historically are objective analyses from experts, not political reports. The troubling line reads:\n\n       The 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) outlines the \n     Administration's approach to promoting the President's agenda \n     for reducing nuclear dangers and pursuing the goal of a world \n     without nuclear weapons.\n\n\tThis statement reveals the whole truth. The NPR is the President's policy, sent from the top down, not the bottom up. Stunningly, the report lacks a clear focus on the only objective that counts: Securing a nuclear arsenal second to none that can, under any circumstances, deter attacks on and defend the United States and its allies.\n\tFourthly, the Obama vision of a world without nuclear weapons has not been well received. Indeed, the breadth of the criticism from experts and world leaders is noteworthy.\n\tTwo years ago, Congress adopted an amendment I proposed that called for a commission to review the strategic posture of the United States. It was bipartisan and chaired by former Secretaries of Defense Dr. William Perry and Dr. James Schlesinger. The commission powerfully dismissed the idea of a world without nuclear weapons. In somewhat diplomatic but clear and strong language, they said this:\n\n       The conditions that might make possible the global \n     elimination of nuclear weapons are not present today and \n     their creation would require a fundamental transformation of \n     the world political order.\n\n\tThey went on to say this:\n\n       All of the commission members believe that reaching the \n     ultimate goal of global nuclear elimination would require a \n     fundamental change in geopolitics.\n\n\tMaybe the Second Coming.\n\tOthers have dismissed this concept as a wild chimera. French President Sarkozy, from one of our European allies, France, said this:\n\n       It [our nuclear deterrent] is neither a matter of prestige \n     nor a question of rank, it is quite simply the Nation's life \n     insurance policy.\n\n\tHe made clear they had no intention of giving that up.\n\tSecretary James Schlesinger, back when President Reagan was meeting in Reykjavik over nuclear issues, made this wise comment:\n\n       Nuclear arsenals are going to be with us as long as there \n     are sovereign states with conflicting ideologies. Unlike \n     Aladdin with his lamp, we have no way to force the nuclear \n     genie back into the bottle. A world without nuclear weapons \n     is a utopian dream.\n\n\tKeith Payne, who served on this nuclear commission, writing recently in the National Review, said:\n\n       The presumption that United States movement toward nuclear \n     disarmament will deliver nonproliferation success is a \n     fantasy. On the contrary, the United States nuclear arsenal \n     has itself been the single most important tool for \n     nonproliferation in history, and dismantling it would be a \n     huge setback.\n\n\tRemember the commission.\n\tJonathan Tepperman, in Newsweek, said:\n\n       And even if Russia and China (and France, Britain, Israel, \n     India, and Pakistan) could be coaxed to abandon their \n     weapons, we'd still live with the fear that any of them could \n     quickly and secretly rearm.\n\n\tGideon Rachman, in Financial Times, said:\n\n       The idea of a world free of nuclear weapons is not so much \n     an impossible dream as an impossible nightmare.\n\n\tWilliam Kristol, writing in the Washington Post, in October, said:\n\n       Yet to justify a world without nuclear weapons, what Obama \n     would really have to envision is a world without war, or \n     without threats of war. . . .The danger is that the allure of \n     a world without nuclear weapons can be a distraction--even an \n     excuse for not acting against real nuclear threats. . . .So \n     while Obama talks of a future without nuclear weapons, the \n     trajectory we are on today is toward a nuclear--and missile-\n     capable North Korea and Iran--and a far more dangerous world.\n\n\tOthers have also written about this.\n\tDavid Von Drehle, writing in Time Magazine, said:\n\n       A world with nuclear weapons in it is a scary, scary place \n     to think about. The industrialized world without nuclear \n     weapons was a scary, scary place for real. But there is no \n     way to un-ring the nuclear bell. The science and technology \n     of nuclear weapons is widespread, and if nukes are outlawed \n     someday, only outlaws will have nukes.\n\n\tKenneth Waltz, leading arms controller and professor emeritus of political science at UC Berkeley, said:\n \n\n       We now have 64 years of experience since Hiroshima. It's \n     striking and against all historical precedent that for that \n     substantial period, there has not been any war among nuclear \n     states.\n\n\tImportantly, the administration's planned further diminishment of our nuclear stockpile--further diminishing it from these numbers--and President Obama's hostility to the utility of nuclear weapons generally has caused a great deal of unease among our non-nuclear allies. These nations are not so open about their concerns, but the problem is a very real one.\n\tThe American nuclear umbrella, our extended deterrence, has allowed our allies, free democratic nations, to remain nuclear free, without having nuclear weapons. But if the Obama policy continues, the Perry-Schlesinger report concludes real dangers may await:\n\n       If we are unsuccessful in dealing with current challenges, \n     we may find ourselves at a tipping point, where many \n     additional states conclude that they require nuclear \n     deterrents of their own. If this tipping point is itself \n     mishandled, we may well find ourselves faced with a cascade \n     of proliferation.\n\n\tThe nuclear commission--President Obama appointed a number of the Members on the Democratic side--said that if our allies who feel they have been protected by our nuclear umbrella become uncertain, we could be faced with a cascade of proliferation. Is that what we want? I know the President wants nonproliferation. I know that is what he wants. I am not attacking his goal. Throughout my remarks, I am raising the question of whether these goals will be furthered by the actions of this treaty and these policies or whether they will not.\n\tOne final concern. The administration has made it clear that this treaty's nuclear reductions are just the first step in a long march to a nuclear-free world. Assistant Secretary Rose Gottemoeller, who negotiated the treaty, said in April:\n\n       We will also seek to include non-strategic, non-deployed \n     weapons in future reductions.\n\n\tAssistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and former Ambassador Alexander Vershbow a few weeks ago said that the administration, in follow-on talks, will seek further reductions in strategic, nondeployed, and nonstrategic weapons. And the President has said that repeatedly.\n\tWe Senators, in the end, only have our judgment. My best judgment tells me that if our weapons fall too low in numbers, such an event could inspire rogue and dangerous lesser nuclear powers to seek to become peer nuclear competitors to the United States--a dangerous event for the entire world. Thus, I must conclude that the Obama plan is to diminish the power and leadership of the United States. Carefully read, this is what the goal does. I think this conclusion cannot be disputed. The leader of the one nation that has been the greatest force for freedom and stability in the world, with our large nuclear arsenal, is displaying a naivete beyond imagining.\n\tSince this treaty is a calculated step in the President's plan to achieve dangerous and unacceptable policies, this treaty must not be ratified. The treaty and the policy behind it must be rejected.\n\tI thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. KERRY. We are shortly going to propound a unanimous consent request. I have been saying that a couple of times now, but we really are shortly going to do it. There are several Senators who wish to speak. I would like to see if we could set up an order for them.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Washington proceed for 10 minutes, then the Senator from Texas for up to 10 minutes, then the Senator from North Dakota for 5 minutes. I ask unanimous consent also that each of those Senators would allow the interruption for the propounding of the unanimous consent request if it comes during the time they are speaking.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                    Defense Level Playing Field Act\n\n\tMrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to call on the Senate to move and pass H.R. 6540, which is the Defense Level Playing Field Act, a bill which was passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives yesterday.\n\tThis is a bill that is identical to a bipartisan provision I have introduced here in the Senate with Senators Brownback, Cantwell, and others from States that know the value of American aerospace. It is a bill that will require the Pentagon to take into account illegal subsidies to foreign companies in our country, and that will finally deliver an even playing field in our procurement process.\n\tBut above all, this is a jobs bill. It is about protecting skilled, family-wage jobs, manufacturing jobs, and engineering jobs--jobs with technical skills and expertise that are passed down from one generation to the next; jobs that not only support our families during a very difficult economic time but are also helping to keep our communities above water. These are jobs in communities in Kansas, in Connecticut, in California, and in my home State of Washington. They are jobs that support small businesses, they pay people's mortgages, and they create economic opportunity. These jobs right now are at risk. Why? Because of illegal subsidies that undercut our workers and create an uneven playing field for America's aerospace workers.\n\tThis is a commonsense, straightforward way to protect American aerospace jobs from unfairly subsidized European competition. It is a bill that specifically targets a major job-creating project--the Air Force's aerial refueling tanker contract--as a place where we can begin to restore fairness for our aerospace workers. This bill says that in awarding that critical tanker contract, the Pentagon must consider any unfair competitive advantage aerospace companies have, and there is no bigger unfair advantage right now in the world of international aerospace than launch aid.\n\tAs my colleagues may know, launch aid is direct funding that has been provided to the European aerospace company Airbus from the treasuries of European governments. It is what supports their factories and their workers and their airplanes. It is what allows them to price their airplanes far below those that are made here in the United States and still turn a profit. It is what allows them to literally role the dice and lose on a product and what separates them from American aerospace companies, such as Boeing, that bet the company on each new airplane line they produce. In short, it is what allows them to stack the decks against American workers.\n\tIn July of this year, the World Trade Organization handed down a ruling in a case that the United States brought against the European Union that finally called launch aid what it really is: a trade-distorting, job-killing, unfair advantage. That is what the WTO said. It is one of our Nation's most important trade cases to date. The WTO ruled very clearly that launch aid is illegal, it creates an uneven playing field, it has harmed American workers and companies, and it needs to end.\n\tSpecifically, the WTO found that European governments have provided Airbus with more than 15 billion Euros in launch aid, subsidizing every model of aircraft ever produced by Airbus in the last 40 years, including, by the way, the A330--the very model they are now putting forward in the tanker competition. The WTO ruled that France and Germany and Spain provided more than 1 billion Euros in infrastructure and infrastructure-related grants between 1989 and 2001, as well as another billion in share transfers and equity infusions into Airbus. They ruled that European governments provided over 1 billion in Euros in funding between 1986 and 2005 for research and development directed specifically to the development of Airbus aircraft. In fact, the Lexington Institute states that launch aid represents over $200 billion in today's dollars in total subsidies to Airbus.\n\tLaunch aid has very real consequences. It has created an uphill battle for our American workers and American aerospace as a whole. Because of launch aid, our workers are now not only competing against rival companies, they are competing against the treasuries of European governments. At the end of the day, that has meant lost jobs at our American aerospace companies and suppliers and the communities that support them.\n\tI have been speaking out against Europe's market-distorting actions for many years because I understand that these subsidies are not only illegal, they are deeply unfair and anticompetitive.\n\tMy home State of Washington is, of course, home to much of our country's aerospace industry, and I know our workers are the best in the world. On a level playing field, they can compete and win against absolutely anybody. But, unfortunately, Airbus and the European Union have refused to allow fair competition. Instead, they use their aerospace industry as a government-funded jobs program, and they use billions in illegal launch aid to fund it.\n\tSo let me be clear about one thing. The objective of this bill that was passed overwhelmingly by the House of Representatives yesterday is not to limit competition; it is to make sure everyone can compete on a level playing field. Airbus has made it clear they will go to any lengths to hurt our country's aerospace industry. We need to make it clear we will take every action to stop them because this is not only about the future of aerospace; it is about jobs right now that will help our economy recover. In fact, as we look at ways to stimulate job growth and keep American companies innovating and growing, we shouldn't look any further than this bill.\n\tThis bill is a commonsense policy. It makes sure U.S. Government policy translates to Pentagon policy because the fact is that the U.S. Government, through our Trade Representative, has taken the position that Airbus subsidies are illegal and unfair. Yet, on the other hand, the U.S. Department of Defense is ignoring that position as we look to purchase a new tanker fleet, and that does not make any sense--not for our country, not for our military, and certainly not for our workers. The WTO made a fair decision. Airbus subsidies are illegal and anticompetitive. Now the Department of Defense needs to take that ruling into account.\n\tWhen I go home and talk to our aerospace workers in Washington State, I want to be able to tell them we have evened the stakes. I want them to know their government is not looking the other way as policies continue to undercut their jobs and their opportunities. I want them to know that while they are working to secure our country by producing the best airplane in the world, their government is doing everything it can to make sure fair opportunities are there that will keep them on the job.\n\tIt is time to take these job-killing subsidies into account. It is the right thing to do for our workers, for our economy, and the future of our airspace industry.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 6540\n\n\tSo I ask, as if in legislative session and as if in morning business, unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6540, which was received from the House and is at the desk; that the bill be read three times and passed; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; and any statements relating to the matter be printed in the Record.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\tMr. SESSIONS. I object.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\tThe Senator from Alabama.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the loyalty of my colleague from Washington for the Boeing facility that is there. I just want to say that other workers are involved, including 48,000 new jobs that would be created if the plant in Alabama were to be the one selected in this competition.\n\tAs a member of the Armed Services Committee, I would note that we voted a number of years ago unanimously to have a competition. There are only two companies in the world that can make this kind of aircraft. It is a commercial aircraft, not a highly sophisticated defense system such as a fighter. The EADS team committed to build that in America--bringing jobs not just to Alabama but jobs all over the Nation, far more around the Nation than just in Alabama--and to create a third major world aircraft facility. Congress asked that the bids be competitively let and that these two competitors be given a chance to submit the best proposal.\n\tI am highly convinced that the EADS aircraft is superior--is larger, it is newer--and more effective in the role it is asked to fulfill.\n\tMrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would just ask what the order is at this point.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator sought recognition after he objected.\n\tMrs. MURRAY. The unanimous consent agreement was that the Senator from Texas would proceed after I had yielded the floor, which I had not yielded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, the Senator from Alabama was the only person who sought recognition.\n\tMrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe there was an agreement that the Senator from Texas follow my remarks.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. There was an order, but there was no objection. There was no one who sought recognition.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. I will wrap up, briefly, if I could.\n\tMrs. HUTCHISON addressed the chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\tMrs. HUTCHISON. If the Senator from Alabama wants to finish his objection--\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: My understanding is that the Senator from Washington had 10 minutes. My understanding is she had completed that 10 minutes; am I incorrect on that?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Her time has expired.\n\tMrs. BOXER. I didn't hear the Chair say that. I thank the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\tMrs. HUTCHISON. I ask the Senator from Alabama, I thought he was objecting on Senator Murray's time, and I was next in the unanimous consent. My question is, is he finished with his objection?\n\tMr. SESSIONS. I wish 1 additional minute to wrap up, if I could, and then I will yield the floor.\n\tMrs. MURRAY. Madam President, then I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\tWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I have the floor, I believe.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Madam President, after this competition has been going on for quite a number of years, and both parties have been very seriously competing for this contract, it is expected to be awarded in March of next year. The Defense Department has considered every one of these issues, including the WTO issue. The lawyers talked about it and we have talked about it in the Senate and the House.\n\tAt this very last minute, on the eve of awarding the competition, a House bill was passed without any debate. We have not discussed it or had a hearing on it. It should not be approved. I object.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\tMrs. MURRAY. Madam President, we are asking for a level playing field with a bill that passed the House. This is a discussion we have had many times. It says that illegal subsidies from any company should be taken into account on a deal in front of the Pentagon.\n\tI will stand anytime and fight for fairness and competition. I am sorry this has been objected to, because it meant our country would have a fair competition.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\tMrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak on the START treaty. I spoke on the floor Saturday stating my concerns about this treaty and the need to address a number of very important issues. I had hoped that amendments that had been offered would be able to clarify the position--the United States position--on this treaty.\n\tI have listened to the debate. I have watched many amendments go down. The treaty supporters have said that these amendments are deal killers, treaty killers. I disagree. I believe everybody has been sincere, but I am not persuaded that the Senate's role to advise and consent to treaties has successfully finetuned the understanding on our part, if we accept this treaty, nor the Russian positions--have they been clarified with our objections or disagreements with the Russian position.\n\tI understand it would have made it hard for the administration to amend the text. But even amendments that would try to amend the preamble, or even the ratification resolution that would clarify the United States position, have caused me great pause. For instance, when we are talking about missile defense, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, said:\n\n       Russians tend to interpret every utterance as binding \n     commitment.\n\n\tShe went on to write:\n\n       The Russians need to understand that the U.S. will use the \n     full range of American technology and talent to improve our \n     ability to intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of \n     hostile countries.\n\n\tI am concerned that this treaty still has a lot of misunderstanding about the United States missile defense capability. I am concerned that our capability, with the understanding of Russians, would be restricted. Russia and the United States each have issued unilateral statements when they signed the New START that clarified their position on the relationship between START and missile defense. Russia stated:\n\n       The treaty can operate and be viable only if the United \n     States refrains from developing its missile defense \n     capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively.\n\n\tI think we should state clearly in the resolution to ratify that it is not the position of the United States to place any limitations on missile defense. The President wrote a letter saying he disagreed with the Russian position and, yet, Senator McCain offered an amendment that would have stricken language in the preamble of the treaty that would have made it clear what the United States position was, and that amendment was not adopted by this body.\n\tAs we speak, I don't believe Russia is our enemy. This is a 10-year treaty. We don't know 10 years down the road how relationships might change. I believe our relationship with Russia is important, but there are rogue nations in the world that are hostile to the United States, which are working in earnest to get nuclear capability and possibly already have it, plus warheads to put those nuclear weapons on.\n\tWith the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran or North Korea, or Pakistan, which is our ally, which has a fragile government, or even Venezuela, which is working with Iran and is certainly within our hemisphere, it would be unthinkable to have any kind of miscommunication about the United States capability to control its own defense capabilities. That is exactly what the Russian statement said we could not do.\n\tU.S. planning and force requirements may have to change in the next 10 years and, frankly, I think they ought to be going forward right now to ensure that we can withstand any kind of warhead, nuclear or otherwise, that would come in from rogue nations.\n\tThat in itself is enough for me to say we have not fulfilled our responsibility under the Constitution for advice to the President on treaties. That is our solemn responsibility, and I do not think we have been successfully able to do that because we have been blocked on every amendment, calling them deal killers.\n\tI think a strong New START is in our best interest. But I believe that this treaty does not address other areas of concern I have voiced as well. I believe this treaty could further be improved by increasing the number of type one and type two inspections, as was attempted by the Inhofe amendment that was defeated yesterday.\n\n\tFor instance, we know there are loose nukes that have come from Russian arsenals in the past, because the Russians have not had a clear control, or list of, or don't seem to be totally firm about where all of their arsenal is, and they don't seem to have the accountability. So the loose nukes, it has been reported, have shown up in other places, such as, for instance, North Korea. So I think verification becomes more important, to get a true idea of exactly what the Russians have, so there can be an accountability going forward to assure that whatever number are in whatever place would always stay the same, unless they are part of the drawdown.\n\tI think the verification amendment Senator Inhofe had that was defeated would have improved our capability to understand exactly what was out there that might loosely go to Iran or North Korea, with whom the Russians have relationships, though we do not.\n\tFormer Secretary of State James Baker described the treaty's verification regime as weaker than its predecessor. I agree with his comment, and I hope we can improve the situation. To be fair, Secretary Baker supports the treaty. But he did recognize its shortcomings, and I think that should have been addressed by the Senate, without fear of what the Russians might say about our capability to defend against threats, not from Russia necessarily, other than the haplessness of not knowing for sure where your nuclear weapons are--I don't think Russia is our enemy. I want a relationship with Russia.\n\tThe missile defense we were not able to even clarify in the resolution of ratification causes me great concern. The verification not being as adequate as I think we need, and then the modernization, which we also address in other amendments, I think, are also problematic. I believe we must know our nuclear warheads could be used in the worst-case circumstance, because I think that is a deterrent.\n\tBecause of these things, I am going to vote no today on the ratification of the treaty. I think the Senate could have improved the understanding of this treaty. I think we could have strengthened it with real amendments that would have strengthened even what the President said in his letter to the Senate, saying that he disagreed with the Russian interpretation. But then when we tried to put that in writing, that didn't pass. So I believe we should not pass this treaty today. I think we can fulfill our responsibility for advice and consent and have a more bipartisan passing of the resolution. I think we need a good relationship with Russia. I think we need to protect, at all costs, the United States unilateral capability for missile defense for our country against other nations. I don't think Russia is a threat, but I do think rogue nations that have nuclear capabilities are. I think the symbiotic relationship between Venezuela and Iran is a very real threat to the United States. I think we need to start preparing more carefully about that.\n\tI know my time is up. I appreciate the time to state my reasons for voting against this and hope that when it passes--which I think it will--we will be more firm in clarifying with the Russians our view of our national security interests.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\tMr. KERRY. Madam President, first, if I can interrupt for a moment before the Senator from North Dakota speaks, according to the prior order. I want to inform Senators that it is now 1:15. We are awaiting language which is forthcoming relatively soon on the 9/11 issue. I think it is the intention of the majority leader to vote very quickly after that unanimous consent agreement comes together. That means we could have a vote, conceivably, on the final passage of the resolution of ratification on the treaty somewhere--this is a guess--within the vicinity of 1:45 to 2 o'clock. That is a guess. Senator Kyl I know wanted to speak prior to that taking place. We are trying to preserve that within the order. That said, I yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\tMr. REID. Madam President, we expect to have the necessary papers to complete the consent agreement within the next 15 minutes. It is 1:15 now, so we hope by 1:30. Sometimes Senate time is not exactly right, but we are getting very close to being able to do this consent agreement. It has been typed. We are waiting for the papers to come from the Hart Building.\n\tWe want everyone to be patient. We know how anxious everyone is to complete the business of this Congress. Just everyone understand it should be not much longer. \n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\tMr. DORGAN. Madam President, I was not going to speak again, but I was prompted to by my colleague from Alabama, a friend and someone for whom I have great respect. The presentation by my colleague from Alabama suggested that President Obama is moving in the direction of disarming us, the implication is that of injuring our national security by proposing that we have fewer nuclear weapons. Let me make a point that I think is so important for the record.\n\tI hope it is not now or ever considered a source of weakness for this country to aspire to have a planet with fewer nuclear weapons. It ought to be a source of strength that we understand it becomes our burden as a world leader--an economic leader and nuclear power--to try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on this Earth.\n\tThis President has not proposed anything that would injure our national security. He is not proposing anything that is unilateral. He has negotiated and his team has negotiated a very strong arms reduction treaty with the Russians.\n\tI know there has been great discussion about modernization, whether there is enough money, about why tactical nuclear weapons were not included, the issue of whether it limits us with respect to missile defense. All of those issues have been answered. All have been responded to.\n\tThe question, it seems to me, for us now and for all Americans, and particularly those who serve in Congress in the future, is will we be a world leader in pushing for a reduction in the number of nuclear weapons on this planet?\n\tThere are some 25,000 nuclear weapons on this planet. The loss of just one of those weapons, into the hands of a terrorist or rogue nation who might then explode it in a major city on Earth would change everything.\n\tMy colleagues are probably tired of hearing me say it, but in my desk I have kept a piece of a Soviet Union bomber, a very small piece of a wing strut from a Soviet Union bomber. We did not shoot it down. We negotiated that bomber down by paying money to saw the wings off.\n\tNuclear arms reduction treaties work. We know they work. There are Russian submarines that were not destroyed in battle. We ground them up and took them apart. The wings were sawed off bombers, and they were sold for scrap. Nuclear missiles in silos with nuclear warheads aimed at American cities are gone.\n\tI will give an example. One was in Ukraine. Now sunflower seeds adorn that pasture where there was a missile with a nuclear weapon aimed at America.\n\tWe know these arms reduction treaties work because we have seen them work. Fewer nuclear weapons, fewer delivery vehicles, bombers, submarines, missiles--we know this works.\n\tMy colleague seemed to suggest that it would be a horrible thing if the entire world were rid of nuclear weapons. I hope that every Senator would aspire to have that be the case, a world in which there was not one weapon left, for almost surely every offensive weapon on this planet has always been used. We need to be very concerned about the number of nuclear weapons, the spread of nuclear weapons, the need, the desire for terrorists to acquire nuclear weapons. That is why these treaties and these negotiations on arms reduction are so unbelievably important.\n\tNever has it been more important because now there is a new threat. They do not wear uniforms. They do not belong to one country. It is the terrorist threat. And they strive mightily to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\tThis treaty negotiated at the start by the previous President and concluded by this President, in my judgment, strengthens this country, represents our best national security interests.\n\tI ask the question of anyone who believes that it is a threat for us to begin reducing nuclear weapons through arms negotiations with others who have nuclear weapons: Who, if not us, will lead the way to do that? If not us, who? Is there another country they think will aspire to provide leadership to reduce the number of nuclear weapons? If there is, tell us the name because we all know better than that.\n\tThis responsibility falls on our shoulders. We are the leading nuclear power on this Earth. It is our responsibility, it is this country's responsibility to lead. I don't ever want anybody to suggest it is some sort of weakness for this President or any President to engage in arms reduction negotiations. That is a source of strength.\n\tThis treaty was negotiated carefully. I was on the national security working group. We had briefing after briefing in top-secret venues. This treaty was carefully negotiated. It represents our best interests. It represents a reduction of nuclear weapons, a reduction of delivery vehicles and represents, in my judgment, another step in reducing the nuclear threat. It is not even a giant step, but it certainly is a step in the right direction.\n\tThis represents our best national security interests, and this President has demonstrated, yes, he wants a world with fewer nuclear weapons. He wants a world, as would I, with no nuclear weapons at some point. But this President would never allow negotiations or never allow circumstances in which this country is unarmed or unprepared or unable to meet its national security needs. He has not done that, not in this treaty, and will not do it in the future.\n\tI did want to stand up and say that because of the comments earlier by the Senator who suggested there is some sort of weakness for a country that aspires to have a reduction of nuclear weapons on this planet.\n\tLet me finally say, I have spoken at length on this floor about the severity of losing even just one nuclear weapon. I have told the story about a CIA agent code-named Dragonfire who reported 1 month after 9/11 that a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon had been stolen from Russia and that nuclear weapon had been smuggled into New York City and was to be detonated. There was an apoplectic seizure in this town about it because no one knew what to do about it. They did not even notify the mayor of New York.\n\tThey discovered a month later that was probably not a credible piece of information. But as they did the diagnosis of it, they discovered it is plausible someone could have acquired a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon from Russia, it was plausible; if they had done that, they could have smuggled it into an American city and if terrorists did that they could have detonated it. Then we are not talking about 3,000 deaths, we are talking about 100,000, 200,000 deaths.\n\tThe work we have done in so many areas, the work in this administration, let me say, to secure loose nuclear materials, circumstances where plutonium or highly enriched uranium in the size of a liter or, in one case, in the size of a small can of soda, enough to kill tens and tens of thousands of people with a nuclear weapon--this is serious business. At a time when we debate a lot of issues--serious and not so serious--this is serious business.\n\tI think the work that has been done by the chairman and ranking member in recent days--I watched a lot of this and watched it over this year--is extraordinary work. But so too is the work by this President, by the negotiators. My colleague described the folks at the State Department who had a significant role as well.\n\tLet us not ever think it is a source of weakness to be negotiating verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons among those who possess them. That is a source of strength, and it is important for our kids and grandchildren who can succeed by continuing to do that with treaties that make the best sense for this country's national security interests.\n\tI see the Senator from Massachusetts does not yet have a unanimous consent request, but I know all my colleagues are anxious to see one.\n\tI yield the floor, and I expect, as the majority leader indicated, within the next half hour or so we will be voting, and I think that is good news. I yield the floor.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Interest on Lawyer Trust Accounts\n\n\tMr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to discuss and ask unanimous consent for consideration of H.R. 6398. I will get to the unanimous consent language in a moment, but right now I want to describe what this is about. Then I wish to yield to my colleague from Georgia to add a little bit of the impact of this issue.\n\tThe issue is this: In all 50 States in America, lawyers have to put clients' funds into trust accounts. Under the law, they are not allowed to earn interest on these accounts. Over time, an arrangement has been worked out whereby the banks pay interest, but it does not go to the clients; it goes to fund civil legal services for those who cannot afford those services.\n\tThis arrangement is in great jeopardy if we do not pass this bill today. I will expand on that jeopardy in a moment, but at this point I simply am going to yield to my colleague from Georgia.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\tMr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. This is very important work, and we are in our late hour. Sometimes we do our best in the late hour.\n\tThe unintended consequence of the Dodd-Frank legislation with regard to IOLTA is it not being extended and we are going to literally have thousands of escrow accounts held by law firms and attorneys, real estate transactions, dispute resolution transactions, and beneficial programs that will have to be spread among many more banks because the insurance level, which is now limited, drops to $250,000. It would force the transfer of escrow account money out of any number of banks. At a time when capital is critical in small community banks, the unintended consequence might have been to take them below tier one capital requirements and put them in a stress situation.\n\tI commend the distinguished Senator from Oregon for his work on this legislation. I thank the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter, for his consent for us to bring this forward. I give wholehearted support to the unanimous consent request.\n\tI yield back to the Senator.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\tMr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I appreciate so much the partnership of my colleague from Georgia. He has laid out clearly the impact of a failure to fix this legislation on our community banks where lawyers, exercising their fiduciary responsibilities, would have to move their trust accounts out of these special accounts where the interest goes to legal services and legal education and into no-interest-bearing accounts so that no one gains from that movement. In the course of it, they would be moving funds often from community banks to other institutions, imperiling these community banks.\n\tI wish to address the other side of this issue, which is the important work these funds do in all 50 States. I will speak specifically to the State of Oregon, but there are parallels because all 50 States participate with these accounts.\n\tIn Oregon, we have, first, the association of Oregon Legal Services Program, its primary source of civil legal assistance available to low-income Oregonians. To give a sense, if a woman is having a big challenge with domestic violence, she can get legal aid through this type of assistance. If a family is trying to struggle with a mistake on a foreclosure process so they can save their home, they can get assistance through this program. They have 20 offices throughout the State of Oregon to serve Oregonians living in poverty.\n\n\tSecond is the Juvenile Rights Project. This provides legal services to children and families through individual representation in juvenile court and school proceedings to help children who are in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.\n\tA third is Disability Rights Oregon, the Oregon Advocacy Center, which assists those who are disabled, who are victims of abuse or neglect, or have difficulty acquiring health care or need to exercise their rights in regard to special education. They can turn to the Oregon Advocacy Center-Disability Rights of Oregon for help.\n\tIn addition, these funds pay for legal-oriented education for our K-12 students. Let me give an example of three programs in Oregon. These programs assist 15,000 students in our State.\n\tOne is the High School Mock Trial Competition. This type of mock trial competition is an enormous learning exercise for our students in how our courts function and how the facts of a case are presented and how the principles of law are applied.\n\tThen we have the summer institute training for teachers so that social studies teachers can learn more about the role of law and be more effective in conveying that vision to our students.\n\tThen I also want to mention the We The People Program on the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Here in this Chamber, we discuss the Constitution and the Bill of Rights virtually on a daily basis. Virtually every day on this floor, we discuss how these founding documents affect how our laws are applied and how freedoms are protected in the United States of America. This program helps our children learn those fundamental principles. Sort of the heart and spirit of the American democratic world are conveyed through this We The People Program.\n\tI also wish to commend a whole host of banks in Oregon that have agreed not only to pay interest on these lawyer trust accounts--and IOLTA stands for interest on lawyer trust accounts--but to pay 1 percent, which is above the going rate on most types of transaction accounts. They do that because they benefit from the deposits, and they know their communities benefit from these services and these programs.\n\tThis legislation will resolve a problem in which lawyers, applying their fiduciary responsibilities, would have had to withdraw their funds from these accounts and put them in other non-interest-bearing accounts, to no benefit to anyone and to a great deal of harm to so many.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["John F.

Madam President, I wish to take an additional minute, if \nI might--the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is on the \nfloor--to say, in addition to my statement I made 2 days ago in a \nspeech on the floor with regard to the START treaty, that I wish to \nthank the chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for the accommodating process from day one in April until \ntoday, where the treaty will ultimately pass on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Legislation is about improving ideas and making sure the interest of \nthe\n\n[[Page S10965]]\n\nAmerican people and the United States of America is protected. Through \nthe work of Senators Lugar and Kerry, we have been able to craft \namendments to the resolution of ratification on the START treaty that \nensure missile defense and modernization--the two contentious points on \nthis legislation which came from the committee--are not only taken care \nof, but they are buttoned down and they are clear. And I thank the \nchairman and the ranking member for their willingness to do so.\n  I want to let everyone who is listening and those who will read the \nreports of this debate know that this has been a 7-month process, not a \n9-day process, and it has been a detailed process. It has been the work \nof the will of the people of the United States of America, and the U.S. \nSenate has worked its will. When it is ratified today, it will be a \nstep forward in the future for my children and grandchildren.\n  During my campaign when I ran for reelection this year, I made the \nfollowing statement: The rest of my life is about doing everything I \ncan do to see to it that the lives of my children and grandchildren are \nsafer, more secure, and as affluent as my life has been because of my \nparents and grandparents. Today, in this ratification, we are ensuring \nthat we will be strong in our strength, we will trust but we will \nverify. We will make sure we can fight, if necessary, but we will also \nmake sure we are accountable. And most important of all, with regard to \nthe biggest threats we face--terrorism and loose nuclear materials \nfalling into the hands of a rogue nation--we will be a safer country \nbecause of this, and I thank the chairman and ranking member because of \nit.\n  I thank the chairman for his time, and I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I rise to oppose the START treaty because \nit recognizes limits on U.S. missile defenses in return for marginal \nreductions in the Russian arsenal. At the moment when the U.S. and \nallies must build missile defenses to protect against Iran, this treaty \ngenerates Russian pressure for America to go slow or risk Russia's \ndeparture from the agreement.\n  If you take the President's Senate missile defense letter at face \nvalue, then America would deploy defenses that will trigger a Russian \ntreaty exit. I am concerned that to prevent a Russian treaty \nwithdrawal, the United States will move slower on building defenses \nagainst Iran just when we need to move faster.\n  The most important duty of the Federal Government is to defend \nAmericans against foreign attack, and the most important mission under \nthat duty is to protect American families from the most dangerous \nnations that could carry out such an attack.\n  In the mid-20th century, we agreed that the Soviet Union represented \na clear and present danger to America. Our Cold War Presidents--Truman \nthrough Clinton, Republicans and Democrats--backed policies of a strong \ndefense, with alliances with our friends and diplomacy with the \nSoviets. But much has changed since the 20th century ended over a \ndecade ago. While the Russians still have an impressive arsenal, they \nare shadows of their former shadow, dropping from 290 million people to \n140 million people and from a gross domestic product of $2.6 trillion \nin 1990 to $2.1 trillion in 2010. The nuclear national security threat \nfor the new 21st century moved beyond Russia to include Iran and North \nKorea, soon to be armed with nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver \nthem.\n  While the Russians are heavily armed, they present a relatively \nstable face to the outside world. They have the capability to attack, \nbut they currently lack the intent. On any given year, their leaders \nappear adverse to risk and unready to commit national suicide. The same \ncannot be said for Iran, North Korea, and other nations that present a \nfar less rational face to the international community. Looking at such \npotentially irresponsible leaders, it is incumbent on us to go beyond \nidealistic diplomacy and mount a defense against an attack which may be \nleveled against our people or our allies. The lives of millions and the \ncause of freedom depend on our assessment of this threat and how we \nrespond.\n  Recall that nuclear technology represents the science of the 1930s, \nmissile technology from the 1960s. Since the laws of physics cannot be \nclassified, countries bad and good will all one day have the means to \ndevelop powerful arsenals based on the last century's science. It is \nthe sacred mission of the democracies to understand this change, to \nmeasure its danger, and to eliminate an attack should one of these \nsmaller, less rational countries attack.\n  In such an environment, an agreement to limit the nuclear arms of the \nUnited States and Russia is helpful but does not concern the new danger \nemerging against the people of the West. If we can lower nuclear arms \nto levels where we still maintain a devastating counterpunch against a \nrational opponent who is uninterested in national suicide, then a \nnuclear war with that country remains unlikely and the cost of our \narmaments is reduced. If that agreement also causes us not to build \ndefenses against an irrational opponent who may attack anyway, then we \nhave committed a grievous national error.\n  I initially favored the goals of the START treaty. The treaty is an \necho from the 20th century and had a marginal utility in improving the \ndefense of the United States. Unfortunately, the negotiations to \nproduce this treaty took a turn that was not well perceived by the \npress or public. The Russians used these negotiations intended to \nimprove the defense of the United States as a means to preserve their \nability to attack.\n  Surprisingly, American negotiators formalized a link in the protocol \nbetween limiting defenses against missile attack and maintaining forces \nto carry out such a strike. Perversely, this agreement now stands for \ntwo principles: No. 1, the United States and Russia should reduce their \nnuclear arms, on which we all agree, and No. 2, the United States \nshould recognize policies to maintain the viability of a Russian \nattack. This second principle turns the purpose of the treaty on its \nhead. It weakens the future defense of our Nation. The treaty would \nsupport a policy that we must not improve our defenses to such a degree \nas to defeat a Russian attack.\n  Much of this has had little impact on actual defense plans regarding \nRussia. Russia presents a relatively stable, status quo face to the \ninternational community. It also maintains a nuclear force which would \nquickly overwhelm any planned system of defense. But a policy of \nlimiting missile defense has a tremendous impact on our ability to \nthwart an attack from less responsible powers, such as Iran or North \nKorea. Given the actions of Iranian and North Korean leaders, I would \nargue these countries represent the more important danger to the future \nof the United States and our allies in this new century.\n  In the 20th century, the argument about the defense of the Nation \nagainst an attack by missiles took on a divided and partisan tone. \nPresident Reagan proposed ``missile defense,'' while congressional \nDemocrats opposed ``Star Wars.''\n  Much of the disagreement ended in the late 1980s and 1990s when Iraq \nattacked Iran and then Israel with missiles.\n  Over time, careful observers noted that missile defense was important \nnot just to the health of Israel but to its survival.\n  When Russia attacked Georgia, it used a great number of missiles to \ndeliver blows against that little country. As this century winds on, \nmore countries will see these realities of the 21st century, eventually \nincluding the United States.\n  The administration's unsteady missile defense plans also concern me. \nI am concerned about the missile defense actions taken by the current \nadministration. When it took office, it cancelled plans to enhance the \nmissile defenses of the United States itself that were based in Alaska \nand California. To the great embarrassment of our allies in the Czech \nRepublic and Poland, it cancelled plans to deploy radars and two-stage \nground-based interceptors (GBIs). I would note that history has been \nunkind to Western leaders that abandon Poland.\n  The administration also began an effort to cancel funding for the \n``Arrow III'' interceptor being jointly developed with Israel. Thanks \nto the late Chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Committee, \nJack Murtha, the effort to kill Arrow III was reversed and\n\n[[Page S10966]]\n\nfull-funding came to the Arrow III program despite the President's \nearly wishes.\n  Once the negative reaction of our hurt Polish allies was known, the \nadministration responded with a four-part plan to calm Europe using \nsystems inferior to the GBI anti-missiles originally proposed by the \nlast administration and current Secretary of defense. The inartfully \ncoined European ``Phased-Adaptive'' approach involved anti-aircraft \nsystems patched together in a rather ad hoc fashion. We now plan to \nbegin by sailing U.S. Navy Aegis cruisers near European coasts followed \nby a decade and the possible deployment of a to-be-built Navy missile \ninterceptor that does not yet exist, called the ``Standard Missile 3, \nblock IIA''.\n  I contacted our Missile Defense Agency and asked if the originally \nplanned GBIs for Poland could have stopped an attack by Iran against \nthe United States. They answered yes.\n  We checked if any one of the new ``Phased-Adaptive'' stages could \nstop a similar intercontinental attack by Iran against the U.S. They \nanswered Phase I could not, Phase II could not, and Phase III could \nnot.\n  In fact the only phase that could engage a missile launched by Iran \nagainst the U.S. was not until Phase IV by the IIB missile that did not \nyet exist that would be deployed far later than the original GBIs \nproposed.\n  The problem goes deeper. I asked the MDA to compare the capabilities \nof the originally proposed two-stage GBIs to hit an Iranian missile \nagainst the future final Phase IV SM-3 JIB. The MDA replied with this \ngraph. It shows that the original, longer range GBIs would have a full \n4-minute window to hit and destroy an incoming Iranian missile bound \nfor New York City. The SM-3 IIB, which has a shorter range, would have \nonly 3 minutes. In short, the administration's new proposed missile has \n25 percent less time to defeat an incoming Iranian attack than the \noriginally proposed missile. No wonder our Polish allies supported the \noriginal plan.\n  I worry that some of these changes were made to curry favor with the \nRussians. I am concerned that the preamble to the START treaty would be \nused to reduce or block the efforts of the Congress to upgrade the \ndefenses of the United States. In short, I am worried that while this \ntreaty reduces the smaller threat of attack by Russia, it creates a \nRussian block for plans to eliminate the larger threat from Iran. The \nRussians clearly stated that if we mount defenses that could defeat \ntheir attack, they would pull out of the treaty. The problem is that to \neliminate the threat from Iran and North Korea, we will have to do so. \nIn this case, what is the value of the treaty? It clearly helps the \nRussians but if it blocks or delays our effort to protect against Iran, \ndoes it help us? I am also concerned with other aspects of this treaty, \nlike an end to full-time compliance monitoring inside Russia.\n  There are also details of the treaty itself that concern me. Under \nprevious treaties, the United States had a full-time monitoring \npresence in Votkinsk. This was eliminated. We will no longer have full-\ntime monitors in Russia.\n  Also, an end to telemetry from new Russian missiles. Under previous \ntreaties, the United States and Russia shared all the information \ntransmitted by their test missiles in flight, called telemetry. While \nour spy satellites, planes and ships can gather some of this \ninformation, there is nothing like getting it straight from the \nmissile's mouth. Telemetry is key to understanding the capability of a \nnew missile, especially its maneuvers to drop off one or more nuclear \nwarheads.\n\n  Under this new treaty, this data was lost. The Russians will not \nprovide telemetry from their new missiles under this treaty. Their only \nobligation is to share telemetry from five missile flights a year and \nthey will likely pick old missiles to do this.\n  We are told we lost the capability to collect the telemetry of new \nRussian missiles because while the Russians are developing many new \nmodels, we are not. Given that telemetry would report mainly on new \nRussian developments and not American, our negotiators gave up.\n  They should not have given up. The collection of telemetry from new \nRussian missiles had long been enshrined in arms control treaties. This \nprecedent was well established and should have been continued.\n  There are inspections, but only 18 per year. We are told that the new \ntreaty will offer the unprecedented inspection of actual missile \nwarheads. This is true. Under the old treaties, we simply counted the \nnumber of missiles the Russians had using our spy satellites and \nassumed each missile was packed with as many warheads as the missile's \nflight tests and telemetry showed.\n  Now we will get to inspect actual missiles--but only 18 per year. The \nRussians have hundreds. At the rate the treaty allows, the full \ninspection of the Russian arsenal of 800 launchers would take over 40 \nyears.\n  I asked administration officials how many hours notice the Russians \nwould have before Americans conducted an actual warhead inspection. In \nall cases, they would have 24 hours or more notice that the Americans \nwere coming. After extensive briefings on Russian cheating against \nprevious arms control treaties--most flagrantly the treaty banning \nbiological weapons--it should give you pause that the United States \ngave up collecting telemetry on the flight of every Russian missile in \nreturn for the inspection of 10 missiles per year and that only after a \nfull day's notice.\n  We are also told that this treaty is needed to improve Russian \ninternational behavior. In my view, a treaty should only be signed to \nreward good behavior, not to encourage it later.\n  I was most inclined to support the intent of this treaty to improve \nrelations between the United States and Russia on the subject of \ncollapsing the Iranian regime and its nuclear weapons program. \nUndoubtedly, the administration earned good marks in getting the \nRussians to cancel the delivery of one key piece of air defense \nequipment--an anti-aircraft missile battery called the S-300--to Iran. \nThis was an unqualified success.\n  Unfortunately, there are many more failures where the press paid \nlittle note. We believe the Russians are still delivering other pieces \nof air defense equipment to the Iranians. That is why the Russians \ninsisted on exempting such deliveries from the new U.N. sanctions \nagainst Iran. Russian equipment will likely be used to defend Iran's \nnuclear sites, the very programs we are most worried about that violate \nIran's commitment to the U.N. Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n  What is most surprising is the actions of the Russians since the \nnegotiation of this treaty. They know we, the Europeans and Israelis \nare most worried about the nuclear program of Iran. Despite these well-\npublicized concerns and numerous U.N. resolutions against the Iranian \nnuclear program, the Russians chose this year and this country to \nprovide nuclear fuel to the Iranian reactor at Bushehr. As that Russian \nreactor begins operation, plutonium production will begin inside Iran. \nWhile the Russians promise that the Iranians will not be able to use \nthis plutonium in Iranian bombs, can we be assured that these promises \nwill be honored? Would not it have been better to never begin plutonium \nproduction in Iran at all?\n  I am also concerned about new ideas coming from the administration on \nmissile defense and the Russians. Long ago, President Clinton proposed \nU.S-Russian cooperation in space. That cooperation led to a dependence \nso that soon, the U.S. will lack any way to launch astronauts. We \ncannot send our own astronauts to our own space station without the \npermission of the Russians.\n  In discussions regarding this treaty, I learned that the \nadministration is now planning to bring the Russians inside the missile \ndefenses of NATO. Russia is the very nation that used missiles to \nattack Georgia--a country applying for membership in NATO. I am sure \nthe Georgians would be uncomfortable at best seeing Russians manage the \nmissile defense of their little nation.\n  The U.S. offer to bring the Russians into NATO's missile defenses was \nembodied in an offer at the recent NATO conference in Lisbon. Nearly \nall Americans are fully aware of Russian spying against the United \nStates military for the last 70 years. We know that Russia has one of \nthe most active cyber-attack networks on the planet operating against \nU.S. networks. It would seem that a proposal to bring the Russians into \nthe missile defense system of\n\n[[Page S10967]]\n\nNATO would introduce powerful new opportunities for espionage against \nus, as well as a greater understanding of our defense capabilities and \nweaknesses.\n  Imagine a Russian officer in a NATO missile defense center. He will \nsoon learn when our system is alerted, how it processes information, \nwhat our response times are and the estimated accuracy of our \ninterceptors. These are the things he would learn during his first week \ninside our operations center. We can only imagine what else he would \nlearn over the coming years.\n  Remember that the warning information from NATO is critical to the \ndefense of the United States. If the Russians managed to spoof or block \ncritical NATO missile warning data, then U.S. commanders defending our \nhomeland would become weaker, not stronger due to Russian presence in \nNATO missile defense centers.\n  Recall that missile combat is the ultimate ``come as you are'' \naffair. In a struggle between continents, the battle will be joined \nwithin 30 minutes. When submarine or medium-range missiles are \nemployed, battle can start in as little as 10 minutes. If we have \nRussians in the system who found American weaknesses or deployed \nproblems, U.S. commanders will have only minutes to diagnose and fix \nthose problems before the gravest consequences befall our people and \nallies.\n  The next Congress will favor missile defense programs to a far \ngreater degree than this one. I plan to encourage this body and \nespecially the House with legislation to deny funding for any effort to \nbring Russians into the missile defenses of NATO or the United States.\n  I respect the opinions of Senators on both sides of this question. It \nis my judgment that safety of the American people is better off if we \nwork to eliminate the new dangers of the 21st century rather than focus \non the old agreements of the 20th century. In my view, the growing \ndangers of Iran and North Korea threaten the American people most. \nTherefore, the missile defense programs of the United States and our \nallies take precedence over an agreement whose protocol limits our \ndefenses by acknowledging the need to preserve the ability of Russia to \nattack the United States.\n  While most of us were born in the 20th century and we loved black and \nwhite TV, the ``Ed Sullivan Show'' and the ``Honeymooners,'' we \nrecognize that time has passed and we must adapt to the new world of \nthe Internet, Ipad and Ichat. The 20th century doctrine of nuclear \nMutually Assured Destruction against the Soviet Union is part of our \npast and not part of a future involving Taepo Dong II missiles from \nNorth Korea and Shahab III missiles from Iran.\n  I would urge the administration to devote the time and attention of \nour able diplomats to ending the Iranian nuclear program rather than \nthis agreement that, while laudable in its very modest goals, went awry \nat the negotiating table.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, on April 8, 2009, President Obama and \nPresident Medvedev concluded negotiations, which had begun under \nPresident Bush, and signed the New START treaty. This new treaty is a \nkey part of the reset of the U.S.-Russian relationship. Even though the \nCold War ended 20 years ago, this relationship has been unclear; Russia \nis not an adversary but neither is it an ally. There have been divides \nand disagreements even though we share many common goals and interests. \nPresident Obama is rightly intent on moving the relationship in a more \npositive direction. Ratification of the New START treaty is an \nimportant part of this process.\n  On May 13 of this year, President Obama submitted the New START \ntreaty to the Senate. In carrying out its responsibility the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, the Senate Armed Service Committee and the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence held a total of 20 hearings and \n4 briefings. Seven hearings and three briefings were held by the Armed \nServices Committee. Even before the new treaty was submitted to the \nSenate, the Department of State provided the Senate National Security \nWorking Group multiple briefings on the status of and issues discussed \nduring negotiations.\n  It is now time for the Senate to provide its consent to ratification. \nAs Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said \nabout the START treaty on December 12, ``this is a national security \nissue of great significance and the sooner we get it done the better.'' \nThe Director of National Intelligence is also eager to get this treaty \nfinished and restore the insight into Russian nuclear forces that this \ntreaty will provide and that is so important for the intelligence \ncommunity. Director Clapper said, ``the sooner, the better. From an \nintelligence perspective, we are better off with the Treaty than \nwithout it.'' Retired General Brent Scowcroft, the National Security \nAdviser for both Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, and a \nsupporter of the Treaty, said, ``to play politics with what is the \nfundamental national interest is pretty scary stuff.''\n  Some have suggested that this new treaty should not be taken up in \nthis lameduck session of the 111th Congress. I couldn't disagree more. \nAlmost as soon as this session of Congress began, the President \nannounced his intent to complete negotiations on the new strategic arms \nagreement to replace the START I treaty. Various Senate committees of \nthis Congress and the Senate National Security Working Group of this \nCongress were briefed on numerous occasions by the negotiating team on \nthe new treaty. This Congress got the updates on the progress and the \nissues and this Congress provided guidance along the way. The \ncommittees of this Congress held 20 hearings and briefings on this new \ntreaty. This Congress hosted several all-Member briefings including one \nsuch session with the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \nto get his views on the importance of the treaty. The next Congress \nwill not have the benefit of all that work and insight. It is in fact \nthe obligation and the duty of this Congress to take up this treaty.\n\n  When President Obama submitted the START treaty to the Senate for \nconsideration he made six key points.\n  The treaty will enhance the national security of the United States.\n  The treaty mandates mutual reductions and limitations on the world's \ntwo largest nuclear arsenals.\n  The treaty will promote transparency and predictability in the future \nstrategic relationships of Russia and the United States.\n  The treaty will enable each party to the treaty to verify that the \nother party is complying with its obligations through a regime of \nonsite inspections, notifications, comprehensive and continuing data \nexchanges, and provisions for unimpeded use of national technical \nmeans.\n  The treaty includes detailed procedures for elimination or conversion \nof treaty accountable items, and\n  The treaty provides for the exchange of certain telemetric \ninformation on ballistic missile launches.\n  Equally important to this discussion is what the START treaty does \nnot cover.\n  It does not limit U.S. missile defense plans and programs.\n  It does not limit U.S. conventional prompt global strike programs.\n  It does not provide authority within the treaty to modify the terms \nand conditions of the treaty without the advice and consent of the \nSenate.\n  It does not constrain in any way the ability of the United States to \nmodernize the nuclear weapons complex, modernize, maintain, or replace \nstrategic delivery systems, or the ability to ensure that the stockpile \nof U.S. nuclear weapons remains safe, secure, and reliable.\n  It also does not cover nonstrategic nuclear weapons--often referred \nto as tactical nuclear weapons. The START treaty covers, as have all \nprevious nuclear arms reduction treaties, strategic offensive nuclear \narms. Dealing with tactical nuclear weapons is certainly an area of \narms control that needs to be addressed but has proved elusive to \nprevious administrations, Democratic and Republican. It remains to be \naddressed.\n  The START III treaty was to have covered these weapons but when the \nSTART II treaty, which was signed by President George H.W. Bush and \nRussian President Boris Yeltsin in 1993, was not ratified, any hope of \naddressing tactical nuclear weapons in a START III treaty died along \nwith the START II treaty. 17 years later President Obama is trying to \nget nuclear\n\n[[Page S10968]]\n\narms reductions back on track, by resuming discussions with Russia and \nsigning the START treaty. Hopefully, entry into force of this START \ntreaty will allow the United States and Russia to discuss an agreement \non tactical nuclear weapons. While getting an agreement to limit \ntactical nuclear weapons will be very difficult, without ratification \nof the New START treaty, it will be impossible.\n  Because this treaty does not require any significant reductions in \neither U.S. nuclear weapons or delivery systems, it is a fairly modest \ntreaty.\n  The so-called Moscow Treaty, which was signed in 2002 by President \nGeorge W. Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, limited both Russia \nand the United States to a range of operationally deployed nuclear \nwarheads by the year 2012. Under the Moscow Treaty, each side could \nhave between 1700 and 2200 total operationally deployed nuclear \nweapons. Russia has already met this goal and the United States is very \nclose. Under the START treaty, each side will have no more than 1550 \ndeployed nuclear weapons, a reduction of just 150 weapons below the \nMoscow Treaty. The START treaty does not limit the number of \nnondeployed nuclear weapons, an issue of importance to the Commander of \nthe U.S. Strategic Command, GEN. Kevin Chilton.\n  The limits in this treaty were agreed to after careful analysis by \nU.S. military leadership, particularly GEN Kevin Chilton, the Commander \nof the U.S. Strategic Command and the man responsible for these \nstrategic systems.\n  At a hearing before the Armed Services Committee on July 20, 2010, \nGEN Chilton stated that the force levels in the treaty meet the current \nguidance for deterrence for the United States. That guidance was laid \nout by President George W. Bush\n\n       The options we provided in this process focused on ensuring \n     America's ability to continue to deter potential adversaries, \n     assure our allies, and sustain strategic stability for as \n     long as nuclear weapons exist. This rigorous approach, rooted \n     in deterrence strategy and assessment of potential adversary \n     capabilities, supports both the agreed-upon limits in New \n     START and recommendations in the Nuclear Posture Review \n     (NPR).\n\n  The strategic deployed forces allowed under the treaty will ensure \nthe retention of the nuclear triad--all three delivery legs of the \ntriad, bombers, SLBMs, and ICBMs. On that point GEN Chilton was very \nclear, saying ``We will retain a triad of strategic nuclear delivery \nsystems.''\n  Secretary of Defense Gates has also been very clear that the nuclear \ntriad will be maintained. In an op-ed in May in the Wall Street \nJournal, Secretary Gates said the New START treaty ``preserves the U.S. \nnuclear arsenal as a vital pillar of our nation's and our allies' \nsecurity posture. Under this treaty the U.S. will maintain our powerful \nnuclear triad . . . and we retain the ability to change our force mix \nas we see fit.''\n  Some have said that the United States will have to make significant \nreductions to reach the force levels under the treaty and that the \nRussians will have to make no reductions. According to GEN Chilton this \nargument is a distraction. At an Armed Services Committee hearing GEN \nChilton commented on the lower level of Russian forces and said:\n\n       New START limits the number of Russian ballistic missile \n     warheads that can target the United States, missiles that \n     pose the most prompt threat to our forces and our nation. \n     Regardless of whether Russia would have kept its missile \n     force levels within those limits without a New START Treaty, \n     upon ratification they would now be required to do so.\n\n  While the START treaty will also not require significant reductions \nin the number of U.S. strategic delivery systems, there will be \nsome reductions but not for 7 years. More importantly the START treaty \nwill provide certainty for both Russia and the United States as to the \nsize of the deployed nuclear force of the other. This is particularly \nimportant to the United States because Russia is now below the proposed \ndelivery system limits of the START treaty, but has plans to build the \nnumber of strategic delivery systems. It is very much in the interest \nof the United States to have a cap on that build-up. An unrestrained \nbuild up would quickly bring back the ghosts and burdensome costs of \nthe Cold War.\n\n  Under this new treaty, Russia and the United States will each have a \ntotal of 800 deployed and nondeployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, \nand heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments, and 700 deployed \nICBMs, deployed SLBMs and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear \narmaments. The treaty does not limit nondeployed nuclear warheads, \nnondeployed ICBMs, nondeployed SLBMs, or heavy bombers that are not \nequipped for nuclear armaments. This is particularly important for the \nB-1B bomber fleet, as those airframes have not been in nuclear service \nfor many years and will not be counted under the START treaty when \nsimple modifications are completed.\n  This START treaty brings a practical approach to strategic systems \nand counts real delivery systems and real warheads. Over the years, the \nold START I treaty had resulted in exaggerated nuclear force numbers. \nFor instance, under the old START I treaty, the four Ohio class \nsubmarines that have been converted to conventional use, were still \ncounted as 96 deployed SLBMs and 768 deployed nuclear warheads. These \nexaggerated force structure levels have led to uncertainties for \nmilitary planners and increased costs for the United States. Under this \ntreaty they will not be counted.\n  One of the additional benefits of this START treaty is that the \ntreaty provides a clear mechanism to remove systems from being counted \nunder the treaty. The ability to clearly and easily remove systems, \nsuch as heavy bombers from under the treaty, is also of great \nimportance to General Chilton, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic \nCommand.\n  For example the United States currently has 76 B-52 bombers and 18 B-\n2 bombers, a total of 94 nuclear capable bombers. Under the current \nplan for implementing the treaty there will be up to 60 nuclear capable \nbombers. The remaining 34 can be converted to conventional only \ncapability and will no longer count under the treaty. They do not have \nto be destroyed. I think this fact is often misunderstood and there may \nbe an impression that the 34 bombers will have to be destroyed under \nthe treaty. That is not the case.\n  This past May, Secretary of Defense Gates wrote an op-ed in the Wall \nStreet Journal. Drawing on his long history and involvement with \nstrategic arms control agreements, which dates back to 1970, Secretary \nGates said that the question is always the same for each treaty: ``Is \nthe United States better off with an agreement or without it?'' With \nrespect to the START Treaty Secretary Gates' answer to the question is \nunequivocal: ``The United States is far better off with this Treaty \nthan without it.''\n  That is also the issue now before the Senate. Is the United States \nbetter off with this START treaty? The 20 hearings and 4 briefings have \nclearly demonstrated that it is.\n  In that same op-ed, Secretary Gates emphasized the current state of \naffairs that has existed since the end of December 2009 when the START \nI treaty expired. Since that time, there has been no verification and \ninspection regime, no visibility into the Russian strategic programs, \nand no limits on delivery vehicles. As the Secretary said:\n\n       Since the expiration of the old START Treaty in December \n     2009, the U.S. has had none of these safeguards. The new \n     treaty will put them back in place, strengthen many of them, \n     and create a verification regime that will provide for \n     greater transparency and predictability between our two \n     countries, to include substantial visibility into the \n     development of Russian nuclear forces.\n\n  This rigorous inspection and verification regime, which when coupled \nwith our national technical means, will allow this treaty to be \nmonitored and verified. Nevertheless there has been an argument made \nthat Russia cheated on the START I treaty and therefore we shouldn't \nratify the new treaty. According to the State Department that is simply \nnot the case.\n  In testimony before the Armed Services Committee in July, Assistant \nSecretary of State Rose Gottemoeller said, regarding the State \nDepartment's 2010 Treaty Compliance Report:\n\n       I want to point out that Russia was in compliance with \n     START's central limits during the Treaty's life span. \n     Moreover, the majority of compliance issues raised under \n     START were satisfactorily resolved. Most reflected differing \n     interpretations on how to implement START's complex \n     inspection and verification regime.\n\n  The old START I treaty was a complicated and complex treaty, many of\n\n[[Page S10969]]\n\nthe lessons learned from the inspections during the course of that \ntreaty have been incorporated into the new treaty. There were issues on \nboth sides. According to the 2010 Treaty Compliance Report:\n\n       The United States stated on several occasions to our Treaty \n     partners that the United States was compliant with the \n     Treaty; however as might be expected under a verification \n     regime as complex as START, the United States and Russia \n     developed a difference of views with regard to how the sides \n     implemented certain Treaty requirements.\n\n  This is not the same as cheating.\n  Our senior military leaders believe the new treaty can be monitored \nand verified and that if Russia did cheat there is high confidence that \nany cheating could be detected before such cheating rose to a level of \nmilitary significance. General Chilton said during testimony before the \nArmed Services Committee, ``New START will reestablish a strategic \nnuclear arms control verification regime that provides access to \nRussian nuclear forces and a measure of predictability in Russian force \ndeployments over the life of the treaty.''\n  In a discussion on the ability to detect cheating I asked General \nChilton, ``In other words, the verification provisions give you \nconfidence that Russia cannot achieve a militarily significant \nadvantage undetected?'' General Chilton said: ``Yes, that's correct.''\n  Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller, in her July testimony \nbefore the Armed Services Committee, made it clear that any cheating \ncould be detected before it became militarily significant. She also \nbelieves that the United States is well positioned to deter cheating as \nwell. In that regard she said:\n\n       Deterrence of cheating is a key part of the assessment of \n     verifiability, and is strongest when the probability of \n     detecting significant violations is high, the benefits to \n     cheating are low, and the potential costs are high. We assess \n     that this is the case for Russia cheating under the New START \n     Treaty.\n\n  One of the areas on which we have had substantial discussion is \nmissile defense. The U.S. missile defense program isn't covered or \nlimited by the New START treaty. It--the missile defense program--has \nnevertheless become a major focus of the debate on the treaty. Our \nmissile defense programs and policies are based on developing and \nfielding the missile defense capabilities we need to meet the missile \nthreats we face, not on any of these treaty matters. The New START \ntreaty does not limit the missile defense capabilities we need.\n  Secretary of Defense Gates, in testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee on June 17, said:\n\n       The Treaty will not constrain the United States from \n     deploying the most effective missile defenses possible, nor \n     impose additional costs or barriers on those defenses. I \n     remain confident in the U.S. missile defense program, which \n     has made considerable advancements, including the testing and \n     development of the SM-3 missile, which we will deploy in \n     Europe.\n\n  Secretary of State Clinton, in testimony before the Armed Services \nCommittee on June 17 said:\n\n       This Treaty does not constrain our missile defense efforts. \n     I want to underscore this because I know there have been a \n     lot of concerns about it and I anticipate a lot of questions.\n\n  During that same hearing Secretary Clinton went on to say:\n\n       The Treaty's preamble does include language acknowledging \n     the relationship between strategic offensive and defensive \n     forces, but that's simply a statement of fact. It too does \n     not in any way constrain our missile defense programs.\n\n  In a July 20 hearing before the Armed Services Committee, GEN Kevin \nChilton, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command said:\n\n       As the combatant command(er) also responsible for \n     synchronizing global missile defense plans, operations, and \n     advocacy, I can say with confidence that this treaty does not \n     constrain any current or future missile defense plans.\n\n  Assistant Secretary of State, Rose Gottemoeller, the lead negotiator \nof the Treaty, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations hearing \non June 10, said:\n\n       The Treaty does not constrain our current or planned \n     missile defense and, in fact, contains no meaningful \n     restrictions on missile defenses of any kind.\n\n  Later, on July 29, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee, \nAssistant Secretary Gottemoeller said:\n\n       There were no--and I repeat--no secret deals made in \n     connection with the New START Treaty, not on missile defense \n     nor on any other issue.\n\n  As the Ballistic Missile Defense Review report made clear, the \nadministration is pursuing a variety of systems and capabilities to \ndefend the homeland and different regions of the world against missile \nthreats from nations such as North Korea and Iran. A good example of \nthat is the phased adaptive approach to missile defense in Europe. The \nSecretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended it \nunanimously. It is strongly supported by our NATO allies. The November \n20, NATO Lisbon Summit Declaration says that ``the United States \nEuropean Phased Adaptive Approach is welcomed as a valuable national \ncontribution to the NATO missile defense architecture.''\n  During the NATO Lisbon Summit NATO announced its own decision to \nbuild a missile defense system to protect European populations and \nterritory against missile attack, consistent with the phased adaptive \napproach. The phased adaptive approach is designed to provide effective \nmissile defense capabilities in a timely manner against existing or \nemerging Iranian missile threats. Those are the missile threats faced \nby our military personnel, allies, and partners in Europe.\n  As the Secretary of Defense and numerous other officials have made \nclear, the treaty does not limit our missile defense plans or programs. \nThe Armed Services Committee also knows that, and our authorization \nbill stated that fact. Section 221(b)(8) of the Ike Skelton national \nDefense authorization bill for fiscal year 2011 that we passed this \nmorning in the Senate states, ``there are no constraints contained in \nthe New START Treaty on the development or deployment of effective \nmissile defenses, including all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach \nto missile defense in Europe and further enhancements to the Ground-\nbased Midcourse Defense system, as well as future missile defenses.''\n  To be very clear there is one provision in the treaty that prohibits \neach side from using ICBM silos or SLBM launchers for missile defense \ninterceptors, and vice versa. But using these silos and launchers are \nnot in our missile defense plan and should not be in our plan because \nit would be very much against our interest to use strategic missile \ninterceptor silos for ballistic defense purposes. It would be more \nexpensive than building new silos, the strategic missile silos aren't \nin the right locations to defend against missiles from North Korea, and \nmost importantly, it would be destabilizing to launch ballistic missile \ninterceptors from ICBM silos or SLBM launchers.\n  Lieutenant General O'Reilly, the Director of the Missile Defense \nAgency, has made clear, we don't want, need, or plan to use such silos \nfor missile defense purposes. In a June 16 hearing before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, Lieutenant General O'Reilly made it very \nclear saying ``replacing ICBMs with ground-based interceptors or \nadapting the submarine-launched ballistic missiles to be an interceptor \nwould actually be a setback--a major setback--to the development of our \nmissile defenses.''\n  That one limitation has no impact on our plans for missile defense, \nplans that are more effective and less expensive than converting ICBM \nor SLBM silos to missile defense use.\n  There is one other area of the many that have been discussed in \nconnection with the START treaty that I would like to raise, and that \nis modernization of the nuclear weapons complex and maintaining the \nability to certify annually that our stockpile remains safe, secure and \nreliable.\n  Shortly before Congress instituted a moratorium on nuclear weapons \ntesting in the early 1990s, the United States established a stockpile \nstewardship program to design and build advanced scientific, \nexperimental, and computational capabilities to enable the annual \ncertification process for the nuclear weapons. This program has been \nvery successful. Beginning in 2005, however, support for the program \nstarted to wane and the budgets for nuclear activities started to go \ndown. Without enough money the weapons complex was forced to have \nlayoffs at the nuclear weapons laboratories and the production \nfacilities, to defer\n\n[[Page S10970]]\n\nmaintenance on many important buildings and facilities, to delay key \nacquisitions, and to delay design and construction of the last two \nmajor new production facilities. President Obama, in his fiscal year \n2011 budget request and in the plans for the future years, has turned \nthis situation around by providing $4.1 billion more over the next five \nyears than previously planned. This level of funding is unprecedented \nsince the end of the Cold War.\n  President Obama laid out his funding plan for the nuclear enterprise \nin the November Section 1251 report, a report that would provide an \nadditional $1.2 billion over 2 years, a 15 percent increase and a total \nof $41.6 billion for fiscal years 2012-2016 for the National Nuclear \nSecurity Administration.\n\n  With these amounts has the administration committed enough to \nmodernization and sustainment of the complex and the life extension \nprograms for the nuclear stockpile? The directors of three nuclear \nweapons laboratories all say yes. In a joint December 1, 2010, letter \nto Senators Kerry and Lugar, the three Directors of the nuclear weapons \nlaboratories said that the finding level proposed in the section 1251 \nreport `` would enable the laboratories to execute our requirements for \nensuring a safe, secure, reliable, and effective stockpile under the \nStockpile Stewardship and Management Plan.''\n  The Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, \nunder both President George W. Bush and President Obama, Tom \nD'Agostino, said, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee in \nJuly:\n\n       Our plans for investment in and modernization of the \n     Nuclear Security Enterprise--the collection of NNSA \n     laboratories, production sites, and experimental facilities \n     that support our stockpile stewardship program, our nuclear \n     nonproliferation agenda, our Naval nuclear propulsion \n     programs, and a host of other nuclear security missions--are \n     essential irrespective of whether or not New START is \n     ratified.\n\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee took the right approach on \nthis issue in its resolution of ratification by not making entry into \nforce contingent on a certain funding level, but by including a sense \nof the Senate that the United States is committed to a robust stockpile \nstewardship program.\n  The list of both Republican and Democratic supporters of this Treaty \nis broad and strongly bipartisan, including eight former Secretaries of \nState--Madeleine Albright, Warren Christopher, Colin Powell, \nCondoleezza Rice, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, George Schultz, \nHenry Kissinger--four former Secretaries of Defense--Harold Brown, \nFrank Carlucci, Bill Cohen, Bill Perry, and Jim Schlesinger--seven \nformer commanders of the U.S. Strategic Command, President George H.W. \nBush, President Clinton and a long list of national security experts.\n  Our NATO allies support this treaty and have urged us to ratify it \nwithout delay. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rassmussen said at \nthe NATO summit in Lisbon in November:\n\n       A ratification of the START Treaty will contribute strongly \n     to an improvement of the overall security environment in the \n     Euro-Atlantic area, and all members of the NATO-Russia \n     Council share the view that an early ratification of the \n     START Treaty would be to the benefit of security in the Euro-\n     Atlantic area. I'd also have to say that it is a matter of \n     concern that a delayed ratification of the START Treaty will \n     be damaging to the overall security environment in Europe. So \n     we strongly urge both parties to ratify the START Treaty as \n     early as possible.\n\n  I believe that the Senate should consent to ratification of the New \nSTART treaty and that ratification of this treaty is in the national \nsecurity interest of the United States. Ratification of the New START \ntreaty will provide predictability, confidence, transparency and \nstability in the United States-Russian relationship. The New START \ntreaty will make us safer today, and leave a safer world for our \nchildren and grandchildren. The Senate should ratify the New START \ntreaty now.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nabout to ratify the New START treaty--I hope and believe with a very \nsolid bipartisan vote.\n  This really is a historic moment. This is the biggest arms control \ntreaty in 20 years, and the most important foreign policy action the \nSenate will take this Congress.\n  This is absolutely the right thing to do. It is important to our \nnational security and it is critical to uphold America's place in the \nworld community.\n  As I have said many times, the arms reductions in this treaty are \nmodest. New START requires a 30 percent reduction in warheads from the \nlimits set out in the Moscow Treaty in 2002 to 1,550 on each side, but \nboth the United States and Russia have been reducing their strategic \nstockpiles since then.\n  The real importance of this treaty comes from the monitoring \nprovisions, confidence-building measures, and the strengthened \nrelationship between two of the world's major powers.\n  We have not had inspectors at Russian nuclear facilities for 13 \nmonths. We have not had data exchanges on the size and deployment of \nRussian forces. Russia has had the freedom to block our national \ntechnical means to monitor their forces. Apart from our national \ntechnical means, we are now blind.\n  With this treaty, we will benefit from these measures and others. The \nSenate has discussed the monitoring and verification provisions at \nlength during this debate--in open and closed session--and it has been \nmade very clear that this treaty greatly strengthens our intelligence \ncommunity's ability to monitor and assess Russian strategic forces.\n  As Director of National Intelligence Clapper has said, the sooner we \nratify this treaty, the better. I am very pleased that the Senate is \nacting now, before the end of the year and the congressional session, \nto give the executive branch these tools.\n  With the ratification of this treaty, the Senate also makes clear \nthat the United States is willing and able to make good on its foreign \npolicy promises and to act in the best interests of our country and of \nthe world.\n  Following ratification in the Russian Duma, the United States and \nRussia will begin the next round of arms control and transparency.\n  I hope and I believe many Senators have expressed their desire, that \nthis will lead to further arms control negotiations to reduce further \nthe level of strategic arms and to address tactical nuclear weapons and \nother delivery mechanisms.\n  The ratification also maintains, and hopefully will build on, the \nimproving relationship between our two countries and our two young \nPresidents.\n  We have enjoyed strong cooperation this year, over Afghanistan, over \nIran, and--according to a letter I received from President Obama on \nMonday--over the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n  In a world of asymmetric threats, we need friends and allies more \nthan ever. This treaty moves us in this direction--with Russia and with \nthe Eastern European nations that are strongly in support of the \ntreaty.\n  Before closing, I want to congratulate and thank my good friend from \nMassachusetts. He has spent an incredible amount of time considering \nthis treaty in the Foreign Relations Committee, preparing the \nresolution of ratification and in managing this floor debate.\n  He has done a fabulous job, and I really want to thank him for all \nhis effort and his cooperation with me through this entire process.\n  I would also like to thank the many administration officials for \ntheir assistance in my consideration of this treaty, all of whom have \nspent time in my office over the past year. They include:\n       Assistant Secretary Rose Gottemoeller, our lead negotiator; \n     Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; \n     General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; \n     Tom D'Agostino, Administrator of the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration; and Director of National \n     Intelligence Jim Clapper.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today, the Senate has a historic \nopportunity to follow in a long history of strong, bipartisan support \nfor reducing the threat posed by nuclear weapons around the globe. We \nhave a chance to strengthen American national security and restore \nAmerican leadership on the nuclear agenda. I am hopeful that the Senate \nwill choose the right path and vote in favor of ratification of the New \nSTART treaty.\n  I want to thank Senators Kerry and Lugar for their tireless, \nimpressive work on the New START treaty.\n\n[[Page S10971]]\n\nFormer Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger, in explaining his \nsupport for the New START Treaty, told our committee earlier this year \nthat the Senate's decision on New START ``will affect the prospects for \npeace for a decade or more. It is, by definition, not a bipartisan, but \na nonpartisan, challenge.'' Senators Kerry and Lugar have done \neverything in their power to make this a nonpartisan effort, and I \ncommend them and their staff for their excellent work.\n  I want to also take a moment to thank the negotiators, Rose \nGottemoeller, Ted Warner, their colleagues at the White House, and all \nthe civil servants responsible for negotiating this agreement. Each of \nthem has a lifetime of experience and impressive expertise on nuclear \nissues, and they all worked hard to navigate this difficult treaty \nprocess. America was well-served by your efforts, and we thank you for \nyour leadership.\n  At the very beginning of this long process, Secretary of Defense \nRobert Gates asked the Senate a very important question: Is the United \nStates better off with an agreement or without it? Today, the Senate \nhas to answer this specific question.\n  We have had a very long, thorough, and vigorous debate, and some \nSenators may not agree with everything in the treaty text before us, \nand some may have problems with the process by which we are here today, \nbut let's be clear. The vote today is not about what each of us might \nhave done differently. The vote today is not about abstract numbers or \ntheoretical point scoring. The historic vote today is simple: Do you \nbelieve the United States and the world are better off with an \nagreement or without one?\n  The Senate--led in a bipartisan fashion by Senators Kerry and Lugar \nhas done an impressive job of meeting its constitutional \nresponsibilities, and I am proud of the work we have done in giving our \nadvice and consent to the New START treaty. The involvement of the \nSenate over the last year and a half and the debate we have undertaken \nhave been worthy of the world's greatest deliberative body.\n  I have heard from many of my colleagues that the Senate should not be \na rubber stamp in ratifying the New START Treaty--as if to suggest we \nhave not taken our constitutional responsibilities seriously during \nthis process. This could not be further from the truth.\n  First, the Senate's influence can be seen throughout the treaty \ndocument. A number of Senators met with negotiators numerous times \nprior to the treaty's completion, and some even traveled to Geneva \nduring the negotiations. In many respects, from the very beginning, our \nnegotiators were operating within a framework and boundaries as set by \nSenators involved in the process. The treaty itself is really a product \nof collective input from both the executive and congressional branches. \nThe unique insight and input this Congress has provided throughout the \nnegotiation process could not be replicated in any future \nconsideration.\n  In addition, since we received the treaty, the Senate has done its \njob and has thoroughly considered this agreement. The Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee held 12 hearings and heard testimony from 21 expert \nwitnesses. The administration has answered over 900 questions for the \nrecord. We have also had more floor time for amendments and \nconsideration than any other treaty of its kind. Our vigorous debate on \nthe floor has added nuance and depth to this already thorough body of \nwork.\n  It is also important to note that the Senate, in providing its advice \nand consent, actually writes and approves the resolution of \nratification to go along with the treaty. This is not an insignificant \ndocument. This is the Senate's opportunity to influence the treaty's \nfuture interpretation and implementation and our chance to provide the \ndeclarations, understandings, and conditions to the treaty. The \nresolution succinctly and explicitly expresses the Senate's views on \nNew START, and our resolution actually provides some strong statements \nwith respect to many of the concerns raised by critics of the treaty.\n  For example, on missile defense, the resolution reads very clearly \nthat the United States remains committed to missile defense, and the \nNew START treaty does not constrain that commitment:\n\n       The New START Treaty and the . . . unilateral statement of \n     the Russian Federation on missile defense do not limit in any \n     way, and shall not be interpreted as limiting, activities \n     that the U.S. currently plans or that might be required . . . \n     to protect U.S. Armed Forces and U.S. allies from limited \n     ballistic missile attack.\n\n  In addition, the DeMint amendment on missile defense in the \nresolution reads:\n\n       The United States is and will remain free to reduce the \n     vulnerability to attack by constructing a layered missile \n     defense capable of countering missiles of all ranges The \n     United States is committed to improving U.S. strategic \n     defensive capabilities both quantitatively . . . and \n     qualitatively and such improvements are consistent with the \n     Treaty.\n\n  On tactical nuclear weapons, the resolution reads:\n\n       The Senate calls upon the President to pursue . . . an \n     agreement with Russia that would address the disparity \n     between tactical nuclear weapons stockpiles . . . and would \n     secure and reduce tactical nuclear weapons in a verifiable \n     manner.\n\n  Finally, on strategic-range, nonnuclear weapon systems:\n\n       Nothing in the New START Treaty restricts U.S. research, \n     development, testing, and evaluation of strategic-range, non-\n     nuclear weapons . . . [or] prohibits deployments of \n     strategic-range, non-nuclear weapon systems.\n\n  The fact is that the Senate has done its constitutional duty and has \nthoroughly debated and considered this important agreement.\n  Adding to our extensive internal debate, countless outside experts \nand former officials have also weighed in on this treaty. New START has \nthe unanimous backing of our Nation's military and its leadership, \nincluding Secretary Gates, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the \ncommander of America's Strategic Command, and the Director of the \nMissile Defense Agency. America's military establishment is joined by \nthe support of every living Secretary of State--from Secretary Jim \nBaker to Secretary Condoleezza Rice--as well as five former Secretaries \nof Defense, nine former national security advisors, and former \nPresidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush. The overwhelming consensus \nfrom these foreign policy and national security heavyweights has been \nclear: New START is in America's national security interests.\n  I think it is important to take a step back and remember the broader \npicture of the decision before us today. We are no longer talking about \nabstract numbers, intangible ideas or questions of process. We are \ntalking about real nuclear weapons. We are talking about thousands of \nthe most dangerous weapons in the history of mankind--weapons actually \naimed directly at American cities.\n  Our arsenals are composed primarily of nuclear weapons each yielding \nbetween 100 and 1,200 kilotons of power. To give you a sense of the \npower of these weapons, the nuclear weapon dropped on Hiroshima yielded \naround 13 kilotons of power. After New START, the United States and \nRussia will still be allowed an arsenal of 1,550 warheads capable of \nleveling cities more than five times the size of New Hampshire's \nlargest city of Manchester.\n  Now, I am under no illusions that the ratification of the New START \ntreaty will somehow by itself meet the threats posed by nuclear weapons \naround the globe. President Kennedy told us that attainable peace will \nbe ``based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual \nevolution in human institutions'' and ``peace must be the product of \nmany nations, the sum of many acts.'' He said:\n\n       No treaty, however much it may be to the advantage of . . . \n     all can provide absolute security . . . But it can . . . \n     offer far more security and far fewer risks than an unabated, \n     uncontrolled, unpredictable arms race.\n\n  New START is a step away from this ``unabated, uncontrolled, \nunpredictable'' environment.\n  As the first Nation to invent and then use nuclear weapons, the \nUnited States has spent the majority of the last half century trying to \nreduce the risk they pose. Over five decades ago, President Eisenhower \ncommitted the United States to meeting its special responsibilities on \nthe nuclear threat. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S10972]]\n\n\n       The United States pledges before you--and therefore before \n     the world--its determination to help solve the fearful atomic \n     dilemma--to devote its entire heart and mind to find the way \n     by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be \n     dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.\n\n  Eisenhower's early commitment and America's special responsibility \nhave led to unbroken U.S. leadership in the world on the nuclear \nagenda. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--the cornerstone of global \nnonproliferation efforts--was born out of President Eisenhower's \n``Atoms for Peace'' vision. The original START treaty was a culmination \nof President Reagan's entreaty to ``trust, but verify'' Russia and its \nactions. The U.S. Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which has led \nto the deactivation of over 7,500 Russian nuclear warheads, was the \nresult of two visionary and farsighted Senators named Nunn and Lugar.\n  American leadership on the nuclear agenda makes the world safer. \nPeriod.\n  As Secretaries Kissinger, Schultz, Perry, and Senator Nunn told us in \ntheir seminal 2007 opinion piece:\n\n       The world is now on the precipice of a new and dangerous \n     nuclear era . . . Nuclear weapons today present tremendous \n     dangers but also a historic opportunity. U.S. leadership will \n     be required to take the world to the next stage--to a solid \n     consensus for reversing reliance on nuclear weapons globally \n     as a vital contribution to preventing their proliferation \n     into potentially dangerous hands.\n\n  The New START treaty should be the next step on the path of American \nleadership on the nuclear agenda. If we turn our back on this treaty at \nthis time, we are turning our back on a generation of bipartisan, \nAmerican leadership in this field, and we cede the field to a more \ndangerous and more uncertain world.\n  The debate over New START is now over, and the only choice left \nbefore us is this treaty or nothing. Each of us today will decide--yes \nor no--whether we think we are better off with a treaty or without one.\n  I hope we will vote on the side of the overwhelming majority of \nforeign policy and national security experts who have called on us to \nsupport this treaty. I hope we will vote on the side of our unanimous \nmilitary and intelligence communities. I hope we will vote on the side \nof a legacy of American leadership on the nuclear agenda.\n  I am hopeful we will follow in the footsteps of the Senate's strong \nbipartisan history and ratify the New START treaty today.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to support ratification of \nthe New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START. This treaty \ncontinues the bipartisan arms control framework first proposed by \nPresident Ronald Reagan and implemented by President George H.W. Bush \nwith the START I and START II treaties. President George W. Bush \ncontinued this work with the Moscow Treaty. Now President Obama has \ntaken another important step to address the dangers of nuclear weapons \nwith the New START treaty.\n  Stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and reducing existing nuclear \nstockpiles is critical to our national security. New START helps \naccomplish this goal by placing responsible limits on nuclear warheads \nand delivery vehicles, while still enabling the United States to \nmaintain a credible nuclear deterrent.\n  New START also reestablishes regular onsite inspections of Russian \nnuclear facilities, which ended more than a year ago when the previous \nSTART treaty expired. The potential lack of safety, security, and \ncontrols of Russian nuclear weapons is a grave security risk, and there \nis no substitute for onsite inspections to address this threat.\n  I carefully considered the views of our military and diplomatic \nleaders in evaluating New START, and I am impressed by the breadth of \nbipartisan support for this treaty. The Secretaries of State, Defense, \nand Energy support New START. Our senior uniformed military leaders \nsupport New START, including the head of the Missile Defense Agency. \nEvery living former Secretary of State, Republican or Democrat, \nsupports New START.\n  I commend my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for \nthe extensive work they have done to consider the New START treaty. \nThey have produced a thorough record on the merits of this treaty, \nwhich enables every Senator to cast an informed vote. After reviewing \nthis record, I am proud to cast my vote in favor of ratifying New \nSTART.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, before I begin my remarks on the New \nSTART treaty, I would like to point out to my colleagues that in 2002, \nI voted in favor of the Moscow Treaty. I was also one of 93 Senators \nwho voted in favor of START I in 1992.\n  I recognize the importance of maintaining a positive and cooperative \nrelationship with Russia. The proponents of the New START treaty argue \nthat this treaty is necessary to continue the goodwill between our \ncountries and the much-touted ``reset'' in our relations. More \nimportantly to me, however, are the merits of the treaty itself. The \nSenate should not simply ratify this treaty to appease Russia or as a \nsignal of cooperation with them. The treaty should be considered based \non its impact on our national security and the security of our allies.\n  A nuclear arms control treaty can be evaluated based on the level of \nparity it brings to the two parties. In this regard, I believe this \ntreaty falls short. The fact is, while this treaty places new limits on \nwarheads, as well as deployed and nondeployed delivery vehicles, Russia \nis already below the limit on delivery vehicles. The treaty primarily \nimposes new limits on the U.S., while requiring modest, if any, \nreductions on the Russian side. Also alarming is that this treaty is \nsilent on the matter of tactical nuclear weapons. It is believed that \nRussia has a 10-to-1 advantage over the U.S. in terms of tactical \nnuclear weapons.\n  The administration has argued that this treaty is necessary to \nprovide strategic stability. However, if we are reducing our strategic \nweapons without regard to Russia's overwhelming advantage on tactical \nnuclear weapons, I question whether this reduction isn't weakening \nstrategic stability. It should also be mentioned that some proponents \nof the New START treaty were critical of the 2002 Moscow Treaty for \nfailing to reduce Russian tactical nuclear weapons. I believe our \nleverage with the Russians to begin placing meaningful limits on \ntactical nuclear weapons existed with this treaty. Now, I see no clear \npath to negotiating reductions in tactical nuclear weapons.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I have serious concerns about the \ninclusion of references to and limitations on U.S. plans for missile \ndefense. I don't believe there should be a connection between strategic \nnuclear weapons reductions and our plans for missile defense. I am \nequally troubled that Russia issued a unilateral statement at the \ntreaty's signing stating that the treaty ``may be effective and viable \nonly in conditions where there is no qualitative or quantitative build-\nup in the missile defense system capabilities of the United States of \nAmerica.''\n  It is positive that the Resolution of Ratification makes a strong \nstatement that the treaty does not limit the deployment of U.S. missile \ndefense systems, other than those contained in article V. It also says \nthat the Russian statement on missile defense does not impose a legal \nobligation on the United States. While I would have preferred that this \ntreaty not contain any language on missile defense, I appreciate the \nwork of the Foreign Relations chairman and ranking member to include \nthis language in the ratification resolution. But the fact remains, \nthis language is simply our opinion and is nonbinding.\n  This treaty reverses the gains made in the Moscow Treaty which de-\nlinked offensive and defensive capabilities. Although a modified \namendment on missile defense to the resolution of ratification was \nagreed to today, I am disappointed that the Senate could not agree to \nthe amendment offered by Senator McCain which would have stricken the \nlanguage in the treaty's preamble that arguably gives Russia a say on \nour future missile defense plans.\n  Finally, I also share the serious concerns related to the issue of \nverification. It has been the subject of much debate, and deservedly \nso. I agree with the sentiment that as our deployed strategic nuclear \nweapons are reduced, it becomes more and more critical that the \nremaining weapons can be relied upon. As the number of weapons is \nreduced, it becomes more important that we know that the Russians are \nabiding by the limits of the treaty.\n\n[[Page S10973]]\n\n  After reviewing the classified material presented by Senator Bond, \nranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have serious \nreservations about the new verification regime contained in the treaty. \nAlthough former Secretary of State James Baker supports ratification of \nthe treaty, he stated that the verification mechanism in the New START \ntreaty ``does not appear as rigorous or extensive as the one that \nverified the numerous and diverse treaty obligations and prohibitions \nunder START I.''\n  I do regret that without a treaty in place that there is no \nverification regime, and no U.S. inspectors monitoring Russia's nuclear \narms activities. It's important to point out, however, that the Obama \nadministration had the ability to extend the verification regime for 5 \nyears, as provided for in START I. But the Obama administration failed \nto act. The administration also insisted there would be a ``bridging \nagreement'' to continue verification until the entry into force of a \nsuccessor agreement. This agreement was never completed either.\n  I am deeply disappointed that in these areas of concern, the Senate \nis simply being asked to be a ``rubberstamp'' rather than fulfill our \nconstitutional obligation to provide our advice on these important \nmatters. Had the advice of the Senate on these important issues been \nincorporated into the treaty, I believe it would have gained \noverwhelming bipartisan support. Without addressing these areas in a \nmeaningful way, I am reluctantly unable to support it.\n  Mr. COONS. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nvoicing my strong and unequivocal support for New START. I want to \nthank Senators Kerry and Lugar for their leadership on this issue, and \njoin them in urging the Senate to support ratification. New START will \nmake America stronger and more secure by building on 30 years of U.S. \nglobal leadership on nuclear arms control and reduction. This is why it \nhas been endorsed by national security leaders on both sides of the \naisle, including every living Republican Secretary of State, 5 former \nSecretaries of Defense, 7 former commanders of the U.S. Strategic \nCommand, the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff, 3 former Presidents, and all \n27 of our NATO allies.\n  We simply cannot afford to postpone the vote until the 112th Congress \nand delay ratification any further. Military planners have confirmed \nthat ratification is essential to U.S. security in an increasingly \ndangerous environment, and 73 percent of Americans support ratification \naccording to one recent poll.\n  As the newest member of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services \nCommittees, I did not have the luxury of receiving the wealth of \ninformation and perspective offered in the 18 public hearings and \nSenate deliberations on this issue. I have, however, received enough \ninformation from classified briefings to know this is a pressing \nnational security matter of the highest order. As we approach a vote, I \nplan on following the strong advice of our military and national \nsecurity leadership, as well as the will of the American people, in \nsupporting New START.\n  New START will enhance U.S. intelligence gathering and restore \ninspections needed to monitor the Russian nuclear force. For more than \na year, we have been deprived of such inspections due the expiration of \nthe original treaty. While opponents of New START have highlighted the \nreduction in the total number of inspections, those which remain \ncomprise the most robust strategic arms inspections regime in history. \nBy increasing transparency between the United States and Russia, New \nSTART will enhance our mutual nuclear deterrent. This is just one \nexample of why ratification is in America's best security interest.\n  In addition to reducing the total number of both American and Russian \ndeployed strategic nuclear weapons to 1550, New START will limit the \nnumber of deployed delivery vehicles for nuclear warheads to 700. As we \nconsider investing more than $85 billion over the next decade into \nmodernizing our current nuclear arsenal, we must also consider the \npractical benefit of maintaining a smaller number of strategic nuclear \nweapons. These limits have been endorsed by our military planners \nbecause they are commensurate with our current and future defense \nneeds. Moreover, reducing the number of deployed strategic warheads and \ndelivery vehicles better positions us to invest the savings in nuclear \nmodernization.\n  The United States and Russia share common threats and common \ninterests, and, in the words of Vice President Biden, New START is a \n``cornerstone of our efforts to reset relations with Russia.'' Over the \npast 2 years, cooperation between the United States and Russia has \ngrown in areas such as supporting sanctions to thwart Iran's nuclear \ndevelopment and transferring essential supplies into Afghanistan. At \nthis juncture, the Senate's failure to ratify New START could have far-\nreaching implications on such progress, including jeopardizing future \ncooperation in these critical areas.\n  As some of my colleagues propose altering the treaty, I want to voice \nmy strong opposition to all amendments, as they would effectively kill \nthe agreement by requiring renegotiation with Russia. In the future, we \ncan address some of the issues raised during the amendment process--\nincluding Russia's extensive stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons--but \nthese matters exceed the breadth of the treaty before us today. I also \nbelieve that we can achieve a missile defense cooperation agreement \nwith Russia, but reaching an understanding on missile defense will be \neasier once we have established an agreed-upon limit to the number of \ndeployed strategic nuclear weapons.\n  America must maintain its global leadership on nuclear arms control \nand nonproliferation, and it is our obligation as Senators to act now. \nIt is time to look beyond politics and vote on principle, and I urge \nall Senators to join me in supporting ratification of New START because \nit is a domestic and global security imperative.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New START, which was \nsigned by the United States and Russia on April 8 and transmitted for \nthe advice and consent of the Senate on May 13. Since then, Chairman \nKerry, with the unwavering support of Ranking Member Lugar, has \nnavigated the treaty through 18 hearings before the Senate Foreign \nRelations, Armed Services, and Intelligence Committees--and I commend \nthe chairman for his determination to see this paramount accomplishment \nthrough to the finish.\n  Without equivocation, since his election to the U.S. Senate in 1976, \nRanking Member Lugar has been an overriding force of nature in reducing \nthe threat of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons--and his work \nwith then-Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn to lay the groundwork \nfor the deactivation of more than 7,500 of these dangerous weapons in \nthe former Soviet Union is legendary. Throughout the negotiations and \nconsideration of New START, Ranking Member Lugar has once again \ndemonstrated his incredible depth of knowledge and expertise on these \nissues, which has been of the utmost benefit to the Senate.\n  President George H.W. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed \nthe original START Treaty on July 31, 1991--5 months before the \ncollapse of the Soviet Union. The agreement represented the culmination \nof more than 20 years of bilateral arms control agreements between our \ntwo nations.\n  Much has changed over what is almost two decades since the original \nSTART agreement was signed in Moscow. The world has witnessed the \ndisintegration of the Soviet Union, the rise of terrorist organizations \nwith nuclear weapons ambitions, and growing threats from hostile \nregimes in such locations as Tehran and Pyongyang. As a result, when \nSTART expired 1 year ago this month, we found ourselves at a \ncrossroads--without the ability to inspect Russian missile silos, \nwhich, frankly, is unfortunate given that last year Senator Lugar \nsuggested that the administration obtain a short-term ``bridging \nagreement'' with the Russians to ensure there was not a verification \ngap between the expiration of START and approval of New START.\n  Yet despite this missed opportunity to secure a short-term bridging \nagreement, I believe the debate we have had in this body over the last \n12 months has made clear that it is in our vital national interests to, \nfirst and foremost, maintain strategic stability between the United \nStates and Russia--\n\n[[Page S10974]]\n\nthe two countries that hold more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear \nweapons--and furthermore to upgrade the original START agreement to \nreflect the new realities of the post-Cold War era.\n  On the first point, I have supported New START's goal of reinstating \na more stable, transparent, and legally binding mechanism based on \nproven methods for monitoring compliance with treaty provisions and \ndeterring potential violations. For example, New START requires \nessential data exchanges detailing the numbers, types, and locations of \naffected weapons, mandates up to 18 short-notice on-site inspections \neach year to try and confirm information shared during such exchanges, \nand it calls for the parties to notify each other and to update the \ndatabase whenever they move such forces between facilities.\n  Since the early years of nuclear weapons agreements between the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union, beginning with Strategic Arms \nLimitation Talks, known as SALT, in May 1972; to the Intermediate-Range \nNuclear Forces, or INF Treaty, in December 1987 and the original START \nagreement in July 1991; our nations have gained from the structure and \ndegree of transparency that these agreements provide. As former \nNational Security Advisor and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said \nin May, New START is ``an evolution of treaties that have been \nnegotiated in previous administrations of both parties'' and ``its \nprincipal provisions are an elaboration'' of existing agreements. \nSecretary Kissinger went on to note that the continued absence of this \nvital agreement would undoubtedly ``create an element of uncertainty in \nthe calculations of both adversaries and allies'' and have an \n``unsettling impact on the international environment.''\n  In other words, without the comprehensive and overlapping system of \ninspections, notifications, and data exchanges that both the original \nSTART and New START provide, our strategic commanders and civilian \nleaders may be forced to position their assets in a way that \nanticipates the worst case scenario, which as we witnessed during many \noverwrought days of the Cold War is an incredibly precarious--and often \nmore costly--approach in terms of the prioritization of our \nintelligence and defense resources. Therefore, I believe firmly that, \nwhen combined with our Nation's overhead intelligence assets, remote \nsensing equipment, and other classified methods, the New START \nagreement will provide our government better insight into the accuracy \nof Russia's declarations on the numbers and types of deployed and \nnondeployed strategic offensive arms subject to the treaty, thereby \nengendering greater confidence in our comprehension of the state of \naffairs, enhancing global stability and our security here at home.\n  Still, in addition to maintaining the framework of our nuclear arms \nreduction program with Russia, it is crucial that this treaty be \nthoroughly vetted to reflect the reality of the threats we face in the \n21st century. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution states that the \nPresident ``shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present \nconcur''--and as such we must make absolutely certain that questions \nregarding our ability to verify Russian compliance with New START's \nlimits, to develop and deploy effective missile defenses, and to \nmodernize our nuclear weapons complex, have been satisfactorily \nresolved. Senator Kyl, in particular, has brought great value to this \nprocess--and I extol all of my colleagues for their dedication to \nmeeting our constitutional responsibilities.\n  Among the most significant questions that have been raised are those \nthat deal with our ability to monitor Russian compliance with the \ntreaty's limits. As part of its overlapping monitoring and verification \nregimes, New START permits up to 18 short-notice on-site inspections at \nICBM bases, submarine bases, and air bases each year. U.S. inspectors \nwill use these inspections to help verify data on the number of \nwarheads located on deployed ICBMs and deployed submarine launched \nballistic missiles and the number of armaments located on deployed \nheavy bombers.\n  Over the course of this debate, some of my colleagues have questioned \nthe utility and effectiveness of New START's on-site inspections. As a \nmember of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have worked \nwith my colleagues to scrutinize this proposed agreement and have \nclosely reviewed the National Intelligence Estimate pertaining to this \nsubject as well as a number of other classified reports. It is \nimportant to understand that we do not depend only on the treaty's \nmonitoring and verification provisions to ensure the Russians are \ncomplying with the warhead limit and other clauses. To the contrary, \nthe treaty is but one critical instrument which, as with the 1991 START \nagreement, is intended to augment information collected through our \noverhead assets, and via other technical tools that leverage the larger \nU.S. Intelligence system--known as our National Technical Means.\n\n  Since the treaty was transmitted to the Senate in May, the \nIntelligence Committee has conducted a comprehensive review, and my \nstaff and I have questioned key officials, including the Director of \nNational Intelligence Jim Clapper, former Secretary of Defense Bill \nCohen, and Secretary Gates' Representative to Post-START Negotiations \nDr. Ted Warner. Additionally, my staff has held classified discussions \nwith former START inspection team members and delegates to the START \nJoint Compliance and Inspection Commission.\n  Consequently, I would underscore two significant areas of advancement \nwhere New START's verification and monitoring provisions will be \ndistinctly different from its predecessor. First, under the original \nSTART agreement, the treaty database listed the number of warheads \nattributed to a type of ballistic missile, and each missile of that \ntype counted as the same number of warheads. Notably, New START \nadvances this standard by enabling our inspectors to in fact count the \nactual number of reentry vehicles deployed on the missile to confirm \nthat it equals the number designated by the Russians for that \nparticular weapon.\n  Secondly, New START includes the innovation that unique identifiers--\nwhich mean numeric codes--be affixed to all Russian missiles and \nnuclear-capable heavy bombers. Under the original START agreement, \nunique identifiers were applied only to Russian road-mobile missiles. \nAs Ranking Member Lugar has noted, while this does not insure a \n``foolproof'' verification system, it will provide enhanced confidence \nand transparency under the Treaty structure.\n  Taken as a whole, I believe the treaty's notification requirements, \nthe use of unique identifiers on each ICBM, submarine launched \nballistic missile, and heavy bomber, and the 18 annual short-notice on-\nsite inspections, combined with our National Technical Means, will \nfurther our critical national security objectives by helping us observe \nand evaluate Russian activities--an objective that is fundamental to \nour strategic stability.\n  Additionally, when it comes to our ballistic missile defense \ncapabilities, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote on \nDecember 7 that ``The Russians need to understand that the U.S. will \nuse the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our \nability to intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile \ncountries.'' In an effort to make certain that our intentions are \nunambiguous, the U.S. issued a unilateral statement at the signing of \nNew START, which affirms that our government ``intends to continue \nimproving and deploying its missile defense systems in order to defend \nitself against limited attack and as part of our collaborative approach \nto strengthening stability in key regions.''\n  Furthermore, Ranking Member Lugar also worked to ensure that the \nResolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification that was approved by \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 16 addresses this \nquestion by declaring that ``it is the policy of the United States to \ndeploy as soon as technically possible an effective National Missile \nDefense system'' and that nothing in the Treaty limits ``further \nplanned enhancements'' to missile defense programs. President Obama, \nSecretary Clinton, and Secretary Gates have reaffirmed this commitment \nand the Administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Review, released in \nFebruary, outlines a detailed plan to continue to\n\n[[Page S10975]]\n\nexpand international missile defense efforts to defend the United \nStates, our deployed forces, and our allies and partners around the \nworld.\n  It is also important for the record to reflect that Russia issued a \nsimilar statement when the original START was signed in 1991, saying \nthat the treaty would be viable only under conditions of compliance \nwith the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which at the time restricted \nballistic missile defenses. History clearly shows that following \nratification of START the United States did not restrain its missile \ndefense programs or reduce its expenditures on ballistic missile \ndefenses in an effort to ensure that Russia remained committed to the \noriginal START Treaty. To the contrary, U.S. spending on ballistic \nmissile defense programs increased dramatically following the signing \nof the original START agreement--from less than $4 billion for \nDepartment of Defense-wide ballistic missile defense funding support in \n1991 to nearly $10 billion this year. Moreover, in spite of this threat \nin 1991, Russia remained a party to START and continued to negotiate \nfurther reductions on strategic offensive weapons after the U.S. \nwithdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002.\n\n  Still, despite this precedent and Ranking Member Lugar's considerable \nefforts to make certain that the resolution addresses the issue of \nmissile defense, questions have been raised about potential \nrestrictions on our ability to deploy effective missile defenses, and \nsome of my colleagues have rightly criticized the preamble's \nrecognition of an ``interrelationship between strategic offensive arms \nand strategic defensive arms.'' It has been argued--and I agree--that \nthis language, when combined with Russia's unilateral statement \nasserting its concern about a United States ``build-up'' in missile \ndefense system capabilities, needlessly gives Russia a leverage point \nwith which to attempt to compel our government to pull back from our \nmissile defense objectives by threatening to withdraw from the Treaty \nif we seek to increase our capabilities. As a result, I supported \nSenator McCain's effort to amend the Treaty to strike any reference to \nthe ``interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic \ndefensive arms.''\n  Finally, when it comes to the modernization of our nuclear forces, \nmeaningful concerns have been raised about the deplorable state of our \ndeteriorating Manhattan Project-era nuclear laboratories and weapons \nstockpiles. Senators Kyl and Corker should be commended for their \ndiligence in shedding light on the undeniable truth that these \nfacilities are sorely out-dated, and continue to erode as safety and \nsecurity costs have grown exponentially, maintenance is deferred, and \nlayoffs and hiring freezes deprive our government of highly skilled \nscientists and technicians needed to maintain our nuclear deterrent.\n  Credible modernization plans and long-term funding for the U.S. \nnuclear weapons stockpile and the infrastructure that supports it are \ncentral to the effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent, and we have \nposed serious questions about the veracity of the administration's \nmodernization report that was submitted to Congress with the New START \nagreement on May 13th, pursuant to section 1251 of the fiscal year 2010 \nDefense Authorization Act. Specifically, we have sought greater detail \nand assurances regarding the administration's plans to retool and \nsustain our national weapons labs--including construction of the \nvitally important plutonium processing facility, known as the Chemistry \nand Metallurgy Research Replacement nuclear facility, in Los Alamos, \nNM, and the Uranium Processing Facility at Oak Ridge, TN. These two \nprojects are essential for meeting our life extension program \nrequirements for existing warheads and certifying the safety and \nreadiness of the current stockpile.\n  On November 17, due in large part to the unyielding persistence of \nSenators Kyl and Corker, the administration released an updated 1251 \nmodernization report that directly answered many of our concerns and \nelaborated on our modernization objectives by providing more detailed \n10-year timelines and specific budget projections to sustain funding \nfor stockpile surveillance at over $200 million over the next 10 years, \nand cost estimates for the plutonium and uranium processing facilities \nat upwards of $5.8 billion and $6.5 billion respectively. In total, the \nadministration has now committed more than $85 billion to modernize our \nnuclear weapons complex over the next 10 years--$15 billion more than \ninitially proposed by the administration--and I am confident this \nundertaking will ensure continued support for these indispensable \nactivities.\n  It is now the responsibility of President Obama and his \nadministration to, in the months ahead, communicate even more specific \ndetails regarding any lingering concerns about our Nation's long-term \nmodernization programs. The Resolution of Advice and Consent, which is \ncurrently before the Senate, includes strong language requiring direct \nnotification to Congress if at any moment more resources are required--\nor if appropriations are enacted that fail to meet our modernization \nneeds--and we as a body must hold this government true to these \ncommitments.\n  In summary, the original START agreement was signed over 19 years \nago, at a time when we still lived in a decidedly bipolar, and some \nmight argue less complicated world. But with the fall of the Soviet \nUnion and the end of the Cold War, we are now facing new threats from \nvolatile governments intent on the proliferation of dangerous weapons, \nand decentralized terrorist groups focused on launching attacks more \ndevastating even than 9/11.\n  Confronted with these daunting challenges, America must be prepared \nto defend our homeland, our forces in theatre, and our allies--and I \nbelieve this treaty allows future administrations to meet this \nresponsibility, to maintain a safe and effective deterrent, and at the \nsame time to continue to reduce the number of deployed and ready to \nlaunch long-range nuclear weapons. And as former Secretary of State \nJames Baker noted in May, a more stable and cooperative relationship \nbetween Washington and Moscow ``will be vital if the two countries are \nto cooperate in order to stem nuclear proliferation in countries like \nIran and North Korea.'' Simply put, the ratification of New START, and \nthe cooperation and transparency it requires, has the potential to set \nthe stage for expanded NATO and Russian collaboration when it comes to \nconfronting terrorists and other dangerous proliferators--so together \nwe may face those who threaten stability in the post-Cold War world.\n  Mr. President, the New START treaty has the unanimous support of our \nNation's military and diplomatic leadership, Director of National \nIntelligence Jim Clapper, and the endorsement of President George H.W. \nBush and prominent former national security officials such as Secretary \nof Defense Bill Cohen, and every living Secretary of State--including \nColin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. As a member of the Senate \nIntelligence Committee, I am convinced that this agreement, when \ncombined with our intelligence assets, will enhance global stability, \nand most importantly, our national security. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting the Resolution of Advice and Consent to \nRatification.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we cannot end this historic session of \nCongress without taking one more important step to protect the national \nsecurity of the United States. It is time for the Senate to ratify the \nNew START treaty.\n  This treaty will secure nuclear stockpiles. It will take nearly 1,500 \nAmerican and Russian nuclear weapons out of commission. These are \nweapons that, as we speak, are trained on cities like Washington and \nMoscow, St. Louis and St. Petersburg.\n  More than a year has passed since American inspectors were on the \nground monitoring the Russian nuclear weapons arsenal. The sooner we \nratify this treaty, the sooner we can re-open the window into exactly \nwhat the Russians are, or are not, doing.\n  START will also preserve a strong American nuclear arsenal. Our \nmilitary leaders have analyzed the treaty and determined the number of \nnuclear weapons we need to retain in order to keep us safe here at \nhome. The director of the Missile Defense Agency has said the treaty \nwill not restrain or limit our missile-defense capacity.\n  America and Russia control more than 90 percent of the world's \nnuclear weapons. The transparency this treaty\n\n[[Page S10976]]\n\nwill provide is critical not just to our two countries but the entire \nplanet.\n  By ratifying the START treaty, we will also increase our ability to \nwork with other countries to reduce nuclear weapons around the world, \nand to make sure that those weapons are kept safe and secure. We need \nto work together with Russia to stop the most dangerous nuclear \nthreats, including those from Iran and North Korea.\n  One of the greatest and gravest threats we face is the specter of a \nterrorist getting his hands on a nuclear weapon. We have faced nuclear \nthreats before--but such a threat from a superpower is much different \nthan one from a terrorist.\n  A nuclear-armed terrorist would not be constrained by doctrines of \ndeterrence or mutually assured destruction. Instead, rogue groups could \nattack and destroy one of our cities--and millions of our people--\nwithout warning. By ratifying the New START treaty, we can help make \nsure this kind of unprecedented tragedy never happens\n  We have had a positive, bipartisan process up to this point. That \nshould continue today.\n  The Senate Foreign Relations Committee overwhelmingly approved the \ntreaty with a bipartisan vote of 14-4.\n  Our Nation's military leadership unanimously supports it. Secretary \nof Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ADM \nMichael Mullen testified before the Senate and urged us to ratify it.\n  Secretaries of State from the last five Republican Presidents support \nthe treaty because they know--in their words--``The world is safer \ntoday because of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of \nnuclear weapons.''\n  And an all-star team of Republican and Democratic national security \nleaders support the treaty, including former President George H.W. \nBush, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, Brent Scowcroft, James \nSchlesinger, Stephen Hadley, Senator Sam Nunn, and Senator John Warner.\n  Republicans have been included and instrumental from the beginning. \nAt Senator Kerry's urging, the resolution was crafted by Senator Lugar \nto reflect the views of our Republican colleagues. The Foreign \nRelations Committee then adopted additional Republican amendments in \nits mark-up. And we have adopted four additional amendments on the \nfloor.\n  Senator Kyl raised legitimate concerns about the state of our nuclear \nweapons complex, and the White House responded with an $85 billion \ncommitment to upgrade it over the next 10 years.\n  We have spent 8 days debating this treaty on the floor--that is \nlonger than we spent on the original START--in a bipartisan and \nproductive debate. I want to thank Chairman Kerry and Senator Lugar for \ntheir tireless leadership on this treaty and thank Senators on both \nside of the aisle who have worked hard to get this treaty completed.\n  For many Nevadans, the sights and sounds of a nuclear attack are \nfamiliar. Deep in our desert sits the Nevada National Security Site, \nwhich until this summer was called the Nevada Test Site.\n  Today the site is the center of our fight against terrorism and \nnuclear smuggling. It is on the front lines of our intelligence, arms \ncontrol and nonproliferation efforts.\n  But the site was once a critical battlefield of the Cold War, and for \ndecades it served as our Nation's nuclear proving ground. A lot of \nNevadans grew up with mushroom clouds in our backyard. We want to make \nsure the tests that took place in the Nevada desert are the closest we \ncome to a nuclear explosion.\n  Today we can do that. We can continue our institution's long history \nof bipartisan support for arms control. We can take 1,500 nuclear \nweapons off their launch pads. And we can make the future far safer for \nAmerica and the world.\n  This is not just a narrow Senate debate. It isn't just a local issue. \nAnd it isn't something that can wait another day. The whole world is \nwatching and waiting for us to act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me thank my colleagues for working hard \nto get this treaty passed and for being able to achieve that as well, \npeople within the administration. I appreciate the cooperation some of \nus have had with the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nranking member and others who have worked hard to try to complete, in a \nvery short period of time, what probably should have taken a lot longer \nperiod of time. But I appreciate their efforts to work with us in that \nregard.\n  I would like to, briefly, speak to three things: the process, the \nproblems, and some positive results of the consideration of this \ntreaty.\n  For those who are watching, I can tell you right now there is only \none thing on the mind of everybody in this Chamber: How quickly are we \ngoing to get out of here. One colleague said: I have a plane to catch. \nHow long are you going to talk? Will I be able to catch it?\n  That is understandable because every one of us wants to get home to \nour families. I know there were some snide comments expressed about my \nconcern a week or so ago about the fact we were going to be into \nChristmas week. But now the reality is everybody wants to get out of \nhere immediately so cut short your comments, put them in the Record, \nand so on.\n  When I predicted a couple weeks ago that I didn't think we had time \nto do everything the majority leader wanted to do and do it well, I had \nno idea how many things would be added to the agenda and how difficult \nthat would be. Unfortunately, I think my prediction turned out to be \ncorrect.\n  I remember just 1 year ago when we were on the Senate floor doing the \nhealth care bill, one of the primary criticisms of it was the way it \nwas done. I must tell you, with regard to the process of this bill, I \nam concerned about the precedent we are setting in the Senate, taking a \nlameduck session to jam so many things through, frequently without an \nopportunity to provide amendments or, when there are amendments, to \nsimply have them all shot down without, I believe, adequate \nconsideration.\n  We have done the tax legislation, the continuing resolution to fund \nthe Government, the DOD authorization bill, the DREAM Act, don't ask, \ndon't tell, the 9/11 bill is on the way, some judges, we passed a food \nsafety bill almost in the middle of the night by unanimous consent \nwithout Members being adequately notified, and now the START treaty. In \nmany of those situations, there was not adequate time--as I said, no \namendments even allowed.\n  When cloture was filed, I expressed concern we had only dealt with, I \nbelieve at that time, four amendments to the treaty itself. But we were \ntold: Don't worry. We will still give you consent to do resolution-of-\nratification amendments.\n  Unfortunately, not all of them were permitted by the majority and, in \norder to get as many as possible together, we had to consolidate 70 or \nso amendments down to a very few.\n  The other side announced at the beginning of the debate there would \nbe no amendments on the treaty itself or the preamble. It turned out \nthe amendments that were offered were all defeated, but we did have \nsome amendments on the resolution of ratification. They, too, would \nhave all been defeated or were defeated, except for the fact that we \nwere willing to water them down and, therefore, had them accepted by \nthe majority.\n  Now we have very little time to make closing statements because we \nare going to adjourn sine die, meaning this is the end of the Congress. \nWe will not have time to actually prepare written statements for the \nRecord. This is a very brief statement to discuss primarily some \npositive things because there is not time to lay out all the problems \nthat I think those of us who oppose the treaty still believe are \npresent in the treaty.\n  I agree with the comments the newest Member of the Senate, Mark Kirk, \nmade just a moment ago. He is very well schooled in these issues, \nthough a new Member of the Senate. I associate myself with a lot of the \nremarks he made. I think later, when we come back next year, we can \nchronicle the things that were said in the debates and have a pretty \ngood record of how it all ended. But I fear more for the process \nbecause of the precedent set that serious matters, such as the ones we \nhave debated and dealt with, including the treaty, were done in, to \nsome extent, a slipshod way, to some extent in\n\n[[Page S10977]]\n\nwhich there was not adequate time to do what the Senate should have \ndone.\n  I also fear for the precedent set with respect to treaty \nratification. Essentially, on many of the issues that were raised--and \nI appreciate, I must say, colleagues have been kind to me in their \ncompliments. I appreciate that very much. They were complimentary to me \nand my colleagues in saying we were raising important issues that \nneeded to be vetted, but in each case this was not the time to do it, \nthis was not the place to do it because if we dare change one comma in \nthis treaty, it would require that it be renegotiated. There were some \nunspecified horrible results of the fact that we would have to \nrenegotiate the treaty because the Russians wouldn't like what we did.\n  The precedent we are establishing is that the Senate is a \nrubberstamp. Whatever a President negotiates with the Russians or \nsomebody else, we dare not change because otherwise it will have to be \nrenegotiated, to some great detriment to humanity, and I don't think \nthat is appropriate. I think our Founders, when they wrote into the \nConstitution an equal role for the Senate and the President, they meant \nit. That role is advice and consent. We gave some advice in the last \nDefense authorization bill. We said, for example, don't negotiate \nconventional Prompt Global Strike limitations and don't allow \nlimitations on missile defense. Both those things were done against our \nadvice. But we are being asked to consent notwithstanding.\n  It seems to me, if the Senate is to have a role in the future on \nthese kinds of treaties, we better come to an understanding if we are \ngoing to be able to make some changes. I don't think anybody ever said \nthe administration ever got anything 100 percent right. We ought to be \nable to make some changes or else we might as well avoid the process \naltogether because it is just a big waste of time. Eleven years ago \nwhen we considered the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and rejected that \ntreaty, a lot of commentators said the Senate had finally put its mark \non the process by conclusively demonstrating it would not be a \nrubberstamp and that would be a new era for the administration in the \nfuture, having to pay some attention to what the Senate said. I hope \nthis new START treaty is an aberration, rather than the beginning of a \nnew precedent.\n  I will just tell you this. If the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is \nbrought forward again, there will be a different process. Rather than \nthe situation which obtained here, in which I did not urge a single \ncolleague to oppose this treaty until the time that cloture was filed \non it, I will urge every one of my colleagues to oppose reconsideration \nof the CTB.\n  So the process is not good. I have to hope that the result of the way \nwe handled it this year will not establish a new precedent. The \nproblems of the treaty I wish to discuss in detail, but because my \ncolleagues want to catch airplanes, I will not.\n  Let me focus then on the third and last element here, which is, some \nnew things we learned from this treaty, and, frankly, some achievements \nthat were obtained as a result of a lot of attention to it--being paid \nto it by our colleagues, a lot of great debate, particularly with \nrespect to missile defense, modernization, and future arms control \nagenda.\n  One of the things I think we have made some progress on is that this \nmay be the last arms control agreement for a while. Maybe we can get \nback to focusing on the real issues, issues of proliferation, of \nterrorism dealing with threats from countries such as North Korea and \nIran.\n  It is fine to have yet another Cold War era type agreement with \nRussia. But the real issue is not between Russia and the United States, \nit is dealing with these other threats. So I suggest we move away from \nthe distraction of agreements such as this, and on to what is a more \ncontemporary challenge. I think as a result of the debate, that will be \npossible to do.\n  I would quote one of our colleagues, Condoleezza Rice, who served \nwith great distinction as Secretary of State, and before that as \nNational Security Adviser, wrote recently in the Wall Street Journal \nand she said:\n\n       After this treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous \n     proliferators, not on further reductions of the U.S. and \n     Russian strategic arsenals, which are really no threats to \n     each other or to international stability.\n\n  Presidential Adviser Gary Samore agreed, saying:\n\n       If Iran succeeds in developing a nuclear capability, that \n     would do more damage to the effort of the President to \n     achieve a nuclear free world than anything.\n\n  That is the real test of where we are headed. So I would hope the \nfocus in the future will be on the illicit programs of Iran, of Korea, \ncountries such as Syria, and potentially focusing on some of the \nsupporters of these countries such as the country of China. These are \nthe real challenges. I believe there would be bipartisan support in \nthis body to address those challenges next.\n  But, secondly, I think as a result of focusing on our nuclear \narsenal, which we had to do by looking at this treaty, we have also \nlearned that we have a very big challenge in this country. And, \nfortunately and parallel with the treaty, we worked on this challenge, \nthe issue of how we can modernize our nuclear facilities and nuclear \nforce and the delivery vehicles of the triad that would deliver those \nvehicles.\n  I think we have all agreed we made significant improvement in that \nregard. The administration, I believe, has made a significant \ncommitment to the modernization of our nuclear facilities. And the \nSenate, in various ways in dealing with this treaty, has done likewise, \nas well as through an exchange of letters that have been entered into \nby members of the Appropriations Committee, and we hope to work with \nour colleagues in the House of Representatives with whom we have not \nhad enough contact on this issue. But hopefully, as a result of \neverything we have done, we will have an opportunity to fund the \nmodernization, as it becomes clear more precisely what has to be done, \nto ensure that all of that is accomplished within the appropriate \ntimeframe.\n  When we started out, we had a pretty woeful amount of money dedicated \nto the modernization of our nuclear facilities. Now we have a request \nfrom the administration of a total of about $85 billion over a decade \nto operate our facilities. That includes about $15 billion in new \nmodernization spending.\n  With the 1251 report coming from the administration each year, we \nanticipate there will be further updates which will demonstrate \nadditional progress we can make in the modernization. In addition, I \nmentioned the letter from the four key members of the Appropriations \nCommittee in this body. We hope to work with Members in the House of \nRepresentatives likewise.\n  Finally on this matter, one of the last amendments that was adopted \nis a certification requirement, which is a change to the resolution of \nratification that, to the extent possible, the administration will \naccelerate the planning and design of the two major facilities here \nand, where appropriate, request multiyear funding, of which my two \ncolleagues from Tennessee who are, as usual, seated right here \ntogether, made a very strong point--that we could not only save a lot \nof money every year but also accelerate the construction of these \nfacilities so we could complete the life extension programs for our \nnuclear weapons that are so critical.\n  A third thing I think we did, which is a very positive result, is to \nfocus a little bit also on the other aspect of modernization; that is \nto say, the triad, our nuclear triad of bombers, submarines, and ICBMs.\n  The Secretary of Defense had made a decision at the outset of the \nObama administration that we would cancel the decision on the next \ngeneration of bomber. It was very unclear whether it was the intention \nof our government to have a nuclear-capable bomber part of the nuclear \ntriad.\n  Quoting General Chilton, who is the general responsible at Strategic \nCommand on this, ``We need service programs that sustain the long-term \nviability of our land-based, airborne, and sea-based delivery \nplatforms.''\n  One of the amendments that was adopted, amendment No. 4864, does \nrequire the President to certify that he intends to modernize or \nreplace the triad, a heavy bomber and air-launched cruise missile, \nnuclear capable, an ICBM, and an SSBN and SLBM--in other words, the \nsubmarine leg, which I believe the administration has already begun to \nmove forward on.\n\n[[Page S10978]]\n\n  Also it would maintain the rocket motor industrial base necessary to \nsupport continued production of ballistic missiles. This is very \nimportant, because even if you modernize the warheads, if you do not \nhave modern delivery vehicles to deliver them, obviously you do not \nhave a capable deterrent. And, of course, the Russians, who have the \nmost capable system other than ours, are modernizing their delivery \nvehicles, especially their ICBMs and, as a result, I think we need to \ndo that as well.\n  I am very pleased we have been able to resolve this question about a \nnuclear-capable triad. I look forward to clear and unambiguous \nstatements from the administration in the future about this, and \neventually getting a replacement for all three legs of the triad that \nneed to be modernized.\n  Fourth, there was a lot of discussion here about missile defense. I \nthink without the treaty having come up, we probably would not have \nspent the time and raised the issues with regard to missile defense \nthat were raised. We had a disagreement here about whether--or the \nextent to which the preamble to the treaty and article V of the treaty \nand the signing statements created a problem with respect to further \ndevelopment of our missile defenses.\n  But through this debate, I believe, through commitments of the \nPresident in a letter that he wrote, through an amendment to the \nresolution of ratification and a lot of statements for the record \nduring this debate, we are much further down the road in predicting \nthat we will be able to deploy the kind of missile defense that is \nnecessary to protect not just our allies in Europe, for example, but \nalso the continental United States and the American people.\n  To conclude this point, any attempt by the Russian Federation now to \nreestablish a link between missile defense and strategic arms control \nwill not succeed; that any argument that there is a legal right to \nwithdraw from the treaty if we proceed with our deployment plans, as \nthey will be communicated to the Russians, will not stand. So our \nfriends in Russia do need to understand what we have done here. And we \nare making clear, as President Reagan once did, that U.S. missile \ndefenses are simply not open to a discussion. They will not be part of \nfuture negotiations as well.\n  Finally, with regard to the Conventional Prompt Global Strike, I \nthink we made some progress there. Very few people had ever heard the \nphrase, knew what it was. The Senate did give its advice in last year's \nDefense bill not to limit it. But, nevertheless, it was limited in the \ntreaty. I think our debate about it here has helped to educate Members \nas to the need for this, something both the administration and many of \nus here in the Senate support. It is simply the capability to deliver \nnot a nuclear warhead but a conventional warhead by an ICBM at a very \nlong distance in a very relatively short period of time, to meet some \nof the new threats we are going to be facing in the future.\n  Unfortunately, Prompt Global Strike is limited in the treaty. \nNotwithstanding that unfortunate linkage, as I said, I think we have \nhad an opportunity to obtain a more secure commitment from the \nadministration on the deployment of the Global Strike capability, \nbecause the resolution of ratification now calls for a detailed report \non our CPGS objectives prior to entry into the force of the treaty.\n  It will require the administration to consider treaty limitations, \nmethods of distinguishing nuclear, nonnuclear systems, which are \npossible and should relieve any concern that the Russians have about \nthe potential for a Prompt Global Strike weapon being confused with a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Apart from all of the things I just talked about there are other \nthings in the resolution of ratification that will add some strength to \nthe position that those of us who oppose the treaty have taken, \nincluding working through the Bilateral Consultative Commission, not \nbeing undercut by that commission, requiring an annual report \ncertifying Russian compliance with the terms of the New START treaty, \nthings of that sort.\n  I conclude that one of the things we will have to do proactively from \nhere on out, in order to achieve some of the objectives that we have \ntalked about here, is to work with our House colleagues who have not \nbeen a part of this process, to share with them the reasons we have \nconcluded these things are important, to work together, the \nadministration, my colleagues on the Democratic side and our side, to \nconvince them each year of the necessary appropriations that will be \nrequired, among other things, for modernization of both the triad and--\nI know my colleagues are anxious to leave. As a result, I will cut my \ncomments short to make this point.\n  I again close, as I opened, by thanking colleagues for working under \nwhat are, frankly, very difficult circumstances, to try to compress \neverything into a very short period of time, to be on a START treaty at \nthe same time we are parachuting in all manner of other issues and \ntrying to get those resolved. This has not been easy.\n  For those colleagues who were patient and expressed desire to do \nthings on the floor that we did not have time for, I appreciate their \nindulgences and appreciate the courtesies that everyone has extended. \nThis has been very contentious, and yet the disagreements between us \nhave never risen to any level beyond that which is totally appropriate \nfor a serious debate in the Senate, proving again that while we can \ndisagree or will disagree, we can certainly do so agreeably. I thank my \ncolleagues for their willingness to do that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I know he has \ncurtailed his remarks. I have cut mine. But I do want to say a couple \nof things as we try to wind down here. I want to thank the Senator from \nArizona for helping to get us to a point where we can vote now. I want \nto thank Senator Wyden who, 48 hours after surgery, has made himself \navailable to come here and to be able to vote. We are appreciative of \nthat.\n  As we end our debate on the New START treaty, I believe we can say \nthe Senate has done its duty, and done it with diligence, serious \npurpose, and honor. And I am confident that our Nation's security--and \nthat of the world--will be enhanced by ratifying this treaty.\n  When we began this debate 8 days ago, I quoted Chris Dodd's farewell \naddress, in which he reminded us that the Founding Fathers had designed \nthe Senate with these moments in mind. I think over the past week we \nhave lived up to our moment. Senators have had opportunity to speak and \ndebate. The fact is, we have considered this treaty--a less complicated \nor far-reaching treaty than START I--for longer than we considered \nSTART I and START II combined.\n  Admiral Mullen summed up our interests in this treaty in a compelling \nway. He said:\n\n       I continue to believe that ratification of the New START \n     Treaty is vital to U.S. national security. Through the trust \n     it engenders, the cuts it requires, and the flexibility it \n     preserves, this treaty enhances our ability to do that which \n     we in the military have been charged to do: protect and \n     defend the citizens of the United States. I am as confident \n     in its success as I am in its safeguards. The sooner it is \n     ratified, the better.\n\n  I think that is exactly right, and it is important to keep our \nfundamental charge to protect America foremost in our minds.\n  But I think there is something more to think about now. In the back \nand forth of debates like this, as we dispute details and draw dividing \nlines, it is easy to lose sight of the magnitude of the decision we are \nmaking.\n  Because sometimes, when we repeat and repeat and repeat certain words \nand phrases they become routine and ritual, and their true meaning \nfades away. When we argue about the difference between 700 delivery \nvehicles and 720, we may forget that in the final analysis, regardless \nof where we stand on the START treaty, this is one of\n\n[[Page S10979]]\n\nthose rare times in the U.S. Senate, one of the only times in all our \nservice here, when we have it in our power to safeguard or endanger \nhuman life on this planet. More than any other, this issue should \ntranscend politics. More than any other, this issue should summon our \nbest instincts and our highest sense of responsibility. More than at \nalmost any other time, the people of the world are watching us because \nthey rely on our leadership and because this issue involves not simply \nour lives and the lives of our children but their lives and the lives \nof their children as well.\n  So it is altogether fitting that we have debated and now we decide \nnot in a campaign season, but in a season that celebrates and summons \nus to the ideal of peace on Earth. Yes, we have contended about \nschedules. Yes, the constant chatter on cable speculates about whether \nwe would approve the treaty in time to get out of here for Christmas. \nBut the question is not whether we get out of here for a holiday; the \nquestion is whether we move the world a little more out of the dark \nshadow of nuclear nightmare. For whatever our faith, the right place \nfor us at this time of year, no matter how long it may take, is here in \nthe Senate where we now have a unique capacity to give a priceless gift \nnot just to our friends and family, but to our fellow men and women \neverywhere. When Robert Oppenheimer left Los Alamos after the atomic \nbomb was dropped, he said, ``The peoples of this world must unite or \nthey will perish. This war, that has ravaged so much of the earth, has \nwritten these words. The atomic bomb has spelled them out for all men \nto understand. . . . By our works we are committed, committed to a \nworld united, before this common peril, in law and in humanity.'' That \nis what brings us to this moment.\n\n  Last night, a friend called my attention to the meditation of Pope \nJohn Paul II when he visited Hiroshima. He said that from the memory of \nthose awesome mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki we must draw \nthe ``conviction that man who wages war can also successfully make \npeace.'' This month in homes across this land, Americans are honoring \nmoments in the history of faith that enshrine the values that guide us \nall regardless of faith. We in the Senate, only 100 of us in a world of \nbillions, should be humbled and proud that in this month we have the \nprivilege of reducing the risks of war and advancing the cause of \npeace.\n  So think of what is at stake here and of the role we now have to \nplay, not only in the governing of our country but literally in the \nlife of the world. Here more than ever our power to advise and consent \nis more than some arcane procedural matter. The Framers of the \nConstitution created the Senate with a vision of statesmanship, that \nhere narrow interests would yield to the national interest, that petty \nquarrels would be set aside in pursuit of great and common endeavor. \nThe best of our history has proven the wisdom of that vision. There was \nthat defining moment when Senator Daniel Webster stood at his desk in \nthis Chamber to address the fundamental moral issue of slavery. The \nwords with which he started were stark and simple, and they should \nguide us today and every day. He said: ``I speak not as a Massachusetts \nman, nor a northern man, but as an American.'' This is the very \ndefinition of what it means to be a Senator. To speak not for one State \nbut for one America. To remember that the whole world is watching. So \nit is now, and so it has been across the decades during which so many \nPresidents and Senators of both parties, citizens in every part of the \ncountry, have struggled and at critical turning points succeeded in \npushing back the dark frontier of nuclear conflict. The efforts have \nnot always been perfect; nothing in life or policy ever is. But as we \nend this debate now, let us take our own step forward for America and \nfor the world. As stewards of enormous destructive power, we too can \nbecome the stewards of peace.\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as the Senate approaches a point of \ndecision on the New START treaty, I would like to offer a few \nconcluding thoughts.\n  My attitudes towards the enterprise of arms control have been \naffected by the time I have spent during the last two decades visiting \nremote areas of Russia in an effort to bolster Nunn-Lugar dismantlement \noperations. When one sees Russian SS-18 ballistic missiles being cut up \nat Surovatikha, or when one witnesses the dismantlement of a Typhoon \nballistic missile submarine at the SevMash facility on the approaches \nto the Barents Sea, one gets a clear picture of the enormity of the \nproblem that confronted us during the Cold War.\n  With all the destructive power that was created during that era \namidst intense suspicion and enmity between the United States and the \nformer Soviet Union, we were extraordinarily fortunate to have avoided \na mishap that could have destroyed American civilization. During the \nlast two decades, we have circumscribed the nuclear problem, but we \nhave not eliminated it. Our cities remain vulnerable to accident, \nmiscalculation, and proliferation stemming from the Russian nuclear \narsenal. And we still must pay very close attention to the disposition \nof Russian nuclear forces.\n  Visiting dismantlement operations in Russia also underscores that \narms control is a technically challenging endeavor. In these debates we \ngenerally focus on the balance of nuclear forces, deterrence theories, \ndiplomatic maneuvers, and other aspects of high statecraft. But arms \ncontrol is also a ``nuts and bolts'' enterprise involving thousands of \nAmerican and Russian technicians, officials, and military personnel. \nVerification and dismantlement activities require tremendous \ncooperation on mundane engineering challenges, equipment and supply \nlogistics, and legal frameworks that allow these activities to proceed.\n  Ironically the exacting nature of arms verification and elimination \nmay be a blessing. The challenges of this work and the amount of \ninformation that both sides are required to exchange have improved \ntransparency and forced our countries to build productive partnerships \nover time.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on June 24 in which \nDefense Department officials in charge of verification and \ndismantlement activities in the former Soviet Union testified. These \nofficials oversee dismantlement work in Russia that occurs every day. \nTheir agencies oversaw verification under START I before the treaty \nexpired on December 5, 2009. They would oversee the verification work \nrequired under the New START treaty.\n\n  They described in detail how verification operations are conducted \nand gave Senators a picture of how the United States and Russia \ncooperate on technically challenging nonproliferation goals. Only five \nmembers of the committee attended that hearing. I wish that every \nSenator could have attended, because the presentation underscored how \nmuch the START process links our two defense establishments and how \ncritical the START framework is to nonproliferation activities.\n  Mr. President, there is a maxim that has been popularized in American \ncinema, variants of which have sometimes been attributed to early \npolitical philosophers such as Sun Tsu or Machiavelli. It is ``Keep \nyour friends close, but your enemies closer.'' I am not suggesting that \nRussia is an enemy. Our relationship with that country is far more \ncomplex. It is a relationship that is both wary and hopeful. We admire \nthe Russian people and their cultural and scientific achievements, \nwhile lamenting continuing restrictions on their civil and political \nliberties. We recognize the potential for U.S.-Russian cooperation \nbased on deep commonalities in our history and geography, even as we \nare frustrated that Cold War sensibilities are difficult to dislodge.\n  Although we can and must make situational judgments to engage Russia, \nsuch engagement is no guarantee that we will experience a convergence \nof perceived interests or the elimination of friction.\n  But one does not have to abandon one's skepticism of the Russian \nGovernment or dismiss contentious foreign policy disagreements with \nMoscow to invest in the practical enterprise of nuclear verification \nand transparency. In fact, it is precisely the friction in our broader \nrelationship that makes this treaty so important.\n\n[[Page S10980]]\n\n  It would be an incredible strategic blunder to sever our START \nrelationship with Russia when that country still possesses thousands of \nnuclear weapons. We would be distancing ourselves from a historic rival \nin the area where our national security is most affected and where \ncooperation already has delivered successes. When it comes to our \nnuclear arsenals we want to keep Russia close. There are enough \ncentripetal forces at work without abandoning a START process that has \nprevented surprises and miscalculations for 15 years.\n  The New START agreement came about because the United States and \nRussia, despite differences on many geopolitical issues, do have \ncoincident interests on specific matters of nuclear security. We share \nan interest in limiting competition on expensive weapons systems that \ndo little to enhance the productivity of our respective societies. We \nshare an interest in achieving predictability with regard to each \nother's nuclear forces so we are not left guessing about equal \npotential vulnerabilities. We share an interest in cooperating broadly \non keeping weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists. \nAnd we share an interest in maintaining lines of communication between \nour political and military establishments that are based on the \noriginal START agreement.\n  Over the last 7 months the Senate has performed due diligence on the \nNew START treaty. Most importantly, we have gathered and probed \nmilitary opinion about what the treaty would mean for our national \ndefense. We have heard from the top military leadership, as well as the \ncommanders who oversee our nuclear weapons and our missile defense. We \nhave heard from former Secretaries of Defense and STRATCOM commanders \nwho have confirmed the judgment of current military leaders. Their \nanswers have demonstrated a carefully-reasoned military consensus in \nfavor of ratifying the treaty. Rejection of such a consensus on a \ntreaty that affects fundamental questions of nuclear deterrence would \nbe an extraordinary action for the Senate to take.\n\n  Moreover, the treaty review process has produced a much stronger \nAmerican political consensus in favor of modernization of our nuclear \nforces and implementation of our miile defense plans. This includes \nexplicit commitments by the President and congressional appropriators. \nIn the absence of the New START treaty, I believe this consensus would \nbe more difficult to maintain. We have the chance today not only to \napprove the New START treaty, but also to solidify our domestic \ndetermination to achieve these national security goals.\n  I began the Senate debate on this treaty last week by citing a long \nlist of the national security threats that currently occupy our nation \nand our military. Our troops are heavily engaged in Afghanistan and \nIraq. We are fighting a global terrorist threat. And we are seeking to \nresolve the dangerous circumstances surrounding nuclear weapons \nprograms in Iran and North Korea. We are attempting to address these \nand many other national security questions at a time of growing \nresource constraints reflected in a $14 trillion debt.\n  In this context the U.S. Senate has a chance today to constrain \nexpensive arms competition with Russia. We have chance to guarantee \ntransparency and confidence-building procedures that contribute to our \nfundamental national security. We have a chance to frustrate rogue \nnations who would prefer as much distance as possible between the \nUnited States and Russia on nuclear questions. And we have a chance to \nstrike a blow against nuclear proliferation that deeply threatens \nAmerican citizens and our interests in the world.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will embrace this opportunity to bolster \nU.S. national security by voting to approve the New START treaty.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "TREATY WITH RUSSIA ON MEASURES FOR FURTHER REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF \n                  STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS--Continued\n\n\tMr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I wish to take an additional minute, if I might--the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is on the floor--to say, in addition to my statement I made 2 days ago in a speech on the floor with regard to the START treaty, that I wish to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee for the accommodating process from day one in April until today, where the treaty will ultimately pass on the floor of the Senate.\n\tLegislation is about improving ideas and making sure the interest of the American people and the United States of America is protected. Through the work of Senators Lugar and Kerry, we have been able to craft amendments to the resolution of ratification on the START treaty that ensure missile defense and modernization--the two contentious points on this legislation which came from the committee--are not only taken care of, but they are buttoned down and they are clear. And I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their willingness to do so.\n\tI want to let everyone who is listening and those who will read the reports of this debate know that this has been a 7-month process, not a 9-day process, and it has been a detailed process. It has been the work of the will of the people of the United States of America, and the U.S. Senate has worked its will. When it is ratified today, it will be a step forward in the future for my children and grandchildren.\n\tDuring my campaign when I ran for reelection this year, I made the following statement: The rest of my life is about doing everything I can do to see to it that the lives of my children and grandchildren are safer, more secure, and as affluent as my life has been because of my parents and grandparents. Today, in this ratification, we are ensuring that we will be strong in our strength, we will trust but we will verify. We will make sure we can fight, if necessary, but we will also make sure we are accountable. And most important of all, with regard to the biggest threats we face--terrorism and loose nuclear materials falling into the hands of a rogue nation--we will be a safer country because of this, and I thank the chairman and ranking member because of it.\n\tI thank the chairman for his time, and I yield back.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\tMr. KIRK. Madam President, I rise to oppose the START treaty because it recognizes limits on U.S. missile defenses in return for marginal reductions in the Russian arsenal. At the moment when the U.S. and allies must build missile defenses to protect against Iran, this treaty generates Russian pressure for America to go slow or risk Russia's departure from the agreement.\n\tIf you take the President's Senate missile defense letter at face value, then America would deploy defenses that will trigger a Russian treaty exit. I am concerned that to prevent a Russian treaty withdrawal, the United States will move slower on building defenses against Iran just when we need to move faster.\n\tThe most important duty of the Federal Government is to defend Americans against foreign attack, and the most important mission under that duty is to protect American families from the most dangerous nations that could carry out such an attack.\n\tIn the mid-20th century, we agreed that the Soviet Union represented a clear and present danger to America. Our Cold War Presidents--Truman through Clinton, Republicans and Democrats--backed policies of a strong defense, with alliances with our friends and diplomacy with the Soviets. But much has changed since the 20th century ended over a decade ago. While the Russians still have an impressive arsenal, they are shadows of their former shadow, dropping from 290 million people to 140 million people and from a gross domestic product of $2.6 trillion in 1990 to $2.1 trillion in 2010. The nuclear national security threat for the new 21st century moved beyond Russia to include Iran and North Korea, soon to be armed with nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them.\n\tWhile the Russians are heavily armed, they present a relatively stable face to the outside world. They have the capability to attack, but they currently lack the intent. On any given year, their leaders appear adverse to risk and unready to commit national suicide. The same cannot be said for Iran, North Korea, and other nations that present a far less rational face to the international community. Looking at such potentially irresponsible leaders, it is incumbent on us to go beyond idealistic diplomacy and mount a defense against an attack which may be leveled against our people or our allies. The lives of millions and the cause of freedom depend on our assessment of this threat and how we respond.\n\tRecall that nuclear technology represents the science of the 1930s, missile technology from the 1960s. Since the laws of physics cannot be classified, countries bad and good will all one day have the means to develop powerful arsenals based on the last century's science. It is the sacred mission of the democracies to understand this change, to measure its danger, and to eliminate an attack should one of these smaller, less rational countries attack.\n\tIn such an environment, an agreement to limit the nuclear arms of the United States and Russia is helpful but does not concern the new danger emerging against the people of the West. If we can lower nuclear arms to levels where we still maintain a devastating counterpunch against a rational opponent who is uninterested in national suicide, then a nuclear war with that country remains unlikely and the cost of our armaments is reduced. If that agreement also causes us not to build defenses against an irrational opponent who may attack anyway, then we have committed a grievous national error.\n\tI initially favored the goals of the START treaty. The treaty is an echo from the 20th century and had a marginal utility in improving the defense of the United States. Unfortunately, the negotiations to produce this treaty took a turn that was not well perceived by the press or public. The Russians used these negotiations intended to improve the defense of the United States as a means to preserve their ability to attack.\n\tSurprisingly, American negotiators formalized a link in the protocol between limiting defenses against missile attack and maintaining forces to carry out such a strike. Perversely, this agreement now stands for two principles: No. 1, the United States and Russia should reduce their nuclear arms, on which we all agree, and No. 2, the United States should recognize policies to maintain the viability of a Russian attack. This second principle turns the purpose of the treaty on its head. It weakens the future defense of our Nation. The treaty would support a policy that we must not improve our defenses to such a degree as to defeat a Russian attack.\n\tMuch of this has had little impact on actual defense plans regarding Russia. Russia presents a relatively stable, status quo face to the international community. It also maintains a nuclear force which would quickly overwhelm any planned system of defense. But a policy of limiting missile defense has a tremendous impact on our ability to thwart an attack from less responsible powers, such as Iran or North Korea. Given the actions of Iranian and North Korean leaders, I would argue these countries represent the more important danger to the future of the United States and our allies in this new century.\n\tIn the 20th century, the argument about the defense of the Nation against an attack by missiles took on a divided and partisan tone. President Reagan proposed ``missile defense,'' while congressional Democrats opposed ``Star Wars.''\n\tMuch of the disagreement ended in the late 1980s and 1990s when Iraq attacked Iran and then Israel with missiles.\n\tOver time, careful observers noted that missile defense was important not just to the health of Israel but to its survival.\n\tWhen Russia attacked Georgia, it used a great number of missiles to deliver blows against that little country. As this century winds on, more countries will see these realities of the 21st century, eventually including the United States.\n\tThe administration's unsteady missile defense plans also concern me. I am concerned about the missile defense actions taken by the current administration. When it took office, it cancelled plans to enhance the missile defenses of the United States itself that were based in Alaska and California. To the great embarrassment of our allies in the Czech Republic and Poland, it cancelled plans to deploy radars and two-stage ground-based interceptors (GBIs). I would note that history has been unkind to Western leaders that abandon Poland.\n\tThe administration also began an effort to cancel funding for the ``Arrow III'' interceptor being jointly developed with Israel. Thanks to the late Chairman of the House Defense Appropriations Committee, Jack Murtha, the effort to kill Arrow III was reversed and full-funding came to the Arrow III program despite the President's early wishes.\n\tOnce the negative reaction of our hurt Polish allies was known, the administration responded with a four-part plan to calm Europe using systems inferior to the GBI anti-missiles originally proposed by the last administration and current Secretary of defense. The inartfully coined European ``Phased-Adaptive'' approach involved anti-aircraft systems patched together in a rather ad hoc fashion. We now plan to begin by sailing U.S. Navy Aegis cruisers near European coasts followed by a decade and the possible deployment of a to-be-built Navy missile interceptor that does not yet exist, called the ``Standard Missile 3, block IIA''.\n\tI contacted our Missile Defense Agency and asked if the originally planned GBIs for Poland could have stopped an attack by Iran against the United States. They answered yes.\n\tWe checked if any one of the new ``Phased-Adaptive'' stages could stop a similar intercontinental attack by Iran against the U.S. They answered Phase I could not, Phase II could not, and Phase III could not.\n\tIn fact the only phase that could engage a missile launched by Iran against the U.S. was not until Phase IV by the IIB missile that did not yet exist that would be deployed far later than the original GBIs proposed.\n\tThe problem goes deeper. I asked the MDA to compare the capabilities of the originally proposed two-stage GBIs to hit an Iranian missile against the future final Phase IV SM-3 JIB. The MDA replied with this graph. It shows that the original, longer range GBIs would have a full 4-minute window to hit and destroy an incoming Iranian missile bound for New York City. The SM-3 IIB, which has a shorter range, would have only 3 minutes. In short, the administration's new proposed missile has 25 percent less time to defeat an incoming Iranian attack than the originally proposed missile. No wonder our Polish allies supported the original plan.\n\tI worry that some of these changes were made to curry favor with the Russians. I am concerned that the preamble to the START treaty would be used to reduce or block the efforts of the Congress to upgrade the defenses of the United States. In short, I am worried that while this treaty reduces the smaller threat of attack by Russia, it creates a Russian block for plans to eliminate the larger threat from Iran. The Russians clearly stated that if we mount defenses that could defeat their attack, they would pull out of the treaty. The problem is that to eliminate the threat from Iran and North Korea, we will have to do so. In this case, what is the value of the treaty? It clearly helps the Russians but if it blocks or delays our effort to protect against Iran, does it help us? I am also concerned with other aspects of this treaty, like an end to full-time compliance monitoring inside Russia.\n\tThere are also details of the treaty itself that concern me. Under previous treaties, the United States had a full-time monitoring presence in Votkinsk. This was eliminated. We will no longer have full-time monitors in Russia.\n\tAlso, an end to telemetry from new Russian missiles. Under previous treaties, the United States and Russia shared all the information transmitted by their test missiles in flight, called telemetry. While our spy satellites, planes and ships can gather some of this information, there is nothing like getting it straight from the missile's mouth. Telemetry is key to understanding the capability of a new missile, especially its maneuvers to drop off one or more nuclear warheads.\n\n\tUnder this new treaty, this data was lost. The Russians will not provide telemetry from their new missiles under this treaty. Their only obligation is to share telemetry from five missile flights a year and they will likely pick old missiles to do this.\n\tWe are told we lost the capability to collect the telemetry of new Russian missiles because while the Russians are developing many new models, we are not. Given that telemetry would report mainly on new Russian developments and not American, our negotiators gave up.\n\tThey should not have given up. The collection of telemetry from new Russian missiles had long been enshrined in arms control treaties. This precedent was well established and should have been continued.\n\tThere are inspections, but only 18 per year. We are told that the new treaty will offer the unprecedented inspection of actual missile warheads. This is true. Under the old treaties, we simply counted the number of missiles the Russians had using our spy satellites and assumed each missile was packed with as many warheads as the missile's flight tests and telemetry showed.\n\tNow we will get to inspect actual missiles--but only 18 per year. The Russians have hundreds. At the rate the treaty allows, the full inspection of the Russian arsenal of 800 launchers would take over 40 years.\n\tI asked administration officials how many hours notice the Russians would have before Americans conducted an actual warhead inspection. In all cases, they would have 24 hours or more notice that the Americans were coming. After extensive briefings on Russian cheating against previous arms control treaties--most flagrantly the treaty banning biological weapons--it should give you pause that the United States gave up collecting telemetry on the flight of every Russian missile in return for the inspection of 10 missiles per year and that only after a full day's notice.\n\tWe are also told that this treaty is needed to improve Russian international behavior. In my view, a treaty should only be signed to reward good behavior, not to encourage it later.\n\tI was most inclined to support the intent of this treaty to improve relations between the United States and Russia on the subject of collapsing the Iranian regime and its nuclear weapons program. Undoubtedly, the administration earned good marks in getting the Russians to cancel the delivery of one key piece of air defense equipment--an anti-aircraft missile battery called the S-300--to Iran. This was an unqualified success.\n\tUnfortunately, there are many more failures where the press paid little note. We believe the Russians are still delivering other pieces of air defense equipment to the Iranians. That is why the Russians insisted on exempting such deliveries from the new U.N. sanctions against Iran. Russian equipment will likely be used to defend Iran's nuclear sites, the very programs we are most worried about that violate Iran's commitment to the U.N. Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\tWhat is most surprising is the actions of the Russians since the negotiation of this treaty. They know we, the Europeans and Israelis are most worried about the nuclear program of Iran. Despite these well-publicized concerns and numerous U.N. resolutions against the Iranian nuclear program, the Russians chose this year and this country to provide nuclear fuel to the Iranian reactor at Bushehr. As that Russian reactor begins operation, plutonium production will begin inside Iran. While the Russians promise that the Iranians will not be able to use this plutonium in Iranian bombs, can we be assured that these promises will be honored? Would not it have been better to never begin plutonium production in Iran at all?\n\tI am also concerned about new ideas coming from the administration on missile defense and the Russians. Long ago, President Clinton proposed U.S-Russian cooperation in space. That cooperation led to a dependence so that soon, the U.S. will lack any way to launch astronauts. We cannot send our own astronauts to our own space station without the permission of the Russians.\n\tIn discussions regarding this treaty, I learned that the administration is now planning to bring the Russians inside the missile defenses of NATO. Russia is the very nation that used missiles to attack Georgia--a country applying for membership in NATO. I am sure the Georgians would be uncomfortable at best seeing Russians manage the missile defense of their little nation.\n\tThe U.S. offer to bring the Russians into NATO's missile defenses was embodied in an offer at the recent NATO conference in Lisbon. Nearly all Americans are fully aware of Russian spying against the United States military for the last 70 years. We know that Russia has one of the most active cyber-attack networks on the planet operating against U.S. networks. It would seem that a proposal to bring the Russians into the missile defense system of NATO would introduce powerful new opportunities for espionage against us, as well as a greater understanding of our defense capabilities and weaknesses.\n\tImagine a Russian officer in a NATO missile defense center. He will soon learn when our system is alerted, how it processes information, what our response times are and the estimated accuracy of our interceptors. These are the things he would learn during his first week inside our operations center. We can only imagine what else he would learn over the coming years.\n\tRemember that the warning information from NATO is critical to the defense of the United States. If the Russians managed to spoof or block critical NATO missile warning data, then U.S. commanders defending our homeland would become weaker, not stronger due to Russian presence in NATO missile defense centers.\n\tRecall that missile combat is the ultimate ``come as you are'' affair. In a struggle between continents, the battle will be joined within 30 minutes. When submarine or medium-range missiles are employed, battle can start in as little as 10 minutes. If we have Russians in the system who found American weaknesses or deployed problems, U.S. commanders will have only minutes to diagnose and fix those problems before the gravest consequences befall our people and allies.\n\tThe next Congress will favor missile defense programs to a far greater degree than this one. I plan to encourage this body and especially the House with legislation to deny funding for any effort to bring Russians into the missile defenses of NATO or the United States.\n\tI respect the opinions of Senators on both sides of this question. It is my judgment that safety of the American people is better off if we work to eliminate the new dangers of the 21st century rather than focus on the old agreements of the 20th century. In my view, the growing dangers of Iran and North Korea threaten the American people most. Therefore, the missile defense programs of the United States and our allies take precedence over an agreement whose protocol limits our defenses by acknowledging the need to preserve the ability of Russia to attack the United States.\n\tWhile most of us were born in the 20th century and we loved black and white TV, the ``Ed Sullivan Show'' and the ``Honeymooners,'' we recognize that time has passed and we must adapt to the new world of the Internet, Ipad and Ichat. The 20th century doctrine of nuclear Mutually Assured Destruction against the Soviet Union is part of our past and not part of a future involving Taepo Dong II missiles from North Korea and Shahab III missiles from Iran.\n\tI would urge the administration to devote the time and attention of our able diplomats to ending the Iranian nuclear program rather than this agreement that, while laudable in its very modest goals, went awry at the negotiating table.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tMr. LEVIN. Madam President, on April 8, 2009, President Obama and President Medvedev concluded negotiations, which had begun under President Bush, and signed the New START treaty. This new treaty is a key part of the reset of the U.S.-Russian relationship. Even though the Cold War ended 20 years ago, this relationship has been unclear; Russia is not an adversary but neither is it an ally. There have been divides and disagreements even though we share many common goals and interests. President Obama is rightly intent on moving the relationship in a more positive direction. Ratification of the New START treaty is an important part of this process.\n\tOn May 13 of this year, President Obama submitted the New START treaty to the Senate. In carrying out its responsibility the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Senate Armed Service Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a total of 20 hearings and 4 briefings. Seven hearings and three briefings were held by the Armed Services Committee. Even before the new treaty was submitted to the Senate, the Department of State provided the Senate National Security Working Group multiple briefings on the status of and issues discussed during negotiations.\n\tIt is now time for the Senate to provide its consent to ratification. As Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said about the START treaty on December 12, ``this is a national security issue of great significance and the sooner we get it done the better.'' The Director of National Intelligence is also eager to get this treaty finished and restore the insight into Russian nuclear forces that this treaty will provide and that is so important for the intelligence community. Director Clapper said, ``the sooner, the better. From an intelligence perspective, we are better off with the Treaty than without it.'' Retired General Brent Scowcroft, the National Security Adviser for both Presidents Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush, and a supporter of the Treaty, said, ``to play politics with what is the fundamental national interest is pretty scary stuff.''\n\tSome have suggested that this new treaty should not be taken up in this lameduck session of the 111th Congress. I couldn't disagree more. Almost as soon as this session of Congress began, the President announced his intent to complete negotiations on the new strategic arms agreement to replace the START I treaty. Various Senate committees of this Congress and the Senate National Security Working Group of this Congress were briefed on numerous occasions by the negotiating team on the new treaty. This Congress got the updates on the progress and the issues and this Congress provided guidance along the way. The committees of this Congress held 20 hearings and briefings on this new treaty. This Congress hosted several all-Member briefings including one such session with the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, to get his views on the importance of the treaty. The next Congress will not have the benefit of all that work and insight. It is in fact the obligation and the duty of this Congress to take up this treaty.\n\n\tWhen President Obama submitted the START treaty to the Senate for consideration he made six key points.\n\tThe treaty will enhance the national security of the United States.\n\tThe treaty mandates mutual reductions and limitations on the world's two largest nuclear arsenals.\n\tThe treaty will promote transparency and predictability in the future strategic relationships of Russia and the United States.\n\tThe treaty will enable each party to the treaty to verify that the other party is complying with its obligations through a regime of onsite inspections, notifications, comprehensive and continuing data exchanges, and provisions for unimpeded use of national technical means.\n\tThe treaty includes detailed procedures for elimination or conversion of treaty accountable items, and\n\tThe treaty provides for the exchange of certain telemetric information on ballistic missile launches.\n\tEqually important to this discussion is what the START treaty does not cover.\n\tIt does not limit U.S. missile defense plans and programs.\n\tIt does not limit U.S. conventional prompt global strike programs.\n\tIt does not provide authority within the treaty to modify the terms and conditions of the treaty without the advice and consent of the Senate.\n\tIt does not constrain in any way the ability of the United States to modernize the nuclear weapons complex, modernize, maintain, or replace strategic delivery systems, or the ability to ensure that the stockpile of U.S. nuclear weapons remains safe, secure, and reliable.\n\tIt also does not cover nonstrategic nuclear weapons--often referred to as tactical nuclear weapons. The START treaty covers, as have all previous nuclear arms reduction treaties, strategic offensive nuclear arms. Dealing with tactical nuclear weapons is certainly an area of arms control that needs to be addressed but has proved elusive to previous administrations, Democratic and Republican. It remains to be addressed.\n\tThe START III treaty was to have covered these weapons but when the START II treaty, which was signed by President George H.W. Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1993, was not ratified, any hope of addressing tactical nuclear weapons in a START III treaty died along with the START II treaty. 17 years later President Obama is trying to get nuclear arms reductions back on track, by resuming discussions with Russia and signing the START treaty. Hopefully, entry into force of this START treaty will allow the United States and Russia to discuss an agreement on tactical nuclear weapons. While getting an agreement to limit tactical nuclear weapons will be very difficult, without ratification of the New START treaty, it will be impossible.\n\tBecause this treaty does not require any significant reductions in either U.S. nuclear weapons or delivery systems, it is a fairly modest treaty.\n\tThe so-called Moscow Treaty, which was signed in 2002 by President George W. Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin, limited both Russia and the United States to a range of operationally deployed nuclear warheads by the year 2012. Under the Moscow Treaty, each side could have between 1700 and 2200 total operationally deployed nuclear weapons. Russia has already met this goal and the United States is very close. Under the START treaty, each side will have no more than 1550 deployed nuclear weapons, a reduction of just 150 weapons below the Moscow Treaty. The START treaty does not limit the number of nondeployed nuclear weapons, an issue of importance to the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, GEN. Kevin Chilton.\n\tThe limits in this treaty were agreed to after careful analysis by U.S. military leadership, particularly GEN Kevin Chilton, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command and the man responsible for these strategic systems.\n\tAt a hearing before the Armed Services Committee on July 20, 2010, GEN Chilton stated that the force levels in the treaty meet the current guidance for deterrence for the United States. That guidance was laid out by President George W. Bush\n\n       The options we provided in this process focused on ensuring \n     America's ability to continue to deter potential adversaries, \n     assure our allies, and sustain strategic stability for as \n     long as nuclear weapons exist. This rigorous approach, rooted \n     in deterrence strategy and assessment of potential adversary \n     capabilities, supports both the agreed-upon limits in New \n     START and recommendations in the Nuclear Posture Review \n     (NPR).\n\n\tThe strategic deployed forces allowed under the treaty will ensure the retention of the nuclear triad--all three delivery legs of the triad, bombers, SLBMs, and ICBMs. On that point GEN Chilton was very clear, saying ``We will retain a triad of strategic nuclear delivery systems.''\n\tSecretary of Defense Gates has also been very clear that the nuclear triad will be maintained. In an op-ed in May in the Wall Street Journal, Secretary Gates said the New START treaty ``preserves the U.S. nuclear arsenal as a vital pillar of our nation's and our allies' security posture. Under this treaty the U.S. will maintain our powerful nuclear triad . . . and we retain the ability to change our force mix as we see fit.''\n\tSome have said that the United States will have to make significant reductions to reach the force levels under the treaty and that the Russians will have to make no reductions. According to GEN Chilton this argument is a distraction. At an Armed Services Committee hearing GEN Chilton commented on the lower level of Russian forces and said:\n\n       New START limits the number of Russian ballistic missile \n     warheads that can target the United States, missiles that \n     pose the most prompt threat to our forces and our nation. \n     Regardless of whether Russia would have kept its missile \n     force levels within those limits without a New START Treaty, \n     upon ratification they would now be required to do so.\n\n\tWhile the START treaty will also not require significant reductions in the number of U.S. strategic delivery systems, there will be some reductions but not for 7 years. More importantly the START treaty will provide certainty for both Russia and the United States as to the size of the deployed nuclear force of the other. This is particularly important to the United States because Russia is now below the proposed delivery system limits of the START treaty, but has plans to build the number of strategic delivery systems. It is very much in the interest of the United States to have a cap on that build-up. An unrestrained build up would quickly bring back the ghosts and burdensome costs of the Cold War.\n\n\tUnder this new treaty, Russia and the United States will each have a total of 800 deployed and nondeployed ICBM launchers, SLBM launchers, and heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments, and 700 deployed ICBMs, deployed SLBMs and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. The treaty does not limit nondeployed nuclear warheads, nondeployed ICBMs, nondeployed SLBMs, or heavy bombers that are not equipped for nuclear armaments. This is particularly important for the B-1B bomber fleet, as those airframes have not been in nuclear service for many years and will not be counted under the START treaty when simple modifications are completed.\n\tThis START treaty brings a practical approach to strategic systems and counts real delivery systems and real warheads. Over the years, the old START I treaty had resulted in exaggerated nuclear force numbers. For instance, under the old START I treaty, the four Ohio class submarines that have been converted to conventional use, were still counted as 96 deployed SLBMs and 768 deployed nuclear warheads. These exaggerated force structure levels have led to uncertainties for military planners and increased costs for the United States. Under this treaty they will not be counted.\n\tOne of the additional benefits of this START treaty is that the treaty provides a clear mechanism to remove systems from being counted under the treaty. The ability to clearly and easily remove systems, such as heavy bombers from under the treaty, is also of great importance to General Chilton, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command.\n\tFor example the United States currently has 76 B-52 bombers and 18 B-2 bombers, a total of 94 nuclear capable bombers. Under the current plan for implementing the treaty there will be up to 60 nuclear capable bombers. The remaining 34 can be converted to conventional only capability and will no longer count under the treaty. They do not have to be destroyed. I think this fact is often misunderstood and there may be an impression that the 34 bombers will have to be destroyed under the treaty. That is not the case.\n\tThis past May, Secretary of Defense Gates wrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal. Drawing on his long history and involvement with strategic arms control agreements, which dates back to 1970, Secretary Gates said that the question is always the same for each treaty: ``Is the United States better off with an agreement or without it?'' With respect to the START Treaty Secretary Gates' answer to the question is unequivocal: ``The United States is far better off with this Treaty than without it.''\n\tThat is also the issue now before the Senate. Is the United States better off with this START treaty? The 20 hearings and 4 briefings have clearly demonstrated that it is.\n\tIn that same op-ed, Secretary Gates emphasized the current state of affairs that has existed since the end of December 2009 when the START I treaty expired. Since that time, there has been no verification and inspection regime, no visibility into the Russian strategic programs, and no limits on delivery vehicles. As the Secretary said:\n\n       Since the expiration of the old START Treaty in December \n     2009, the U.S. has had none of these safeguards. The new \n     treaty will put them back in place, strengthen many of them, \n     and create a verification regime that will provide for \n     greater transparency and predictability between our two \n     countries, to include substantial visibility into the \n     development of Russian nuclear forces.\n\n\tThis rigorous inspection and verification regime, which when coupled with our national technical means, will allow this treaty to be monitored and verified. Nevertheless there has been an argument made that Russia cheated on the START I treaty and therefore we shouldn't ratify the new treaty. According to the State Department that is simply not the case.\n\tIn testimony before the Armed Services Committee in July, Assistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller said, regarding the State Department's 2010 Treaty Compliance Report:\n\n       I want to point out that Russia was in compliance with \n     START's central limits during the Treaty's life span. \n     Moreover, the majority of compliance issues raised under \n     START were satisfactorily resolved. Most reflected differing \n     interpretations on how to implement START's complex \n     inspection and verification regime.\n\n\tThe old START I treaty was a complicated and complex treaty, many of the lessons learned from the inspections during the course of that treaty have been incorporated into the new treaty. There were issues on both sides. According to the 2010 Treaty Compliance Report:\n\n       The United States stated on several occasions to our Treaty \n     partners that the United States was compliant with the \n     Treaty; however as might be expected under a verification \n     regime as complex as START, the United States and Russia \n     developed a difference of views with regard to how the sides \n     implemented certain Treaty requirements.\n\n\tThis is not the same as cheating.\n\tOur senior military leaders believe the new treaty can be monitored and verified and that if Russia did cheat there is high confidence that any cheating could be detected before such cheating rose to a level of military significance. General Chilton said during testimony before the Armed Services Committee, ``New START will reestablish a strategic nuclear arms control verification regime that provides access to Russian nuclear forces and a measure of predictability in Russian force deployments over the life of the treaty.''\n\tIn a discussion on the ability to detect cheating I asked General Chilton, ``In other words, the verification provisions give you confidence that Russia cannot achieve a militarily significant advantage undetected?'' General Chilton said: ``Yes, that's correct.''\n\tAssistant Secretary of State Rose Gottemoeller, in her July testimony before the Armed Services Committee, made it clear that any cheating could be detected before it became militarily significant. She also believes that the United States is well positioned to deter cheating as well. In that regard she said:\n\n       Deterrence of cheating is a key part of the assessment of \n     verifiability, and is strongest when the probability of \n     detecting significant violations is high, the benefits to \n     cheating are low, and the potential costs are high. We assess \n     that this is the case for Russia cheating under the New START \n     Treaty.\n\n\tOne of the areas on which we have had substantial discussion is missile defense. The U.S. missile defense program isn't covered or limited by the New START treaty. It--the missile defense program--has nevertheless become a major focus of the debate on the treaty. Our missile defense programs and policies are based on developing and fielding the missile defense capabilities we need to meet the missile threats we face, not on any of these treaty matters. The New START treaty does not limit the missile defense capabilities we need.\n\tSecretary of Defense Gates, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee on June 17, said:\n\n       The Treaty will not constrain the United States from \n     deploying the most effective missile defenses possible, nor \n     impose additional costs or barriers on those defenses. I \n     remain confident in the U.S. missile defense program, which \n     has made considerable advancements, including the testing and \n     development of the SM-3 missile, which we will deploy in \n     Europe.\n\n\tSecretary of State Clinton, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee on June 17 said:\n\n       This Treaty does not constrain our missile defense efforts. \n     I want to underscore this because I know there have been a \n     lot of concerns about it and I anticipate a lot of questions.\n\n\tDuring that same hearing Secretary Clinton went on to say:\n\n       The Treaty's preamble does include language acknowledging \n     the relationship between strategic offensive and defensive \n     forces, but that's simply a statement of fact. It too does \n     not in any way constrain our missile defense programs.\n\n\tIn a July 20 hearing before the Armed Services Committee, GEN Kevin Chilton, the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command said:\n\n       As the combatant command(er) also responsible for \n     synchronizing global missile defense plans, operations, and \n     advocacy, I can say with confidence that this treaty does not \n     constrain any current or future missile defense plans.\n\n\tAssistant Secretary of State, Rose Gottemoeller, the lead negotiator of the Treaty, in testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations hearing on June 10, said:\n\n       The Treaty does not constrain our current or planned \n     missile defense and, in fact, contains no meaningful \n     restrictions on missile defenses of any kind.\n\n\tLater, on July 29, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee, Assistant Secretary Gottemoeller said:\n\n       There were no--and I repeat--no secret deals made in \n     connection with the New START Treaty, not on missile defense \n     nor on any other issue.\n\n\tAs the Ballistic Missile Defense Review report made clear, the administration is pursuing a variety of systems and capabilities to defend the homeland and different regions of the world against missile threats from nations such as North Korea and Iran. A good example of that is the phased adaptive approach to missile defense in Europe. The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended it unanimously. It is strongly supported by our NATO allies. The November 20, NATO Lisbon Summit Declaration says that ``the United States European Phased Adaptive Approach is welcomed as a valuable national contribution to the NATO missile defense architecture.''\n\tDuring the NATO Lisbon Summit NATO announced its own decision to build a missile defense system to protect European populations and territory against missile attack, consistent with the phased adaptive approach. The phased adaptive approach is designed to provide effective missile defense capabilities in a timely manner against existing or emerging Iranian missile threats. Those are the missile threats faced by our military personnel, allies, and partners in Europe.\n\tAs the Secretary of Defense and numerous other officials have made clear, the treaty does not limit our missile defense plans or programs. The Armed Services Committee also knows that, and our authorization bill stated that fact. Section 221(b)(8) of the Ike Skelton national Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2011 that we passed this morning in the Senate states, ``there are no constraints contained in the New START Treaty on the development or deployment of effective missile defenses, including all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense in Europe and further enhancements to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, as well as future missile defenses.''\n\tTo be very clear there is one provision in the treaty that prohibits each side from using ICBM silos or SLBM launchers for missile defense interceptors, and vice versa. But using these silos and launchers are not in our missile defense plan and should not be in our plan because it would be very much against our interest to use strategic missile interceptor silos for ballistic defense purposes. It would be more expensive than building new silos, the strategic missile silos aren't in the right locations to defend against missiles from North Korea, and most importantly, it would be destabilizing to launch ballistic missile interceptors from ICBM silos or SLBM launchers.\n\tLieutenant General O'Reilly, the Director of the Missile Defense Agency, has made clear, we don't want, need, or plan to use such silos for missile defense purposes. In a June 16 hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Lieutenant General O'Reilly made it very clear saying ``replacing ICBMs with ground-based interceptors or adapting the submarine-launched ballistic missiles to be an interceptor would actually be a setback--a major setback--to the development of our missile defenses.''\n\tThat one limitation has no impact on our plans for missile defense, plans that are more effective and less expensive than converting ICBM or SLBM silos to missile defense use.\n\tThere is one other area of the many that have been discussed in connection with the START treaty that I would like to raise, and that is modernization of the nuclear weapons complex and maintaining the ability to certify annually that our stockpile remains safe, secure and reliable.\n\tShortly before Congress instituted a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing in the early 1990s, the United States established a stockpile stewardship program to design and build advanced scientific, experimental, and computational capabilities to enable the annual certification process for the nuclear weapons. This program has been very successful. Beginning in 2005, however, support for the program started to wane and the budgets for nuclear activities started to go down. Without enough money the weapons complex was forced to have layoffs at the nuclear weapons laboratories and the production facilities, to defer maintenance on many important buildings and facilities, to delay key acquisitions, and to delay design and construction of the last two major new production facilities. President Obama, in his fiscal year 2011 budget request and in the plans for the future years, has turned this situation around by providing $4.1 billion more over the next five years than previously planned. This level of funding is unprecedented since the end of the Cold War.\n\tPresident Obama laid out his funding plan for the nuclear enterprise in the November Section 1251 report, a report that would provide an additional $1.2 billion over 2 years, a 15 percent increase and a total of $41.6 billion for fiscal years 2012-2016 for the National Nuclear Security Administration.\n\n\tWith these amounts has the administration committed enough to modernization and sustainment of the complex and the life extension programs for the nuclear stockpile? The directors of three nuclear weapons laboratories all say yes. In a joint December 1, 2010, letter to Senators Kerry and Lugar, the three Directors of the nuclear weapons laboratories said that the finding level proposed in the section 1251 report `` would enable the laboratories to execute our requirements for ensuring a safe, secure, reliable, and effective stockpile under the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan.''\n\tThe Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, under both President George W. Bush and President Obama, Tom D'Agostino, said, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee in July:\n\n       Our plans for investment in and modernization of the \n     Nuclear Security Enterprise--the collection of NNSA \n     laboratories, production sites, and experimental facilities \n     that support our stockpile stewardship program, our nuclear \n     nonproliferation agenda, our Naval nuclear propulsion \n     programs, and a host of other nuclear security missions--are \n     essential irrespective of whether or not New START is \n     ratified.\n\n\tThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee took the right approach on this issue in its resolution of ratification by not making entry into force contingent on a certain funding level, but by including a sense of the Senate that the United States is committed to a robust stockpile stewardship program.\n\tThe list of both Republican and Democratic supporters of this Treaty is broad and strongly bipartisan, including eight former Secretaries of State--Madeleine Albright, Warren Christopher, Colin Powell, Condoleezza Rice, James Baker, Lawrence Eagleburger, George Schultz, Henry Kissinger--four former Secretaries of Defense--Harold Brown, Frank Carlucci, Bill Cohen, Bill Perry, and Jim Schlesinger--seven former commanders of the U.S. Strategic Command, President George H.W. Bush, President Clinton and a long list of national security experts.\n\tOur NATO allies support this treaty and have urged us to ratify it without delay. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rassmussen said at the NATO summit in Lisbon in November:\n\n       A ratification of the START Treaty will contribute strongly \n     to an improvement of the overall security environment in the \n     Euro-Atlantic area, and all members of the NATO-Russia \n     Council share the view that an early ratification of the \n     START Treaty would be to the benefit of security in the Euro-\n     Atlantic area. I'd also have to say that it is a matter of \n     concern that a delayed ratification of the START Treaty will \n     be damaging to the overall security environment in Europe. So \n     we strongly urge both parties to ratify the START Treaty as \n     early as possible.\n\n\tI believe that the Senate should consent to ratification of the New START treaty and that ratification of this treaty is in the national security interest of the United States. Ratification of the New START treaty will provide predictability, confidence, transparency and stability in the United States-Russian relationship. The New START treaty will make us safer today, and leave a safer world for our children and grandchildren. The Senate should ratify the New START treaty now.\n\tMrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am very pleased that the Senate is about to ratify the New START treaty--I hope and believe with a very solid bipartisan vote.\n\tThis really is a historic moment. This is the biggest arms control treaty in 20 years, and the most important foreign policy action the Senate will take this Congress.\n\tThis is absolutely the right thing to do. It is important to our national security and it is critical to uphold America's place in the world community.\n\tAs I have said many times, the arms reductions in this treaty are modest. New START requires a 30 percent reduction in warheads from the limits set out in the Moscow Treaty in 2002 to 1,550 on each side, but both the United States and Russia have been reducing their strategic stockpiles since then.\n\tThe real importance of this treaty comes from the monitoring provisions, confidence-building measures, and the strengthened relationship between two of the world's major powers.\n\tWe have not had inspectors at Russian nuclear facilities for 13 months. We have not had data exchanges on the size and deployment of Russian forces. Russia has had the freedom to block our national technical means to monitor their forces. Apart from our national technical means, we are now blind.\n\tWith this treaty, we will benefit from these measures and others. The Senate has discussed the monitoring and verification provisions at length during this debate--in open and closed session--and it has been made very clear that this treaty greatly strengthens our intelligence community's ability to monitor and assess Russian strategic forces.\n\tAs Director of National Intelligence Clapper has said, the sooner we ratify this treaty, the better. I am very pleased that the Senate is acting now, before the end of the year and the congressional session, to give the executive branch these tools.\n\tWith the ratification of this treaty, the Senate also makes clear that the United States is willing and able to make good on its foreign policy promises and to act in the best interests of our country and of the world.\n\tFollowing ratification in the Russian Duma, the United States and Russia will begin the next round of arms control and transparency.\n\tI hope and I believe many Senators have expressed their desire, that this will lead to further arms control negotiations to reduce further the level of strategic arms and to address tactical nuclear weapons and other delivery mechanisms.\n\tThe ratification also maintains, and hopefully will build on, the improving relationship between our two countries and our two young Presidents.\n\tWe have enjoyed strong cooperation this year, over Afghanistan, over Iran, and--according to a letter I received from President Obama on Monday--over the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\tIn a world of asymmetric threats, we need friends and allies more than ever. This treaty moves us in this direction--with Russia and with the Eastern European nations that are strongly in support of the treaty.\n\tBefore closing, I want to congratulate and thank my good friend from Massachusetts. He has spent an incredible amount of time considering this treaty in the Foreign Relations Committee, preparing the resolution of ratification and in managing this floor debate.\n\tHe has done a fabulous job, and I really want to thank him for all his effort and his cooperation with me through this entire process.\n\tI would also like to thank the many administration officials for their assistance in my consideration of this treaty, all of whom have spent time in my office over the past year. They include:\n       Assistant Secretary Rose Gottemoeller, our lead negotiator; \n     Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; \n     General James Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs; \n     Tom D'Agostino, Administrator of the National Nuclear \n     Security Administration; and Director of National \n     Intelligence Jim Clapper.\n\tMrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today, the Senate has a historic opportunity to follow in a long history of strong, bipartisan support for reducing the threat posed by nuclear weapons around the globe. We have a chance to strengthen American national security and restore American leadership on the nuclear agenda. I am hopeful that the Senate will choose the right path and vote in favor of ratification of the New START treaty.\n\tI want to thank Senators Kerry and Lugar for their tireless, impressive work on the New START treaty. Former Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger, in explaining his support for the New START Treaty, told our committee earlier this year that the Senate's decision on New START ``will affect the prospects for peace for a decade or more. It is, by definition, not a bipartisan, but a nonpartisan, challenge.'' Senators Kerry and Lugar have done everything in their power to make this a nonpartisan effort, and I commend them and their staff for their excellent work.\n\tI want to also take a moment to thank the negotiators, Rose Gottemoeller, Ted Warner, their colleagues at the White House, and all the civil servants responsible for negotiating this agreement. Each of them has a lifetime of experience and impressive expertise on nuclear issues, and they all worked hard to navigate this difficult treaty process. America was well-served by your efforts, and we thank you for your leadership.\n\tAt the very beginning of this long process, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates asked the Senate a very important question: Is the United States better off with an agreement or without it? Today, the Senate has to answer this specific question.\n\tWe have had a very long, thorough, and vigorous debate, and some Senators may not agree with everything in the treaty text before us, and some may have problems with the process by which we are here today, but let's be clear. The vote today is not about what each of us might have done differently. The vote today is not about abstract numbers or theoretical point scoring. The historic vote today is simple: Do you believe the United States and the world are better off with an agreement or without one?\n\tThe Senate--led in a bipartisan fashion by Senators Kerry and Lugar has done an impressive job of meeting its constitutional responsibilities, and I am proud of the work we have done in giving our advice and consent to the New START treaty. The involvement of the Senate over the last year and a half and the debate we have undertaken have been worthy of the world's greatest deliberative body.\n\tI have heard from many of my colleagues that the Senate should not be a rubber stamp in ratifying the New START Treaty--as if to suggest we have not taken our constitutional responsibilities seriously during this process. This could not be further from the truth.\n\tFirst, the Senate's influence can be seen throughout the treaty document. A number of Senators met with negotiators numerous times prior to the treaty's completion, and some even traveled to Geneva during the negotiations. In many respects, from the very beginning, our negotiators were operating within a framework and boundaries as set by Senators involved in the process. The treaty itself is really a product of collective input from both the executive and congressional branches. The unique insight and input this Congress has provided throughout the negotiation process could not be replicated in any future consideration.\n\tIn addition, since we received the treaty, the Senate has done its job and has thoroughly considered this agreement. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held 12 hearings and heard testimony from 21 expert witnesses. The administration has answered over 900 questions for the record. We have also had more floor time for amendments and consideration than any other treaty of its kind. Our vigorous debate on the floor has added nuance and depth to this already thorough body of work.\n\tIt is also important to note that the Senate, in providing its advice and consent, actually writes and approves the resolution of ratification to go along with the treaty. This is not an insignificant document. This is the Senate's opportunity to influence the treaty's future interpretation and implementation and our chance to provide the declarations, understandings, and conditions to the treaty. The resolution succinctly and explicitly expresses the Senate's views on New START, and our resolution actually provides some strong statements with respect to many of the concerns raised by critics of the treaty.\n\tFor example, on missile defense, the resolution reads very clearly that the United States remains committed to missile defense, and the New START treaty does not constrain that commitment:\n\n       The New START Treaty and the . . . unilateral statement of \n     the Russian Federation on missile defense do not limit in any \n     way, and shall not be interpreted as limiting, activities \n     that the U.S. currently plans or that might be required . . . \n     to protect U.S. Armed Forces and U.S. allies from limited \n     ballistic missile attack.\n\n\tIn addition, the DeMint amendment on missile defense in the resolution reads:\n\n       The United States is and will remain free to reduce the \n     vulnerability to attack by constructing a layered missile \n     defense capable of countering missiles of all ranges The \n     United States is committed to improving U.S. strategic \n     defensive capabilities both quantitatively . . . and \n     qualitatively and such improvements are consistent with the \n     Treaty.\n\n\tOn tactical nuclear weapons, the resolution reads:\n\n       The Senate calls upon the President to pursue . . . an \n     agreement with Russia that would address the disparity \n     between tactical nuclear weapons stockpiles . . . and would \n     secure and reduce tactical nuclear weapons in a verifiable \n     manner.\n\n\tFinally, on strategic-range, nonnuclear weapon systems:\n\n       Nothing in the New START Treaty restricts U.S. research, \n     development, testing, and evaluation of strategic-range, non-\n     nuclear weapons . . . [or] prohibits deployments of \n     strategic-range, non-nuclear weapon systems.\n\n\tThe fact is that the Senate has done its constitutional duty and has thoroughly debated and considered this important agreement.\n\tAdding to our extensive internal debate, countless outside experts and former officials have also weighed in on this treaty. New START has the unanimous backing of our Nation's military and its leadership, including Secretary Gates, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the commander of America's Strategic Command, and the Director of the Missile Defense Agency. America's military establishment is joined by the support of every living Secretary of State--from Secretary Jim Baker to Secretary Condoleezza Rice--as well as five former Secretaries of Defense, nine former national security advisors, and former Presidents Clinton and George H.W. Bush. The overwhelming consensus from these foreign policy and national security heavyweights has been clear: New START is in America's national security interests.\n\tI think it is important to take a step back and remember the broader picture of the decision before us today. We are no longer talking about abstract numbers, intangible ideas or questions of process. We are talking about real nuclear weapons. We are talking about thousands of the most dangerous weapons in the history of mankind--weapons actually aimed directly at American cities.\n\tOur arsenals are composed primarily of nuclear weapons each yielding between 100 and 1,200 kilotons of power. To give you a sense of the power of these weapons, the nuclear weapon dropped on Hiroshima yielded around 13 kilotons of power. After New START, the United States and Russia will still be allowed an arsenal of 1,550 warheads capable of leveling cities more than five times the size of New Hampshire's largest city of Manchester.\n\tNow, I am under no illusions that the ratification of the New START treaty will somehow by itself meet the threats posed by nuclear weapons around the globe. President Kennedy told us that attainable peace will be ``based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions'' and ``peace must be the product of many nations, the sum of many acts.'' He said:\n\n       No treaty, however much it may be to the advantage of . . . \n     all can provide absolute security . . . But it can . . . \n     offer far more security and far fewer risks than an unabated, \n     uncontrolled, unpredictable arms race.\n\n\tNew START is a step away from this ``unabated, uncontrolled, unpredictable'' environment.\n\tAs the first Nation to invent and then use nuclear weapons, the United States has spent the majority of the last half century trying to reduce the risk they pose. Over five decades ago, President Eisenhower committed the United States to meeting its special responsibilities on the nuclear threat. He said:\n \n\n       The United States pledges before you--and therefore before \n     the world--its determination to help solve the fearful atomic \n     dilemma--to devote its entire heart and mind to find the way \n     by which the miraculous inventiveness of man shall not be \n     dedicated to his death, but consecrated to his life.\n\n\tEisenhower's early commitment and America's special responsibility have led to unbroken U.S. leadership in the world on the nuclear agenda. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty--the cornerstone of global nonproliferation efforts--was born out of President Eisenhower's ``Atoms for Peace'' vision. The original START treaty was a culmination of President Reagan's entreaty to ``trust, but verify'' Russia and its actions. The U.S. Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which has led to the deactivation of over 7,500 Russian nuclear warheads, was the result of two visionary and farsighted Senators named Nunn and Lugar.\n\tAmerican leadership on the nuclear agenda makes the world safer. Period.\n\tAs Secretaries Kissinger, Schultz, Perry, and Senator Nunn told us in their seminal 2007 opinion piece:\n\n       The world is now on the precipice of a new and dangerous \n     nuclear era . . . Nuclear weapons today present tremendous \n     dangers but also a historic opportunity. U.S. leadership will \n     be required to take the world to the next stage--to a solid \n     consensus for reversing reliance on nuclear weapons globally \n     as a vital contribution to preventing their proliferation \n     into potentially dangerous hands.\n\n\tThe New START treaty should be the next step on the path of American leadership on the nuclear agenda. If we turn our back on this treaty at this time, we are turning our back on a generation of bipartisan, American leadership in this field, and we cede the field to a more dangerous and more uncertain world.\n\tThe debate over New START is now over, and the only choice left before us is this treaty or nothing. Each of us today will decide--yes or no--whether we think we are better off with a treaty or without one.\n\tI hope we will vote on the side of the overwhelming majority of foreign policy and national security experts who have called on us to support this treaty. I hope we will vote on the side of our unanimous military and intelligence communities. I hope we will vote on the side of a legacy of American leadership on the nuclear agenda.\n\tI am hopeful we will follow in the footsteps of the Senate's strong bipartisan history and ratify the New START treaty today.\n\tMr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today to support ratification of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or New START. This treaty continues the bipartisan arms control framework first proposed by President Ronald Reagan and implemented by President George H.W. Bush with the START I and START II treaties. President George W. Bush continued this work with the Moscow Treaty. Now President Obama has taken another important step to address the dangers of nuclear weapons with the New START treaty.\n\tStopping the spread of nuclear weapons and reducing existing nuclear stockpiles is critical to our national security. New START helps accomplish this goal by placing responsible limits on nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles, while still enabling the United States to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent.\n\tNew START also reestablishes regular onsite inspections of Russian nuclear facilities, which ended more than a year ago when the previous START treaty expired. The potential lack of safety, security, and controls of Russian nuclear weapons is a grave security risk, and there is no substitute for onsite inspections to address this threat.\n\tI carefully considered the views of our military and diplomatic leaders in evaluating New START, and I am impressed by the breadth of bipartisan support for this treaty. The Secretaries of State, Defense, and Energy support New START. Our senior uniformed military leaders support New START, including the head of the Missile Defense Agency. Every living former Secretary of State, Republican or Democrat, supports New START.\n\tI commend my colleagues on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the extensive work they have done to consider the New START treaty. They have produced a thorough record on the merits of this treaty, which enables every Senator to cast an informed vote. After reviewing this record, I am proud to cast my vote in favor of ratifying New START.\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, before I begin my remarks on the New START treaty, I would like to point out to my colleagues that in 2002, I voted in favor of the Moscow Treaty. I was also one of 93 Senators who voted in favor of START I in 1992.\n\tI recognize the importance of maintaining a positive and cooperative relationship with Russia. The proponents of the New START treaty argue that this treaty is necessary to continue the goodwill between our countries and the much-touted ``reset'' in our relations. More importantly to me, however, are the merits of the treaty itself. The Senate should not simply ratify this treaty to appease Russia or as a signal of cooperation with them. The treaty should be considered based on its impact on our national security and the security of our allies.\n\tA nuclear arms control treaty can be evaluated based on the level of parity it brings to the two parties. In this regard, I believe this treaty falls short. The fact is, while this treaty places new limits on warheads, as well as deployed and nondeployed delivery vehicles, Russia is already below the limit on delivery vehicles. The treaty primarily imposes new limits on the U.S., while requiring modest, if any, reductions on the Russian side. Also alarming is that this treaty is silent on the matter of tactical nuclear weapons. It is believed that Russia has a 10-to-1 advantage over the U.S. in terms of tactical nuclear weapons.\n\tThe administration has argued that this treaty is necessary to provide strategic stability. However, if we are reducing our strategic weapons without regard to Russia's overwhelming advantage on tactical nuclear weapons, I question whether this reduction isn't weakening strategic stability. It should also be mentioned that some proponents of the New START treaty were critical of the 2002 Moscow Treaty for failing to reduce Russian tactical nuclear weapons. I believe our leverage with the Russians to begin placing meaningful limits on tactical nuclear weapons existed with this treaty. Now, I see no clear path to negotiating reductions in tactical nuclear weapons.\n\tLike many of my colleagues, I have serious concerns about the inclusion of references to and limitations on U.S. plans for missile defense. I don't believe there should be a connection between strategic nuclear weapons reductions and our plans for missile defense. I am equally troubled that Russia issued a unilateral statement at the treaty's signing stating that the treaty ``may be effective and viable only in conditions where there is no qualitative or quantitative build-up in the missile defense system capabilities of the United States of America.''\n\tIt is positive that the Resolution of Ratification makes a strong statement that the treaty does not limit the deployment of U.S. missile defense systems, other than those contained in article V. It also says that the Russian statement on missile defense does not impose a legal obligation on the United States. While I would have preferred that this treaty not contain any language on missile defense, I appreciate the work of the Foreign Relations chairman and ranking member to include this language in the ratification resolution. But the fact remains, this language is simply our opinion and is nonbinding.\n\tThis treaty reverses the gains made in the Moscow Treaty which de-linked offensive and defensive capabilities. Although a modified amendment on missile defense to the resolution of ratification was agreed to today, I am disappointed that the Senate could not agree to the amendment offered by Senator McCain which would have stricken the language in the treaty's preamble that arguably gives Russia a say on our future missile defense plans.\n\tFinally, I also share the serious concerns related to the issue of verification. It has been the subject of much debate, and deservedly so. I agree with the sentiment that as our deployed strategic nuclear weapons are reduced, it becomes more and more critical that the remaining weapons can be relied upon. As the number of weapons is reduced, it becomes more important that we know that the Russians are abiding by the limits of the treaty. \n\tAfter reviewing the classified material presented by Senator Bond, ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have serious reservations about the new verification regime contained in the treaty. Although former Secretary of State James Baker supports ratification of the treaty, he stated that the verification mechanism in the New START treaty ``does not appear as rigorous or extensive as the one that verified the numerous and diverse treaty obligations and prohibitions under START I.''\n\tI do regret that without a treaty in place that there is no verification regime, and no U.S. inspectors monitoring Russia's nuclear arms activities. It's important to point out, however, that the Obama administration had the ability to extend the verification regime for 5 years, as provided for in START I. But the Obama administration failed to act. The administration also insisted there would be a ``bridging agreement'' to continue verification until the entry into force of a successor agreement. This agreement was never completed either.\n\tI am deeply disappointed that in these areas of concern, the Senate is simply being asked to be a ``rubberstamp'' rather than fulfill our constitutional obligation to provide our advice on these important matters. Had the advice of the Senate on these important issues been incorporated into the treaty, I believe it would have gained overwhelming bipartisan support. Without addressing these areas in a meaningful way, I am reluctantly unable to support it.\n\tMr. COONS. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in voicing my strong and unequivocal support for New START. I want to thank Senators Kerry and Lugar for their leadership on this issue, and join them in urging the Senate to support ratification. New START will make America stronger and more secure by building on 30 years of U.S. global leadership on nuclear arms control and reduction. This is why it has been endorsed by national security leaders on both sides of the aisle, including every living Republican Secretary of State, 5 former Secretaries of Defense, 7 former commanders of the U.S. Strategic Command, the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff, 3 former Presidents, and all 27 of our NATO allies.\n\tWe simply cannot afford to postpone the vote until the 112th Congress and delay ratification any further. Military planners have confirmed that ratification is essential to U.S. security in an increasingly dangerous environment, and 73 percent of Americans support ratification according to one recent poll.\n\tAs the newest member of the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees, I did not have the luxury of receiving the wealth of information and perspective offered in the 18 public hearings and Senate deliberations on this issue. I have, however, received enough information from classified briefings to know this is a pressing national security matter of the highest order. As we approach a vote, I plan on following the strong advice of our military and national security leadership, as well as the will of the American people, in supporting New START.\n\tNew START will enhance U.S. intelligence gathering and restore inspections needed to monitor the Russian nuclear force. For more than a year, we have been deprived of such inspections due the expiration of the original treaty. While opponents of New START have highlighted the reduction in the total number of inspections, those which remain comprise the most robust strategic arms inspections regime in history. By increasing transparency between the United States and Russia, New START will enhance our mutual nuclear deterrent. This is just one example of why ratification is in America's best security interest.\n\tIn addition to reducing the total number of both American and Russian deployed strategic nuclear weapons to 1550, New START will limit the number of deployed delivery vehicles for nuclear warheads to 700. As we consider investing more than $85 billion over the next decade into modernizing our current nuclear arsenal, we must also consider the practical benefit of maintaining a smaller number of strategic nuclear weapons. These limits have been endorsed by our military planners because they are commensurate with our current and future defense needs. Moreover, reducing the number of deployed strategic warheads and delivery vehicles better positions us to invest the savings in nuclear modernization.\n\tThe United States and Russia share common threats and common interests, and, in the words of Vice President Biden, New START is a ``cornerstone of our efforts to reset relations with Russia.'' Over the past 2 years, cooperation between the United States and Russia has grown in areas such as supporting sanctions to thwart Iran's nuclear development and transferring essential supplies into Afghanistan. At this juncture, the Senate's failure to ratify New START could have far-reaching implications on such progress, including jeopardizing future cooperation in these critical areas.\n\tAs some of my colleagues propose altering the treaty, I want to voice my strong opposition to all amendments, as they would effectively kill the agreement by requiring renegotiation with Russia. In the future, we can address some of the issues raised during the amendment process--including Russia's extensive stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons--but these matters exceed the breadth of the treaty before us today. I also believe that we can achieve a missile defense cooperation agreement with Russia, but reaching an understanding on missile defense will be easier once we have established an agreed-upon limit to the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons.\n\tAmerica must maintain its global leadership on nuclear arms control and nonproliferation, and it is our obligation as Senators to act now. It is time to look beyond politics and vote on principle, and I urge all Senators to join me in supporting ratification of New START because it is a domestic and global security imperative.\n\tMs. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, known as New START, which was signed by the United States and Russia on April 8 and transmitted for the advice and consent of the Senate on May 13. Since then, Chairman Kerry, with the unwavering support of Ranking Member Lugar, has navigated the treaty through 18 hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations, Armed Services, and Intelligence Committees--and I commend the chairman for his determination to see this paramount accomplishment through to the finish.\n\tWithout equivocation, since his election to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Ranking Member Lugar has been an overriding force of nature in reducing the threat of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons--and his work with then-Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn to lay the groundwork for the deactivation of more than 7,500 of these dangerous weapons in the former Soviet Union is legendary. Throughout the negotiations and consideration of New START, Ranking Member Lugar has once again demonstrated his incredible depth of knowledge and expertise on these issues, which has been of the utmost benefit to the Senate.\n\tPresident George H.W. Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the original START Treaty on July 31, 1991--5 months before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The agreement represented the culmination of more than 20 years of bilateral arms control agreements between our two nations.\n\tMuch has changed over what is almost two decades since the original START agreement was signed in Moscow. The world has witnessed the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the rise of terrorist organizations with nuclear weapons ambitions, and growing threats from hostile regimes in such locations as Tehran and Pyongyang. As a result, when START expired 1 year ago this month, we found ourselves at a crossroads--without the ability to inspect Russian missile silos, which, frankly, is unfortunate given that last year Senator Lugar suggested that the administration obtain a short-term ``bridging agreement'' with the Russians to ensure there was not a verification gap between the expiration of START and approval of New START.\n\tYet despite this missed opportunity to secure a short-term bridging agreement, I believe the debate we have had in this body over the last 12 months has made clear that it is in our vital national interests to, first and foremost, maintain strategic stability between the United States and Russia-- the two countries that hold more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons--and furthermore to upgrade the original START agreement to reflect the new realities of the post-Cold War era.\n\tOn the first point, I have supported New START's goal of reinstating a more stable, transparent, and legally binding mechanism based on proven methods for monitoring compliance with treaty provisions and deterring potential violations. For example, New START requires essential data exchanges detailing the numbers, types, and locations of affected weapons, mandates up to 18 short-notice on-site inspections each year to try and confirm information shared during such exchanges, and it calls for the parties to notify each other and to update the database whenever they move such forces between facilities.\n\tSince the early years of nuclear weapons agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union, beginning with Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, known as SALT, in May 1972; to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces, or INF Treaty, in December 1987 and the original START agreement in July 1991; our nations have gained from the structure and degree of transparency that these agreements provide. As former National Security Advisor and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said in May, New START is ``an evolution of treaties that have been negotiated in previous administrations of both parties'' and ``its principal provisions are an elaboration'' of existing agreements. Secretary Kissinger went on to note that the continued absence of this vital agreement would undoubtedly ``create an element of uncertainty in the calculations of both adversaries and allies'' and have an ``unsettling impact on the international environment.''\n\tIn other words, without the comprehensive and overlapping system of inspections, notifications, and data exchanges that both the original START and New START provide, our strategic commanders and civilian leaders may be forced to position their assets in a way that anticipates the worst case scenario, which as we witnessed during many overwrought days of the Cold War is an incredibly precarious--and often more costly--approach in terms of the prioritization of our intelligence and defense resources. Therefore, I believe firmly that, when combined with our Nation's overhead intelligence assets, remote sensing equipment, and other classified methods, the New START agreement will provide our government better insight into the accuracy of Russia's declarations on the numbers and types of deployed and nondeployed strategic offensive arms subject to the treaty, thereby engendering greater confidence in our comprehension of the state of affairs, enhancing global stability and our security here at home.\n\tStill, in addition to maintaining the framework of our nuclear arms reduction program with Russia, it is crucial that this treaty be thoroughly vetted to reflect the reality of the threats we face in the 21st century. Article II, section 2 of the Constitution states that the President ``shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur''--and as such we must make absolutely certain that questions regarding our ability to verify Russian compliance with New START's limits, to develop and deploy effective missile defenses, and to modernize our nuclear weapons complex, have been satisfactorily resolved. Senator Kyl, in particular, has brought great value to this process--and I extol all of my colleagues for their dedication to meeting our constitutional responsibilities.\n\tAmong the most significant questions that have been raised are those that deal with our ability to monitor Russian compliance with the treaty's limits. As part of its overlapping monitoring and verification regimes, New START permits up to 18 short-notice on-site inspections at ICBM bases, submarine bases, and air bases each year. U.S. inspectors will use these inspections to help verify data on the number of warheads located on deployed ICBMs and deployed submarine launched ballistic missiles and the number of armaments located on deployed heavy bombers.\n\tOver the course of this debate, some of my colleagues have questioned the utility and effectiveness of New START's on-site inspections. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have worked with my colleagues to scrutinize this proposed agreement and have closely reviewed the National Intelligence Estimate pertaining to this subject as well as a number of other classified reports. It is important to understand that we do not depend only on the treaty's monitoring and verification provisions to ensure the Russians are complying with the warhead limit and other clauses. To the contrary, the treaty is but one critical instrument which, as with the 1991 START agreement, is intended to augment information collected through our overhead assets, and via other technical tools that leverage the larger U.S. Intelligence system--known as our National Technical Means.\n\n\tSince the treaty was transmitted to the Senate in May, the Intelligence Committee has conducted a comprehensive review, and my staff and I have questioned key officials, including the Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper, former Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, and Secretary Gates' Representative to Post-START Negotiations Dr. Ted Warner. Additionally, my staff has held classified discussions with former START inspection team members and delegates to the START Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission.\n\tConsequently, I would underscore two significant areas of advancement where New START's verification and monitoring provisions will be distinctly different from its predecessor. First, under the original START agreement, the treaty database listed the number of warheads attributed to a type of ballistic missile, and each missile of that type counted as the same number of warheads. Notably, New START advances this standard by enabling our inspectors to in fact count the actual number of reentry vehicles deployed on the missile to confirm that it equals the number designated by the Russians for that particular weapon.\n\tSecondly, New START includes the innovation that unique identifiers--which mean numeric codes--be affixed to all Russian missiles and nuclear-capable heavy bombers. Under the original START agreement, unique identifiers were applied only to Russian road-mobile missiles. As Ranking Member Lugar has noted, while this does not insure a ``foolproof'' verification system, it will provide enhanced confidence and transparency under the Treaty structure.\n\tTaken as a whole, I believe the treaty's notification requirements, the use of unique identifiers on each ICBM, submarine launched ballistic missile, and heavy bomber, and the 18 annual short-notice on-site inspections, combined with our National Technical Means, will further our critical national security objectives by helping us observe and evaluate Russian activities--an objective that is fundamental to our strategic stability.\n\tAdditionally, when it comes to our ballistic missile defense capabilities, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote on December 7 that ``The Russians need to understand that the U.S. will use the full-range of American technology and talent to improve our ability to intercept and destroy the ballistic missiles of hostile countries.'' In an effort to make certain that our intentions are unambiguous, the U.S. issued a unilateral statement at the signing of New START, which affirms that our government ``intends to continue improving and deploying its missile defense systems in order to defend itself against limited attack and as part of our collaborative approach to strengthening stability in key regions.''\n\tFurthermore, Ranking Member Lugar also worked to ensure that the Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification that was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on September 16 addresses this question by declaring that ``it is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as technically possible an effective National Missile Defense system'' and that nothing in the Treaty limits ``further planned enhancements'' to missile defense programs. President Obama, Secretary Clinton, and Secretary Gates have reaffirmed this commitment and the Administration's Ballistic Missile Defense Review, released in February, outlines a detailed plan to continue to expand international missile defense efforts to defend the United States, our deployed forces, and our allies and partners around the world.\n\tIt is also important for the record to reflect that Russia issued a similar statement when the original START was signed in 1991, saying that the treaty would be viable only under conditions of compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which at the time restricted ballistic missile defenses. History clearly shows that following ratification of START the United States did not restrain its missile defense programs or reduce its expenditures on ballistic missile defenses in an effort to ensure that Russia remained committed to the original START Treaty. To the contrary, U.S. spending on ballistic missile defense programs increased dramatically following the signing of the original START agreement--from less than $4 billion for Department of Defense-wide ballistic missile defense funding support in 1991 to nearly $10 billion this year. Moreover, in spite of this threat in 1991, Russia remained a party to START and continued to negotiate further reductions on strategic offensive weapons after the U.S. withdrew from the ABM Treaty in 2002.\n\n\tStill, despite this precedent and Ranking Member Lugar's considerable efforts to make certain that the resolution addresses the issue of missile defense, questions have been raised about potential restrictions on our ability to deploy effective missile defenses, and some of my colleagues have rightly criticized the preamble's recognition of an ``interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms.'' It has been argued--and I agree--that this language, when combined with Russia's unilateral statement asserting its concern about a United States ``build-up'' in missile defense system capabilities, needlessly gives Russia a leverage point with which to attempt to compel our government to pull back from our missile defense objectives by threatening to withdraw from the Treaty if we seek to increase our capabilities. As a result, I supported Senator McCain's effort to amend the Treaty to strike any reference to the ``interrelationship between strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms.''\n\tFinally, when it comes to the modernization of our nuclear forces, meaningful concerns have been raised about the deplorable state of our deteriorating Manhattan Project-era nuclear laboratories and weapons stockpiles. Senators Kyl and Corker should be commended for their diligence in shedding light on the undeniable truth that these facilities are sorely out-dated, and continue to erode as safety and security costs have grown exponentially, maintenance is deferred, and layoffs and hiring freezes deprive our government of highly skilled scientists and technicians needed to maintain our nuclear deterrent.\n\tCredible modernization plans and long-term funding for the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile and the infrastructure that supports it are central to the effectiveness of our nuclear deterrent, and we have posed serious questions about the veracity of the administration's modernization report that was submitted to Congress with the New START agreement on May 13th, pursuant to section 1251 of the fiscal year 2010 Defense Authorization Act. Specifically, we have sought greater detail and assurances regarding the administration's plans to retool and sustain our national weapons labs--including construction of the vitally important plutonium processing facility, known as the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement nuclear facility, in Los Alamos, NM, and the Uranium Processing Facility at Oak Ridge, TN. These two projects are essential for meeting our life extension program requirements for existing warheads and certifying the safety and readiness of the current stockpile.\n\tOn November 17, due in large part to the unyielding persistence of Senators Kyl and Corker, the administration released an updated 1251 modernization report that directly answered many of our concerns and elaborated on our modernization objectives by providing more detailed 10-year timelines and specific budget projections to sustain funding for stockpile surveillance at over $200 million over the next 10 years, and cost estimates for the plutonium and uranium processing facilities at upwards of $5.8 billion and $6.5 billion respectively. In total, the administration has now committed more than $85 billion to modernize our nuclear weapons complex over the next 10 years--$15 billion more than initially proposed by the administration--and I am confident this undertaking will ensure continued support for these indispensable activities.\n\tIt is now the responsibility of President Obama and his administration to, in the months ahead, communicate even more specific details regarding any lingering concerns about our Nation's long-term modernization programs. The Resolution of Advice and Consent, which is currently before the Senate, includes strong language requiring direct notification to Congress if at any moment more resources are required--or if appropriations are enacted that fail to meet our modernization needs--and we as a body must hold this government true to these commitments.\n\tIn summary, the original START agreement was signed over 19 years ago, at a time when we still lived in a decidedly bipolar, and some might argue less complicated world. But with the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, we are now facing new threats from volatile governments intent on the proliferation of dangerous weapons, and decentralized terrorist groups focused on launching attacks more devastating even than 9/11.\n\tConfronted with these daunting challenges, America must be prepared to defend our homeland, our forces in theatre, and our allies--and I believe this treaty allows future administrations to meet this responsibility, to maintain a safe and effective deterrent, and at the same time to continue to reduce the number of deployed and ready to launch long-range nuclear weapons. And as former Secretary of State James Baker noted in May, a more stable and cooperative relationship between Washington and Moscow ``will be vital if the two countries are to cooperate in order to stem nuclear proliferation in countries like Iran and North Korea.'' Simply put, the ratification of New START, and the cooperation and transparency it requires, has the potential to set the stage for expanded NATO and Russian collaboration when it comes to confronting terrorists and other dangerous proliferators--so together we may face those who threaten stability in the post-Cold War world.\n\tMr. President, the New START treaty has the unanimous support of our Nation's military and diplomatic leadership, Director of National Intelligence Jim Clapper, and the endorsement of President George H.W. Bush and prominent former national security officials such as Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, and every living Secretary of State--including Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I am convinced that this agreement, when combined with our intelligence assets, will enhance global stability, and most importantly, our national security. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification.\n\tMr. REID. Madam President, we cannot end this historic session of Congress without taking one more important step to protect the national security of the United States. It is time for the Senate to ratify the New START treaty.\n\tThis treaty will secure nuclear stockpiles. It will take nearly 1,500 American and Russian nuclear weapons out of commission. These are weapons that, as we speak, are trained on cities like Washington and Moscow, St. Louis and St. Petersburg.\n\tMore than a year has passed since American inspectors were on the ground monitoring the Russian nuclear weapons arsenal. The sooner we ratify this treaty, the sooner we can re-open the window into exactly what the Russians are, or are not, doing.\n\tSTART will also preserve a strong American nuclear arsenal. Our military leaders have analyzed the treaty and determined the number of nuclear weapons we need to retain in order to keep us safe here at home. The director of the Missile Defense Agency has said the treaty will not restrain or limit our missile-defense capacity.\n\tAmerica and Russia control more than 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons. The transparency this treaty will provide is critical not just to our two countries but the entire planet.\n\tBy ratifying the START treaty, we will also increase our ability to work with other countries to reduce nuclear weapons around the world, and to make sure that those weapons are kept safe and secure. We need to work together with Russia to stop the most dangerous nuclear threats, including those from Iran and North Korea.\n\tOne of the greatest and gravest threats we face is the specter of a terrorist getting his hands on a nuclear weapon. We have faced nuclear threats before--but such a threat from a superpower is much different than one from a terrorist.\n\tA nuclear-armed terrorist would not be constrained by doctrines of deterrence or mutually assured destruction. Instead, rogue groups could attack and destroy one of our cities--and millions of our people--without warning. By ratifying the New START treaty, we can help make sure this kind of unprecedented tragedy never happens\n\tWe have had a positive, bipartisan process up to this point. That should continue today.\n\tThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee overwhelmingly approved the treaty with a bipartisan vote of 14-4.\n\tOur Nation's military leadership unanimously supports it. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ADM Michael Mullen testified before the Senate and urged us to ratify it.\n\tSecretaries of State from the last five Republican Presidents support the treaty because they know--in their words--``The world is safer today because of the decades-long effort to reduce its supply of nuclear weapons.''\n\tAnd an all-star team of Republican and Democratic national security leaders support the treaty, including former President George H.W. Bush, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, Brent Scowcroft, James Schlesinger, Stephen Hadley, Senator Sam Nunn, and Senator John Warner.\n\tRepublicans have been included and instrumental from the beginning. At Senator Kerry's urging, the resolution was crafted by Senator Lugar to reflect the views of our Republican colleagues. The Foreign Relations Committee then adopted additional Republican amendments in its mark-up. And we have adopted four additional amendments on the floor.\n\tSenator Kyl raised legitimate concerns about the state of our nuclear weapons complex, and the White House responded with an $85 billion commitment to upgrade it over the next 10 years.\n\tWe have spent 8 days debating this treaty on the floor--that is longer than we spent on the original START--in a bipartisan and productive debate. I want to thank Chairman Kerry and Senator Lugar for their tireless leadership on this treaty and thank Senators on both side of the aisle who have worked hard to get this treaty completed.\n\tFor many Nevadans, the sights and sounds of a nuclear attack are familiar. Deep in our desert sits the Nevada National Security Site, which until this summer was called the Nevada Test Site.\n\tToday the site is the center of our fight against terrorism and nuclear smuggling. It is on the front lines of our intelligence, arms control and nonproliferation efforts.\n\tBut the site was once a critical battlefield of the Cold War, and for decades it served as our Nation's nuclear proving ground. A lot of Nevadans grew up with mushroom clouds in our backyard. We want to make sure the tests that took place in the Nevada desert are the closest we come to a nuclear explosion.\n\tToday we can do that. We can continue our institution's long history of bipartisan support for arms control. We can take 1,500 nuclear weapons off their launch pads. And we can make the future far safer for America and the world.\n\tThis is not just a narrow Senate debate. It isn't just a local issue. And it isn't something that can wait another day. The whole world is watching and waiting for us to act.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\tMr. KYL. Madam President, let me thank my colleagues for working hard to get this treaty passed and for being able to achieve that as well, people within the administration. I appreciate the cooperation some of us have had with the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, the ranking member and others who have worked hard to try to complete, in a very short period of time, what probably should have taken a lot longer period of time. But I appreciate their efforts to work with us in that regard.\n\tI would like to, briefly, speak to three things: the process, the problems, and some positive results of the consideration of this treaty.\n\tFor those who are watching, I can tell you right now there is only one thing on the mind of everybody in this Chamber: How quickly are we going to get out of here. One colleague said: I have a plane to catch. How long are you going to talk? Will I be able to catch it?\n\tThat is understandable because every one of us wants to get home to our families. I know there were some snide comments expressed about my concern a week or so ago about the fact we were going to be into Christmas week. But now the reality is everybody wants to get out of here immediately so cut short your comments, put them in the Record, and so on.\n\tWhen I predicted a couple weeks ago that I didn't think we had time to do everything the majority leader wanted to do and do it well, I had no idea how many things would be added to the agenda and how difficult that would be. Unfortunately, I think my prediction turned out to be correct.\n\tI remember just 1 year ago when we were on the Senate floor doing the health care bill, one of the primary criticisms of it was the way it was done. I must tell you, with regard to the process of this bill, I am concerned about the precedent we are setting in the Senate, taking a lameduck session to jam so many things through, frequently without an opportunity to provide amendments or, when there are amendments, to simply have them all shot down without, I believe, adequate consideration.\n\tWe have done the tax legislation, the continuing resolution to fund the Government, the DOD authorization bill, the DREAM Act, don't ask, don't tell, the 9/11 bill is on the way, some judges, we passed a food safety bill almost in the middle of the night by unanimous consent without Members being adequately notified, and now the START treaty. In many of those situations, there was not adequate time--as I said, no amendments even allowed.\n\tWhen cloture was filed, I expressed concern we had only dealt with, I believe at that time, four amendments to the treaty itself. But we were told: Don't worry. We will still give you consent to do resolution-of-ratification amendments.\n\tUnfortunately, not all of them were permitted by the majority and, in order to get as many as possible together, we had to consolidate 70 or so amendments down to a very few.\n\tThe other side announced at the beginning of the debate there would be no amendments on the treaty itself or the preamble. It turned out the amendments that were offered were all defeated, but we did have some amendments on the resolution of ratification. They, too, would have all been defeated or were defeated, except for the fact that we were willing to water them down and, therefore, had them accepted by the majority.\n\tNow we have very little time to make closing statements because we are going to adjourn sine die, meaning this is the end of the Congress. We will not have time to actually prepare written statements for the Record. This is a very brief statement to discuss primarily some positive things because there is not time to lay out all the problems that I think those of us who oppose the treaty still believe are present in the treaty.\n\tI agree with the comments the newest Member of the Senate, Mark Kirk, made just a moment ago. He is very well schooled in these issues, though a new Member of the Senate. I associate myself with a lot of the remarks he made. I think later, when we come back next year, we can chronicle the things that were said in the debates and have a pretty good record of how it all ended. But I fear more for the process because of the precedent set that serious matters, such as the ones we have debated and dealt with, including the treaty, were done in, to some extent, a slipshod way, to some extent in which there was not adequate time to do what the Senate should have done.\n\tI also fear for the precedent set with respect to treaty ratification. Essentially, on many of the issues that were raised--and I appreciate, I must say, colleagues have been kind to me in their compliments. I appreciate that very much. They were complimentary to me and my colleagues in saying we were raising important issues that needed to be vetted, but in each case this was not the time to do it, this was not the place to do it because if we dare change one comma in this treaty, it would require that it be renegotiated. There were some unspecified horrible results of the fact that we would have to renegotiate the treaty because the Russians wouldn't like what we did.\n\tThe precedent we are establishing is that the Senate is a rubberstamp. Whatever a President negotiates with the Russians or somebody else, we dare not change because otherwise it will have to be renegotiated, to some great detriment to humanity, and I don't think that is appropriate. I think our Founders, when they wrote into the Constitution an equal role for the Senate and the President, they meant it. That role is advice and consent. We gave some advice in the last Defense authorization bill. We said, for example, don't negotiate conventional Prompt Global Strike limitations and don't allow limitations on missile defense. Both those things were done against our advice. But we are being asked to consent notwithstanding.\n\tIt seems to me, if the Senate is to have a role in the future on these kinds of treaties, we better come to an understanding if we are going to be able to make some changes. I don't think anybody ever said the administration ever got anything 100 percent right. We ought to be able to make some changes or else we might as well avoid the process altogether because it is just a big waste of time. Eleven years ago when we considered the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and rejected that treaty, a lot of commentators said the Senate had finally put its mark on the process by conclusively demonstrating it would not be a rubberstamp and that would be a new era for the administration in the future, having to pay some attention to what the Senate said. I hope this new START treaty is an aberration, rather than the beginning of a new precedent.\n\tI will just tell you this. If the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is brought forward again, there will be a different process. Rather than the situation which obtained here, in which I did not urge a single colleague to oppose this treaty until the time that cloture was filed on it, I will urge every one of my colleagues to oppose reconsideration of the CTB.\n\tSo the process is not good. I have to hope that the result of the way we handled it this year will not establish a new precedent. The problems of the treaty I wish to discuss in detail, but because my colleagues want to catch airplanes, I will not.\n\tLet me focus then on the third and last element here, which is, some new things we learned from this treaty, and, frankly, some achievements that were obtained as a result of a lot of attention to it--being paid to it by our colleagues, a lot of great debate, particularly with respect to missile defense, modernization, and future arms control agenda.\n\tOne of the things I think we have made some progress on is that this may be the last arms control agreement for a while. Maybe we can get back to focusing on the real issues, issues of proliferation, of terrorism dealing with threats from countries such as North Korea and Iran.\n\tIt is fine to have yet another Cold War era type agreement with Russia. But the real issue is not between Russia and the United States, it is dealing with these other threats. So I suggest we move away from the distraction of agreements such as this, and on to what is a more contemporary challenge. I think as a result of the debate, that will be possible to do.\n\tI would quote one of our colleagues, Condoleezza Rice, who served with great distinction as Secretary of State, and before that as National Security Adviser, wrote recently in the Wall Street Journal and she said:\n\n       After this treaty, our focus must be on stopping dangerous \n     proliferators, not on further reductions of the U.S. and \n     Russian strategic arsenals, which are really no threats to \n     each other or to international stability.\n\n\tPresidential Adviser Gary Samore agreed, saying:\n\n       If Iran succeeds in developing a nuclear capability, that \n     would do more damage to the effort of the President to \n     achieve a nuclear free world than anything.\n\n\tThat is the real test of where we are headed. So I would hope the focus in the future will be on the illicit programs of Iran, of Korea, countries such as Syria, and potentially focusing on some of the supporters of these countries such as the country of China. These are the real challenges. I believe there would be bipartisan support in this body to address those challenges next.\n\tBut, secondly, I think as a result of focusing on our nuclear arsenal, which we had to do by looking at this treaty, we have also learned that we have a very big challenge in this country. And, fortunately and parallel with the treaty, we worked on this challenge, the issue of how we can modernize our nuclear facilities and nuclear force and the delivery vehicles of the triad that would deliver those vehicles.\n\tI think we have all agreed we made significant improvement in that regard. The administration, I believe, has made a significant commitment to the modernization of our nuclear facilities. And the Senate, in various ways in dealing with this treaty, has done likewise, as well as through an exchange of letters that have been entered into by members of the Appropriations Committee, and we hope to work with our colleagues in the House of Representatives with whom we have not had enough contact on this issue. But hopefully, as a result of everything we have done, we will have an opportunity to fund the modernization, as it becomes clear more precisely what has to be done, to ensure that all of that is accomplished within the appropriate timeframe.\n\tWhen we started out, we had a pretty woeful amount of money dedicated to the modernization of our nuclear facilities. Now we have a request from the administration of a total of about $85 billion over a decade to operate our facilities. That includes about $15 billion in new modernization spending.\n\tWith the 1251 report coming from the administration each year, we anticipate there will be further updates which will demonstrate additional progress we can make in the modernization. In addition, I mentioned the letter from the four key members of the Appropriations Committee in this body. We hope to work with Members in the House of Representatives likewise.\n\tFinally on this matter, one of the last amendments that was adopted is a certification requirement, which is a change to the resolution of ratification that, to the extent possible, the administration will accelerate the planning and design of the two major facilities here and, where appropriate, request multiyear funding, of which my two colleagues from Tennessee who are, as usual, seated right here together, made a very strong point--that we could not only save a lot of money every year but also accelerate the construction of these facilities so we could complete the life extension programs for our nuclear weapons that are so critical.\n\tA third thing I think we did, which is a very positive result, is to focus a little bit also on the other aspect of modernization; that is to say, the triad, our nuclear triad of bombers, submarines, and ICBMs.\n\tThe Secretary of Defense had made a decision at the outset of the Obama administration that we would cancel the decision on the next generation of bomber. It was very unclear whether it was the intention of our government to have a nuclear-capable bomber part of the nuclear triad.\n\tQuoting General Chilton, who is the general responsible at Strategic Command on this, ``We need service programs that sustain the long-term viability of our land-based, airborne, and sea-based delivery platforms.''\n\tOne of the amendments that was adopted, amendment No. 4864, does require the President to certify that he intends to modernize or replace the triad, a heavy bomber and air-launched cruise missile, nuclear capable, an ICBM, and an SSBN and SLBM--in other words, the submarine leg, which I believe the administration has already begun to move forward on. \n\tAlso it would maintain the rocket motor industrial base necessary to support continued production of ballistic missiles. This is very important, because even if you modernize the warheads, if you do not have modern delivery vehicles to deliver them, obviously you do not have a capable deterrent. And, of course, the Russians, who have the most capable system other than ours, are modernizing their delivery vehicles, especially their ICBMs and, as a result, I think we need to do that as well.\n\tI am very pleased we have been able to resolve this question about a nuclear-capable triad. I look forward to clear and unambiguous statements from the administration in the future about this, and eventually getting a replacement for all three legs of the triad that need to be modernized.\n\tFourth, there was a lot of discussion here about missile defense. I think without the treaty having come up, we probably would not have spent the time and raised the issues with regard to missile defense that were raised. We had a disagreement here about whether--or the extent to which the preamble to the treaty and article V of the treaty and the signing statements created a problem with respect to further development of our missile defenses.\n\tBut through this debate, I believe, through commitments of the President in a letter that he wrote, through an amendment to the resolution of ratification and a lot of statements for the record during this debate, we are much further down the road in predicting that we will be able to deploy the kind of missile defense that is necessary to protect not just our allies in Europe, for example, but also the continental United States and the American people.\n\tTo conclude this point, any attempt by the Russian Federation now to reestablish a link between missile defense and strategic arms control will not succeed; that any argument that there is a legal right to withdraw from the treaty if we proceed with our deployment plans, as they will be communicated to the Russians, will not stand. So our friends in Russia do need to understand what we have done here. And we are making clear, as President Reagan once did, that U.S. missile defenses are simply not open to a discussion. They will not be part of future negotiations as well.\n\tFinally, with regard to the Conventional Prompt Global Strike, I think we made some progress there. Very few people had ever heard the phrase, knew what it was. The Senate did give its advice in last year's Defense bill not to limit it. But, nevertheless, it was limited in the treaty. I think our debate about it here has helped to educate Members as to the need for this, something both the administration and many of us here in the Senate support. It is simply the capability to deliver not a nuclear warhead but a conventional warhead by an ICBM at a very long distance in a very relatively short period of time, to meet some of the new threats we are going to be facing in the future.\n\tUnfortunately, Prompt Global Strike is limited in the treaty. Notwithstanding that unfortunate linkage, as I said, I think we have had an opportunity to obtain a more secure commitment from the administration on the deployment of the Global Strike capability, because the resolution of ratification now calls for a detailed report on our CPGS objectives prior to entry into the force of the treaty.\n\tIt will require the administration to consider treaty limitations, methods of distinguishing nuclear, nonnuclear systems, which are possible and should relieve any concern that the Russians have about the potential for a Prompt Global Strike weapon being confused with a nuclear weapon.\n\tApart from all of the things I just talked about there are other things in the resolution of ratification that will add some strength to the position that those of us who oppose the treaty have taken, including working through the Bilateral Consultative Commission, not being undercut by that commission, requiring an annual report certifying Russian compliance with the terms of the New START treaty, things of that sort.\n\tI conclude that one of the things we will have to do proactively from here on out, in order to achieve some of the objectives that we have talked about here, is to work with our House colleagues who have not been a part of this process, to share with them the reasons we have concluded these things are important, to work together, the administration, my colleagues on the Democratic side and our side, to convince them each year of the necessary appropriations that will be required, among other things, for modernization of both the triad and--I know my colleagues are anxious to leave. As a result, I will cut my comments short to make this point.\n\tI again close, as I opened, by thanking colleagues for working under what are, frankly, very difficult circumstances, to try to compress everything into a very short period of time, to be on a START treaty at the same time we are parachuting in all manner of other issues and trying to get those resolved. This has not been easy.\n\tFor those colleagues who were patient and expressed desire to do things on the floor that we did not have time for, I appreciate their indulgences and appreciate the courtesies that everyone has extended. This has been very contentious, and yet the disagreements between us have never risen to any level beyond that which is totally appropriate for a serious debate in the Senate, proving again that while we can disagree or will disagree, we can certainly do so agreeably. I thank my colleagues for their willingness to do that.\n\tMr. KERRY. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I know he has curtailed his remarks. I have cut mine. But I do want to say a couple of things as we try to wind down here. I want to thank the Senator from Arizona for helping to get us to a point where we can vote now. I want to thank Senator Wyden who, 48 hours after surgery, has made himself available to come here and to be able to vote. We are appreciative of that.\n\tAs we end our debate on the New START treaty, I believe we can say the Senate has done its duty, and done it with diligence, serious purpose, and honor. And I am confident that our Nation's security--and that of the world--will be enhanced by ratifying this treaty.\n\tWhen we began this debate 8 days ago, I quoted Chris Dodd's farewell address, in which he reminded us that the Founding Fathers had designed the Senate with these moments in mind. I think over the past week we have lived up to our moment. Senators have had opportunity to speak and debate. The fact is, we have considered this treaty--a less complicated or far-reaching treaty than START I--for longer than we considered START I and START II combined.\n\tAdmiral Mullen summed up our interests in this treaty in a compelling way. He said:\n\n       I continue to believe that ratification of the New START \n     Treaty is vital to U.S. national security. Through the trust \n     it engenders, the cuts it requires, and the flexibility it \n     preserves, this treaty enhances our ability to do that which \n     we in the military have been charged to do: protect and \n     defend the citizens of the United States. I am as confident \n     in its success as I am in its safeguards. The sooner it is \n     ratified, the better.\n\n\tI think that is exactly right, and it is important to keep our fundamental charge to protect America foremost in our minds.\n\tBut I think there is something more to think about now. In the back and forth of debates like this, as we dispute details and draw dividing lines, it is easy to lose sight of the magnitude of the decision we are making.\n\tBecause sometimes, when we repeat and repeat and repeat certain words and phrases they become routine and ritual, and their true meaning fades away. When we argue about the difference between 700 delivery vehicles and 720, we may forget that in the final analysis, regardless of where we stand on the START treaty, this is one of those rare times in the U.S. Senate, one of the only times in all our service here, when we have it in our power to safeguard or endanger human life on this planet. More than any other, this issue should transcend politics. More than any other, this issue should summon our best instincts and our highest sense of responsibility. More than at almost any other time, the people of the world are watching us because they rely on our leadership and because this issue involves not simply our lives and the lives of our children but their lives and the lives of their children as well.\n\tSo it is altogether fitting that we have debated and now we decide not in a campaign season, but in a season that celebrates and summons us to the ideal of peace on Earth. Yes, we have contended about schedules. Yes, the constant chatter on cable speculates about whether we would approve the treaty in time to get out of here for Christmas. But the question is not whether we get out of here for a holiday; the question is whether we move the world a little more out of the dark shadow of nuclear nightmare. For whatever our faith, the right place for us at this time of year, no matter how long it may take, is here in the Senate where we now have a unique capacity to give a priceless gift not just to our friends and family, but to our fellow men and women everywhere. When Robert Oppenheimer left Los Alamos after the atomic bomb was dropped, he said, ``The peoples of this world must unite or they will perish. This war, that has ravaged so much of the earth, has written these words. The atomic bomb has spelled them out for all men to understand. . . . By our works we are committed, committed to a world united, before this common peril, in law and in humanity.'' That is what brings us to this moment.\n\n\tLast night, a friend called my attention to the meditation of Pope John Paul II when he visited Hiroshima. He said that from the memory of those awesome mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki we must draw the ``conviction that man who wages war can also successfully make peace.'' This month in homes across this land, Americans are honoring moments in the history of faith that enshrine the values that guide us all regardless of faith. We in the Senate, only 100 of us in a world of billions, should be humbled and proud that in this month we have the privilege of reducing the risks of war and advancing the cause of peace.\n\tSo think of what is at stake here and of the role we now have to play, not only in the governing of our country but literally in the life of the world. Here more than ever our power to advise and consent is more than some arcane procedural matter. The Framers of the Constitution created the Senate with a vision of statesmanship, that here narrow interests would yield to the national interest, that petty quarrels would be set aside in pursuit of great and common endeavor. The best of our history has proven the wisdom of that vision. There was that defining moment when Senator Daniel Webster stood at his desk in this Chamber to address the fundamental moral issue of slavery. The words with which he started were stark and simple, and they should guide us today and every day. He said: ``I speak not as a Massachusetts man, nor a northern man, but as an American.'' This is the very definition of what it means to be a Senator. To speak not for one State but for one America. To remember that the whole world is watching. So it is now, and so it has been across the decades during which so many Presidents and Senators of both parties, citizens in every part of the country, have struggled and at critical turning points succeeded in pushing back the dark frontier of nuclear conflict. The efforts have not always been perfect; nothing in life or policy ever is. But as we end this debate now, let us take our own step forward for America and for the world. As stewards of enormous destructive power, we too can become the stewards of peace.\n\n\tThe VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Indiana.\n\tMr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as the Senate approaches a point of decision on the New START treaty, I would like to offer a few concluding thoughts.\n\tMy attitudes towards the enterprise of arms control have been affected by the time I have spent during the last two decades visiting remote areas of Russia in an effort to bolster Nunn-Lugar dismantlement operations. When one sees Russian SS-18 ballistic missiles being cut up at Surovatikha, or when one witnesses the dismantlement of a Typhoon ballistic missile submarine at the SevMash facility on the approaches to the Barents Sea, one gets a clear picture of the enormity of the problem that confronted us during the Cold War.\n\tWith all the destructive power that was created during that era amidst intense suspicion and enmity between the United States and the former Soviet Union, we were extraordinarily fortunate to have avoided a mishap that could have destroyed American civilization. During the last two decades, we have circumscribed the nuclear problem, but we have not eliminated it. Our cities remain vulnerable to accident, miscalculation, and proliferation stemming from the Russian nuclear arsenal. And we still must pay very close attention to the disposition of Russian nuclear forces.\n\tVisiting dismantlement operations in Russia also underscores that arms control is a technically challenging endeavor. In these debates we generally focus on the balance of nuclear forces, deterrence theories, diplomatic maneuvers, and other aspects of high statecraft. But arms control is also a ``nuts and bolts'' enterprise involving thousands of American and Russian technicians, officials, and military personnel. Verification and dismantlement activities require tremendous cooperation on mundane engineering challenges, equipment and supply logistics, and legal frameworks that allow these activities to proceed.\n\tIronically the exacting nature of arms verification and elimination may be a blessing. The challenges of this work and the amount of information that both sides are required to exchange have improved transparency and forced our countries to build productive partnerships over time.\n\tThe Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on June 24 in which Defense Department officials in charge of verification and dismantlement activities in the former Soviet Union testified. These officials oversee dismantlement work in Russia that occurs every day. Their agencies oversaw verification under START I before the treaty expired on December 5, 2009. They would oversee the verification work required under the New START treaty.\n\n\tThey described in detail how verification operations are conducted and gave Senators a picture of how the United States and Russia cooperate on technically challenging nonproliferation goals. Only five members of the committee attended that hearing. I wish that every Senator could have attended, because the presentation underscored how much the START process links our two defense establishments and how critical the START framework is to nonproliferation activities.\n\tMr. President, there is a maxim that has been popularized in American cinema, variants of which have sometimes been attributed to early political philosophers such as Sun Tsu or Machiavelli. It is ``Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.'' I am not suggesting that Russia is an enemy. Our relationship with that country is far more complex. It is a relationship that is both wary and hopeful. We admire the Russian people and their cultural and scientific achievements, while lamenting continuing restrictions on their civil and political liberties. We recognize the potential for U.S.-Russian cooperation based on deep commonalities in our history and geography, even as we are frustrated that Cold War sensibilities are difficult to dislodge.\n\tAlthough we can and must make situational judgments to engage Russia, such engagement is no guarantee that we will experience a convergence of perceived interests or the elimination of friction.\n\tBut one does not have to abandon one's skepticism of the Russian Government or dismiss contentious foreign policy disagreements with Moscow to invest in the practical enterprise of nuclear verification and transparency. In fact, it is precisely the friction in our broader relationship that makes this treaty so important. \n\tIt would be an incredible strategic blunder to sever our START relationship with Russia when that country still possesses thousands of nuclear weapons. We would be distancing ourselves from a historic rival in the area where our national security is most affected and where cooperation already has delivered successes. When it comes to our nuclear arsenals we want to keep Russia close. There are enough centripetal forces at work without abandoning a START process that has prevented surprises and miscalculations for 15 years.\n\tThe New START agreement came about because the United States and Russia, despite differences on many geopolitical issues, do have coincident interests on specific matters of nuclear security. We share an interest in limiting competition on expensive weapons systems that do little to enhance the productivity of our respective societies. We share an interest in achieving predictability with regard to each other's nuclear forces so we are not left guessing about equal potential vulnerabilities. We share an interest in cooperating broadly on keeping weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists. And we share an interest in maintaining lines of communication between our political and military establishments that are based on the original START agreement.\n\tOver the last 7 months the Senate has performed due diligence on the New START treaty. Most importantly, we have gathered and probed military opinion about what the treaty would mean for our national defense. We have heard from the top military leadership, as well as the commanders who oversee our nuclear weapons and our missile defense. We have heard from former Secretaries of Defense and STRATCOM commanders who have confirmed the judgment of current military leaders. Their answers have demonstrated a carefully-reasoned military consensus in favor of ratifying the treaty. Rejection of such a consensus on a treaty that affects fundamental questions of nuclear deterrence would be an extraordinary action for the Senate to take.\n\n\tMoreover, the treaty review process has produced a much stronger American political consensus in favor of modernization of our nuclear forces and implementation of our miile defense plans. This includes explicit commitments by the President and congressional appropriators. In the absence of the New START treaty, I believe this consensus would be more difficult to maintain. We have the chance today not only to approve the New START treaty, but also to solidify our domestic determination to achieve these national security goals.\n\tI began the Senate debate on this treaty last week by citing a long list of the national security threats that currently occupy our nation and our military. Our troops are heavily engaged in Afghanistan and Iraq. We are fighting a global terrorist threat. And we are seeking to resolve the dangerous circumstances surrounding nuclear weapons programs in Iran and North Korea. We are attempting to address these and many other national security questions at a time of growing resource constraints reflected in a $14 trillion debt.\n\tIn this context the U.S. Senate has a chance today to constrain expensive arms competition with Russia. We have chance to guarantee transparency and confidence-building procedures that contribute to our fundamental national security. We have a chance to frustrate rogue nations who would prefer as much distance as possible between the United States and Russia on nuclear questions. And we have a chance to strike a blow against nuclear proliferation that deeply threatens American citizens and our interests in the world.\n\tI am hopeful that the Senate will embrace this opportunity to bolster U.S. national security by voting to approve the New START treaty.\n\tI thank the Chair.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe VICE PRESIDENT. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe majority leader is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Johnny Isakson", "Mark Kirk", "Carl Levin", "Dianne Feinstein", "Jeanne Shaheen", "Herb Kohl", "Chuck Grassley", "Christopher A.

Mr. President, I have heard complaints over the past few \ndays about why we in the Senate are still working so close to the \nChristmas holiday. All of us would rather be home with our families, \nbut of course we were sent here to serve the American people. We were \nsent here to the Senate to do the work of the American people, and we \nhave been trying to complete our work for the past several weeks. One \nremaining issue demands our attention: taking care of the Americans who \nresponded to the terrorist attacks on September 11th. We cannot turn \nour backs on these injured and ailing first responders. This is a \ndefining issue of our American values--how we serve those who have \nsacrificed for our Nation.\n\n[[Page S10981]]\n\n  Almost a decade ago, in the aftermath of attack, I visited the Fresh \nKills Landfill on Staten Island, NY. There, I witnessed detectives and \nmedical professionals conduct the heartbreaking work to sort debris \nfrom the World Trade Center Towers in order to recover the remains and \npersonal effects of those killed in the 9/11 attacks. It is difficult \nto describe how moving and powerful this was. It affirmed my faith in \nthe goodness of America and its citizens.\n  These Americans were doing everything they could to bring what little \ncomfort and closure they could to the survivors of those killed. They \nwere acting not for themselves but for their fellow citizens. These men \nand women were driven by the same sense of patriotism and compassion \nthat drove so many brave Americans to rush from across the United \nStates to respond at Ground Zero. Their acts of heroism, selflessness, \nand patriotism were emblematic of how Americans came together for one \nanother.\n  The legislation we consider today is the least we can do for these \nmen and women who answered the call of their Nation in our moment of \ncrisis. It is for the 30 New York City police officers who have died \nsince September 11, 2001, as the result of illnesses brought on by \nexposure to the toxic dust and debris. It is for the 13,000 first \nresponders who are sick as a result of their brave actions at Ground \nZero. It is for the thousands of men and women who came from across the \nUnited States to help the people of New York and our country. And it is \nfor the thousands more who will need medical care in the future. They \ndeserve the continuing support and assistance of their government, on \nbehalf of all Americans.\n  It is deeply disappointing that passing this legislation has been so \ndifficult. It should not be. If there is one thing on which we should \nfind unanimity, it is fulfilling our obligation to the men and women \nwho gave so much to help others on 9/11. These men and women asked \nnothing before they acted. They did what they thought was right. It is \nlong past time for the Senate to do what is right by them.\n  I applaud the Senators from New York. They have worked tirelessly and \nin the end agreed to compromise with a few of Senators on the other \nside of the aisle who were blocking action on this bill to help these \nfirst responders. The legislation we will pass today does not go as far \nas many of us hoped and believe appropriate, but it will go a long way \nto help the dedicated police officers, firefighters, construction \nworkers, and medical personnel who were injured because of their \nservice at a time of great national need. I cannot think of a better \nmeasure to end our work on in this Chamber than the message that we \nhonor their service by taking care of the injuries they sustained while \nserving.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I come to the floor today \nto congratulate my colleagues on their leadership and their willingness \nto come to the table to find a workable solution to ensure that we do \nnot forget those who risked their lives on September 11, 2001.\n  Today, the Senate reached an agreement to move forward on legislation \nthat would create a program dedicated exclusively to provide screening \nand treatment to the first responders and other men and women who \nparticipated in rescue efforts at the World Trade Center.\n  As I have said repeatedly, the work of my colleagues, Ms. Gillibrand \nand Mr. Schumer, are honorable and good. As I have said in every \nmeeting that I have held--whether meeting with firefighters and police \nofficers in Massachusetts, whether it be with Mayor Bloomberg of New \nYork City or New York City Police Commissioner Kelly--I support their \nefforts and their good work and dedication to make sure that none of \nthe heroes from September 11, 2001 are left behind or forgotten.\n  I support this agreement because it represents what the Senate should \nbe about: coming together, working together, and finding common ground \nand workable solutions. Today, in the final hours of the 111th \nCongress, we did just that by providing benefits to the first \nresponders in a realistic and pragmatic way.\n  But, M. President, I continue to have reservations regarding the \noffsets that are used to provide these benefits. As I have said to my \ncolleagues, I am concerned because I am not 100 percent confident that \nthe suggested offsets will materialize because of potential legal \nchallenges or questionable trade implications.\n  We should not forget the lives that were lost on September 11, 2001. \nThe lives that were risked that day. And those who continue to live \nwith scars from that day. And I can assure you, we won't.\n  I am supporting this legislation because it provides access to the \nhealth care and treatment that our heroes deserve. And I greatly \nappreciate the input and patience of so many firefighters and first \nresponders from my own state of Massachusetts, for whom I have \ntremendous respect and gratitude for all that they do.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. And I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the horror of September 11 was \nunforgettable, and so much about that day was unimaginable.\n  But imagine you had the courage to run into the disaster everyone \nelse was running away from. And because of the toxic fumes and smoke \nyou breathed in while you were working there, you got terribly sick.\n  And almost a decade later, you are still suffering. You have trouble \nbreathing, or maybe a tumor, or some other lung or heart disease. You \nknew you would be risking your life, but you probably didn't know it \nwould--like this.\n  Now imagine the help you need--the health care and compensation you \ndeserve--is within reach. But your Senator is keeping it from you.\n  That is exactly what is happening right now. The courageous first \nresponders and rescue workers who were the first on the scene at Ground \nZero need our help.\n  It is all so hard to imagine. It is hard to imagine we would have the \ncourage to do what they did that day--and that is why we revere these \nfirst responders. And it is hard to imagine their leaders would abandon \nthem like this.\n  We should all be embarrassed we are still here, at this late date, \ntalking about this bill. This is not controversial--it is common sense. \nWe should never, ever waste a minute before rushing to help the heroes \nof 9/11.

Mr. President, I have heard complaints over the past few days about why we in the Senate are still working so close to the Christmas holiday. All of us would rather be home with our families, but of course we were sent here to serve the American people. We were sent here to the Senate to do the work of the American people, and we have been trying to complete our work for the past several weeks. One remaining issue demands our attention: taking care of the Americans who responded to the terrorist attacks on September 11th. We cannot turn our backs on these injured and ailing first responders. This is a defining issue of our American values--how we serve those who have sacrificed for our Nation. \n\tAlmost a decade ago, in the aftermath of attack, I visited the Fresh Kills Landfill on Staten Island, NY. There, I witnessed detectives and medical professionals conduct the heartbreaking work to sort debris from the World Trade Center Towers in order to recover the remains and personal effects of those killed in the 9/11 attacks. It is difficult to describe how moving and powerful this was. It affirmed my faith in the goodness of America and its citizens.\n\tThese Americans were doing everything they could to bring what little comfort and closure they could to the survivors of those killed. They were acting not for themselves but for their fellow citizens. These men and women were driven by the same sense of patriotism and compassion that drove so many brave Americans to rush from across the United States to respond at Ground Zero. Their acts of heroism, selflessness, and patriotism were emblematic of how Americans came together for one another.\n\tThe legislation we consider today is the least we can do for these men and women who answered the call of their Nation in our moment of crisis. It is for the 30 New York City police officers who have died since September 11, 2001, as the result of illnesses brought on by exposure to the toxic dust and debris. It is for the 13,000 first responders who are sick as a result of their brave actions at Ground Zero. It is for the thousands of men and women who came from across the United States to help the people of New York and our country. And it is for the thousands more who will need medical care in the future. They deserve the continuing support and assistance of their government, on behalf of all Americans.\n\tIt is deeply disappointing that passing this legislation has been so difficult. It should not be. If there is one thing on which we should find unanimity, it is fulfilling our obligation to the men and women who gave so much to help others on 9/11. These men and women asked nothing before they acted. They did what they thought was right. It is long past time for the Senate to do what is right by them.\n\tI applaud the Senators from New York. They have worked tirelessly and in the end agreed to compromise with a few of Senators on the other side of the aisle who were blocking action on this bill to help these first responders. The legislation we will pass today does not go as far as many of us hoped and believe appropriate, but it will go a long way to help the dedicated police officers, firefighters, construction workers, and medical personnel who were injured because of their service at a time of great national need. I cannot think of a better measure to end our work on in this Chamber than the message that we honor their service by taking care of the injuries they sustained while serving.\n\tMr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to congratulate my colleagues on their leadership and their willingness to come to the table to find a workable solution to ensure that we do not forget those who risked their lives on September 11, 2001.\n\tToday, the Senate reached an agreement to move forward on legislation that would create a program dedicated exclusively to provide screening and treatment to the first responders and other men and women who participated in rescue efforts at the World Trade Center.\n\tAs I have said repeatedly, the work of my colleagues, Ms. Gillibrand and Mr. Schumer, are honorable and good. As I have said in every meeting that I have held--whether meeting with firefighters and police officers in Massachusetts, whether it be with Mayor Bloomberg of New York City or New York City Police Commissioner Kelly--I support their efforts and their good work and dedication to make sure that none of the heroes from September 11, 2001 are left behind or forgotten.\n\tI support this agreement because it represents what the Senate should be about: coming together, working together, and finding common ground and workable solutions. Today, in the final hours of the 111th Congress, we did just that by providing benefits to the first responders in a realistic and pragmatic way.\n\tBut, M. President, I continue to have reservations regarding the offsets that are used to provide these benefits. As I have said to my colleagues, I am concerned because I am not 100 percent confident that the suggested offsets will materialize because of potential legal challenges or questionable trade implications.\n\tWe should not forget the lives that were lost on September 11, 2001. The lives that were risked that day. And those who continue to live with scars from that day. And I can assure you, we won't.\n\tI am supporting this legislation because it provides access to the health care and treatment that our heroes deserve. And I greatly appreciate the input and patience of so many firefighters and first responders from my own state of Massachusetts, for whom I have tremendous respect and gratitude for all that they do.\n\tThank you, Mr. President. And I yield the floor.\n\tMr. REID. Mr. President, the horror of September 11 was unforgettable, and so much about that day was unimaginable.\n\tBut imagine you had the courage to run into the disaster everyone else was running away from. And because of the toxic fumes and smoke you breathed in while you were working there, you got terribly sick.\n\tAnd almost a decade later, you are still suffering. You have trouble breathing, or maybe a tumor, or some other lung or heart disease. You knew you would be risking your life, but you probably didn't know it would--like this.\n\tNow imagine the help you need--the health care and compensation you deserve--is within reach. But your Senator is keeping it from you.\n\tThat is exactly what is happening right now. The courageous first responders and rescue workers who were the first on the scene at Ground Zero need our help.\n\tIt is all so hard to imagine. It is hard to imagine we would have the courage to do what they did that day--and that is why we revere these first responders. And it is hard to imagine their leaders would abandon them like this.\n\tWe should all be embarrassed we are still here, at this late date, talking about this bill. This is not controversial--it is common sense. We should never, ever waste a minute before rushing to help the heroes of 9/11. We should never, ever waste a minute before rushing to help the victims of that day. These first responders are both--and this delay is simply inexcusable.\n\tThis new program will make sure we do our jobs just as they did theirs. It sets up a program that will monitor the health and treatment of the thousands of rescue workers and survivors of 9/11 and makes sure they get the care they need.\n\tThe authors of this bill have written protections into it to ensure the quality of the medical treatment it delivers and to protect it from fraud.\n\tAs far as legislation and leadership go, this one is a no-brainer.

Checks and balances are in place to make sure all claims are legitimate. And when this program is established, it will be used only as a last resort--only if it's needed after private health insurance and workers' compensation aren't sufficient or fast enough.\n\tNone of these men and women thought twice before trying to save the lives of their fellow Americans. Neither should we.\n\tWe all know the Capitol might not be standing without the courage of men and women who became heroes that day. How can we stand in this building and vote against helping their fellow heroes--people who were the first to respond when the unimaginable happened?\n\tThe VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on the engrossment of the amendment and third reading of the bill.\n\tThe amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a third time.\n\tThe bill was read the third time.\n\tThe VICE PRESIDENT. The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n\tThe bill (H.R. 847), as amended, was passed.\n\tMr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote. \n\tMr. KERRY.

The first \n     such report shall include a long-term plan for the \n     maintenance of New START Treaty monitoring. Each subsequent \n     report shall include an update of the long-term plan. Each \n     such report may be submitted in either classified or \n     unclassified form.\n       (B) It is the sense of the Senate that monitoring Russian \n     Federation compliance with the New START Treaty is a high \n     priority and that the inability to do so would constitute a \n     threat to United States national security interests.\n       (3) Reductions.--(A) The New START Treaty shall not enter \n     into force until instruments of ratification have been \n     exchanged in accordance with Article XIV of the New START \n     Treaty.\n       (B) If, prior to the entry into force of the New START \n     Treaty, the President plans to implement reductions of United \n     States strategic nuclear forces below those currently planned \n     and consistent with the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive \n     Reductions, signed at Moscow on May 24, 2002 (commonly \n     referred to as ``the Moscow Treaty''), then the President \n     shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate regarding the effect of such \n     reductions on the national security of the United States; and\n       (ii) take no such reductions until the President submits to \n     the Senate the President's determination that such reductions \n     are in the national security interest of the United States.\n       (4) Timely warning of breakout.--If the President \n     determines, after consultation with the Director of National \n     Intelligence, that the Russian Federation intends to break \n     out of the limits in Article II of the New START Treaty, the \n     President shall immediately inform the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Armed Services of the\n\n[[Page S10983]]\n\n     Senate, with a view to determining whether circumstances \n     exist that jeopardize the supreme interests of the United \n     States, such that withdrawal from the New START Treaty may be \n     warranted pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the New \n     START Treaty.\n       (5) United states missile defense test telemetry.--Prior to \n     entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President shall \n     certify to the Senate that the New START Treaty does not \n     require, at any point during which it will be in force, the \n     United States to provide to the Russian Federation telemetric \n     information under Article IX of the New START Treaty, Part \n     Seven of the Protocol, and the Annex on Telemetric \n     Information to the Protocol for the launch of--\n       (A) any missile defense interceptor, as defined in \n     paragraph 44 of Part One of the Protocol to the New START \n     Treaty;\n       (B) any satellite launches, missile defense sensor targets, \n     and missile defense intercept targets, the launch of which \n     uses the first stage of an existing type of United States \n     ICBM or SLBM listed in paragraph 8 of Article III of the New \n     START Treaty; or\n       (C) any missile described in clause (a) of paragraph 7 of \n     Article III of the New START Treaty.\n       (6) Conventional prompt global strike.--(A) The Senate \n     calls on the executive branch to clarify its planning and \n     intent in developing future conventionally armed, strategic-\n     range weapon systems. To this end, prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall provide a \n     report to the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate containing the following:\n       (i) A list of all conventionally armed, strategic-range \n     weapon systems that are currently under development.\n       (ii) An analysis of the expected capabilities of each \n     system listed under clause (i).\n       (iii) A statement with respect to each system listed under \n     clause (i) as to whether any of the limits in Article II of \n     the New START Treaty apply to such system.\n       (iv) An assessment of the costs, risks, and benefits of \n     each system.\n       (v) A discussion of alternative deployment options and \n     scenarios for each system.\n       (vi) A summary of the measures that could help to \n     distinguish each system listed under clause (i) from nuclear \n     systems and reduce the risks of misinterpretation and of a \n     resulting claim that such systems might alter strategic \n     stability.\n       (B) The report under subparagraph (A) may be supplemented \n     by a classified annex.\n       (C) If, at any time after the New START Treaty enters into \n     force, the President determines that deployment of \n     conventional warheads on ICBMs or SLBMs is required at levels \n     that cannot be accommodated within the limits in Article II \n     of the New START Treaty while sustaining a robust United \n     States nuclear triad, then the President shall immediately \n     consult with the Senate regarding the reasons for such \n     determination.\n       (7) United states telemetric information.--In implementing \n     Article IX of the New START Treaty, Part Seven of the \n     Protocol, and the Annex on Telemetric Information to the \n     Protocol, prior to agreeing to provide to the Russian \n     Federation any amount of telemetric information on a United \n     States test launch of a conventionally armed prompt global \n     strike system, the President shall certify to the Committees \n     on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the Senate that--\n       (A) the provision of United States telemetric information--\n       (i) consists of data that demonstrate that such system is \n     not subject to the limits in Article II of the New START \n     Treaty; or\n       (ii) would be provided in exchange for significant \n     telemetric information regarding a weapon system not listed \n     in paragraph 8 of Article III of the New START Treaty, or a \n     system not deployed by the Russian Federation prior to \n     December 5, 2009;\n       (B) it is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to provide such telemetric information; and\n       (C) provision of such telemetric information will not \n     undermine the effectiveness of such system.\n       (8) Bilateral consultative commission.--Not later than 15 \n     days before any meeting of the Bilateral Consultative \n     Commission to consider a proposal for additional measures to \n     improve the viability or effectiveness of the New START \n     Treaty or to resolve a question related to the applicability \n     of provisions of the New START Treaty to a new kind of \n     strategic offensive arm, the President shall consult with the \n     Chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate with regard to whether the \n     proposal, if adopted, would constitute an amendment to the \n     New START Treaty requiring the advice and consent of the \n     Senate, as set forth in Article II, section 2, clause 2 of \n     the Constitution of the United States.\n       (9) United states commitments ensuring the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of its nuclear forces.--(A) The \n     United States is committed to ensuring the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of its nuclear forces. It is the \n     sense of the Senate that--\n       (i) the United States is committed to proceeding with a \n     robust stockpile stewardship program, and to maintaining and \n     modernizing the nuclear weapons production capabilities and \n     capacities, that will ensure the safety, reliability, and \n     performance of the United States nuclear arsenal at the New \n     START Treaty levels and meet requirements for hedging against \n     possible international developments or technical problems, in \n     conformance with United States policies and to underpin \n     deterrence;\n       (ii) to that end, the United States is committed to \n     maintaining United States nuclear weapons laboratories and \n     preserving the core nuclear weapons competencies therein; and\n       (iii) the United States is committed to providing the \n     resources needed to achieve these objectives, at a minimum at \n     the levels set forth in the President's 10-year plan provided \n     to the Congress pursuant to section 1251 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law \n     111-84).\n       (B) If appropriations are enacted that fail to meet the \n     resource requirements set forth in the President's 10-year \n     plan, or if at any time more resources are required than \n     estimated in the President's 10-year plan, the President \n     shall submit to Congress, within 60 days of such enactment or \n     the identification of the requirement for such additional \n     resources, as appropriate, a report detailing--\n       (i) how the President proposes to remedy the resource \n     shortfall;\n       (ii) if additional resources are required, the proposed \n     level of funding required and an identification of the \n     stockpile work, campaign, facility, site, asset, program, \n     operation, activity, construction, or project for which \n     additional funds are required;\n       (iii) the impact of the resource shortfall on the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of United States nuclear forces; \n     and\n       (iv) whether and why, in the changed circumstances brought \n     about by the resource shortfall, it remains in the national \n     interest of the United States to remain a Party to the New \n     START Treaty.\n       (10) Annual report.--As full and faithful implementation is \n     key to realizing the benefits of the New START Treaty, the \n     President shall submit a report to the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Armed Services of the Senate not later than \n     January 31 of each year beginning with January 31, 2012, \n     which will provide--\n       (A) details on each Party's reductions in strategic \n     offensive arms between the date the New START Treaty entered \n     into force and December 31, 2011, or, in subsequent reports, \n     during the previous year;\n       (B) a certification that the Russian Federation is in \n     compliance with the terms of the New START Treaty, or a \n     detailed discussion of any noncompliance by the Russian \n     Federation;\n       (C) a certification that any conversion and elimination \n     procedures adopted pursuant to Article VI of the New START \n     Treaty and Part Three of the Protocol have not resulted in \n     ambiguities that could defeat the object and purpose of the \n     New START Treaty, or--\n       (i) a list of any cases in which a conversion or \n     elimination procedure that has been demonstrated by Russia \n     within the framework of the Bilateral Consultative Commission \n     remains ambiguous or does not achieve the goals set forth in \n     paragraph 2 or 3 of Section I of Part Three of the Protocol; \n     and\n       (ii) a comprehensive explanation of steps the United States \n     has taken with respect to each such case;\n       (D) an assessment of the operation of the New START \n     Treaty's transparency mechanisms, including--\n       (i) the extent to which either Party encrypted or otherwise \n     impeded the collection of telemetric information; and\n       (ii) the extent and usefulness of exchanges of telemetric \n     information; and\n       (E) an assessment of whether a strategic imbalance exists \n     that endangers the national security interests of the United \n     States.\n       (11) Strategic nuclear delivery vehicles.--Prior to the \n     entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President shall \n     certify to the Senate that the President intends to--\n       (A) modernize or replace the triad of strategic nuclear \n     delivery systems: a heavy bomber and air-launched cruise \n     missile, an ICBM, and an SSBN and SLBM; and\n       (B) maintain the United States rocket motor industrial \n     base.\n       (12) Tactical nuclear weapons.--(A) Prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate that--\n       (i) the United States will seek to initiate, following \n     consultation with NATO allies but not later than one year \n     after the entry into force of the New START Treaty, \n     negotiations with the Russian Federation on an agreement to \n     address the disparity between the non-strategic (tactical) \n     nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian Federation and of \n     the United States and to secure and reduce tactical nuclear \n     weapons in a verifiable manner; and\n       (ii) it is the policy of the United States that such \n     negotiations shall not include defensive missile systems.\n       (B) Not later than one year after the entry into force of \n     the New START Treaty, and annually thereafter for the \n     duration of the New START Treaty or until the conclusion of \n     an agreement pursuant to subparagraph (A), the President \n     shall submit to the Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed \n     Services of the Senate a report--\n       (i) detailing the steps taken to conclude the agreement \n     cited in subparagraph (A); and\n       (ii) analyzing the reasons why such an agreement has not \n     yet been concluded.\n       (C) Recognizing the difficulty the United States has faced \n     in ascertaining with confidence the number of tactical \n     nuclear weapons maintained by the Russian Federation and the \n     security of those weapons, the Senate urges the President to \n     engage the Russian Federation with the objectives of--\n       (i) establishing cooperative measures to give each Party to \n     the New START Treaty\n\n[[Page S10984]]\n\n     improved confidence regarding the accurate accounting and \n     security of tactical nuclear weapons maintained by the other \n     Party; and\n       (ii) providing United States or other international \n     assistance to help the Russian Federation ensure the accurate \n     accounting and security of its tactical nuclear weapons.\n       (13) Design and funding of certain facilities.--Prior to \n     the entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that the President intends to--\n       (A) accelerate to the extent possible the design and \n     engineering phase of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement (CMRR) building and the Uranium Processing \n     Facility (UPF); and\n       (B) request full funding, including on a multi-year basis \n     as appropriate, for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility upon \n     completion of the design and engineering phase for such \n     facilities.\n       (14) Effectiveness and viability of new start treaty and \n     united states missile defenses.--Prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate, and at the time of the exchange of instruments of \n     ratification shall communicate to the Russian Federation, \n     that it is the policy of the United States to continue \n     development and deployment of United States missile defense \n     systems to defend against missile threats from nations such \n     as North Korea and Iran, including qualitative and \n     quantitative improvements to such systems. Such systems \n     include all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defenses in Europe, the modernization of the Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense system, and the continued development of \n     the two-stage Ground-Based Interceptor as a technological and \n     strategic hedge. The United States believes that these \n     systems do not and will not threaten the strategic balance \n     with the Russian Federation. Consequently, while the United \n     States cannot circumscribe the sovereign rights of the \n     Russian Federation under paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the \n     Treaty, the United States believes continued improvement and \n     deployment of United States missile defense systems do not \n     constitute a basis for questioning the effectiveness and \n     viability of the Treaty, and therefore would not give rise to \n     circumstances justifying the withdrawal of the Russian \n     Federation from the Treaty.\n       (b) Understandings.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     to the ratification of the New START Treaty is subject to the \n     following understandings, which shall be included in the \n     instrument of ratification:\n       (1) Missile defense.--It is the understanding of the United \n     States that--\n       (A) the New START Treaty does not impose any limitations on \n     the deployment of missile defenses other than the \n     requirements of paragraph 3 of Article V of the New START \n     Treaty, which states, ``Each Party shall not convert and \n     shall not use ICBM launchers and SLBM launchers for placement \n     of missile defense interceptors therein. Each Party further \n     shall not convert and shall not use launchers of missile \n     defense interceptors for placement of ICBMs and SLBMs \n     therein. This provision shall not apply to ICBM launchers \n     that were converted prior to signature of this Treaty for \n     placement of missile defense interceptors therein.'';\n       (B) any additional New START Treaty limitations on the \n     deployment of missile defenses beyond those contained in \n     paragraph 3 of Article V, including any limitations agreed \n     under the auspices of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, \n     would require an amendment to the New START Treaty which may \n     enter into force for the United States only with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States;\n       (C) the April 7, 2010, unilateral statement by the Russian \n     Federation on missile defense does not impose a legal \n     obligation on the United States; and\n       (D) the preamble of the New START Treaty does not impose a \n     legal obligation on the Parties.\n       (2) Rail-mobile icbms.--It is the understanding of the \n     United States that--\n       (A) any rail-mobile-launched ballistic missile with a range \n     in excess of 5,500 kilometers would be an ICBM, as the term \n     is defined in paragraph 37 of Part One of the Protocol (in \n     the English-language numbering), for the purposes of the New \n     START Treaty, specifically including the limits in Article II \n     of the New START Treaty;\n       (B) an erector-launcher mechanism for launching an ICBM and \n     the railcar or flatcar on which it is mounted would be an \n     ICBM launcher, as the term is defined in paragraph 28 of Part \n     One of the Protocol (in the English-language numbering), for \n     the purposes of the New START Treaty, specifically including \n     the limits in Article II of the New START Treaty;\n       (C) if either Party should produce a rail-mobile ICBM \n     system, the Bilateral Consultative Commission would address \n     the application of other parts of the New START Treaty to \n     that system, including Articles III, IV, VI, VII, and XI of \n     the New START Treaty and relevant portions of the Protocol \n     and the Annexes to the Protocol; and\n       (D) an agreement reached pursuant to subparagraph (C) is \n     subject to the requirements of Article XV of the New START \n     Treaty and, specifically, if an agreement pursuant to \n     subparagraph (C) creates substantive rights or obligations \n     that differ significantly from those in the New START Treaty \n     regarding a ``mobile launcher of ICBMs'' as defined in Part \n     One of the Protocol to the New START Treaty, such agreement \n     will be considered an amendment to the New START Treaty \n     pursuant to Paragraph 1 of Article XV of the New START Treaty \n     and will be submitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent to ratification.\n       (3) Strategic-range, non-nuclear weapon systems.--It is the \n     understanding of the United States that--\n       (A) future, strategic-range non-nuclear weapon systems that \n     do not otherwise meet the definitions of the New START Treaty \n     will not be ``new kinds of strategic offensive arms'' subject \n     to the New START Treaty;\n       (B) nothing in the New START Treaty restricts United States \n     research, development, testing, and evaluation of strategic-\n     range, non-nuclear weapons, including any weapon that is \n     capable of boosted aerodynamic flight;\n       (C) nothing in the New START Treaty prohibits deployments \n     of strategic-range non-nuclear weapon systems; and\n       (D) the addition to the New START Treaty of--\n       (i) any limitations on United States research, development, \n     testing, and evaluation of strategic-range, non-nuclear \n     weapon systems, including any weapon that is capable of \n     boosted aerodynamic flight; or\n       (ii) any prohibition on the deployment of such systems, \n     including any such limitations or prohibitions agreed under \n     the auspices of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, would \n     require an amendment to the New START Treaty which may enter \n     into force for the United States only with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, section 2, \n     clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (c) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     the ratification of the New START Treaty is subject to the \n     following declarations, which express the intent of the \n     Senate:\n       (1) Missile defense.--(A) It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (i) pursuant to the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 \n     (Public Law 106-38), it is the policy of the United States \n     ``to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an \n     effective National Missile Defense system capable of \n     defending the territory of the United States against limited \n     ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, \n     or deliberate)'';\n       (ii) defenses against ballistic missiles are essential for \n     new deterrent strategies and for new strategies should \n     deterrence fail; and\n       (iii) further limitations on the missile defense \n     capabilities of the United States are not in the national \n     security interest of the United States.\n       (B) The New START Treaty and the April 7, 2010, unilateral \n     statement of the Russian Federation on missile defense do not \n     limit in any way, and shall not be interpreted as limiting, \n     activities that the United States Government currently plans \n     or that might be required over the duration of the New START \n     Treaty to protect the United States pursuant to the National \n     Missile Defense Act of 1999, or to protect United States \n     Armed Forces and United States allies from limited \n     ballistic missile attack, including further planned \n     enhancements to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system \n     and all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defense in Europe.\n       (C) Given its concern about missile defense issues, the \n     Senate expects the executive branch to offer regular \n     briefings, not less than twice each year, to the Committees \n     on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the Senate on all \n     missile defense issues related to the New START Treaty and on \n     the progress of United States-Russia dialogue and cooperation \n     regarding missile defense.\n       (2) Defending the united states and allies against \n     strategic attack.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) a paramount obligation of the United States Government \n     is to provide for the defense of the American people, \n     deployed members of the United States Armed Forces, and \n     United States allies against nuclear attacks to the best of \n     its ability;\n       (B) policies based on ``mutual assured destruction'' or \n     intentional vulnerability can be contrary to the safety and \n     security of both countries, and the United States and the \n     Russian Federation share a common interest in moving \n     cooperatively as soon as possible away from a strategic \n     relationship based on mutual assured destruction;\n       (C) in a world where biological, chemical, and nuclear \n     weapons and the means to deliver them are proliferating, \n     strategic stability can be enhanced by strategic defensive \n     measures;\n       (D) accordingly, the United States is and will remain free \n     to reduce the vulnerability to attack by constructing a \n     layered missile defense system capable of countering missiles \n     of all ranges;\n       (E) the United States will welcome steps by the Russian \n     Federation also to adopt a fundamentally defensive strategic \n     posture that no longer views robust strategic defensive \n     capabilities as undermining the overall strategic balance, \n     and stands ready to cooperate with the Russian Federation on \n     strategic defensive capabilities, as long as such cooperation \n     is aimed at fostering and in no way constrains the defensive \n     capabilities of both sides; and\n       (F) the United States is committed to improving United \n     States strategic defensive capabilities both quantitatively \n     and qualitatively during the period that the New\n\n[[Page S10985]]\n\n     START Treaty is in effect, and such improvements are \n     consistent with the Treaty.\n       (3) Conventionally armed, strategic-range weapon systems.--\n     Consistent with statements made by the United States that \n     such systems are not intended to affect strategic stability \n     with respect to the Russian Federation, the Senate finds that \n     conventionally armed, strategic-range weapon systems not co-\n     located with nuclear-armed systems do not affect strategic \n     stability between the United States and the Russian \n     Federation.\n       (4) Nunn-lugar cooperative threat reduction.--It is the \n     sense of the Senate that the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction (CTR) Program has made an invaluable contribution \n     to the security and elimination of weapons of mass \n     destruction, including nuclear weapons and materials in \n     Russia and elsewhere, and that the President should continue \n     the global CTR Program and CTR assistance to Russia, \n     including for the purpose of facilitating implementation of \n     the New START Treaty.\n       (5) Asymmetry in reductions.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, in conducting the reductions mandated by the New START \n     Treaty, the President should regulate reductions in United \n     States strategic offensive arms so that the number of \n     accountable strategic offensive arms under the New START \n     Treaty possessed by the Russian Federation in no case exceeds \n     the comparable number of accountable strategic offensive arms \n     possessed by the United States to such an extent that a \n     strategic imbalance endangers the national security interests \n     of the United States.\n       (6) Compliance.--(A) The New START Treaty will remain in \n     the interests of the United States only to the extent that \n     the Russian Federation is in strict compliance with its \n     obligations under the New START Treaty.\n       (B) Given its concern about compliance issues, the Senate \n     expects the executive branch to offer regular briefings, not \n     less than four times each year, to the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Armed Services of the Senate on compliance \n     issues related to the New START Treaty. Such briefings shall \n     include a description of all United States efforts in United \n     States-Russian diplomatic channels and bilateral fora to \n     resolve any compliance issues and shall include, but would \n     not necessarily be limited to, a description of--\n       (i) any compliance issues the United States plans to raise \n     with the Russian Federation at the Bilateral Consultative \n     Commission, in advance of such meetings; and\n       (ii) any compliance issues raised at the Bilateral \n     Consultative Commission, within thirty days of such meetings.\n       (7) Expansion of strategic arsenals in countries other than \n     russia.--It is the sense of the Senate that if, during the \n     time the New START Treaty remains in force, the President \n     determines that there has been an expansion of the strategic \n     arsenal of any country not party to the New START Treaty so \n     as to jeopardize the supreme interests of the United States, \n     then the President should consult on an urgent basis with the \n     Senate to determine whether adherence to the New START Treaty \n     remains in the national interest of the United States.\n       (8) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in condition \n     (1) of the resolution of advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range \n     Missiles, together with the related memorandum of \n     understanding and protocols (commonly referred to as the \n     ``INF Treaty''), approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and \n     condition (8) of the resolution of advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the Document Agreed Among the States Parties \n     to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) of \n     November 19, 1990 (commonly referred to as the ``CFE Flank \n     Document''), approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.\n       (9) Treaty modification or reinterpretation.--The Senate \n     declares that any agreement or understanding which in any \n     material way modifies, amends, or reinterprets United States \n     or Russian obligations under the New START Treaty, including \n     the time frame for implementation of the New START Treaty, \n     should be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent \n     to ratification.\n       (10) Consultations.--Given the continuing interest of the \n     Senate in the New START Treaty and in strategic offensive \n     reductions to the lowest possible levels consistent with \n     national security requirements and alliance obligations of \n     the United States, the Senate expects the President to \n     consult with the Senate prior to taking actions relevant to \n     paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article XIV of the New START Treaty.\n       (11) Further strategic arms reductions.--\n       (A) Recognizing the obligation under Article VI of the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow on July 1, 1968, ``to pursue \n     negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to \n     cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to \n     nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on general and complete \n     disarmament under strict and effective international \n     control,'' and in anticipation of the ratification and entry \n     into force of the New START Treaty, the Senate calls upon the \n     other nuclear weapon states to give careful and early \n     consideration to corresponding reductions of their own \n     nuclear arsenals.\n       (B) The Senate declares that further arms reduction \n     agreements obligating the United States to reduce or limit \n     the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in any \n     militarily significant manner may be made only pursuant to \n     the treaty-making power of the President as set forth in \n     Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n       (12) Modernization and replacement of united states \n     strategic delivery vehicles.--In accordance with paragraph 1 \n     of Article V of the New START Treaty, which states that, \n     ``Subject to the provisions of this Treaty, modernization and \n     replacement of strategic offensive arms may be carried out,'' \n     it is the sense of the Senate that United States deterrence \n     and flexibility is assured by a robust triad of strategic \n     delivery vehicles. To this end, the United States is \n     committed to accomplishing the modernization and replacement \n     of its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and to ensuring \n     the continued flexibility of United States conventional and \n     nuclear delivery systems.\n\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Under the previous order, the President will be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's consent to the resolution of \nratification.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I voted against \nthe New START treaty. The U.S. Senate is the deliberative body of \nCongress. Our forefathers created the Senate so issues of this \nmagnitude are thoroughly considered with all of the facts and with a \ncareful eye on all possible future consequences. With previous treaties \nof this magnitude, the full Senate has been allowed over a full year to \nconsider what the treaty would require of not only Russia but also the \nUnited States. That hasn't happened here, and it is a disconcerting \ntrend.\n  The executive branches of both the Russian and the U.S. governments \nstated they will not take actions during the negotiations of this \ntreaty that would be contrary to the spirit of the treaty. Both the \nRussian and U.S. governments recognize the treaty's implementation will \ntake time. The need to get this treaty right is paramount.\n  I am concerned that I haven't had all of my specific questions \nanswered about the treaty. Although members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee have had the opportunity to consider this treaty and ask many \nquestions, the full Senate has not had the chance to have all of their \nquestions answered. Forcing through a treaty without detailed scrutiny \nby the full Senate is not how our government should work.\n  Even with post-Cold War threats and adversaries, the nuclear balance \nbetween the United States and Russia remains a cornerstone to global \nnon-proliferation. That's why each member of the Senate must determine \nif he or she believes this treaty will make our Nation safer. We can \nonly do so if we have all the information about the treaty, and we can \nonly make it better if we have the opportunity to fully amend the \ntreaty.\n  During debate, we were repeatedly told that amending the treaty would \nkill it. That's just not true. Going back and forth on treaties is not \nnew. As with the original START, which was signed in 1991, the U.S. \nSenate did not accept the first version and required that a better \ntreaty be created.\n  We offered amendments that would have simply required that Russia be \nmore involved in the changes this treaty will require, stressing the \nimportance to the Russian government to create a safe global atmosphere \nsimilar to the United States. Those amendments were rejected. Only two \namendments, one about modernization of the nuclear weapons complex and \none stating that missile defense will proceed, were accepted by \nunanimous consent. The other amendments were either not considered or \nfailed. It is now up to the Russian Duma to consider the suggested \nchanges by the Senate's amendments and approve them or not. Both \ncountries should be willing to work hard on this front and the best \ntreaties, just like legislative bills, are those that are thoroughly \nconsidered by all involved with a willingness to comprehensively \naddress all concerns and needs.\n  Beyond the issues of Senate processes, I have concerns about certain \nprovisions in this treaty. It is impossible to fully consider this \ntreaty without being able to review the full negotiating record, which \nhas not been provided to all senators. Summaries have\n\n[[Page S10986]]\n\nbeen provided, but summaries do not include the specific information on \nhow the full implementation of this treaty will be done.\n  As a founding member of the Senate ICBM Coalition, I strongly believe \nthat all three legs of the nuclear triad--missiles, submarines, and \nbombers--must be maintained in order to retain a highly reliable and \ncredible deterrent nuclear force. This need is even greater as we \npotentially draw down some of our nuclear forces through the New START \ntreaty. I have worked with other members in the ICBM Coalition and with \nthe administration to encourage them to ensure the treaty does not harm \nthe triad. I appreciated the information provided by the administration \non the treaty and the opportunity to meet on this issue during the \nfloor debate. However, I remain deeply concerned about the implications \nthe treaty will have on our country's national security, particularly \nits potential effects on the current missile force structure. Without \nthe specific information on how the administration is going to \nimplement the treaty and concrete assurances that the current missile \nforce structure of 450 deployed and nondeployed silos be maintained, I \nremain skeptical of this agreement.\n  F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, WY, helps the United States \nmaintain one leg of the triad by operating part of the ICBM force. It \nis my obligation as a Senator from Wyoming to know what effects this \ntreaty will have on the missile defense missions in my home state. I \nalso respect and watch out for the servicemembers in the 90th Space \nCommand and 20th Missile Command who work hard to ensure our country \nhas a strong missile defense. I have not yet been able to get a firm \ncommitment from my Senate colleagues and the administration on a \nconcrete number of missiles that will be maintained under this treaty.\n  Furthermore, the treaty will require unilateral reductions from the \nUnited States with no similar requirements for Russia. Instead, the \nRussian government is actually given room to build up its nuclear \nforces with more modern capabilities.\n  Regardless of this agreement, the United States has not thoroughly \naddressed the modernization of our country's nuclear capabilities. I \nhave spoken with those involved in the treaty negotiations regarding \nU.S. modernization. I was told that the modernization efforts are in \nthe works and the funding for these activities is planned. I support \nthis more focused modernization approach. Part of the need for U.S. \nmodernization is to address our Nation's tactical weapons capabilities. \nAs currently written, the treaty will leave Russia in a 10-1 advantage \nin tactical nuclear weapons. This is disconcerting and modernization \nmust be a priority.\n  I have concerns about verifiability as well. Former Secretary of \nState James Baker has described the treaty's verification regime as \nweaker than its predecessor. If the United States is going to make \nreductions to our capabilities under this treaty, we should ensure that \nRussia is doing the same and following the treaty as closely as our \ncountry will. We should not settle for some verification--we must \nrequire full verification. Second best will do the United States no \ngood in terms of intelligence and response capabilities.\n  Back in 2002, I traveled to Russia with the University of Georgia to \ntalk about nonproliferation. At that time, I expressed serious concerns \nnot only about Russia's capabilities to secure their nuclear complex, \nbut also to ensure that their nuclear scientists and their knowledge \ndid not become available to bad actors like al-Qaida. Ensuring that \nRussia continues to keep their capabilities and know-how secure is \nimperative and cannot be left to second best.\n  Our two nations may approach nuclear agreements with different goals, \nbut the fact that the United States and Russian governments maintain a \ndialogue is a highly positive fact. We need and want the cooperation of \nour counterparts in Russia in both bilateral and multilateral efforts. \nThis is highlighted in the United Nations Security Council discussions \non nuclear weapons development in Iran, North Korea, and other actors.\n  We want and need to create a safer world while maintaining our \ndefensive capabilities for ourselves and our allies. By forcing debate \non this treaty during the lame duck session, I do not believe we were \nable to fully address all concerns in the detail that was warranted. We \nneeded to be sure the treaty does what we expect it to do without any \nsurprises. I am not convinced we will not see any surprises in the \nfuture. Thus, I voted against the New START treaty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "TREATY WITH RUSSIA ON MEASURES FOR FURTHER REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF \n                  STRATEGIC OFFENSIVE ARMS--Continued\n\n\tThe VICE PRESIDENT.

Each \n     such report may be submitted in either classified or \n     unclassified form.\n       (B) It is the sense of the Senate that monitoring Russian \n     Federation compliance with the New START Treaty is a high \n     priority and that the inability to do so would constitute a \n     threat to United States national security interests.\n       (3) Reductions.--(A) The New START Treaty shall not enter \n     into force until instruments of ratification have been \n     exchanged in accordance with Article XIV of the New START \n     Treaty.\n       (B) If, prior to the entry into force of the New START \n     Treaty, the President plans to implement reductions of United \n     States strategic nuclear forces below those currently planned \n     and consistent with the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive \n     Reductions, signed at Moscow on May 24, 2002 (commonly \n     referred to as ``the Moscow Treaty''), then the President \n     shall--\n       (i) consult with the Senate regarding the effect of such \n     reductions on the national security of the United States; and\n       (ii) take no such reductions until the President submits to \n     the Senate the President's determination that such reductions \n     are in the national security interest of the United States.\n       (4) Timely warning of breakout.--If the President \n     determines, after consultation with the Director of National \n     Intelligence, that the Russian Federation intends to break \n     out of the limits in Article II of the New START Treaty, the \n     President shall immediately inform the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Armed Services of the \n     Senate, with a view to determining whether circumstances \n     exist that jeopardize the supreme interests of the United \n     States, such that withdrawal from the New START Treaty may be \n     warranted pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the New \n     START Treaty.\n       (5) United states missile defense test telemetry.--Prior to \n     entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President shall \n     certify to the Senate that the New START Treaty does not \n     require, at any point during which it will be in force, the \n     United States to provide to the Russian Federation telemetric \n     information under Article IX of the New START Treaty, Part \n     Seven of the Protocol, and the Annex on Telemetric \n     Information to the Protocol for the launch of--\n       (A) any missile defense interceptor, as defined in \n     paragraph 44 of Part One of the Protocol to the New START \n     Treaty;\n       (B) any satellite launches, missile defense sensor targets, \n     and missile defense intercept targets, the launch of which \n     uses the first stage of an existing type of United States \n     ICBM or SLBM listed in paragraph 8 of Article III of the New \n     START Treaty; or\n       (C) any missile described in clause (a) of paragraph 7 of \n     Article III of the New START Treaty.\n       (6) Conventional prompt global strike.--(A) The Senate \n     calls on the executive branch to clarify its planning and \n     intent in developing future conventionally armed, strategic-\n     range weapon systems. To this end, prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall provide a \n     report to the Committees on Armed Services and Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate containing the following:\n       (i) A list of all conventionally armed, strategic-range \n     weapon systems that are currently under development.\n       (ii) An analysis of the expected capabilities of each \n     system listed under clause (i).\n       (iii) A statement with respect to each system listed under \n     clause (i) as to whether any of the limits in Article II of \n     the New START Treaty apply to such system.\n       (iv) An assessment of the costs, risks, and benefits of \n     each system.\n       (v) A discussion of alternative deployment options and \n     scenarios for each system.\n       (vi) A summary of the measures that could help to \n     distinguish each system listed under clause (i) from nuclear \n     systems and reduce the risks of misinterpretation and of a \n     resulting claim that such systems might alter strategic \n     stability.\n       (B) The report under subparagraph (A) may be supplemented \n     by a classified annex.\n       (C) If, at any time after the New START Treaty enters into \n     force, the President determines that deployment of \n     conventional warheads on ICBMs or SLBMs is required at levels \n     that cannot be accommodated within the limits in Article II \n     of the New START Treaty while sustaining a robust United \n     States nuclear triad, then the President shall immediately \n     consult with the Senate regarding the reasons for such \n     determination.\n       (7) United states telemetric information.--In implementing \n     Article IX of the New START Treaty, Part Seven of the \n     Protocol, and the Annex on Telemetric Information to the \n     Protocol, prior to agreeing to provide to the Russian \n     Federation any amount of telemetric information on a United \n     States test launch of a conventionally armed prompt global \n     strike system, the President shall certify to the Committees \n     on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the Senate that--\n       (A) the provision of United States telemetric information--\n       (i) consists of data that demonstrate that such system is \n     not subject to the limits in Article II of the New START \n     Treaty; or\n       (ii) would be provided in exchange for significant \n     telemetric information regarding a weapon system not listed \n     in paragraph 8 of Article III of the New START Treaty, or a \n     system not deployed by the Russian Federation prior to \n     December 5, 2009;\n       (B) it is in the national security interest of the United \n     States to provide such telemetric information; and\n       (C) provision of such telemetric information will not \n     undermine the effectiveness of such system.\n       (8) Bilateral consultative commission.--Not later than 15 \n     days before any meeting of the Bilateral Consultative \n     Commission to consider a proposal for additional measures to \n     improve the viability or effectiveness of the New START \n     Treaty or to resolve a question related to the applicability \n     of provisions of the New START Treaty to a new kind of \n     strategic offensive arm, the President shall consult with the \n     Chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate with regard to whether the \n     proposal, if adopted, would constitute an amendment to the \n     New START Treaty requiring the advice and consent of the \n     Senate, as set forth in Article II, section 2, clause 2 of \n     the Constitution of the United States.\n       (9) United states commitments ensuring the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of its nuclear forces.--(A) The \n     United States is committed to ensuring the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of its nuclear forces. It is the \n     sense of the Senate that--\n       (i) the United States is committed to proceeding with a \n     robust stockpile stewardship program, and to maintaining and \n     modernizing the nuclear weapons production capabilities and \n     capacities, that will ensure the safety, reliability, and \n     performance of the United States nuclear arsenal at the New \n     START Treaty levels and meet requirements for hedging against \n     possible international developments or technical problems, in \n     conformance with United States policies and to underpin \n     deterrence;\n       (ii) to that end, the United States is committed to \n     maintaining United States nuclear weapons laboratories and \n     preserving the core nuclear weapons competencies therein; and\n       (iii) the United States is committed to providing the \n     resources needed to achieve these objectives, at a minimum at \n     the levels set forth in the President's 10-year plan provided \n     to the Congress pursuant to section 1251 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law \n     111-84).\n       (B) If appropriations are enacted that fail to meet the \n     resource requirements set forth in the President's 10-year \n     plan, or if at any time more resources are required than \n     estimated in the President's 10-year plan, the President \n     shall submit to Congress, within 60 days of such enactment or \n     the identification of the requirement for such additional \n     resources, as appropriate, a report detailing--\n       (i) how the President proposes to remedy the resource \n     shortfall;\n       (ii) if additional resources are required, the proposed \n     level of funding required and an identification of the \n     stockpile work, campaign, facility, site, asset, program, \n     operation, activity, construction, or project for which \n     additional funds are required;\n       (iii) the impact of the resource shortfall on the safety, \n     reliability, and performance of United States nuclear forces; \n     and\n       (iv) whether and why, in the changed circumstances brought \n     about by the resource shortfall, it remains in the national \n     interest of the United States to remain a Party to the New \n     START Treaty.\n       (10) Annual report.--As full and faithful implementation is \n     key to realizing the benefits of the New START Treaty, the \n     President shall submit a report to the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Armed Services of the Senate not later than \n     January 31 of each year beginning with January 31, 2012, \n     which will provide--\n       (A) details on each Party's reductions in strategic \n     offensive arms between the date the New START Treaty entered \n     into force and December 31, 2011, or, in subsequent reports, \n     during the previous year;\n       (B) a certification that the Russian Federation is in \n     compliance with the terms of the New START Treaty, or a \n     detailed discussion of any noncompliance by the Russian \n     Federation;\n       (C) a certification that any conversion and elimination \n     procedures adopted pursuant to Article VI of the New START \n     Treaty and Part Three of the Protocol have not resulted in \n     ambiguities that could defeat the object and purpose of the \n     New START Treaty, or--\n       (i) a list of any cases in which a conversion or \n     elimination procedure that has been demonstrated by Russia \n     within the framework of the Bilateral Consultative Commission \n     remains ambiguous or does not achieve the goals set forth in \n     paragraph 2 or 3 of Section I of Part Three of the Protocol; \n     and\n       (ii) a comprehensive explanation of steps the United States \n     has taken with respect to each such case;\n       (D) an assessment of the operation of the New START \n     Treaty's transparency mechanisms, including--\n       (i) the extent to which either Party encrypted or otherwise \n     impeded the collection of telemetric information; and\n       (ii) the extent and usefulness of exchanges of telemetric \n     information; and\n       (E) an assessment of whether a strategic imbalance exists \n     that endangers the national security interests of the United \n     States.\n       (11) Strategic nuclear delivery vehicles.--Prior to the \n     entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President shall \n     certify to the Senate that the President intends to--\n       (A) modernize or replace the triad of strategic nuclear \n     delivery systems: a heavy bomber and air-launched cruise \n     missile, an ICBM, and an SSBN and SLBM; and\n       (B) maintain the United States rocket motor industrial \n     base.\n       (12) Tactical nuclear weapons.--(A) Prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate that--\n       (i) the United States will seek to initiate, following \n     consultation with NATO allies but not later than one year \n     after the entry into force of the New START Treaty, \n     negotiations with the Russian Federation on an agreement to \n     address the disparity between the non-strategic (tactical) \n     nuclear weapons stockpiles of the Russian Federation and of \n     the United States and to secure and reduce tactical nuclear \n     weapons in a verifiable manner; and\n       (ii) it is the policy of the United States that such \n     negotiations shall not include defensive missile systems.\n       (B) Not later than one year after the entry into force of \n     the New START Treaty, and annually thereafter for the \n     duration of the New START Treaty or until the conclusion of \n     an agreement pursuant to subparagraph (A), the President \n     shall submit to the Committees on Foreign Relations and Armed \n     Services of the Senate a report--\n       (i) detailing the steps taken to conclude the agreement \n     cited in subparagraph (A); and\n       (ii) analyzing the reasons why such an agreement has not \n     yet been concluded.\n       (C) Recognizing the difficulty the United States has faced \n     in ascertaining with confidence the number of tactical \n     nuclear weapons maintained by the Russian Federation and the \n     security of those weapons, the Senate urges the President to \n     engage the Russian Federation with the objectives of--\n       (i) establishing cooperative measures to give each Party to \n     the New START Treaty \n     improved confidence regarding the accurate accounting and \n     security of tactical nuclear weapons maintained by the other \n     Party; and\n       (ii) providing United States or other international \n     assistance to help the Russian Federation ensure the accurate \n     accounting and security of its tactical nuclear weapons.\n       (13) Design and funding of certain facilities.--Prior to \n     the entry into force of the New START Treaty, the President \n     shall certify to the Senate that the President intends to--\n       (A) accelerate to the extent possible the design and \n     engineering phase of the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement (CMRR) building and the Uranium Processing \n     Facility (UPF); and\n       (B) request full funding, including on a multi-year basis \n     as appropriate, for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research \n     Replacement building and the Uranium Processing Facility upon \n     completion of the design and engineering phase for such \n     facilities.\n       (14) Effectiveness and viability of new start treaty and \n     united states missile defenses.--Prior to the entry into \n     force of the New START Treaty, the President shall certify to \n     the Senate, and at the time of the exchange of instruments of \n     ratification shall communicate to the Russian Federation, \n     that it is the policy of the United States to continue \n     development and deployment of United States missile defense \n     systems to defend against missile threats from nations such \n     as North Korea and Iran, including qualitative and \n     quantitative improvements to such systems. Such systems \n     include all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defenses in Europe, the modernization of the Ground-based \n     Midcourse Defense system, and the continued development of \n     the two-stage Ground-Based Interceptor as a technological and \n     strategic hedge. The United States believes that these \n     systems do not and will not threaten the strategic balance \n     with the Russian Federation. Consequently, while the United \n     States cannot circumscribe the sovereign rights of the \n     Russian Federation under paragraph 3 of Article XIV of the \n     Treaty, the United States believes continued improvement and \n     deployment of United States missile defense systems do not \n     constitute a basis for questioning the effectiveness and \n     viability of the Treaty, and therefore would not give rise to \n     circumstances justifying the withdrawal of the Russian \n     Federation from the Treaty.\n       (b) Understandings.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     to the ratification of the New START Treaty is subject to the \n     following understandings, which shall be included in the \n     instrument of ratification:\n       (1) Missile defense.--It is the understanding of the United \n     States that--\n       (A) the New START Treaty does not impose any limitations on \n     the deployment of missile defenses other than the \n     requirements of paragraph 3 of Article V of the New START \n     Treaty, which states, ``Each Party shall not convert and \n     shall not use ICBM launchers and SLBM launchers for placement \n     of missile defense interceptors therein. Each Party further \n     shall not convert and shall not use launchers of missile \n     defense interceptors for placement of ICBMs and SLBMs \n     therein. This provision shall not apply to ICBM launchers \n     that were converted prior to signature of this Treaty for \n     placement of missile defense interceptors therein.'';\n       (B) any additional New START Treaty limitations on the \n     deployment of missile defenses beyond those contained in \n     paragraph 3 of Article V, including any limitations agreed \n     under the auspices of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, \n     would require an amendment to the New START Treaty which may \n     enter into force for the United States only with the advice \n     and consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States;\n       (C) the April 7, 2010, unilateral statement by the Russian \n     Federation on missile defense does not impose a legal \n     obligation on the United States; and\n       (D) the preamble of the New START Treaty does not impose a \n     legal obligation on the Parties.\n       (2) Rail-mobile icbms.--It is the understanding of the \n     United States that--\n       (A) any rail-mobile-launched ballistic missile with a range \n     in excess of 5,500 kilometers would be an ICBM, as the term \n     is defined in paragraph 37 of Part One of the Protocol (in \n     the English-language numbering), for the purposes of the New \n     START Treaty, specifically including the limits in Article II \n     of the New START Treaty;\n       (B) an erector-launcher mechanism for launching an ICBM and \n     the railcar or flatcar on which it is mounted would be an \n     ICBM launcher, as the term is defined in paragraph 28 of Part \n     One of the Protocol (in the English-language numbering), for \n     the purposes of the New START Treaty, specifically including \n     the limits in Article II of the New START Treaty;\n       (C) if either Party should produce a rail-mobile ICBM \n     system, the Bilateral Consultative Commission would address \n     the application of other parts of the New START Treaty to \n     that system, including Articles III, IV, VI, VII, and XI of \n     the New START Treaty and relevant portions of the Protocol \n     and the Annexes to the Protocol; and\n       (D) an agreement reached pursuant to subparagraph (C) is \n     subject to the requirements of Article XV of the New START \n     Treaty and, specifically, if an agreement pursuant to \n     subparagraph (C) creates substantive rights or obligations \n     that differ significantly from those in the New START Treaty \n     regarding a ``mobile launcher of ICBMs'' as defined in Part \n     One of the Protocol to the New START Treaty, such agreement \n     will be considered an amendment to the New START Treaty \n     pursuant to Paragraph 1 of Article XV of the New START Treaty \n     and will be submitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent to ratification.\n       (3) Strategic-range, non-nuclear weapon systems.--It is the \n     understanding of the United States that--\n       (A) future, strategic-range non-nuclear weapon systems that \n     do not otherwise meet the definitions of the New START Treaty \n     will not be ``new kinds of strategic offensive arms'' subject \n     to the New START Treaty;\n       (B) nothing in the New START Treaty restricts United States \n     research, development, testing, and evaluation of strategic-\n     range, non-nuclear weapons, including any weapon that is \n     capable of boosted aerodynamic flight;\n       (C) nothing in the New START Treaty prohibits deployments \n     of strategic-range non-nuclear weapon systems; and\n       (D) the addition to the New START Treaty of--\n       (i) any limitations on United States research, development, \n     testing, and evaluation of strategic-range, non-nuclear \n     weapon systems, including any weapon that is capable of \n     boosted aerodynamic flight; or\n       (ii) any prohibition on the deployment of such systems, \n     including any such limitations or prohibitions agreed under \n     the auspices of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, would \n     require an amendment to the New START Treaty which may enter \n     into force for the United States only with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, section 2, \n     clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (c) Declarations.--The advice and consent of the Senate to \n     the ratification of the New START Treaty is subject to the \n     following declarations, which express the intent of the \n     Senate:\n       (1) Missile defense.--(A) It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (i) pursuant to the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 \n     (Public Law 106-38), it is the policy of the United States \n     ``to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an \n     effective National Missile Defense system capable of \n     defending the territory of the United States against limited \n     ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, \n     or deliberate)'';\n       (ii) defenses against ballistic missiles are essential for \n     new deterrent strategies and for new strategies should \n     deterrence fail; and\n       (iii) further limitations on the missile defense \n     capabilities of the United States are not in the national \n     security interest of the United States.\n       (B) The New START Treaty and the April 7, 2010, unilateral \n     statement of the Russian Federation on missile defense do not \n     limit in any way, and shall not be interpreted as limiting, \n     activities that the United States Government currently plans \n     or that might be required over the duration of the New START \n     Treaty to protect the United States pursuant to the National \n     Missile Defense Act of 1999, or to protect United States \n     Armed Forces and United States allies from limited \n     ballistic missile attack, including further planned \n     enhancements to the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system \n     and all phases of the Phased Adaptive Approach to missile \n     defense in Europe.\n       (C) Given its concern about missile defense issues, the \n     Senate expects the executive branch to offer regular \n     briefings, not less than twice each year, to the Committees \n     on Foreign Relations and Armed Services of the Senate on all \n     missile defense issues related to the New START Treaty and on \n     the progress of United States-Russia dialogue and cooperation \n     regarding missile defense.\n       (2) Defending the united states and allies against \n     strategic attack.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) a paramount obligation of the United States Government \n     is to provide for the defense of the American people, \n     deployed members of the United States Armed Forces, and \n     United States allies against nuclear attacks to the best of \n     its ability;\n       (B) policies based on ``mutual assured destruction'' or \n     intentional vulnerability can be contrary to the safety and \n     security of both countries, and the United States and the \n     Russian Federation share a common interest in moving \n     cooperatively as soon as possible away from a strategic \n     relationship based on mutual assured destruction;\n       (C) in a world where biological, chemical, and nuclear \n     weapons and the means to deliver them are proliferating, \n     strategic stability can be enhanced by strategic defensive \n     measures;\n       (D) accordingly, the United States is and will remain free \n     to reduce the vulnerability to attack by constructing a \n     layered missile defense system capable of countering missiles \n     of all ranges;\n       (E) the United States will welcome steps by the Russian \n     Federation also to adopt a fundamentally defensive strategic \n     posture that no longer views robust strategic defensive \n     capabilities as undermining the overall strategic balance, \n     and stands ready to cooperate with the Russian Federation on \n     strategic defensive capabilities, as long as such cooperation \n     is aimed at fostering and in no way constrains the defensive \n     capabilities of both sides; and\n       (F) the United States is committed to improving United \n     States strategic defensive capabilities both quantitatively \n     and qualitatively during the period that the New \n     START Treaty is in effect, and such improvements are \n     consistent with the Treaty.\n       (3) Conventionally armed, strategic-range weapon systems.--\n     Consistent with statements made by the United States that \n     such systems are not intended to affect strategic stability \n     with respect to the Russian Federation, the Senate finds that \n     conventionally armed, strategic-range weapon systems not co-\n     located with nuclear-armed systems do not affect strategic \n     stability between the United States and the Russian \n     Federation.\n       (4) Nunn-lugar cooperative threat reduction.--It is the \n     sense of the Senate that the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat \n     Reduction (CTR) Program has made an invaluable contribution \n     to the security and elimination of weapons of mass \n     destruction, including nuclear weapons and materials in \n     Russia and elsewhere, and that the President should continue \n     the global CTR Program and CTR assistance to Russia, \n     including for the purpose of facilitating implementation of \n     the New START Treaty.\n       (5) Asymmetry in reductions.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, in conducting the reductions mandated by the New START \n     Treaty, the President should regulate reductions in United \n     States strategic offensive arms so that the number of \n     accountable strategic offensive arms under the New START \n     Treaty possessed by the Russian Federation in no case exceeds \n     the comparable number of accountable strategic offensive arms \n     possessed by the United States to such an extent that a \n     strategic imbalance endangers the national security interests \n     of the United States.\n       (6) Compliance.--(A) The New START Treaty will remain in \n     the interests of the United States only to the extent that \n     the Russian Federation is in strict compliance with its \n     obligations under the New START Treaty.\n       (B) Given its concern about compliance issues, the Senate \n     expects the executive branch to offer regular briefings, not \n     less than four times each year, to the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Armed Services of the Senate on compliance \n     issues related to the New START Treaty. Such briefings shall \n     include a description of all United States efforts in United \n     States-Russian diplomatic channels and bilateral fora to \n     resolve any compliance issues and shall include, but would \n     not necessarily be limited to, a description of--\n       (i) any compliance issues the United States plans to raise \n     with the Russian Federation at the Bilateral Consultative \n     Commission, in advance of such meetings; and\n       (ii) any compliance issues raised at the Bilateral \n     Consultative Commission, within thirty days of such meetings.\n       (7) Expansion of strategic arsenals in countries other than \n     russia.--It is the sense of the Senate that if, during the \n     time the New START Treaty remains in force, the President \n     determines that there has been an expansion of the strategic \n     arsenal of any country not party to the New START Treaty so \n     as to jeopardize the supreme interests of the United States, \n     then the President should consult on an urgent basis with the \n     Senate to determine whether adherence to the New START Treaty \n     remains in the national interest of the United States.\n       (8) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in condition \n     (1) of the resolution of advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the Treaty Between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the \n     Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter Range \n     Missiles, together with the related memorandum of \n     understanding and protocols (commonly referred to as the \n     ``INF Treaty''), approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and \n     condition (8) of the resolution of advice and consent to the \n     ratification of the Document Agreed Among the States Parties \n     to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) of \n     November 19, 1990 (commonly referred to as the ``CFE Flank \n     Document''), approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.\n       (9) Treaty modification or reinterpretation.--The Senate \n     declares that any agreement or understanding which in any \n     material way modifies, amends, or reinterprets United States \n     or Russian obligations under the New START Treaty, including \n     the time frame for implementation of the New START Treaty, \n     should be submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent \n     to ratification.\n       (10) Consultations.--Given the continuing interest of the \n     Senate in the New START Treaty and in strategic offensive \n     reductions to the lowest possible levels consistent with \n     national security requirements and alliance obligations of \n     the United States, the Senate expects the President to \n     consult with the Senate prior to taking actions relevant to \n     paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article XIV of the New START Treaty.\n       (11) Further strategic arms reductions.--\n       (A) Recognizing the obligation under Article VI of the \n     Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at \n     Washington, London, and Moscow on July 1, 1968, ``to pursue \n     negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to \n     cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to \n     nuclear disarmament and on a treaty on general and complete \n     disarmament under strict and effective international \n     control,'' and in anticipation of the ratification and entry \n     into force of the New START Treaty, the Senate calls upon the \n     other nuclear weapon states to give careful and early \n     consideration to corresponding reductions of their own \n     nuclear arsenals.\n       (B) The Senate declares that further arms reduction \n     agreements obligating the United States to reduce or limit \n     the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States in any \n     militarily significant manner may be made only pursuant to \n     the treaty-making power of the President as set forth in \n     Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n       (12) Modernization and replacement of united states \n     strategic delivery vehicles.--In accordance with paragraph 1 \n     of Article V of the New START Treaty, which states that, \n     ``Subject to the provisions of this Treaty, modernization and \n     replacement of strategic offensive arms may be carried out,'' \n     it is the sense of the Senate that United States deterrence \n     and flexibility is assured by a robust triad of strategic \n     delivery vehicles. To this end, the United States is \n     committed to accomplishing the modernization and replacement \n     of its strategic nuclear delivery vehicles, and to ensuring \n     the continued flexibility of United States conventional and \n     nuclear delivery systems.\n\n\tThe VICE PRESIDENT. Under the previous order, the President will be immediately notified of the Senate's consent to the resolution of ratification.\n\tMr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to explain why I voted against the New START treaty. The U.S. Senate is the deliberative body of Congress. Our forefathers created the Senate so issues of this magnitude are thoroughly considered with all of the facts and with a careful eye on all possible future consequences. With previous treaties of this magnitude, the full Senate has been allowed over a full year to consider what the treaty would require of not only Russia but also the United States. That hasn't happened here, and it is a disconcerting trend.\n\tThe executive branches of both the Russian and the U.S. governments stated they will not take actions during the negotiations of this treaty that would be contrary to the spirit of the treaty. Both the Russian and U.S. governments recognize the treaty's implementation will take time. The need to get this treaty right is paramount.\n\tI am concerned that I haven't had all of my specific questions answered about the treaty. Although members of the Foreign Relations Committee have had the opportunity to consider this treaty and ask many questions, the full Senate has not had the chance to have all of their questions answered. Forcing through a treaty without detailed scrutiny by the full Senate is not how our government should work.\n\tEven with post-Cold War threats and adversaries, the nuclear balance between the United States and Russia remains a cornerstone to global non-proliferation. That's why each member of the Senate must determine if he or she believes this treaty will make our Nation safer. We can only do so if we have all the information about the treaty, and we can only make it better if we have the opportunity to fully amend the treaty.\n\tDuring debate, we were repeatedly told that amending the treaty would kill it. That's just not true. Going back and forth on treaties is not new. As with the original START, which was signed in 1991, the U.S. Senate did not accept the first version and required that a better treaty be created.\n\tWe offered amendments that would have simply required that Russia be more involved in the changes this treaty will require, stressing the importance to the Russian government to create a safe global atmosphere similar to the United States. Those amendments were rejected. Only two amendments, one about modernization of the nuclear weapons complex and one stating that missile defense will proceed, were accepted by unanimous consent. The other amendments were either not considered or failed. It is now up to the Russian Duma to consider the suggested changes by the Senate's amendments and approve them or not. Both countries should be willing to work hard on this front and the best treaties, just like legislative bills, are those that are thoroughly considered by all involved with a willingness to comprehensively address all concerns and needs.\n\tBeyond the issues of Senate processes, I have concerns about certain provisions in this treaty. It is impossible to fully consider this treaty without being able to review the full negotiating record, which has not been provided to all senators. Summaries have been provided, but summaries do not include the specific information on how the full implementation of this treaty will be done.\n\tAs a founding member of the Senate ICBM Coalition, I strongly believe that all three legs of the nuclear triad--missiles, submarines, and bombers--must be maintained in order to retain a highly reliable and credible deterrent nuclear force. This need is even greater as we potentially draw down some of our nuclear forces through the New START treaty. I have worked with other members in the ICBM Coalition and with the administration to encourage them to ensure the treaty does not harm the triad. I appreciated the information provided by the administration on the treaty and the opportunity to meet on this issue during the floor debate. However, I remain deeply concerned about the implications the treaty will have on our country's national security, particularly its potential effects on the current missile force structure. Without the specific information on how the administration is going to implement the treaty and concrete assurances that the current missile force structure of 450 deployed and nondeployed silos be maintained, I remain skeptical of this agreement.\n\tF.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, WY, helps the United States maintain one leg of the triad by operating part of the ICBM force. It is my obligation as a Senator from Wyoming to know what effects this treaty will have on the missile defense missions in my home state. I also respect and watch out for the servicemembers in the 90th Space Command and 20th Missile Command who work hard to ensure our country has a strong missile defense. I have not yet been able to get a firm commitment from my Senate colleagues and the administration on a concrete number of missiles that will be maintained under this treaty.\n\tFurthermore, the treaty will require unilateral reductions from the United States with no similar requirements for Russia. Instead, the Russian government is actually given room to build up its nuclear forces with more modern capabilities.\n\tRegardless of this agreement, the United States has not thoroughly addressed the modernization of our country's nuclear capabilities. I have spoken with those involved in the treaty negotiations regarding U.S. modernization. I was told that the modernization efforts are in the works and the funding for these activities is planned. I support this more focused modernization approach. Part of the need for U.S. modernization is to address our Nation's tactical weapons capabilities. As currently written, the treaty will leave Russia in a 10-1 advantage in tactical nuclear weapons. This is disconcerting and modernization must be a priority.\n\tI have concerns about verifiability as well. Former Secretary of State James Baker has described the treaty's verification regime as weaker than its predecessor. If the United States is going to make reductions to our capabilities under this treaty, we should ensure that Russia is doing the same and following the treaty as closely as our country will. We should not settle for some verification--we must require full verification. Second best will do the United States no good in terms of intelligence and response capabilities.\n\tBack in 2002, I traveled to Russia with the University of Georgia to talk about nonproliferation. At that time, I expressed serious concerns not only about Russia's capabilities to secure their nuclear complex, but also to ensure that their nuclear scientists and their knowledge did not become available to bad actors like al-Qaida. Ensuring that Russia continues to keep their capabilities and know-how secure is imperative and cannot be left to second best.\n\tOur two nations may approach nuclear agreements with different goals, but the fact that the United States and Russian governments maintain a dialogue is a highly positive fact. We need and want the cooperation of our counterparts in Russia in both bilateral and multilateral efforts. This is highlighted in the United Nations Security Council discussions on nuclear weapons development in Iran, North Korea, and other actors.\n\tWe want and need to create a safer world while maintaining our defensive capabilities for ourselves and our allies. By forcing debate on this treaty during the lame duck session, I do not believe we were able to fully address all concerns in the detail that was warranted. We needed to be sure the treaty does what we expect it to do without any surprises. I am not convinced we will not see any surprises in the future. Thus, I voted against the New START treaty.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Harry Reid", "John F. Kerry", "Jon Kyl", "Michael B.

Under the previous order, the question occurs on \nthe following nomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk reported the nomination of Mary Helen \nMurguia, of Arizona, to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Judge Mary \nMurguia to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Murguia has served on the Federal district court in Arizona for \na decade and has a distinguished record that has earned the respect of \nthe legal community in Arizona.\n  Perhaps most telling is the high regard in which Judge Murguia is \nheld by her colleagues on the district court; they come from different \nbackgrounds and were appointed by presidents of both parties, but they \nall speak very highly of her.\n  Judge Murguia was approved by the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 19 \nto 0. That unanimous vote is an indication of the strength of her \nrecord.\n  Finally, as I mentioned at Judge Murguia's hearing, Judge Murguia's \nbrother Carlos is the first Latino to serve as Federal district court \njudge in Kansas. Judge Murguia was the first Latina to be appointed to \nthe Federal district court in Arizona and she and Carlos are the only \nbrother and sister sitting as Federal judges in the United States.\n  I am confident that Judge Murguia is a person of integrity who will \ndo her best to be a fair and objective judge.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is finally being allowed \nto consider a judicial nomination that has been stalled since August--\nthe nomination of Judge Mary Murguia of Arizona to serve on the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I would understand the \nresistance to considering the nomination if President Obama had \nselected someone opposed by her home state Senators. But both \nRepublican home state Senators support this nomination. Unlike his \npredecessor, President Obama has worked with home state Senators, \nincluding Republican Senators. Despite all his efforts, this consensus \nnominee has been stalled for months and months while awaiting final \nSenate action.\n  When the nomination was considered by the Judiciary Committee before \nthe August recess, it was reported unanimously. Every Republican and \nevery Democrat, all 19 members of the Judiciary Committee, voted in \nfavor of her nomination. Still, she has been stalled for months and \nmonths. This is part of the dangerous pattern perpetrated the past two \nyears as President Obama's highly-qualified judicial nominees have been \nstalled from final Senate action for extended periods. This is another \nexample of the unnecessary delays that have led to a judicial vacancies \ncrisis throughout the country. Judicial vacancies have skyrocketed to \nover 100 while nominations are forced to languish without final Senate \naction. In fact, President Obama's nominees have been forced to wait on \naverage six times longer to be considered than President Bush's \njudicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee during the first \n2 years of his Presidency.\n  When the Senate is finally allowed to take action, most of his \nnominations are confirmed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities or \nunanimously. Final Senate action on dozens of President Obama's \njudicial nominations has been delayed without explanation or good \nreason and then confirmed unanimously. The most outrageous examples\n\n[[Page S10987]]\n\nare Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia, who was confirmed unanimously to \nthe Fourth Circuit, and Judge Denny Chin of New York, who was confirmed \nunanimously to the Second Circuit. Both required cloture petitions to \nend the filibusters against their confirmations and then they were each \nconfirmed unanimously.\n  Others confirmed unanimously after months of delay are Judge James A. \nWynn, Jr. of North Carolina, who was finally confirmed to the Fourth \nCircuit after almost 6 months of delay; Judge Albert Diaz of North \nCarolina, who was finally confirmed to the Fourth Circuit after almost \n11 month's delay; Judge Ray Lohier of New York, who was finally \nconfirmed to the Second Circuit after almost 8 months of delay; Judge \nBeverly Martin of Tennessee, who was finally confirmed to the Eleventh \nCircuit after more than 4 months of delay; and James Greenaway of New \nJersey, who was finally confirmed to the Third Circuit after almost 4 \nmonths of delay. I expect Scott Matheson of Utah to be confirmed \nunanimously to the Tenth Circuit, but not until there have been 6 \nmonths of unnecessary delay. I will not be surprised if Judge Murguia \nis confirmed unanimously, or nearly unanimously, after 4 unnecessary \nmonths of delay.\n  Examples of district court nominees who have been delayed for between \n3 and 7 months before being confirmed unanimously are: Judge Kimberly \nJ. Mueller of the Eastern District of California, Judge Catherine \nEagles of the Middle District of North Carolina, Judge John A. Gibney, \nJr. of the Eastern District of Virginia, Judge Ellen Hollander of the \nDistrict of Maryland, Judge Susan R. Nelson of the District of \nMinnesota, Judge James Bredar of the District of Maryland, Judge \nCarlton Reeves of the Southern District of Mississippi, Judge Edmond \nChang of the Northern District of Illinois, Judge Leslie E. Kobayashi \nof the District of Hawaii, and Judge Denise Casper of the District of \nMassachusetts.\n  Ten years ago, Mary Murguia became the first Latina to serve as a \nFederal Judge in Arizona when she was nominated by President Clinton to \nserve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. She will \nnow become the first Hispanic--and only the second woman--from Arizona \nto serve on the Ninth Circuit. I congratulate Judge Murguia and her \nfamily on her confirmation by the Senate today.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is, shall the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of Mary Helen Murguia, of Arizona, to be a U.S. Circuit \nJudge for the 9th Circuit.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. \nFeingold), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from \nMissouri (Mrs. McCaskill), the Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow), \nand the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

In fact, President Obama's nominees have been forced to wait on average six times longer to be considered than President Bush's judicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee during the first 2 years of his Presidency.\n\tWhen the Senate is finally allowed to take action, most of his nominations are confirmed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities or unanimously. Final Senate action on dozens of President Obama's judicial nominations has been delayed without explanation or good reason and then confirmed unanimously. The most outrageous examples are Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia, who was confirmed unanimously to the Fourth Circuit, and Judge Denny Chin of New York, who was confirmed unanimously to the Second Circuit. Both required cloture petitions to end the filibusters against their confirmations and then they were each confirmed unanimously.\n\tOthers confirmed unanimously after months of delay are Judge James A. Wynn, Jr. of North Carolina, who was finally confirmed to the Fourth Circuit after almost 6 months of delay; Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina, who was finally confirmed to the Fourth Circuit after almost 11 month's delay; Judge Ray Lohier of New York, who was finally confirmed to the Second Circuit after almost 8 months of delay; Judge Beverly Martin of Tennessee, who was finally confirmed to the Eleventh Circuit after more than 4 months of delay; and James Greenaway of New Jersey, who was finally confirmed to the Third Circuit after almost 4 months of delay. I expect Scott Matheson of Utah to be confirmed unanimously to the Tenth Circuit, but not until there have been 6 months of unnecessary delay. I will not be surprised if Judge Murguia is confirmed unanimously, or nearly unanimously, after 4 unnecessary months of delay.\n\tExamples of district court nominees who have been delayed for between 3 and 7 months before being confirmed unanimously are: Judge Kimberly J. Mueller of the Eastern District of California, Judge Catherine Eagles of the Middle District of North Carolina, Judge John A. Gibney, Jr. of the Eastern District of Virginia, Judge Ellen Hollander of the District of Maryland, Judge Susan R. Nelson of the District of Minnesota, Judge James Bredar of the District of Maryland, Judge Carlton Reeves of the Southern District of Mississippi, Judge Edmond Chang of the Northern District of Illinois, Judge Leslie E. Kobayashi of the District of Hawaii, and Judge Denise Casper of the District of Massachusetts.\n\tTen years ago, Mary Murguia became the first Latina to serve as a Federal Judge in Arizona when she was nominated by President Clinton to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. She will now become the first Hispanic--and only the second woman--from Arizona to serve on the Ninth Circuit. I congratulate Judge Murguia and her family on her confirmation by the Senate today.\n\tThe VICE PRESIDENT. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n\tThe question is, shall the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Mary Helen Murguia, of Arizona, to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the 9th Circuit.\n\tThe clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe legislative clerk called the roll.\n\tMr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. Feingold), the Senator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from Missouri (Mrs. McCaskill), the Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n\tMr. KYL.

Mr. President, at long last, the Senate is being allowed \nto consider long-pending, consensus judicial nominations. This action \nhas been long overdue. President Obama has reached out and worked with \nSenators from both sides of the aisle in selecting well-qualified \njudicial nominees. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have bent \nover backwards to be fair to all sides. There has been consultation and \na thorough and fair process for evaluating nominations.\n  Scott M. Matheson is finally being confirmed to become a Federal \ncircuit judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In \nhis 30-year legal career, he has been both a State and a Federal \nprosecutor, worked in private practice, and served on the faculty of \nthe S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, including 8 \nyears as the school's dean. The Judiciary Committee unanimously \nreported his nomination on June 10, more than 6 months ago. We did so \nunanimously. The Republican Senators from Utah supported this \nnomination. It has still taken more than 6 months to get a Senate vote.\n  Ten years ago, Mary Murguia became the first Latina to serve as a \nFederal judge in Arizona when she was nominated by President Clinton to \nserve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. She will \nnow become the first Hispanic--and only the second woman--from Arizona \nto serve on the Ninth Circuit. The Judiciary Committee unanimously \nvoted to report her nomination favorably more than 4 months ago. Judge \nMurguia's nomination was supported by her home State Senators, both \nRepublicans. It has still taken more than 4 months to get a Senate \nvote.\n  Kathleen M. O'Malley has for the last 16 years served as a Federal \njudge in the Northern District of Ohio. When Judge O'Malley, a breast \ncancer survivor, was appointed to that court in 1994, she was one of \nthe two youngest women on the Federal bench. She has been nominated to \nserve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The \nJudiciary Committee unanimously reported her nomination to the Federal \nCircuit in September, 3 months ago. The Committee received a letter of \nsupport from Senator Voinovich, who urged an expeditious confirmation \nprocess. It has still taken 3 months to get a Senate vote.\n  The Senate is finally being allowed to fill some of the vacancies on \nthe hard-pressed U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The \nJudiciary Committee unanimously reported the nominations of Beryl \nHowell and Robert Wilkins back in September. It has taken 3 months to \nget Senate votes. The chief judge of the District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia wrote the Senate some time ago urging prompt \naction to fill the four vacancies that exist on that Court.\n  There was a time when having served for 10 years as a respected \nmember of the Judiciary Committee staff would lead to expeditious \nconsideration of a nomination. For example, when Kristi Lee Dubose of \nAlabama, who had served on Senator Sessions' Judiciary Committee staff, \nwas nominated, her hearing was expedited despite the lack of an ABA \npeer review, her nomination was reported by the committee within 2 days \nof her hearing and that nomination was then confirmed promptly. Indeed, \nthe time Judge Dubose's questionnaire was received by the committee to \nthe date of her confirmation was 61 days, which includes a 3-week \nrecess period.\n  By contrast, Ms. Howell's nomination was delayed after her hearing \nfor 57 days before the committee was allowed to vote and has been \nstalled for 89 days on the Senate Executive Calendar. Since her \nquestionnaire was received by the committee, it has been 160 days. This \nis no reflection on Ms. Howell, whose credentials, work experience, \ntemperament, and qualifications are beyond reproach.\n  There are more than a dozen additional consensus judicial nominations \nthat have been through the entire process but are being denied a final \nvote. I know of no precedent for this. Indeed, in the lameduck session \nat the end of President Bush's second year in office, we proceeded to \nreport and confirm controversial circuit court nominees. That the \nSenate is not being allowed to consider these consensus nominees is a \nshame and an unnecessary burden on them and their families and for the \ncourts and people they would serve. It is a travesty that all of the \nwell-qualified nominees favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee \ncould not be confirmed before this Congress adjourns. That is what we \ndid when we confirmed 100 judicial nominees of President Bush in 2001 \nand 2002. All 100 of the nominees reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee received Senate votes and were confirmed--all 100. They \ninclude 20 during the lameduck session that year and circuit court \nnominees reported after the election.\n  This year, consensus nominees are not being allowed to be considered. \nThese nominees include one unanimously reported circuit court nominee \nand another circuit court nominee supported by 17 of the 19 Senators on \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  President Obama has nominated James E. Graves to fill one of two \nemergency vacancies on the Fifth Circuit. Currently, Justice Graves is \nthe only African American on the Mississippi Supreme Court. If \nconfirmed, he would be the second African American to sit on the Fifth \nCircuit, the first from Mississippi. His nomination has the strong \nsupport of both of his Republican home State Senators. The ABA Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him ``well \nqualified'', its highest possible rating. The Judiciary Committee \nreported him unanimously. Yet he is not being allowed a vote.\n  Susan Carney is nominated to fill one of 3 emergency vacancies on the \nSecond Circuit. After working for 17 years in private practice, she \nserved as associate general counsel of the Peace Corps, and she is \ncurrently the deputy general counsel of Yale University. Ms. Carney's \nnomination has the strong support of both of her home State Senators. \nHer nomination was reported with the support of five of the seven \nRepublicans serving on the Judiciary Committee and by a vote of 17 to \n2. She is not being allowed a vote.\n  There are 13 more district court nominees who were reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee that the Senate is not being \nallowed to consider.\n  President Obama nominated Amy Totenberg to fill an emergency vacancy \non the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in \nMarch. Ms. Totenberg's nomination has the support of her two Republican \nhome state Senators. Currently a lawyer in private practice in Atlanta, \nshe also serves as a special master for the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Maryland and as a court-appointed mediator for the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. Previously, she was \ngeneral counsel to the Atlanta Board of Education and a part-time \nmunicipal court judge. She earned the highest possible rating, \nunanimously ``well qualified,'' from the ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary. Her nomination was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  James E. Boasberg was nominated to fill another of the vacancies on \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Since 2002, Judge \nBoasberg has served as a judge on the Superior Court of the District of \nColumbia, a position to which he was appointed by President George W. \nBush. Previously, Judge Boasberg was a Federal prosecutor and an \nattorney in private practice. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary rated him unanimously ``well qualified,'' its highest \npossible rating, to become a Federal judge. His nomination was reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Amy Berman Jackson was nominated to fill the other current vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of\n\n[[Page S10989]]\n\nColumbia. Ms. Jackson is currently a partner at the Washington, D.C., \nlaw firm Trout Cacheris.? Previously, she was a partner in Venable's \nWashington, D.C., office, and she also served as a Federal prosecutor \nin the District of Columbia. Ms. Jackson earned the highest possible \nrating, unanimously ``well qualified,'' from the ABA Standing Committee \non the Federal Judiciary. Her nomination was reported unanimously by \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  President Obama nominated James E. Shadid to fill an emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nIllinois, a court that currently has only one active judge. Judge \nShadid is currently a judge on the Tenth Judicial Circuit in Peoria \nCounty, IL. Previously, he was a sole practitioner in Peoria, a part-\ntime commissioner on the Illinois Court of Claims, and a part-time \nassistant public defender in the Peoria County Public Defender's \nOffice. When he was appointed to serve as a State judge, Judge Shadid \nbecame the first Arab-American judge in Illinois. He will become the \nonly Federal Arab-American judge in the State and one of only \napproximately four Arab-American Federal judges in the country. His \nnomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Sue E. Myerscough was also nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. She is \ncurrently the presiding justice on the Fourth District Appellate Court \nof Illinois, and she previously sat on the Seventh Judicial Circuit of \nIllinois, first as associate judge and then as circuit judge. In all, \nJustice Myerscough has more than 23 years of judicial experience. She \nalso serves as an adjunct associate professor in the Department of \nMedical Humanities at the Southern Illinois University School of \nMedicine. Justice Myerscough was first nominated to serve as a Federal \njudge in 1995, but her nomination was returned to the President after \nthe Senate failed to act on it. Her nomination was reported unanimously \nby the Judiciary Committee.\n  President Obama nominated Paul K. Holmes, III, to fill an emergency \nvacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of \nArkansas. Mr. Holmes is currently of counsel at the Fort Smith, AR, law \nfirm where he formerly worked for more than two decades as an associate \nand a partner. Previously, he was the U.S. attorney for the Western \nDistrict of Arkansas. As U.S. attorney, Holmes served for 2 years on \nthe Attorney General's Advisory Committee. Mr. Holmes earned the \nhighest possible rating--unanimously ``well qualified''--from the ABA \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, and he has the strong \nsupport of his two home State Senators. His nomination was reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Anthony J. Battaglia was nominated to become a Federal judge on the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, the court \nhe has served as a magistrate Judge for 17 years. He is a former \npresident of the Federal Magistrate Judges Association and of the San \nDiego County Bar Association. Prior to taking the bench, Judge \nBattaglia worked for nearly two decades as a civil litigator in private \npractice. He has the strong support of both of his home State Senators, \nand the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave him its \nhighest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified.'' His nomination \nwas reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Judge Edward J. Davila was nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. \nCurrently a judge on the Superior Court of California, Judge Davila \npreviously spent 20 years as a trial lawyer, first as a deputy public \ndefender in the Santa Clara County Public Defender's Office and then as \na lawyer in private practice. He also has taught trial advocacy course \nsessions at Stanford Law School, Santa Clara University School of Law, \nand the University of San Francisco School of Law. If confirmed, Judge \nDavila will become the first Latino to take the Federal bench in the \nBay area in more than 15 years. He has the strong support of his two \nhome State Senators. His nomination was reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  President Obama nominated Diana Saldana to fill an emergency vacancy \nin the Southern District of Texas, the district she has served as a \nmagistrate judge since 2006. Before taking the bench, Judge Saldana \nserved the Southern District for 5 years as a Federal prosecutor, and \nshe previously was a lawyer in private practice and a trial attorney in \nthe Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. The child \nof migrant farm workers, Judge Saldana began working alongside her \nfamily in the sugar beet fields at age 10, and she continued to do so \nfor more than a decade. After graduating from law school, she served as \na law clerk to then-Chief Judge George P. Kazen. If confirmed, Judge \nSaldana will fill the vacancy created by Judge Kazen's retirement. \nJudge Saldana earned the highest possible rating--unanimously ``well \nqualified''--from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. \nShe has the strong support of her two Republican home State Senators. \nSenator Cornyn called her ``one of the toughest law enforcers in South \nTexas,'' and Senator Hutchison added that Judge Saldana ``has some of \nthe finest qualities we expect in our judges.'' Her nomination was \nreported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Max O. Cogburn was nominated to sit on the U.S. District Court for \nthe Western District of North Carolina, the district that he previously \nserved for 9 years as a magistrate judge and for 12 years as an \nassistant U.S. attorney. Mr. Cogburn is currently a partner in the \nAsheville, NC, law firm, Cogburn and Brazil, and he also serves as an \nappointed member of the North Carolina Education Lottery Commission. In \naddition to practicing law, Mr. Cogburn owns and maintains with his \nsiblings the Pisgah View Ranch, a dude ranch that has been in his \nfamily for generations. Mr. Cogburn has the strong, bipartisan support \nof his two home State Senators, a Republican and a Democrat. His \nnomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Marco A. Hernandez was nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. He has served as a \njudge in Oregon's 20th Judicial District for the last 15 years, first \non the district court and now as a circuit court judge. Previously, \nJudge Hernandez was a deputy district attorney in Washington County, \nOR, and a lawyer for Oregon Legal Services. Judge Hernandez has the \nstrong support of his two home State Senators, and he has now been \nnominated to this position by Presidents of both parties. If confirmed, \nhe will become the first Latino to serve as a Federal Judge in Oregon. \nHis nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. I \nalso note that Senator Sessions made quite a fuss that he was not \nconfirmed at the end of the Bush administration while Senator Sessions \nproceeded to delay Committee consideration of his nomination and while \nRepublicans still refuse to allow it to be considered before \nadjournment.\n  President Obama nominated Steve Jones to fill an emergency vacancy on \nthe U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. For the \nlast 15 years, Judge Jones has been a superior court judge in the Tenth \nSuperior Court District of Georgia, and he currently serves that \ndistrict as the presiding judge on the Felony Drug Court as well. \nPreviously, he was a judge on the Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court \nand an assistant district attorney for the Western Judicial Circuit. \nJudge Jones was the first African American to serve the Western \nJudicial Circuit as a superior court judge. He will be the only active \nAfrican-American judge on the Northern District of Georgia and one of \nonly two active African-American judges in the State. Judge Jones \nearned the highest possible rating--unanimously ``well qualified''--\nfrom the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, and he has \nthe strong support of his two Republican home State Senators. His \nnomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Michael Simon was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Oregon. He is currently a partner at the law firm of \nPerkins Coie LLP, where he serves as head of the litigation practice at \nthe Portland office. In that capacity, Mr. Simon has handled\n\n[[Page S10990]]\n\nseveral high-profile first amendment cases on a pro-bono basis. Before \njoining that firm, Mr. Simon was a trial attorney in the Antitrust \nDivision of the U.S. Department of Justice. Mr. Simon has the strong \nsupport of his two home State Senators. His nomination was reported by \nthe Committee with strong bipartisan support.\n  These consensus nominees are in addition to the other highly \nqualified nominations on which the Senate has not been allowed to vote \nfor many months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n\tMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at long last, the Senate is being allowed to consider long-pending, consensus judicial nominations. This action has been long overdue. President Obama has reached out and worked with Senators from both sides of the aisle in selecting well-qualified judicial nominees. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have bent over backwards to be fair to all sides. There has been consultation and a thorough and fair process for evaluating nominations.\n\tScott M. Matheson is finally being confirmed to become a Federal circuit judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. In his 30-year legal career, he has been both a State and a Federal prosecutor, worked in private practice, and served on the faculty of the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah, including 8 years as the school's dean. The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination on June 10, more than 6 months ago. We did so unanimously. The Republican Senators from Utah supported this nomination. It has still taken more than 6 months to get a Senate vote.\n\tTen years ago, Mary Murguia became the first Latina to serve as a Federal judge in Arizona when she was nominated by President Clinton to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. She will now become the first Hispanic--and only the second woman--from Arizona to serve on the Ninth Circuit. The Judiciary Committee unanimously voted to report her nomination favorably more than 4 months ago. Judge Murguia's nomination was supported by her home State Senators, both Republicans. It has still taken more than 4 months to get a Senate vote.\n\tKathleen M. O'Malley has for the last 16 years served as a Federal judge in the Northern District of Ohio. When Judge O'Malley, a breast cancer survivor, was appointed to that court in 1994, she was one of the two youngest women on the Federal bench. She has been nominated to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported her nomination to the Federal Circuit in September, 3 months ago. The Committee received a letter of support from Senator Voinovich, who urged an expeditious confirmation process. It has still taken 3 months to get a Senate vote.\n\tThe Senate is finally being allowed to fill some of the vacancies on the hard-pressed U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the nominations of Beryl Howell and Robert Wilkins back in September. It has taken 3 months to get Senate votes. The chief judge of the District Court for the District of Columbia wrote the Senate some time ago urging prompt action to fill the four vacancies that exist on that Court.\n\tThere was a time when having served for 10 years as a respected member of the Judiciary Committee staff would lead to expeditious consideration of a nomination. For example, when Kristi Lee Dubose of Alabama, who had served on Senator Sessions' Judiciary Committee staff, was nominated, her hearing was expedited despite the lack of an ABA peer review, her nomination was reported by the committee within 2 days of her hearing and that nomination was then confirmed promptly. Indeed, the time Judge Dubose's questionnaire was received by the committee to the date of her confirmation was 61 days, which includes a 3-week recess period.\n\tBy contrast, Ms. Howell's nomination was delayed after her hearing for 57 days before the committee was allowed to vote and has been stalled for 89 days on the Senate Executive Calendar. Since her questionnaire was received by the committee, it has been 160 days. This is no reflection on Ms. Howell, whose credentials, work experience, temperament, and qualifications are beyond reproach.\n\tThere are more than a dozen additional consensus judicial nominations that have been through the entire process but are being denied a final vote. I know of no precedent for this. Indeed, in the lameduck session at the end of President Bush's second year in office, we proceeded to report and confirm controversial circuit court nominees. That the Senate is not being allowed to consider these consensus nominees is a shame and an unnecessary burden on them and their families and for the courts and people they would serve. It is a travesty that all of the well-qualified nominees favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee could not be confirmed before this Congress adjourns. That is what we did when we confirmed 100 judicial nominees of President Bush in 2001 and 2002. All 100 of the nominees reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee received Senate votes and were confirmed--all 100. They include 20 during the lameduck session that year and circuit court nominees reported after the election.\n\tThis year, consensus nominees are not being allowed to be considered. These nominees include one unanimously reported circuit court nominee and another circuit court nominee supported by 17 of the 19 Senators on the Judiciary Committee.\n\tPresident Obama has nominated James E. Graves to fill one of two emergency vacancies on the Fifth Circuit. Currently, Justice Graves is the only African American on the Mississippi Supreme Court. If confirmed, he would be the second African American to sit on the Fifth Circuit, the first from Mississippi. His nomination has the strong support of both of his Republican home State Senators. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated him ``well qualified'', its highest possible rating. The Judiciary Committee reported him unanimously. Yet he is not being allowed a vote.\n\tSusan Carney is nominated to fill one of 3 emergency vacancies on the Second Circuit. After working for 17 years in private practice, she served as associate general counsel of the Peace Corps, and she is currently the deputy general counsel of Yale University. Ms. Carney's nomination has the strong support of both of her home State Senators. Her nomination was reported with the support of five of the seven Republicans serving on the Judiciary Committee and by a vote of 17 to 2. She is not being allowed a vote.\n\tThere are 13 more district court nominees who were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee that the Senate is not being allowed to consider.\n\tPresident Obama nominated Amy Totenberg to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in March. Ms. Totenberg's nomination has the support of her two Republican home state Senators. Currently a lawyer in private practice in Atlanta, she also serves as a special master for the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland and as a court-appointed mediator for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Previously, she was general counsel to the Atlanta Board of Education and a part-time municipal court judge. She earned the highest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified,'' from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Her nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tJames E. Boasberg was nominated to fill another of the vacancies on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Since 2002, Judge Boasberg has served as a judge on the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, a position to which he was appointed by President George W. Bush. Previously, Judge Boasberg was a Federal prosecutor and an attorney in private practice. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated him unanimously ``well qualified,'' its highest possible rating, to become a Federal judge. His nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tAmy Berman Jackson was nominated to fill the other current vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Ms. Jackson is currently a partner at the Washington, D.C., law firm Trout Cacheris.? Previously, she was a partner in Venable's Washington, D.C., office, and she also served as a Federal prosecutor in the District of Columbia. Ms. Jackson earned the highest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified,'' from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. Her nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tPresident Obama nominated James E. Shadid to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, a court that currently has only one active judge. Judge Shadid is currently a judge on the Tenth Judicial Circuit in Peoria County, IL. Previously, he was a sole practitioner in Peoria, a part-time commissioner on the Illinois Court of Claims, and a part-time assistant public defender in the Peoria County Public Defender's Office. When he was appointed to serve as a State judge, Judge Shadid became the first Arab-American judge in Illinois. He will become the only Federal Arab-American judge in the State and one of only approximately four Arab-American Federal judges in the country. His nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tSue E. Myerscough was also nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois. She is currently the presiding justice on the Fourth District Appellate Court of Illinois, and she previously sat on the Seventh Judicial Circuit of Illinois, first as associate judge and then as circuit judge. In all, Justice Myerscough has more than 23 years of judicial experience. She also serves as an adjunct associate professor in the Department of Medical Humanities at the Southern Illinois University School of Medicine. Justice Myerscough was first nominated to serve as a Federal judge in 1995, but her nomination was returned to the President after the Senate failed to act on it. Her nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tPresident Obama nominated Paul K. Holmes, III, to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas. Mr. Holmes is currently of counsel at the Fort Smith, AR, law firm where he formerly worked for more than two decades as an associate and a partner. Previously, he was the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Arkansas. As U.S. attorney, Holmes served for 2 years on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee. Mr. Holmes earned the highest possible rating--unanimously ``well qualified''--from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, and he has the strong support of his two home State Senators. His nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tAnthony J. Battaglia was nominated to become a Federal judge on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, the court he has served as a magistrate Judge for 17 years. He is a former president of the Federal Magistrate Judges Association and of the San Diego County Bar Association. Prior to taking the bench, Judge Battaglia worked for nearly two decades as a civil litigator in private practice. He has the strong support of both of his home State Senators, and the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave him its highest possible rating, unanimously ``well qualified.'' His nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tJudge Edward J. Davila was nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Currently a judge on the Superior Court of California, Judge Davila previously spent 20 years as a trial lawyer, first as a deputy public defender in the Santa Clara County Public Defender's Office and then as a lawyer in private practice. He also has taught trial advocacy course sessions at Stanford Law School, Santa Clara University School of Law, and the University of San Francisco School of Law. If confirmed, Judge Davila will become the first Latino to take the Federal bench in the Bay area in more than 15 years. He has the strong support of his two home State Senators. His nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tPresident Obama nominated Diana Saldana to fill an emergency vacancy in the Southern District of Texas, the district she has served as a magistrate judge since 2006. Before taking the bench, Judge Saldana served the Southern District for 5 years as a Federal prosecutor, and she previously was a lawyer in private practice and a trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. The child of migrant farm workers, Judge Saldana began working alongside her family in the sugar beet fields at age 10, and she continued to do so for more than a decade. After graduating from law school, she served as a law clerk to then-Chief Judge George P. Kazen. If confirmed, Judge Saldana will fill the vacancy created by Judge Kazen's retirement. Judge Saldana earned the highest possible rating--unanimously ``well qualified''--from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. She has the strong support of her two Republican home State Senators. Senator Cornyn called her ``one of the toughest law enforcers in South Texas,'' and Senator Hutchison added that Judge Saldana ``has some of the finest qualities we expect in our judges.'' Her nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tMax O. Cogburn was nominated to sit on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, the district that he previously served for 9 years as a magistrate judge and for 12 years as an assistant U.S. attorney. Mr. Cogburn is currently a partner in the Asheville, NC, law firm, Cogburn and Brazil, and he also serves as an appointed member of the North Carolina Education Lottery Commission. In addition to practicing law, Mr. Cogburn owns and maintains with his siblings the Pisgah View Ranch, a dude ranch that has been in his family for generations. Mr. Cogburn has the strong, bipartisan support of his two home State Senators, a Republican and a Democrat. His nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tMarco A. Hernandez was nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. He has served as a judge in Oregon's 20th Judicial District for the last 15 years, first on the district court and now as a circuit court judge. Previously, Judge Hernandez was a deputy district attorney in Washington County, OR, and a lawyer for Oregon Legal Services. Judge Hernandez has the strong support of his two home State Senators, and he has now been nominated to this position by Presidents of both parties. If confirmed, he will become the first Latino to serve as a Federal Judge in Oregon. His nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee. I also note that Senator Sessions made quite a fuss that he was not confirmed at the end of the Bush administration while Senator Sessions proceeded to delay Committee consideration of his nomination and while Republicans still refuse to allow it to be considered before adjournment.\n\tPresident Obama nominated Steve Jones to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. For the last 15 years, Judge Jones has been a superior court judge in the Tenth Superior Court District of Georgia, and he currently serves that district as the presiding judge on the Felony Drug Court as well. Previously, he was a judge on the Athens-Clarke County Municipal Court and an assistant district attorney for the Western Judicial Circuit. Judge Jones was the first African American to serve the Western Judicial Circuit as a superior court judge. He will be the only active African-American judge on the Northern District of Georgia and one of only two active African-American judges in the State. Judge Jones earned the highest possible rating--unanimously ``well qualified''--from the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, and he has the strong support of his two Republican home State Senators. His nomination was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n\tMichael Simon was nominated to the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. He is currently a partner at the law firm of Perkins Coie LLP, where he serves as head of the litigation practice at the Portland office. In that capacity, Mr. Simon has handled several high-profile first amendment cases on a pro-bono basis. Before joining that firm, Mr. Simon was a trial attorney in the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. Mr. Simon has the strong support of his two home State Senators. His nomination was reported by the Committee with strong bipartisan support.\n\tThese consensus nominees are in addition to the other highly qualified nominations on which the Senate has not been allowed to vote for many months.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Patrick J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm my strong \ncommitment to have the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act \nenacted into law. This bill is of great importance to all of the people \nof Hawaii. The bill would simply put the State of Hawaii on equal \nfooting with the rest of the country in the treatment of its indigenous \npeople. It provides a process for the reorganization of a Native \nHawaiian governing entity. However, since I first introduced this \ncommonsense bill 10 years ago, it has been the subject of misleading \nattacks and procedural hurdles, and has never had the opportunity for \nan up-or-down vote here on the Senate floor.\n  Earlier this month, a handful of my colleagues who oppose this \nmeasure put out a press release, fueling speculation that I was seeking \nto attach this bill to must-pass, end-of-session legislation. One of \nthese colleagues said that this measure--and I quote, ``should be \nbrought up separately and debated openly on the Senate floor with the \nopportunity for amendment.''\n  I could not agree more.\n  A structured debate followed by an up-or-down vote on this \nlegislation is long overdue. The people of Hawaii have waited for far \ntoo long.\n  This Congress, the bill was favorably reported by the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, and it was passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. Despite this, it was not given an opportunity to be \ndebated and voted on, here on the Senate floor.\n  I am deeply disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to \nconsider this bill during the 111th Congress. This historic Congress \nsaw a great many accomplishments on behalf of the American people, but \ntragically, it also saw unprecedented obstruction.\n  I remain committed to passing this bill. I am hopeful that, when we \nconvene next year in the new Congress, I can count on every one of my \ncolleagues to be supportive of my efforts to bring this bill to the \nSenate floor.\n  The Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act is a Hawaii-\nspecific measure. In the long traditions of the U.S. Senate, it was \nconsidered a courtesy to stand with your colleagues on matters \nspecifically addressing the needs of their home State. This civility \nseems to have vanished from this Chamber.\n  It is frustrating to me that some of my colleagues have worked \naggressively to block this bill. For some reason, they have made it a \npriority to prevent the people of my State from moving forward to \nresolve issues caused by the illegal overthrow of the Native Hawaiian \ngovernment in 1893.\n\n[[Page S10991]]\n\n  This bill has widespread support among elected leaders and the \ncitizens of Hawaii. Both chambers of the Hawaii State Legislature have \nvoiced their support of the measure, and our new Governor, Neil \nAbercrombie, was the chief sponsor of the bill in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. This legislation is also supported by community and \ncivic organizations, including the Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs \nand the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, and the Office of \nHawaiian Affairs, a State agency.\n  The bill also has broad support outside of Hawaii. Indigenous leaders \nand community organizations across the United States support the bill, \nsuch as the Alaska Federation of Natives and the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians.\n  The American Bar Association sent a letter this year to Members of \nthe Senate reaffirming its support and outlining the sound \nConstitutional basis for the legislation. The ABA wrote, ``The right of \nNative Hawaiians to use the property held in trust for them and the \nright to govern those assets are not in conflict with the Equal \nProtection Clause since they rest on independent constitutional \nauthority regarding the rights of native nations contained in Articles \nI and II of the Constitution.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat this letter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. The bill also has the support of the Obama Administration. \nWhen the measure passed the House in February of this year, the White \nHouse Press Secretary issued a statement noting that President Obama, \n``looks forward to signing the bill into law and establishing a \ngovernment-to-government relationship with Native Hawaiians.'' And \nearlier this month, Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of the \nInterior Ken Salazar wrote to the Senate Leaders to reiterate the \nadministration's support for the Native--Hawaiian Government \nReorganization Act, and to make note of the urgent need for this bill. \nThe letter reads, ``Of the Nation's three major indigenous groups, \nNative Hawaiians--unlike American Indians and Alaska Natives--are the \nonly one that currently lacks a government-to-government relationship \nwith the United States.'' I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of \nthis letter printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. Opponents have spread misinformation about the bill. Let \nme set the record straight. This bill does not allow Hawaii to secede \nfrom the United States. It does not allow private lands to be taken. It \ndoes not authorize gaming in Hawaii.\n  Opponents of the bill also distort the history of the Native Hawaiian \npeople. I welcome the chance to speak with any of my colleagues about \nthe history of my great State and of its indigenous people.

Developed by Native Hawaiians, this federally \n     recognized entity would serve, maintain and support their \n     unique cultural and civic needs and advocate on their behalf \n     at the federal and state levels. Prior to the overthrow of \n     the Hawaiian monarchy in 1893 by U.S. agents acting without \n     official sanction, Native Hawaiians lived under an organized \n     political framework governed by the rule of law.

However, Native Hawaiians, in seeking \n     rights and privileges that other indigenous people of the \n     United States enjoy under our system of law, are not \n     compromising the rights of others but exercising their own \n     rights to property, to self-determination, and to be \n     recognized as an indigenous people by Congress.\n       The right of Native Hawaiians to use of the property held \n     in trust for them and the right to govern those assets are \n     not in conflict with the Equal Protection Clause since they \n     rest on independent constitutional authority regarding the \n     rights of native nations contained in Articles I and II of \n     the Constitution.

Once the Native Hawaiian government is \n     created and its leaders elected, the United States would \n     officially recognize the new governing entity and work with \n     it on a government-to-government basis, just as the United \n     States works with federally recognized Indian tribes in other \n     States.\n       Senator Akaka first introduced a version of this \n     legislation more than a decade ago. Since 1999, Senator \n     Akaka, Senator Inouye, and other members of Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation have worked tirelessly with the last \n     three Administrations--and especially with our Departments--\n     to greatly improve the bill, which has now received \n     bipartisan support from the House of Representatives, the \n     Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and Hawaii's Governor and \n     Attorney General.\n       Of the Nation's there major indigenous groups, Native \n     Hawaiians--unlike American Indians and Alaska Natives--are \n     the only one that currently lacks a government-to-government \n     relationship with the United States. This bill provides \n     Native Hawaiians a means by which to exercise the inherent \n     rights to local self-government, self-determination, and \n     economic self-sufficiency that other Native Americans enjoy.\n       For these reasons, we urge the Senate to pass the Native \n     Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2010 and send it to \n     the President for his signature.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that \n     enactment of this legislation would be in accord with the \n     Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n     Ken Salazar,\n       Secretary of the Interior.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n              [From the Honolulu Advertiser, May 3, 2010]\n\n 66% of Hawaii Residents Favor Recognition for Native Hawaiians--Poll \n            Shows Slight Uptick From 2006, When 63% Approved\n\n                         (By Gordon Y.K. Pang)\n\n       Hawai'i residents still favor federal recognition of Native \n     Hawaiians by a 2-to-1 margin, the latest Advertiser Hawai'i \n     Poll numbers show.\n       Polling conducted last week found that 66 percent of the \n     participants support Native Hawaiians being ``recognized by \n     Congress and the federal government as a distinct group, \n     similar to the special recognition given to American Indians \n     and Alaskan Natives.''\n       Such recognition could come about under a process created \n     by the Akaka bill, formally known as the Native Hawaiian \n     Government Reorganization Act of 2009. The bill passed the \n     U.S. House in February and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.\n       The Hawai'i Poll appears to indicate that, in recent years, \n     a large segment of Hawai'i residents have settled into how \n     they think about federal recognition and the Akaka bill. In \n     2000, the Advertiser Hawai'i Poll showed 73 percent in favor \n     of federal recognition. That support appeared to dip in the \n     latter part of the decade, when in 2006 the poll showed 63 \n     percent of respondents in favor of recognition.\n       The poll was conducted by locally based Ward Research Inc. \n     with a sampling size of 604 respondents.\n       Over the course of the last decade, during the \n     administrations of President George W. Bush and President \n     Obama, language in the Akaka bill has been widely debated and \n     amended in the effort to get it passed.\n       Gov. Linda Lingle and her administration oppose the current \n     version of the bill. Lingle had been a strong and influential \n     supporter of the bill, but now believes this version grants \n     too much authority to the Native Hawaiian entity at the onset \n     of negotiations that would take place among the entity and \n     the state and the federal governments.\n       For instance, it would grant ``sovereign immunity'' to the \n     entity and its employees from the state's criminal, public \n     health, child safety and environmental laws.\n       Clyde Namu'o, administrator of the Office of Hawaiian \n     Affairs, said he is ``not surprised and actually pleased'' by \n     the latest poll numbers, especially given the new opposition \n     by Lingle and others.\n       ``It's fairly consistent with the polls that we did,'' \n     Namu'o said. ``Obviously, there's still a majority of the \n     people who still support'' federal recognition.\n       Two of three major candidates in the 1st Congressional \n     District special election, Democrat Ed Case and Republican \n     Charles Djou, have said they do not support the current \n     language of the bill that passed the House, leaving Democrat \n     Colleen Hanabusa as the sole staunch supporter.\n\n\n                             `Nobody knows'\n\n       Longtime opponents of the Akaka bill and/or federal \n     recognition said the Hawai'i Poll numbers show only that a \n     majority of Hawai'i residents don't know what federal \n     recognition means.\n       ``I think the big problem is nobody knows what's inside the \n     bill,'' said Thurston Twigg-Smith, former Honolulu Advertiser \n     owner. ``They keep changing it, people don't have a chance to \n     read it.''\n       Congress should hold hearings on the measure in Hawai'i so \n     the public can get a better understanding of the language, he \n     said.\n       Hawaiian rights activist Dennis Pu'uhonua ``Bumpy'' \n     Kanahele said the poll ``only tells me that people aren't \n     even aware of what the Akaka bill is all about.''\n       The state's politicians and ``mainstream Hawaiian \n     organizations'' support the bill and not other models of \n     self-determination, such as complete independence from the \n     U.S. government, he said.\n       Kanahele said that's why he's been pushing for a \n     constitutional convention, so Hawaiians can look at the \n     different models and determine what's best.\n       Among the 115 poll respondents who identified themselves as \n     Native Hawaiians, 82 percent said they support federal \n     recognition. Among other ethnic groups, 66 percent of those \n     describing themselves as Japanese support it, while 61 \n     percent of Filipinos and Caucasians indicated support.\n       Only 58 percent of those who identified themselves as 55 \n     and older support federal recognition, while 72 percent of \n     those ages 35 to 54 support it, and 79 percent of those under \n     35 do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "HELPING HEROES KEEP THEIR HOMES ACT OF 2010\n\n\tMr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm my strong commitment to have the Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act enacted into law. This bill is of great importance to all of the people of Hawaii. The bill would simply put the State of Hawaii on equal footing with the rest of the country in the treatment of its indigenous people. It provides a process for the reorganization of a Native Hawaiian governing entity. However, since I first introduced this commonsense bill 10 years ago, it has been the subject of misleading attacks and procedural hurdles, and has never had the opportunity for an up-or-down vote here on the Senate floor.\n\tEarlier this month, a handful of my colleagues who oppose this measure put out a press release, fueling speculation that I was seeking to attach this bill to must-pass, end-of-session legislation. One of these colleagues said that this measure--and I quote, ``should be brought up separately and debated openly on the Senate floor with the opportunity for amendment.''\n\tI could not agree more.\n\tA structured debate followed by an up-or-down vote on this legislation is long overdue. The people of Hawaii have waited for far too long.\n\tThis Congress, the bill was favorably reported by the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and it was passed by the House of Representatives. Despite this, it was not given an opportunity to be debated and voted on, here on the Senate floor.\n\tI am deeply disappointed that we did not have the opportunity to consider this bill during the 111th Congress. This historic Congress saw a great many accomplishments on behalf of the American people, but tragically, it also saw unprecedented obstruction.\n\tI remain committed to passing this bill. I am hopeful that, when we convene next year in the new Congress, I can count on every one of my colleagues to be supportive of my efforts to bring this bill to the Senate floor.\n\tThe Native Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act is a Hawaii-specific measure. In the long traditions of the U.S. Senate, it was considered a courtesy to stand with your colleagues on matters specifically addressing the needs of their home State. This civility seems to have vanished from this Chamber.\n\tIt is frustrating to me that some of my colleagues have worked aggressively to block this bill. For some reason, they have made it a priority to prevent the people of my State from moving forward to resolve issues caused by the illegal overthrow of the Native Hawaiian government in 1893. \n\tThis bill has widespread support among elected leaders and the citizens of Hawaii. Both chambers of the Hawaii State Legislature have voiced their support of the measure, and our new Governor, Neil Abercrombie, was the chief sponsor of the bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. This legislation is also supported by community and civic organizations, including the Association of Hawaiian Civic Clubs and the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a State agency.\n\tThe bill also has broad support outside of Hawaii. Indigenous leaders and community organizations across the United States support the bill, such as the Alaska Federation of Natives and the National Congress of American Indians.\n\tThe American Bar Association sent a letter this year to Members of the Senate reaffirming its support and outlining the sound Constitutional basis for the legislation. The ABA wrote, ``The right of Native Hawaiians to use the property held in trust for them and the right to govern those assets are not in conflict with the Equal Protection Clause since they rest on independent constitutional authority regarding the rights of native nations contained in Articles I and II of the Constitution.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\tMr. AKAKA. The bill also has the support of the Obama Administration. When the measure passed the House in February of this year, the White House Press Secretary issued a statement noting that President Obama, ``looks forward to signing the bill into law and establishing a government-to-government relationship with Native Hawaiians.'' And earlier this month, Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar wrote to the Senate Leaders to reiterate the administration's support for the Native--Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act, and to make note of the urgent need for this bill. The letter reads, ``Of the Nation's three major indigenous groups, Native Hawaiians--unlike American Indians and Alaska Natives--are the only one that currently lacks a government-to-government relationship with the United States.'' I ask unanimous consent to have a copy of this letter printed in the Record.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n\tMr. AKAKA. Opponents have spread misinformation about the bill. Let me set the record straight. This bill does not allow Hawaii to secede from the United States. It does not allow private lands to be taken. It does not authorize gaming in Hawaii.\n\tOpponents of the bill also distort the history of the Native Hawaiian people. I welcome the chance to speak with any of my colleagues about the history of my great State and of its indigenous people. I want to help you understand why this bill is necessary for Hawaii to move forward, and how it is consistent with the United States' existing policies of Federal recognition for Alaska Natives and American Indians.\n\tOpponents also point to a vocal minority in Hawaii who oppose this bill. The reality is that this legislation is strongly supported by the people of Hawaii. A poll conducted by the Honolulu Advertiser in May of this year found that 66 percent of people in Hawaii support Federal recognition for Native Hawaiians. Of the poll participants, 82 percent identifying themselves as Native Hawaiians said they support Federal recognition. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record.\n  (See exhibit 3.)\n\tMr. AKAKA. This year marked the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the unification of the Hawaiian Islands into one kingdom, under King Kamehameha. This year also marked 51 years of statehood and more than 100 years since Hawaii became a United States territory. And yet the people of Hawaii have still not been given the chance to participate in a government-to-government relationship similar to those already extended to this Nation's other indigenous people.\n\tI have worked tirelessly to educate my colleagues on the importance of this bill. I hope that you will continue to welcome my efforts to speak with you. I extend my heartfelt aloha and mahalo, thank you, to the many, many supporters who have worked to advocate for this legislation. Your support makes a difference and is greatly appreciated.

Thus, the \n     Native Hawaiians have the right to be recognized by the \n     Congress, this right is not in conflict with the rights of \n     others, and this recognition may be renewed despite \n     historical lapses.\n       The American Bar Association urges you to support the \n     rights of Native Hawaiians to self-determination by voting \n     for H.R. 2314.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas M.

Once the Native Hawaiian government is \n     created and its leaders elected, the United States would \n     officially recognize the new governing entity and work with \n     it on a government-to-government basis, just as the United \n     States works with federally recognized Indian tribes in other \n     States.\n       Senator Akaka first introduced a version of this \n     legislation more than a decade ago. Since 1999, Senator \n     Akaka, Senator Inouye, and other members of Hawaii's \n     congressional delegation have worked tirelessly with the last \n     three Administrations--and especially with our Departments--\n     to greatly improve the bill, which has now received \n     bipartisan support from the House of Representatives, the \n     Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, and Hawaii's Governor and \n     Attorney General.\n       Of the Nation's there major indigenous groups, Native \n     Hawaiians--unlike American Indians and Alaska Natives--are \n     the only one that currently lacks a government-to-government \n     relationship with the United States. This bill provides \n     Native Hawaiians a means by which to exercise the inherent \n     rights to local self-government, self-determination, and \n     economic self-sufficiency that other Native Americans enjoy.\n       For these reasons, we urge the Senate to pass the Native \n     Hawaiian Government Reorganization Act of 2010 and send it to \n     the President for his signature.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that \n     enactment of this legislation would be in accord with the \n     Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n     Ken Salazar,\n       Secretary of the Interior.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n              [From the Honolulu Advertiser, May 3, 2010]\n\n 66% of Hawaii Residents Favor Recognition for Native Hawaiians--Poll \n            Shows Slight Uptick From 2006, When 63% Approved\n\n                         (By Gordon Y.K. Pang)\n\n       Hawai'i residents still favor federal recognition of Native \n     Hawaiians by a 2-to-1 margin, the latest Advertiser Hawai'i \n     Poll numbers show.\n       Polling conducted last week found that 66 percent of the \n     participants support Native Hawaiians being ``recognized by \n     Congress and the federal government as a distinct group, \n     similar to the special recognition given to American Indians \n     and Alaskan Natives.''\n       Such recognition could come about under a process created \n     by the Akaka bill, formally known as the Native Hawaiian \n     Government Reorganization Act of 2009. The bill passed the \n     U.S. House in February and is awaiting a vote in the Senate.\n       The Hawai'i Poll appears to indicate that, in recent years, \n     a large segment of Hawai'i residents have settled into how \n     they think about federal recognition and the Akaka bill. In \n     2000, the Advertiser Hawai'i Poll showed 73 percent in favor \n     of federal recognition. That support appeared to dip in the \n     latter part of the decade, when in 2006 the poll showed 63 \n     percent of respondents in favor of recognition.\n       The poll was conducted by locally based Ward Research Inc. \n     with a sampling size of 604 respondents.\n       Over the course of the last decade, during the \n     administrations of President George W. Bush and President \n     Obama, language in the Akaka bill has been widely debated and \n     amended in the effort to get it passed.\n       Gov. Linda Lingle and her administration oppose the current \n     version of the bill. Lingle had been a strong and influential \n     supporter of the bill, but now believes this version grants \n     too much authority to the Native Hawaiian entity at the onset \n     of negotiations that would take place among the entity and \n     the state and the federal governments.\n       For instance, it would grant ``sovereign immunity'' to the \n     entity and its employees from the state's criminal, public \n     health, child safety and environmental laws.\n       Clyde Namu'o, administrator of the Office of Hawaiian \n     Affairs, said he is ``not surprised and actually pleased'' by \n     the latest poll numbers, especially given the new opposition \n     by Lingle and others.\n       ``It's fairly consistent with the polls that we did,'' \n     Namu'o said. ``Obviously, there's still a majority of the \n     people who still support'' federal recognition.\n       Two of three major candidates in the 1st Congressional \n     District special election, Democrat Ed Case and Republican \n     Charles Djou, have said they do not support the current \n     language of the bill that passed the House, leaving Democrat \n     Colleen Hanabusa as the sole staunch supporter.\n\n\n                             `Nobody knows'\n\n       Longtime opponents of the Akaka bill and/or federal \n     recognition said the Hawai'i Poll numbers show only that a \n     majority of Hawai'i residents don't know what federal \n     recognition means.\n       ``I think the big problem is nobody knows what's inside the \n     bill,'' said Thurston Twigg-Smith, former Honolulu Advertiser \n     owner. ``They keep changing it, people don't have a chance to \n     read it.''\n       Congress should hold hearings on the measure in Hawai'i so \n     the public can get a better understanding of the language, he \n     said.\n       Hawaiian rights activist Dennis Pu'uhonua ``Bumpy'' \n     Kanahele said the poll ``only tells me that people aren't \n     even aware of what the Akaka bill is all about.''\n       The state's politicians and ``mainstream Hawaiian \n     organizations'' support the bill and not other models of \n     self-determination, such as complete independence from the \n     U.S. government, he said.\n       Kanahele said that's why he's been pushing for a \n     constitutional convention, so Hawaiians can look at the \n     different models and determine what's best.\n       Among the 115 poll respondents who identified themselves as \n     Native Hawaiians, 82 percent said they support federal \n     recognition. Among other ethnic groups, 66 percent of those \n     describing themselves as Japanese support it, while 61 \n     percent of Filipinos and Caucasians indicated support.\n       Only 58 percent of those who identified themselves as 55 \n     and older support federal recognition, while 72 percent of \n     those ages 35 to 54 support it, and 79 percent of those under \n     35 do.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Richard J.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ncolleague, Senator Byron Dorgan. This is his last day voting in the \nSenate. He is retiring after serving the people of North Dakota in the \nCongress, the House, and Senate, for 30 years. But Byron's record in \nNorth Dakota goes even beyond that--another 12 years in State office, \nso a total of 42 years of serving the people of North Dakota.\n  I want to first say I am not objective when it comes to Byron Dorgan \nbecause he is my best friend. We have been friends and allies for all \nof those 42 years. In 1968 I was running a campaign to lower the voting \nage in North Dakota and first met Byron Dorgan, a young tax \ncommissioner--very young, in his twenties, appointed after the previous \ntax commissioner took his life. Byron had extraordinary responsibility \nthrust on him at a very young age, the youngest statewide official in \nour State's history. Byron disposed of those responsibilities with real \ndistinction, becoming recognized as the most influential State leader, \neven more influential than the Governor of the State, by a major \npublication in North Dakota.\n  I met Byron Dorgan in that year and was so struck by his ability, his \ncharisma, and his vision for our State and our Nation that I thought: \nThis is somebody I want to work with in my career.\n  We started a friendship that has lasted to this day. In 1970 I was \nhelping run the reelection campaign of Senator Quentin Burdick, who \nserved in this Chamber for more than 30 years. I got to know Byron even \nbetter then. In fact, my wife and I spent time with him and his wife. \nIn the years that followed we became very close friends. In 1974, when \nI got back from business school, Byron called me and asked me to come \nto his office. I did the day after I returned home. We took a walk \naround the Capitol Grounds of the State of North Dakota and he talked \nto me about what he saw as the future--the future of our State, things \nthat were happening in the country that needed to be addressed, and how \nthe two of us might, working together, change that future and make a \ndifference.\n  I agreed that day to be his campaign manager for the House of \nRepresentatives. In that campaign, Earl Pomeroy, now North Dakota's \nlone Congressman, was the driver. I was the campaign manager. Byron is \nalways quick to point out it was the only election he ever lost. He \nalways said it was the fault of the campaign manager. I always said it \nwas the fault of the driver. And Earl always believed we would have won \nif only he had been the candidate.\n  Those were incredible days. I remember so well that campaign, the \nthree of us--we bonded in a way that I think is very rare in politics \nand served together in a way that is unusual. There was never the kind \nof competition that often exists between Members. But there was always \na keen friendship and a real partnership. We were allies, fighting for \nNorth Dakota, fighting to\n\n[[Page S10993]]\n\nchange the country, deeply committed to each other and to our State.\n  After that campaign Byron asked me to be his assistant. Weeks later \nhe hired Lucy Calautti. Lucy, years later, became my wife, so I have \nalways credited Byron with bringing us together. We were also joined by \nmy college roommate who became another assistant to then tax \ncommissioner Byron Dorgan, a young man named Jim Lang, a very dear \nfriend of mine, an absolute genius, and the four of us worked to build \nthe Democratic Party in North Dakota and to change the political \nlandscape.\n  Those were incredible times. We fought great battles for a coal \nseverance tax in North Dakota, for an oil severance tax, things that \nhelped build the financial base for our State.\n  In 1980, Byron announced that he would seek North Dakota's lone seat \nin the House of Representatives. I ran to succeed him as tax \ncommissioner. Lucy, who by then was somebody for whom I had great \nrespect, was his campaign manager in that race for the House of \nRepresentatives. Byron was successful, and I was successful in a year \nin which no other Democrats were successful in our State.\n  We then had a period of time, 6 years, before the Senate race in \nwhich Byron was in Washington, I was in North Dakota, and we campaigned \ntogether day after day, weekend after weekend, month after month, all \nacross North Dakota, building a movement, a movement that resulted in \nmy running for the Senate in 1986.\n  It was really Byron's turn. He could have chosen to run, but he \ndecided not to, and so I did, in a race that many thought was \nimpossible for me to win. I started out more than 30 points behind the \nincumbent. He had over $1 million in the bank. When I got into the \nrace, I think I had $126. But Byron Dorgan was my ally in that race \nevery step of the way. I think very few others would have done what he \ndid for me. I think very few other Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, having someone else leapfrog them to come to the \nSenate, would have put themselves on the line as much as Byron Dorgan \ndid for me in that Senate race in 1986. But he was with me in every \ncorner of the State fighting tooth and nail, an uphill battle in which, \nas I said, I started out 38 points behind.\n  But on election day, I won a very narrow victory, winning by about \n2,000 votes over an incumbent who had won his previous race with over \n70 percent of the vote and a man who really looked like a U.S. Senator, \nMark Andrews--6 feet 5 inches, booming voice, white mane of hair, very \npowerful speaker. Yet I was able to win that race in a squeaker, and I \nnever could have without Byron's extraordinary assistance and support.\n  For a period of time that I was in the Senate, he was in the House, \nand then in 1992 I announced I would not seek reelection to my seat \nbecause I made a pledge in that 1986 campaign, and the pledge I made \nwas that I would not run for reelection unless the deficit was \ndramatically reduced. If you have reviewed 1992, you know the deficit \nwas at a record level. After the first Bush administration, deficits \nwere at record levels. So I announced I would not seek reelection, in \nkeeping with my pledge. Byron Dorgan announced for my seat, and there \nwas Lucy helping to run Byron's campaign for what was my seat in the \nSenate--a remarkable time in our lives.\n  Then later that year, Senator Burdick, the other Senator from North \nDakota, died. The Governor called me and said: Kent, you have to run to \nfill out the 2 years of his term; otherwise, North Dakota is going to \nlose all its seniority in one fell swoop, lose all of Senator Burdick's \nmore than 30 years of seniority. We are going to lose Byron's 12 years \nof seniority in the House because he is running for your seat in the \nSenate, and we will lose your 6 years of seniority if you do not run to \nfill the term of Senator Burdick.\n  I have always remembered that the media in North Dakota took a poll \non whether I should run to fill the 2 years of Senator Burdick's term, \nand even an overwhelming majority of Republicans thought I should run. \nSo the Governor told me there would be a special election after the \nregular elections in November. He said: Look, you have kept your \npledge. You did not run for reelection to your seat. Byron is running \nfor election to your seat. You would be in a special election in \nDecember.\n  So I agreed to run, and Byron and I were running simultaneous \ncampaigns for the Senate in 1992, he for my seat in the regular \nelection, and I was running for the special election in December. Once \nagain, we crisscrossed North Dakota campaigning together, making our \ncase, and both of us won very big victories in 1992.\n  From that time period forward until today, Byron and I have served \ntogether representing the State of North Dakota--best friends. What a \nremarkable story.\n  I can still remember one of the publications here on the Hill--I \ncan't remember if it was The Hill or Roll Call--when the two Senators \nfrom Mississippi were fighting for the majority leader position, ran a \ncartoon that said: Why can't the two Senators from Mississippi be more \nlike the Senators from North Dakota--friends forever. And Byron and I \nhave been friends forever and will be friends forever.\n  After the 1992 race, we both served North Dakota, and, unlike so many \ndelegations, we did everything we could to support each other. I can't \nthink of a time when there were ever angry words exchanged between \nByron Dorgan and Earl Pomeroy and myself. It was what many people back \nhome called Team North Dakota. And we have been a team, as close as you \ncould be.\n  During Byron's time in the Senate, he has been a fierce fighter for \npolicies that benefit average people and also somebody very suspicious \nof corporate power. He passionately opposed what he thought were \nmisguided trade policies that contributed to jobs moving overseas. He \nwas one of a handful of Senators who warned against consolidation and \nthe excessive risk that would result from repealing the barriers \nbetween commercial and investment banking. He warned at the time, in \nwhat has become a famous speech, that if we passed that legislation, we \nwould face a financial crisis in the years ahead. That prediction looks \nprescient today in light of the financial collapse of 2008. He was a \nleader in fighting for farm policies to benefit family farmers and \nranch families rather than corporate agriculture. In the midst of it \nall, he wrote two books: take this job and shove it--or ``Take This Job \nand Ship It'' and ``Reckless! How Debt, Deregulation, and Dark Money \nNearly Bankrupted America.''\n  Most importantly, Byron Dorgan had a vision, an energy, and a \npersistence that has played a huge role in building the prosperity of \nour State.\n  Robert Kennedy once said: ``There are those that look at things the \nway they are, and ask why? I dream of things that never were, and ask \nwhy not?'' That is really the way Byron approached service to North \nDakota. He did not see limits; he saw opportunity.\n  He looked at our university system and technology industries and saw \nno reason they could not be built into the Red River Valley Research \nCorridor that could power the economy of eastern North Dakota. And he \nset about making it happen, and he has succeeded.\n  He looked at our energy industry and saw no reason North Dakota could \nnot be the energy powerhouse for the Nation. Through his position on \nthe Energy Committee and the Energy and Water Subcommittee of \nAppropriations, he helped build North Dakota into one of the leading \nenergy-producing States in the Nation.\n  He looked at the growth of the knowledge industries and the Internet \nand saw no reason North Dakota could not be wired with the same 21st-\ncentury telecommunications infrastructure as the rest of the country. \nHe used his position on the Commerce Committee to get that done as \nwell.\n  The results of his work can be seen in every corner of our State. \nModern highways and air terminals, new and improved water \ninfrastructure, a booming energy and agricultural economy, high-tech \ncompanies springing up everywhere across our State, the strongest \neconomic growth in the Nation, the lowest unemployment rate in the \nNation--by any measure, North Dakota is doing very well. Most of that, \nByron will tell you, is because of the hard work and good judgment of \nthe people of North Dakota. But among them, no one has worked harder or \nsmarter on behalf of North Dakota than Senator Byron Dorgan.\n\n[[Page S10994]]\n\n  Let me close by saying that I do not know of a harder working or more \nproductive person than Byron Dorgan. He produces extraordinary amounts \nof high-quality work. He is type A squared, but he never forgot his \nroots.\n  Byron Dorgan grew up in Regent, ND, a town of 300. He often reminds \nus that he graduated in a class of nine and he was in the top five. He \nis proud of that background, he is proud of that heritage, he is proud \nof our State, he is proud of our Nation, and we are proud of him.\n  I will miss Byron Dorgan's partnership here every day, but I know he \nwill be with us because Byron Dorgan will never be far from the fray. \nByron Dorgan has served this body well, served the Nation well, and \nserved our State extraordinarily well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.)

Once again, we crisscrossed North Dakota campaigning together, making our case, and both of us won very big victories in 1992.\n\tFrom that time period forward until today, Byron and I have served together representing the State of North Dakota--best friends. What a remarkable story.\n\tI can still remember one of the publications here on the Hill--I can't remember if it was The Hill or Roll Call--when the two Senators from Mississippi were fighting for the majority leader position, ran a cartoon that said: Why can't the two Senators from Mississippi be more like the Senators from North Dakota--friends forever. And Byron and I have been friends forever and will be friends forever.\n\tAfter the 1992 race, we both served North Dakota, and, unlike so many delegations, we did everything we could to support each other. I can't think of a time when there were ever angry words exchanged between Byron Dorgan and Earl Pomeroy and myself. It was what many people back home called Team North Dakota. And we have been a team, as close as you could be.\n\tDuring Byron's time in the Senate, he has been a fierce fighter for policies that benefit average people and also somebody very suspicious of corporate power. He passionately opposed what he thought were misguided trade policies that contributed to jobs moving overseas. He was one of a handful of Senators who warned against consolidation and the excessive risk that would result from repealing the barriers between commercial and investment banking. He warned at the time, in what has become a famous speech, that if we passed that legislation, we would face a financial crisis in the years ahead. That prediction looks prescient today in light of the financial collapse of 2008. He was a leader in fighting for farm policies to benefit family farmers and ranch families rather than corporate agriculture. In the midst of it all, he wrote two books: take this job and shove it--or ``Take This Job and Ship It'' and ``Reckless! How Debt, Deregulation, and Dark Money Nearly Bankrupted America.''\n\tMost importantly, Byron Dorgan had a vision, an energy, and a persistence that has played a huge role in building the prosperity of our State.\n\tRobert Kennedy once said: ``There are those that look at things the way they are, and ask why? I dream of things that never were, and ask why not?'' That is really the way Byron approached service to North Dakota. He did not see limits; he saw opportunity.\n\tHe looked at our university system and technology industries and saw no reason they could not be built into the Red River Valley Research Corridor that could power the economy of eastern North Dakota. And he set about making it happen, and he has succeeded.\n\tHe looked at our energy industry and saw no reason North Dakota could not be the energy powerhouse for the Nation. Through his position on the Energy Committee and the Energy and Water Subcommittee of Appropriations, he helped build North Dakota into one of the leading energy-producing States in the Nation.\n\tHe looked at the growth of the knowledge industries and the Internet and saw no reason North Dakota could not be wired with the same 21st-century telecommunications infrastructure as the rest of the country. He used his position on the Commerce Committee to get that done as well.\n\tThe results of his work can be seen in every corner of our State. Modern highways and air terminals, new and improved water infrastructure, a booming energy and agricultural economy, high-tech companies springing up everywhere across our State, the strongest economic growth in the Nation, the lowest unemployment rate in the Nation--by any measure, North Dakota is doing very well. Most of that, Byron will tell you, is because of the hard work and good judgment of the people of North Dakota. But among them, no one has worked harder or smarter on behalf of North Dakota than Senator Byron Dorgan. \n\tLet me close by saying that I do not know of a harder working or more productive person than Byron Dorgan. He produces extraordinary amounts of high-quality work. He is type A squared, but he never forgot his roots.\n\tByron Dorgan grew up in Regent, ND, a town of 300. He often reminds us that he graduated in a class of nine and he was in the top five. He is proud of that background, he is proud of that heritage, he is proud of our State, he is proud of our Nation, and we are proud of him.\n\tI will miss Byron Dorgan's partnership here every day, but I know he will be with us because Byron Dorgan will never be far from the fray. Byron Dorgan has served this body well, served the Nation well, and served our State extraordinarily well.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.)

Mr. President, if I might, I would like to \nyield to Senator Barrasso from Wyoming to discuss the important bill \nthat was just objected to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It was a privilege for me to cosponsor this piece of \nlegislation with the distinguished Senator from Colorado. My colleague \nSenator Enzi and I have long been advocates of allowing an additional \nopportunity for jobs and for economic development into the wonderful \nski areas around Rocky Mountain West, which is the intent of this bill. \nIt really is aimed at increasing summer activities so that a number of \nthese locations, if you will, on Forest Service land can use that land \nfor an extended season, which would then work toward full-time, year-\nround employment for the folks in those areas, putting in things such \nas zip lines and opportunities for recreational advancements to \nincrease the amount of tourism, the amount of visitors to these \nwonderful places people like to enjoy. We think additional \nopportunities and enhancements would allow for additional employment. \nThat is why Senator Enzi and I joined with Senator Udall in support of \nhis efforts on this important piece of legislation.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank both Senators from \nWyoming for their support. I know we will go back to work in the next \nCongress because, as the Senator pointed out, this bipartisan bill \nwould provide clear authority for the Forest Service to allow \nadditional summertime use of ski areas which would help create jobs and \ngrow sustainable economies in ski country. It is no cost. It is common \nsense, as the Senator pointed out. That is why it not only has support \nfrom the two Wyoming Senators but also Senators Risch, Ensign, Bennett, \nand Gregg. It was favorably reported out of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee in September. The CBO projects it will actually \ngenerate revenue for the Federal budget and will help improve the \neconomy in a lot of hard-hit mountain communities.\n  Mr. President, we passed a number of other bills out of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee that, unfortunately, will not receive \nvotes in this Congress. I want to touch on a couple of them.\n  I begin with the National Forest Insect Disease Emergency Act. I have \nbeen working on this concern for the entire time I have served in the \nCongress, whether in the Senate or the House. We have an enormous bark \nbeetle epidemic in our Western forests. Those who study our forests say \nthat because of climate change and drought and human activity, these \nepidemics will become more and more common. What the bill would have \ndone is provide the tools and resources to the Forest Service to help \naddress this serious natural disaster. It is slow moving but \nnonetheless a natural disaster. That disaster is the deaths of millions \nand millions of acres of trees due to insect infestations.\n  Senators Crapo and Risch were cosponsors. It is a very significant \ndisappointment that we didn't move to consider this bill. I know it \nwould have passed the Senate.\n  Another bill is the Leadville Mine Drainage Tunnel Act, commonsense \nlegislation that would directly benefit a community in Colorado and, \nindeed, the entire Arkansas River Valley, one of the significant \nwatersheds in the State of Colorado. This mine drainage tunnel near \nLeadville, in 2008, was backed up with a large volume of contaminated \nwater which then created a safety hazard to the community, but it was \nunclear whether the Bureau of Reclamation or the Environmental Protect \nAgency was responsible for addressing it.\n  My bill would clarify that the Bureau of Reclamation has the \nauthority to treat this backed-up water and is responsible for \nmaintaining the tunnel so that in the future these kinds of threats \nwill not arise and, if they do, it is clear who is responsible to \nmitigate them. It is a straightforward bill. It doesn't cost anything. \nIt would give the people of Leadville the certainty they have needed \nfor years.\n  Finally, I wish to mention the Sugar Loaf Fire Protection District \nLand Exchange Act. This would help protect public safety. It \nfacilitates a fair exchange of lands on the Arapaho-Roosevelt National \nForest near Boulder between the Forest Service and the Sugar Loaf Fire \nDistrict. The fire district is seeking this exchange so they can \nupgrade and maintain fire stations which serve this community which has \nbeen subjected to wildland/urban fires. We\n\n[[Page S10995]]\n\nwant to protect the homes and the built structures and people who live \nin those areas. The exchange would reduce costs related to forest \nboundary maintenance as well as provide better service to the residents \nof the fire district, neighbors of the district, and individuals who \ntravel through.\n  I appreciate the patience of my colleagues. The point I wish to make \nis, we had tens and tens of bills in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee that this body should have considered. It would have been \nimportant to give these commonsense bills an up-or-down vote. Almost \nall of them were bipartisan in nature. It is a disappointment to me \nthat we have not done the will of the people in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 100 years ago today, there was a horrible \nfire in the stockyards of Chicago. Most of us have our vision of that \nera and the stockyards from Upton Sinclair's book ``The Jungle,'' which \ntold of the life of a Lithuanian immigrant family working in the \nstockyards. It was one of the busiest commercial ventures in the United \nStates, and it literally fed the Nation. But it also engaged in \npractices acceptable at that time which would be unacceptable by \ntoday's standards of health and safety.\n  That day of December 20, 1910, there was a fire. As a result of that \nfire, 100 years ago today, 21 firefighters lost their lives at the \nunion stockyards in Chicago. Until the collapse of the World Trade \nCenter towers on 9/11, no single disaster in the history of the United \nStates had claimed the lives of more firefighters.\n  Sadly, today, in a cruel irony of history, there has been another \nfire in Chicago. This morning we lost two firefighters who went out in \nthe bitter cold and did their best to fight a fire. A wall collapsed on \nthem, as it did 100 years ago. Two lost their lives, and 14 were \nseriously injured. It is a sad reminder to all of us who drive by \nfirehouses and fire stations all the time and see the men and women who \nwork there, that when they are called to duty, they can give their \nlives at a moment's notice. It happened this morning in Chicago. It \nhappened 100 years ago in the same city. It can happen again.\n  I am glad that earlier today we finally worked out an agreement on \nthe so-called 9/11 Health Compensation Act, the James Zadroga 9/11 \nHealth Compensation Act. The extraordinary efforts for passing that \nhave to be recognized. I will, of course, acknowledge the two Senators \nfrom New York, Kirsten Gillibrand and Charles Schumer, who worked \ntirelessly to get it passed. They would acknowledge the contribution of \nour majority leader, Harry Reid, who stepped in and made this process \nwork when it looked like it had failed several times. Mike Enzi, on the \nRepublican side, Tom Coburn from Oklahoma, all worked together and came \nup with a good bill. The 9/11 Health Compensation Act is going to help \nmany around the United States. I just learned this week it can help one \nperson in Chicago.\n  Arthur Noonan is 1 of the 188 responders and 86 survivors living in \nIllinois and enrolled in the World Trade Center health registry. I wish \nto thank the Chicago Sun Times for telling his story. He is a 30-year \nveteran of the Chicago Fire Department, spent hundreds of hours \nvolunteering at Ground Zero in those critical days and weeks after the \nterrorist attack. Mr. Noonan, a firefighter from Chicago, worked in a \nline passing buckets of debris from Ground Zero, searching for human \nremains and clothing. He remembers the thick dust that coated \neverything and the sickly sweet smell. Noonan and other volunteers were \ngiven respirators, but the filters clogged up after a few minutes. They \nworked without masks after that. A few years after the cleanup, Mr. \nNoonan contracted leukemia. He applied for health benefits through the \nvictims compensation fund and submitted medical documents to \nsubstantiate his claim, but his claim was filed 2 weeks too late.\n  Mr. Noonan said at first he was hesitant to file a claim because he \n``never got anything for nothing.'' He says he has always worked two or \nthree jobs. I talked to him on the phone just a couple days ago. What a \nclassic Chicago story. Here is a man, a proud firefighter, now in \nretirement, battling leukemia successfully, who still says: I don't \nwant anything for nothing.\n\n  I said: So what are you worried about?\n  Well, I am worried because I have a cap on my health insurance of 1 \nmillion bucks, and I have already spent $750,000 on my leukemia. I am \nworried I will just run out of health insurance.\n  That is a concern, a concern that can be addressed by this bill. If \nhis leukemia can be tracked to his experience at Ground Zero, we \ncertainly want to make certain he receives the medical care he needs.\n  Stanley Silata is another Chicago firefighter who applied for health \nassistance but was told his application was too late. He participated \nin search-and-rescue missions at Ground Zero and put out fires. Similar \nto so many other firefighters who were on the lines those days, Mr. \nSilata developed serious respiratory problems. He has had to have \nmedical treatment since 2004. Mr. Silata's claim for assistance was \nsubmitted, unfortunately, 2 weeks after the deadline. We are hoping \nthis bill will provide him some protection as well. The stories go on \nand on. But as we are reminded from the deaths in Chicago today, the \nfirefighters who responded to this fire, the men and women who \nresponded at Ground Zero, carried a servant's heart into one of the \nmost dangerous places on Earth. They literally risked their lives in \nthe hopes that they could save others or at least bring some \ncompensation and some consolation to the families who had suffered \nthese losses.\n  They deserve nothing less than our gratitude and our help, our help \nin enacting this 9/11 health compensation bill. I believe the House of \nRepresentatives will be considering this today. I hope it is signed \nvery quickly by the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "IN SUPPORT OF THE 9/11 HEALTH AND COMPENSATION ACT\n\n\tMr. DURBIN.

Until the collapse of the World Trade Center towers on 9/11, no single disaster in the history of the United States had claimed the lives of more firefighters.\n\tSadly, today, in a cruel irony of history, there has been another fire in Chicago. This morning we lost two firefighters who went out in the bitter cold and did their best to fight a fire. A wall collapsed on them, as it did 100 years ago. Two lost their lives, and 14 were seriously injured. It is a sad reminder to all of us who drive by firehouses and fire stations all the time and see the men and women who work there, that when they are called to duty, they can give their lives at a moment's notice. It happened this morning in Chicago. It happened 100 years ago in the same city. It can happen again.\n\tI am glad that earlier today we finally worked out an agreement on the so-called 9/11 Health Compensation Act, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health Compensation Act. The extraordinary efforts for passing that have to be recognized. I will, of course, acknowledge the two Senators from New York, Kirsten Gillibrand and Charles Schumer, who worked tirelessly to get it passed. They would acknowledge the contribution of our majority leader, Harry Reid, who stepped in and made this process work when it looked like it had failed several times. Mike Enzi, on the Republican side, Tom Coburn from Oklahoma, all worked together and came up with a good bill. The 9/11 Health Compensation Act is going to help many around the United States. I just learned this week it can help one person in Chicago.\n\tArthur Noonan is 1 of the 188 responders and 86 survivors living in Illinois and enrolled in the World Trade Center health registry. I wish to thank the Chicago Sun Times for telling his story. He is a 30-year veteran of the Chicago Fire Department, spent hundreds of hours volunteering at Ground Zero in those critical days and weeks after the terrorist attack. Mr. Noonan, a firefighter from Chicago, worked in a line passing buckets of debris from Ground Zero, searching for human remains and clothing. He remembers the thick dust that coated everything and the sickly sweet smell. Noonan and other volunteers were given respirators, but the filters clogged up after a few minutes. They worked without masks after that. A few years after the cleanup, Mr. Noonan contracted leukemia. He applied for health benefits through the victims compensation fund and submitted medical documents to substantiate his claim, but his claim was filed 2 weeks too late.\n\tMr. Noonan said at first he was hesitant to file a claim because he ``never got anything for nothing.'' He says he has always worked two or three jobs. I talked to him on the phone just a couple days ago. What a classic Chicago story. Here is a man, a proud firefighter, now in retirement, battling leukemia successfully, who still says: I don't want anything for nothing.\n\n\tI said: So what are you worried about?\n\tWell, I am worried because I have a cap on my health insurance of 1 million bucks, and I have already spent $750,000 on my leukemia. I am worried I will just run out of health insurance.\n\tThat is a concern, a concern that can be addressed by this bill. If his leukemia can be tracked to his experience at Ground Zero, we certainly want to make certain he receives the medical care he needs.\n\tStanley Silata is another Chicago firefighter who applied for health assistance but was told his application was too late. He participated in search-and-rescue missions at Ground Zero and put out fires. Similar to so many other firefighters who were on the lines those days, Mr. Silata developed serious respiratory problems. He has had to have medical treatment since 2004. Mr. Silata's claim for assistance was submitted, unfortunately, 2 weeks after the deadline. We are hoping this bill will provide him some protection as well. The stories go on and on. But as we are reminded from the deaths in Chicago today, the firefighters who responded to this fire, the men and women who responded at Ground Zero, carried a servant's heart into one of the most dangerous places on Earth. They literally risked their lives in the hopes that they could save others or at least bring some compensation and some consolation to the families who had suffered these losses.\n\tThey deserve nothing less than our gratitude and our help, our help in enacting this 9/11 health compensation bill. I believe the House of Representatives will be considering this today. I hope it is signed very quickly by the President.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Richard J.

Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly about interchange \nfee reform, an issue I have worked on for many years and an issue which \nwas taken up just recently last Thursday when the Federal Reserve \nconsidered legislation we passed in the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives and sent to them to establish regulations. It was an \neffort to bring reasonable regulation to a $20 billion annual debit \ncard interchange fee system industry.\n  The Federal Reserve released draft regulations that will implement \nthe new law Congress enacted. Back in May, when the Senate was debating \nthe Wall Street reform bill, I offered an amendment. I am honored that \n64 Senators voted for it, including 17 Republicans. It was a bipartisan \nsuccess. It is now the law of the land. The Federal Reserve is moving \nforward to make sure our law is implemented in a fair way.\n  The Fed announced, according to their investigation, it costs the \nbanks between 7 and 12 cents to process a debit card transaction. But \nthe Fed reported that big banks and card networks charge merchants, \nretailers, charities, universities, and others an average debit \ninterchange fee--not 7 to 12 cents--of 44 cents. The Fed has confirmed \nwhat consumers and retailers long suspected. They are being overcharged \nand gouged for each purchase\n\n[[Page S10996]]\n\nmade with a debit card. Merchants and their customers are being charged \nmore than three times what the transactions cost.\n  In the old days, if you paid by check before debit cards, the fee for \nprocessing the check was pennies, regardless of the face amount of the \ncheck. Now the debit card fee is 44 cents--three, four, five, six times \nmore than the cost actually incurred by the banks because of the \ntransaction.\n  The draft regulations released propose to cap the interchange fees at \nthe largest banks at 12 cents per transaction, give or take some \nconditions such as the prevention of fraud, which we built into the \nlaw. With the 12-cent cap, we could save businesses and consumers \nacross the United States about $10 billion in the first year. Imagine \nwhat $10 billion will mean to a restaurant, a shop. Think of what it \nmeans to universities and other charities that collect through the use \nof debit cards--more money for them to use, more profitability, and \nthat could lead to more employment and better business outlooks.\n  At this point, I am hunkered down and ready for the fight that is \ncoming. The biggest banks and credit card companies are going to do \ntheir best to influence the Federal Reserve to raise this interchange \nfee as high as possible, but we know what the reasonable costs are. We \nknow these credit card companies and the big banks have been \novercharging for years. Every time a credit or debit card sale is made, \nVisa and MasterCard take a cut of the transaction. Some of this cut \nthey keep, but most of it is routed along to the bank that issued the \ncard. This fee that goes to the card-issuing bank is the interchange \nfee, also known as a swipe fee. It skims an average of 1 to 3 percent \noff the top of every transaction. An estimated $48 billion in credit \nand debit card interchange fees were collected in 2008, around $20 \nbillion from debit cards.\n  These fees come out of the pockets of everyone who accepts cards--\nmerchants, small businesses, charities, and government agencies--and \nthe costs are passed on to consumers.\n  Every bank says they need to charge fees to help pay for the cost of \nprocessing card transactions and fighting fraud. That is fair enough. \nBut the banks do not set their own interchange fees. There is no \ncompetition here.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues, who supported my efforts said we \ndid not want to go this far to give the Federal Reserve this authority. \nBut there is literally no competition when it comes to credit and debit \ncards. That is why the government has to step in. That is why we think \nthe Federal Reserve is moving in the right direction.\n  Go look at any bank's Web site and look to see how much that bank \ncharges in interchange fees. You won't find anything.\n  Why? Because for years, the banks have enjoyed a cozy scheme where \nthey let Visa and MasterCard fix the interchange fee rates that each \nbank receives.\n  This means banks do not have to compete with one another. They all \nreceive the same fees no matter how much a particular bank actually \nspends to process transactions or to prevent fraud.\n  The current interchange system is a price-fixing scheme. Visa and \nMasterCard set the fee rates that thousands of banks receive. Efficient \nbanks and inefficient banks receive exactly the same fees.\n  And Visa and MasterCard have so much market power over 75 percent of \nthe market--that they can raise rates whenever they want to and tell \nmerchants to take it or leave it.\n  Merchants have no choice but to take it, because now over half of all \nretail transactions take place with cards. They can't say no.\n  It is easy to see that the banks and card companies set up this \ninterchange scheme. It benefits the banks that receive high fees and \ndon't need to compete with each other or negotiate with merchants. And \nit benefits Visa and MasterCard, because they get their own network fee \neach time a card is swiped, and high interchange fees mean more banks \nwill issue more cards.\n  But the system is unfair to merchants and to consumers in the United \nStates. They have to pay billions per year in these fees with no \nnegotiation and no competition.\n  The interchange amendment that I offered--and that is now law reins \nin these abusive fees.\n  My amendment did several things.\n  First, it said that if the big banks are going to let Visa and \nMasterCard fix fees on their behalf, the Federal Reserve should \nregulate those fees.\n  The amendment said that any debit interchange fee that is set by a \ncard network and passed along to a big bank must be regulated by the \nFed to ensure that the fee is reasonable and proportional to the actual \ncost of processing the transaction.\n  If a bank wants to charge its own fees to reflect the costs it bears, \nso be it. My amendment does not regulate that, and as long as those \nfees are transparent and competitive, I am fine with it.\n  But if the banks all get together and decide to let Visa and \nMasterCard fix fees for them, that is where my amendment steps in.\n  We know that banks today receive far more in interchange than it \ncosts them to do debit transactions. They use their excess interchange \nsubsidy to pay for things like ads, rewards programs, and CEO bonuses.\n  The result of my amendment is that we will squeeze the fat out of the \ninterchange system. Banks will still be able to use interchange to pay \nfor necessary processing costs, but they won't be able to use this \ninterchange scheme to take excessive fees out of the pockets of \nmerchants and their customers.\n  Second, my amendment said that if a bank takes steps to effectively \nreduce fraud in debit transactions, that bank can get an increase in \ntheir interchange rate.\n  So instead of the current system, where Visa and MasterCard give \nbanks the same interchange rate no matter how much fraud the bank \nallows, my amendment will actually incentivize banks to reduce the \namount of fraud that takes place. The rules that the Fed institutes on \nthis will mark a major step forward.\n  Third, my amendment said that card networks cannot require that their \ndebit cards all use exclusively one debit network.\n  The story here is that there are a number of debit networks that \nmerchants can use to conduct transactions. Until recently, most cards \ncould be used on multiple networks. You used to see a number of debit \nnetwork logos on each debit card.\n  In recent years, however, the biggest networks like Visa have begun \nrequiring banks to sign exclusive agreements under which they become \nthe sole network on the banks' cards. This diminishes competition \nbetween networks and leads to higher prices. My amendment will restore \nthis competition.\n  Finally, my amendment said that card networks can no longer penalize \nmerchants who try to offer certain discounts to consumers, like \ndiscounts for using debit instead of credit. This was a clear pro-\nconsumer provision.\n  I know that my amendment has been criticized by the banks and by some \nof their allies in Congress. Those criticisms have generally fallen \nalong several lines.\n  Some have argued that my amendment is a problem because it involves \nprice fixing.\n  I agree that price fixing is a problem, but it is the current \ninterchange fee system that represents price fixing.\n  Don't take it from me even Visa admits that they fix prices for all \ntheir member banks under the current system. They sent a letter to the \nFed on November 8 saying, quote, ``issuers do not in practice set \ninterchange transaction fees; rather, these fees are set by networks,''\n  My amendment tries to correct price fixing, not create it.\n  Second, my amendment has been criticized because some think that it \nwill not benefit consumers.\n  I absolutely agree that interchange reform should protect consumer \ninterests. And I would note that my amendment was supported by a broad \nrange of consumer groups and by millions of consumers who signed \npetitions in support of swipe fee reform.\n  Also, I note that the Fed met on October 13 with a number of consumer \ngroups to discuss how to implement interchange reform.\n  The Fed has posted online summaries of all its interchange meetings, \nand according to that summary, the consumer groups said they preferred \nthat\n\n[[Page S10997]]\n\ndebit interchange fees be either de minimis or zero.\n  Consumers support interchange reform because, as a November 2009 GAO \nstudy points out, it is under the current interchange system that \n``merchants pass on their increasing card acceptance costs to their \ncustomers.''\n  The National Retail Federation estimates that each American family \npays an extra $427 per year as a result of inflated prices due to \ninterchange fees.\n  Reining in soaring interchange fees reduces costs for merchants and \nconsumers alike.\n  Now make no mistake--I expect the banks and card companies will try \nto get around debit interchange regulations by creating new hidden \nconsumer fees and by steering consumers toward less-regulated products \nlike prepaid cards. We saw the banks do this after the credit card \nreform bill was enacted last year.\n  But I want the banks and card companies to know that I will be \nwatching, and I will make sure both the Congress and regulators step in \nas needed to prevent consumers from being fleeced.\n  Finally, my amendment has been criticized because some say it will \nhurt small banks and credit unions.\n  I have pointed out repeatedly that my amendment bends over backward \nto protect these small institutions. I don't want to drive them out of \nthe debit card market, and my amendment won't do that.\n  Nothing in the amendment enables merchants to discriminate against \ncards issued by small banks and credit unions. Merchants are still \nrequired by Visa and MasterCard contracts to accept all cards \nregardless of the issuer.\n  And the amendment exempts banks with less than $10 billion in assets \nfrom interchange fee regulation. All but around 90 banks and 3 credit \nunions are exempt.\n  These small banks can continue to receive the same high interchange \nfees that they do today and they will actually receive higher fee rates \nthan their big bank competitors.\n  If Visa and MasterCard are so protective of their big bank members \nthat they decide to voluntarily cut the interchange rates that small \nbanks receive, they will be doing so against their own profit motive--\nand they may be doing so in violation of the antitrust laws.\n  My amendment does not harm small banks and credit unions, and I will \nbe watching to make sure Visa, MasterCard and the big banks do not harm \nthem either.\n  Finally, I will point out that the United States is actually late to \nthe party when it comes to interchange regulation.\n  According to an April 2008 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of \nKansas City, banks have reached agreement with foreign governments to \nreduce interchange fees in countries such as Israel, Mexico, and \nSwitzerland.\n  Just this week, the European Union reached an agreement with Visa \nEurope to limit debit interchange fees to 0.2 percent in nine countries \nand for cross-border EU transactions.\n  These countries are doing fine without excessive interchange fees. \nAnd the United States will do fine as well.\n  In conclusion, the Fed's release of proposed interchange rules is an \nimportant step toward bringing relief to our nation's merchants and \nconsumers.\n  Now the Fed will commence a formal comment period on the draft rules, \nand I and many others will likely submit comments suggesting how the \ndraft can be further improved.\n  I look forward to this process.\n  I again want to thank my 63 colleagues who stood up back in May and \nvoted for my amendment to rein in the unfair debit interchange system. \nI look forward to continuing to work with them on this issue in the \nfuture.\n  I know this fight will be engaged again next year. I am looking \nforward to defending what we have done and to move with Senator \nMenendez of New Jersey and others to deal with other abuses in the \ncredit card industry, such as the prepaid debit card where there are \nvast overcharges of fees. We have to stand in this body for the \nconsumers of America. They cannot afford the well-paid lobbyists in the \nhallways. We have to stand for them because those people are the \nbackbone of our economy, and without our support, have limited voice in \nthe decisionmaking that takes place in this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we come to the end of this Congress \nhaving once again failed to harness the economic potential achievable \nthrough reform of our Nation's energy portfolio or to heed the dire \nwarnings put forth by our planet about the effects of our relentless \ncarbon pollution.\n  The results of our failure are many and are significant.\n  With our economy now at the forefront of our minds, you would think \nwe would have paid more attention to the economic imperative of energy \nreform. As the global economic race to clean energy rushes by around \nus, you would think we would have exhibited more concern at the \nprospect of being left behind.\n  Instead, we remain engaged as a nation in a de facto policy of \nunilateral economic disarmament in the battle for command of tomorrow's \nenergy economy. We are surrendering to China, to the European Union, to \ncompetitors around the world.\n  The United States invented the first solar cell, but we now rank \nfifth among countries that manufacture solar components. Other \ncountries see the demand for clean energy, and they are moving their \ncompanies ahead of ours in the race to meet that demand. The United \nStates is now home to only 1 of the top 10 companies manufacturing \nsolar energy components and to only 1 of the top 10 companies \nmanufacturing wind turbines.\n  Half of America's existing wind turbines were manufactured overseas. \nIn Portsmouth, RI, we have installed two wind turbines. One was \nmanufactured by a Danish company. The other was manufactured by an \nAustrian company, its components delivered to Rhode Island by a \nCanadian distributor.\n  Even in coal sequestration, in a country where half our power still \ncomes from coal, we are not leading. Only one plant is under \nconstruction now with the capability to capture any significant portion \nof its carbon emissions.\n  The new energy economy that beckons us has been described in \ncongressional testimony as bigger by far than the tech revolution that \nbrought us our laptops and our iPads and our BlackBerries and the \nInternet services that are now so important a part of our daily lives. \nThe tech economy is $1 trillion; the energy economy is $6 trillion.\n  In the race for commanding position in this new energy economy, \nAmerica designed much of the underlying energy technology that the \nworld is using, but other countries have put the propulsive effect of \ntheir government behind their industries, and they are pulling ahead of \nus in bringing those new technologies--our new technologies--to market. \nOur competitors are moving to seize an irretrievable advantage in the \ndevelopment and distribution of new energy technologies, and we are \nletting them.\n  Our children, I fear, will judge us sternly for failing to protect \nAmerica's economic self-interest at this pivotal time. But they will \njudge us for that less sternly than they will judge us for our failure \nto protect their lands and waters, the air and climate they will \ninherit. For this, their verdict will be harsh.\n  Nature's warnings abound. Nature is giving us every signal of \ndistress a prudent person could want or need to begin to take prudent \nprecautions. Nature's voice is clear.\n  According to NASA, 2010 was the hottest climate year on record, \nsurpassing 2005 as the previous record year.\n  The acidification of our oceans has reached levels not seen in 8,000 \ncenturies--that is quite a bandwidth to fall out of.\n  September 2010 saw the lowest recorded Arctic ice volume, at 78 \npercent below the 1979 level. Researchers warn that the Arctic Sea \ncould be ice free by 2030 and Glacier National Park without glaciers.\n  Western forests, as Senator Udall just described, are falling by the \nmile to the ravages of spruce and mountain beetles, as warmer winters \nfail to kill off these pests.\n\n[[Page S10998]]\n\n  A warming climate adds energy to our weather systems, loading the \nmeteorological dice for worse and more frequent storms, and we are \nseeing worse and more frequent storms.\n  I am particularly alert to our Earth's alarm signals since I \nrepresent Rhode Island, the Ocean State. Rhode Island and other coastal \nStates face a triple whammy.\n  First, we get the same terrestrial effects from climate change as all \nStates: warming climates, changing habitats, and harsher and more \nfrequent storms. Second, we will also suffer from changes affecting our \nocean economies: species shifts as bays and oceans warm, lost \nfisheries, and the pervasive danger of ocean acidification. Rhode \nIsland's productive winter flounder fishery, for instance, is already \nvirtually gone. Third, we coastal States face the local consequences of \nrising sea levels: protecting coastal infrastructure, rezoning to \ncompensate for new storm surge velocity zones, perhaps even diking and \ndamming to protect low-lying areas from inundation.\n  We can foresee these consequences, and we can foresee the devastation \nthey will bring.\n  Beyond our economic self-interest and beyond our responsibility as \ncaretakers of the planet is the fact that climate change presents a \nthreat to our national security.\n  Leaders of our defense and intelligence communities from both \nRepublican and Democratic administrations and from the career military, \noutside of politics, have come forward to express their concern.\n  Respected leaders such as GEN Wesley Clark and former CIA Director \nJames Woolsey have called for us to aggressively reduce our reliance on \nfossil fuels. In 2007, the nonprofit CNA Military Advisory Board \ngathered a dozen of the Nation's most respected retired admirals and \ngenerals, including former Chief of Staff of the Army GEN Gordon \nSullivan and former commander-in-chief of U.S. Central Command GEN \nAnthony Zinni, to produce a report called ``National Security and the \nThreat of Climate Change.''\n  Its principal conclusion is that climate change poses a serious \nthreat to national security by acting as a ``threat multiplier'' for \ninstability in some of the world's most volatile regions and presents \nsignificant national security challenges for the United States.\n  As former ADM T. Joseph Lopez states in the report:\n\n       More poverty, more forced migrations, higher unemployment. \n     Those conditions are ripe for extremists and terrorists.\n\n  The official position of the U.S. Government is the same--not just at \nEPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, not just in the political \nelements of the administration. In 2008, the intelligence organizations \nwithin our national security structure prepared a national intelligence \nassessment on the national security implications of climate change.\n  Testifying before Congress on the report, chairman of the National \nIntelligence Council, Dr. Thomas Finger, said the impacts of climate \nchange:\n\n       . . . will worsen existing problems--such as poverty, \n     social tensions, environmental degradation, ineffectual \n     leadership, and weak political institutions. Climate change \n     could threaten domestic stability in some states, potentially \n     contributing to intra- or, less likely, interstate conflict, \n     particularly over access to increasingly scarce water \n     resources.\n\n  The Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense Review for 2010 \nconcurred, declaring that climate change will play a ``significant role \nin shaping the future security environment.''\n  The review stated:\n\n       While climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may \n     act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a \n     burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries \n     around the world.\n\n  So here we have it, an enormous missed opportunity economically in a \ntime of economic hardship, an unthinkable failure to safeguard the \nworld our children will inherit, an accelerant of instability and \nconflict at a time when our security is threatened by both and still no \naction. How could we have ended up here again?\n\n  We have ended up here again because of a very unfortunate situation \nin our country right now.\n  I will confess, I am an American exceptionalist. Over and over, I \nhave spoken on the floor about this country as a city on a hill, as a \nbeacon in the darkness, as mankind's last, best hope, as leading the \nworld by our example. These are trite comments perhaps, but I say them \nunashamedly. Our balanced system of government, our founding principles \nof ordered liberty, our embrace of our diversity, our willingness to \nfight and die for freedom in foreign lands and then come home, without \nconquest, with other nations' freedom our only prize, these are \nexceptional American virtues, and they have changed the course of \nhumanity.\n  But our exceptional place in the human story does not give us an \nexcuse. It does not give us a pass. It gives us, as Americans, a \nresponsibility. Our American exceptionalism confers on Americans a \nresponsibility. To ignore, as we have, the calm and constant counsels \nof science is not consistent with that responsibility. To ignore facts \nthat are so plain as to be defacing our planet--her great glaciers and \nseas, her lands and species--is not consistent with that \nresponsibility. To turn away from leadership at a time when other \nnations are turning to us for leadership is not consistent with that \nresponsibility. It is not American exceptionalism to be exceptionally \nwrong or exceptionally blind or exceptionally timid.\n  James Fallows wrote in a recent Atlantic article about clean coal \ntechnology that:\n\n       . . . the Chinese government can decide to transform the \n     country's energy system in 10 years, and no one doubts that \n     it will. An incoming U.S. Administration can promise to \n     create a clean-energy revolution, but only naifs believe that \n     it will.\n\n  Is this what the United States has come to, a country so mired in its \ninternal quarrels and bickering, so slave to special interests that we \ncannot dream big, cannot do what others say is impossible?\n  An eminent historian once counseled his students about the harsh \njudgments which it is history's power to inflict on the wrong. We are, \nby our inaction, by our folly, by our unwillingness to face facts, by \nour refusal to pick up the mantle of leadership, earning such a harsh \njudgment. We have chosen to ignore the plain and indisputable signals \nof our planet, signals that should warn us about the dangers of the \npath on which we are embarked. We have chosen to ignore both the clear \nand present dangers apparent around us now and those looming dangers \nour God-given intelligence gives us the ability to foresee. We have \ninstead chosen to listen to a siren song: the siren song of propaganda, \nmarketed by special interests, indeed, by the very polluters whose \ncarbon pollution is wreaking this damage. That is our choice, and it is \na choice for which history's judgment will be justifiably harsh.\n  The judgment will be harsh because the answer to that choice is \nwrong--because the perils are real, because the Earth acts by the laws \nof physics and chemistry and biology. Atmospheric carbon levels cannot \nbe talked down by propaganda; our warming bays and seas cannot be \ncooled down by corporate spin; our petty politics simply are not part \nof the equation when these great forces of nature are set in motion. \nSimilar to King Canute, we cannot change this tide by proclamation, let \nalone by propaganda.\n  I see the majority leader on the floor. I wish to inquire if he would \nlike me to yield for a moment to him as a courtesy.\n  Mr. REID. Has my friend completed his statement?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I have not.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator, please complete your statement.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Leader.\n  Some say we do not have to worry about the consequences that will \ncome from what we see happening around us, that we do not have to \nattend to nature's warnings about the effects of what we are doing \nbecause God will get us out of the mess we are making. Perhaps, but \nhistory shows how often God's work is done through the work of human \nhands, through the gifts of the human mind, through the responsibility \nof the human conscience. In this, as in so many other things, God's \nwork must be our own. The task for our hands is to address the facts \nscience has long told us will bear on the problem: First and foremost, \nthe rise in carbon pollution. We are now dumping 37 billion tons, or 37 \ngigatons, of CO a year into our atmosphere. Twenty\n\n[[Page S10999]]\n\nyears ago, that number was less than 25 gigatons. Twenty years from now \nit might be over 50 gigatons.\n\n  We know what that means. Carbon dioxide persists in the environment \nfor decades. We know that. So as we pile on the gigatons every year, it \npiles up in our atmosphere. We know that. The concentration of carbon \ndioxide in the atmosphere has fluctuated in a range between 180 and 280 \nparts per million over most of the last million years. In 1900, the \nCO2 concentration had popped out of that range up to 300 \nparts per million, and today the concentration exceeds 390 parts per \nmillion and is climbing at about 2 parts per million every year. We \nknow what that means too.\n  We have known since the Irish scientist, John Tyndall, figured it out \nin 1859--the year Oregon was admitted as the 33rd State, when James \nBuchanan was President, and when, ironically, the first U.S. oil well \nwas drilled--that carbon dioxide traps heat in our atmosphere. It is \nbasic textbook science.\n  Unfortunately, basic textbook science has encountered basic textbook \npolitics and lost.\n  The oil-and-gas sector spent $250 million in lobbying expenses while \nwe were working on a climate change bill between January 2009 and June \n2010. The electric utilities kicked in another $264 million in lobbying \nexpenditures. The mining industry topped it off with $29 million, for a \ngrand total industry lobbying expense during this period of more than \n$\\1/2\\ billion--$543 million, to be exact.\n  So the judgment of history will be harsh not just because we were \nwrong, nor just because we were wrong in ways that we were able to \nunderstand were wrong. It will be harsh because we in this generation \nwere entrusted with America's great democracy, as other generations \nbefore us have been entrusted with America's great democracy, and we \nwill have failed that trust by failing in this challenge to meet the \nstandards of a great democracy.\n  We fail that trust because this is no innocent mistake. This is not \ngetting it wrong even though we tried our best. This is not even \ngetting it wrong because we were lazy and not paying attention. This is \nno innocent mistake. This is the power of money in politics. This is \nthe power of propaganda over truth. This is the deliberate poisoning of \nthe public square with defective information, with manufactured doubt, \nwith false choices, with a campaign of calculated deception. In the \nsame ``Atlantic'' article I quoted earlier, James Fallows observed:\n\n       Heads of the major coal-mining and electric-power utilities \n     in United States and China accept as settled fact that \n     greenhouse gas emissions are an emergency they must confront \n     because of the likely disruptive effect on the world climate.\n\n  Even they get it but not us. We, the generation that lives today, the \nCongress that serves today, the public servants in office today can \nbegin to turn the tide, and we must if we are to live up to our legacy \nas Americans and face up to the judgment of history. We can fight the \npropaganda. We can be servants of the truth. We can prevent \nmanufactured doubt from ruling the day. But we haven't.\n  Losing another year in which we could have taken the action demanded \nof us by our economy, by our national security, by our planet was a \nmistake. Losing this great democracy to the inertia and cynicism of \nthese political times would be a disaster.\n  But beyond the four walls of this Chamber, I believe there is reason \nto hope. Each day Americans are waking up to this challenge. Each day \nyoung people are joining together in their neighborhoods attempting \nsmall but significant local solutions to this large and imposing global \nproblem. Each day our entrepreneurs seek new rays of opportunity in the \nclouds of dismay, finding ways to serve both their business instincts \nand their duty as citizens of the planet. Each day business leaders are \nlooking at our inaction with growing regret and worry. And each day \nordinary citizens from every walk of life are more and more, with clear \neyes, seeing what we must face in the years ahead.\n  Many things influence our political institutions. Yes, money does; \nyes, partisanship does. But more than anything else, we are all \nservants. Each of us, given loud enough calls from our country, from \nour States, from our communities, will have no choice but to listen.\n  So even as I communicate to my colleagues my disappointment at this \nyear's failure, I wish to challenge Americans to take into their own \nhands the job of creating next year's success. Call us. Write to us. \nMake us do this. You know we will be a stronger America if we do. You \nknow we will be a safer America if we do. You know we will be a more \nrespected America if we do. Make us do this.\n  Every American generation is given its chance to meet with honor, \nenergy, and wisdom the great challenges of its day. Every American \ngeneration can rise to meet those challenges in a way that burnishes \nthe gleam of our city on a hill, in a way that brightens the lamp \nAmerica holds out in the darkness. That moment is upon us in this time \nand place, and we must rise to it.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the majority leader for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ENERGY REFORM\n\n\tMr. WHITEHOUSE.

But we haven't.\n\tLosing another year in which we could have taken the action demanded of us by our economy, by our national security, by our planet was a mistake. Losing this great democracy to the inertia and cynicism of these political times would be a disaster.\n\tBut beyond the four walls of this Chamber, I believe there is reason to hope. Each day Americans are waking up to this challenge. Each day young people are joining together in their neighborhoods attempting small but significant local solutions to this large and imposing global problem. Each day our entrepreneurs seek new rays of opportunity in the clouds of dismay, finding ways to serve both their business instincts and their duty as citizens of the planet. Each day business leaders are looking at our inaction with growing regret and worry. And each day ordinary citizens from every walk of life are more and more, with clear eyes, seeing what we must face in the years ahead.\n\tMany things influence our political institutions. Yes, money does; yes, partisanship does. But more than anything else, we are all servants. Each of us, given loud enough calls from our country, from our States, from our communities, will have no choice but to listen.\n\tSo even as I communicate to my colleagues my disappointment at this year's failure, I wish to challenge Americans to take into their own hands the job of creating next year's success. Call us. Write to us. Make us do this. You know we will be a stronger America if we do. You know we will be a safer America if we do. You know we will be a more respected America if we do. Make us do this.\n\tEvery American generation is given its chance to meet with honor, energy, and wisdom the great challenges of its day. Every American generation can rise to meet those challenges in a way that burnishes the gleam of our city on a hill, in a way that brightens the lamp America holds out in the darkness. That moment is upon us in this time and place, and we must rise to it.\n\tI yield the floor, and I thank the majority leader for his courtesy.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the course of the last two decades \nI have had the honor of watching a very smart, but very green young man \nfrom Louisville grow into one of the finest people you could ever work \nwith or call a friend.\n  There is almost no hat that Billy Piper has not worn in the 19 years \nhe has worked in my office--from driver, to mailroom staffer, to \nlegislative aide, to campaign worker, all the way up to chief of staff.\n  He's done it all. And in the course of doing it all, he became \nindispensable to me. And that's why it is so hard to say goodbye. But \nBilly has simply given too much of himself to leave without a proper \nsend-off.\n  One of Billy's defining traits is that he deflects praise. This \nmorning I would like to deny him the chance.\n  A native of Louisville, Billy attended the Kentucky Country Day \nschool and then moved to Virginia to attend the University of Richmond. \nHe spent a semester here in Washington studying public policy and \npolitics and did an internship with Senator Lugar's office, which he \nliked so much he decided to look for a permanent job on the Hill. And I \nwould like to thank Senator Lugar today for inspiring Billy to public \nservice.\n  Billy was so eager to take a job in my office, in fact, that he \nagreed to be a driver even after he learned I had a stick shift--which \nhe didn't know how to drive. His knowledge of Washington, D.C., streets \nwasn't that much better. But he decided the best way to learn both was \nby driving around a U.S. Senator. Our first day on the road was a \nlittle rough. But ever since he mastered the clutch, Billy hasn't made \na misstep since. When he wasn't driving, Billy sorted the mail that \ncame into the office. And it didn't take long for me to see this young \nman had a lot of potential, so I gave him more and more responsibility.\n  He became a legislative correspondent, handling military and foreign \naffairs. And in 1996 I asked him to be the finance director for my \nreelection campaign. Without hesitation, Billy left a secure position \nand his home for an extremely hard campaign job on the road. It wasn't \nan easy job. And in any campaign, there's no guarantee of victory. But \nBilly excelled at it, as usual, and at every task I've given him since.\n  Ask other members of my staff to describe Billy and they will tell \nyou he's not only a friend, but a teacher and a mentor.\n  Lots of people come to Capitol Hill with good intentions and wanting \nto do the right thing--but not all of them learn how to get things \ndone. In my office, the road to mastery of any job usually ran through \nBilly Piper. First of all, Billy puts everyone at ease, from the \ncollege student applying for an internship to heads of state. He treats \neveryone the same, regardless of their station. He also refuses to take \npraise, and even if he does, he's usually eager to deflect it onto the \nrest of the team. He's also got a wicked sense of humor. It's a regular \npart of the day to hear laughter pealing from Billy's office.\n  Billy became the chief of staff in my personal office toward the end \nof 2002. And for the last 8 years, he has shown first-class leadership \nas the steady\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\nhand at the wheel. He has shown extraordinarily sound judgment. He's \nalways been ready to do whatever he was asked, whatever it took. Most \nof all, Billy knew who we all worked for: 4 million Kentuckians. For 8 \nyears, Billy has been my right-hand man.\n  Two years ago, Billy was invaluable to me in my reelection campaign. \nOnce again, he proved himself equal to any challenge. He was the one \nman who knew everything that was going on and what everyone else was \ndoing. He was and is unflappable, steady, and always confident.\n  He gave it everything he had--and always with a smile on his face. \nAnd it wasn't easy for him, I know. With a young family at home, he \nsacrificed much. He's very fortunate that Holly's an understanding \nwife.\n  More than anyone else, Billy is responsible for fostering the feeling \nof family in my office. It's one of the things we'll miss most about \nhim. He always made staff feel like they're more than just a group of \npeople in an office. He's grown close to a lot of them over the years, \nand they all love him and admire him.\n  But as tough as this change is for me, I know it's as tough for Billy \ntoo. Here's a guy who went to the same school from kindergarten through \nthe 12th grade, lived in the same house his whole childhood, and has \nhad the same work e-mail address since we started using e-mail around \nhere. But he is making this change for the right reason. When he \nannounced his decision, Billy said, ``I love this office, I love the \nSenate, and I love Kentucky . . . but I love my family more.'' And no \none can begrudge him that.\n  So while this is a loss for me, my staff, my colleagues in the \nSenate, and the many people he's helped in Kentucky over the years, it \nis a gain for Billy's wife Holly, and their two little boys Billy and \nTucker. And I wish the Piper family great happiness. I can hardly \nbelieve the man I am saying goodbye to is the same young man who stood \nfor a high-school photo with me back in 1986.\n  Sadly, Billy's parents aren't here to share in Billy's sendoff from \nthe Senate. But if you knew Bill and Ann Piper, you would not be \nsurprised by the kind of person Billy is or the success he has become. \nAnd I know they would be bursting with pride if they were here today to \nsee what their son's accomplished. It was the love of a strong family \nthat started Billy off on the right track, and it is because of his \nlove for his family today that we bid him farewell. You can't say Billy \nPiper's priorities aren't in the right place.\n  Before I finish, I would just like to read from an e-mail Billy sent \nto the entire staff on his last day--an e-mail that sums up the kind of \nguy Billy is. Here's what he wrote: ``The great honor of my \nprofessional life has been being able to call myself a McTeamer for \nnearly 20 years. This is an experience I will treasure all the more \nbecause of the wonderful friends I have made along the way. I am better \nfor having known and worked with each of you. Thank you for all you \nhave done and continue to do. I am in your debt.''\n  Billy, as usual, you are generous with praise for everyone but \nyourself. But we're the ones who are thankful. We are the ones who are \nbetter for having known you. And the honor was all ours. Most of all, \nthough, the honor was mine to stand alongside you through the years, as \nyour mentor and your friend. I watched as you inspired others. You've \ninspired me. Thank you for your service and your friendship.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "TRIBUTE TO BILLY PIPER\n\n\tMr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, just as the majority leader started to \nleave the floor, I said to him, what an amazing 2 years. I just left an \ninterview upstairs where a major network asked me: What do you think \nyou have accomplished over the last 2 years?\n  I said to him: I can't speak for what happened 30 or 40 years ago in \nthe Senate; I wasn't around. But I can tell you that in the 28 years I \nhave been in the House and Senate, I have never seen a more amazing, \nproductive session of Congress.\n  In the Senate, you had to put it into perspective. At the same time \nwe were accomplishing these things, we were facing record numbers of \nfilibusters--more obstacles than ever in history. Yet, when you look at \nthe record that was written over the last 2 years in this Chamber and \nin the House of Representatives, working with the President, it is \nnothing short of amazing.\n  Allow me to go through my checklist here. I am sure others will \nquestion some things I put on the list and add some of their own \nparticularly the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who certainly is an \ninspiring leader on so many of these important issues.\n  First and foremost, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. That \nis what the President came to Washington to initiate to stop this \nrecession and slow down the growth in unemployment. None of us is happy \nwith the state of the economy, but it would have been dramatically \nworse had we not done that.\n  Two, Wall Street reform. We looked at the root causes of the \nrecession and said we are going to change the law and add oversight and \ninvestigators to stop Wall Street from bringing us another recession \nsome day in the future.\n  No. 3, the HIRE Act, a jobs package to encourage businesses to hire \nunemployed workers. We have been focusing on jobs since we got here, \nand we need to continue that focus.\n  No. 4 was a measure we passed in this lameduck session, the middle-\nclass tax package, extending middle-class tax breaks for working \nfamilies and lower income families, I might add, as well as others in \nthe year to come so we can keep this economic growth moving in the \nright direction.\n  No. 5, credit card company regulations, long overdue. People \ncomplained about abuses by credit card companies, and we passed major \nregulatory reform.\n  No. 6, small business lending fund. The Small Business Credit and \nJobs Act could provide up to $300 billion in loans to small businesses \nacross America that were having trouble finding money in the private \nsector. That could, I think, dramatically increase jobs from small \nbusinesses.\n  No. 7 occurred as part of our agenda in the lameduck session, the \nextension of unemployment insurance. Time and again we did it and then \nin the tax package we extended it for 13 months so that millions of \nAmericans would have a basic check to buy with each week.\n  First-time home buyers tax credit is No. 8, which encourages more \npeople to buy homes for the first time and it gave them a tax incentive \nto achieve that.\n  The next item I will mention is health care reform. Some would put it \nas No. 1. I certainly would put it as No. 1 or No. 2. This is the first \nPresident in almost 90 years to successfully tackle the challenge of \nthe rising cost of health care and the need for basic reform. Sure, it \nis controversial, but as the provisions of this health care reform bill \nunfold and are implemented, they can bring us to a point where the cost \nof health care will come down and there will be more available to \npeople who currently are not protected.\n  No. 10, the Children's Health Insurance Program. We reauthorized and \nexpanded it. After two vetoes by the former President, this bill \nexpanded health insurance coverage for over 4 million previously \nuninsured children.\n  No. 11--my hats off to the Senator from Iowa--food safety. There were \ntimes in the last week or two that it was a dead duck in the lameduck. \nSomehow or another, it found its wings and started to fly and was \npassed by both the House and the Senate.\n  I worked on this measure for 16 years. The Senator from Iowa brought \nit across the finish line with the kind of skills he has developed as a \nleader in the Senate. It is great to team up with him. People's lives \nwill be saved and people spared serious illness because of this bill.\n  No. 12, child nutrition, a favorite of the First Lady. I thank \nSenator Blanche Lincoln, who is leaving us, for her leadership on this \nissue. We are providing nutritious meals to hungry children and \nincreasing the Federal reimbursement rate for school meals so local \ngovernments do not have to absorb the increased cost.\n  No. 13--here is an issue front and center in my career in the House \nand Senate--tobacco regulation. The bill we passed calls on the Food \nand Drug Administration to regulate the manufacture, sale, and \npromotion of tobacco products. The things we did in this bill, I say to \nSenator Harkin, would have\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\nbeen unthinkable 10 years ago. But we did them to try to keep these \ntobacco products out of the hands of kids.\n  No. 14 on my list is something that passed a few hours ago, ratifying \nthe New START treaty. This is what the President needed. This is what \nAmerica needed. We only have one President. We want to give him the \nauthority to keep America safe. We want his word to be good. We want \nhim to engage former adversaries as future allies with the passage of \nthe New START treaty.\n  No. 15 is one near and dear to my heart. It was originally introduced \nby Hillary Clinton, and when she left to join the President's Cabinet, \nI asked if I could take up the cause of passing the veterans caregiver \nassistance bill. In a word, it means those disabled veterans who return \nhome, who are fortunate to have a spouse, a parent, or a member of \ntheir family who will sacrifice their own lives to make sure they are \ncomfortable in their homes will receive some help from the government. \nThese are people who get to stay home as disabled veterans and, because \nsomeone in the family will stay with them where they want to be, at \nconsiderably less expense to our government but in the right, positive \nenvironment for our disabled veterans. This bill gives those veteran \ncaregivers a little additional assistance, some respite time, and a \nmodest stipend each month so they can continue to do this invaluable \nwork on behalf of the men and women who sacrifice so much for our \ncountry.\n  No. 16 we passed today as well, the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. \nWe said so much in tribute to first responders--police, firefighters \nand others--who came to Ground Zero when they were called. Today we \nsaid we were going to stand by them with any illness that came about as \na result of that experience.\n  No. 17, repeal of don't ask, don't tell. I went to that ceremony \ntoday, and I have to tell you, I thought it was one of the most \nprofound experiences I had. To see an auditorium filled with people who \ncared so much for this issue, many of whom have seen their lives \nwrecked because of discrimination based on their sexual orientation. \nThe Pledge of Allegiance was given by retired Air Force COL Margarethe \nCammermeyer. I know her story well because I told it so many times. She \nwas an Air Force nurse who risked her life to save the lives of \nservicemen in Vietnam who rose through the ranks until one day she \nannounced, when asked, that she was a lesbian. She was discharged, \nretired from the service. Never in the course of her military career \nhad anything about her sexual preference had any impact on her service \nto the Nation, but she was discriminated against because of who she \nwas.\n  She gave the Pledge of Allegiance today with tears in her eyes and \njoined all of us applauding President Obama as he finally signed this \nbill repealing don't ask, don't tell.\n  No. 18 is a bill I worked on, and the most unlikely political odd \ncouple on Capitol Hill, Jeff Sessions. It is the Fair Sentencing Act \nwhich reduced the unfair disparity in sentencing between crack and \npowder cocaine. There are literally thousands of men and women serving \ntime in prison because of this disparity in sentencing. Senator \nSessions and I reached an accommodation, an agreement, a compromise on \nsentencing which brings us closer to the reality of the danger of the \nnarcotics involved. I thank him for his bipartisan cooperation.\n  No. 19 is the first bill signed by President Obama as President of \nthe United States, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to try to once and \nfor all end discrimination of women in the workplace.\n  No. 20, the hate crimes prevention bill. That is one I think is \nabsolutely essential to renew the promise in America that we will never \ndiscriminate against people based on sexual orientation, race, gender, \ncreed, or national origin. That bill was long overdue. The Matthew \nShepard family, who helped us pass that bill, was instrumental in \nmoving America forward in the field of human rights.\n  I am sure Senator Harkin can add three or four of his own to that \nlist.\n  When I look back and reflect on 2 years of hard work, it is worth the \neffort. All the long nights, all the time away from family, some of the \nfrustration, all of the anger, all of it was worth it when we look back \nin time and say in our time here, many of us believe we have helped to \nmove America forward with the work we have done in the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to my friend \nfrom Illinois as he went down his list. I admit it is a pretty thorough \nlist. I may have missed one. I was conversing with another Senator \nbriefly. Did I miss the higher education bill? The list covered \neverything else, I say to my friend. The Higher Education Act, which \nhistorically, I say to Senator Durbin, in 1992, Senator Kennedy, then \nthe chair of the committee which I now chair, had done a study to see \nwhether direct loans would be better than the indirect loans that go \nthrough banks for students going to college.\n  We had this study done, this pilot program. In 1993 and 1994, the \npilot program ran. By 1994, the data was in. The Direct Loan Program \nworked well. It saved tons of money, and the schools liked it, students \nliked it. Our goal was that in 1995, we were going to then expand it \nnationwide. Of course, we know what happened in 1995. We lost the \nCongress. It went to the Republican side.\n  The Republicans did not want to expand the Direct Loan Program. They \nwanted to keep it going through the banks. Banks loved it. Who does not \nlike free money? From 1995 on, we never had the opportunity to ever \nexpand the Direct Loan Program and save all this money, until finally \nwhen Barack Obama became President and Democrats took over the House \nand the Senate, we were able to pass it and, as the Senator knows, we \nsigned that into law, I think if I am not mistaken, in February of this \nyear right after we passed the health care bill, and it was part of the \nhealth care bill.\n  In passing that bill, we went from indirect loans to Direct Loan \nProgram and save $60 billion in 10 years. We took that money and put it \nin better Pell grants for students.\n  I say to my friend to illustrate, sometimes it takes a long time \naround here to get things done. If you persevere and the stars align \nright, you can get it done. It is also a way of saying to my friend \nfrom Illinois, thank you for what you did for food safety. I get a lot \nof accolades. I just happened to be here as chairman of the committee \nat the right time to get it through. Anyone who knows anything about \nthis issue knows Senator Durbin was the Senator who got this going. I \nalways wondered how many years ago. He said 16 years ago.\n  Again, there is perseverance, stick to it. When you know what is \nright and good for this country, do not give up and hang in there. \nSenator Durbin hung in there for 16 long years. We finally got the bill \ndone and passed. I think the President will be signing it into law some \ntime before January 5.\n  A lot fewer people will get sick, a lot more families will be \nhealthy, and our food will be safer because of the efforts of Senator \nDurbin. I publicly thank him for all of his work on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n\tMr. DURBIN. Mr. President, just as the majority leader started to leave the floor, I said to him, what an amazing 2 years. I just left an interview upstairs where a major network asked me: What do you think you have accomplished over the last 2 years?\n\tI said to him: I can't speak for what happened 30 or 40 years ago in the Senate; I wasn't around. But I can tell you that in the 28 years I have been in the House and Senate, I have never seen a more amazing, productive session of Congress.\n\tIn the Senate, you had to put it into perspective. At the same time we were accomplishing these things, we were facing record numbers of filibusters--more obstacles than ever in history. Yet, when you look at the record that was written over the last 2 years in this Chamber and in the House of Representatives, working with the President, it is nothing short of amazing.\n\tAllow me to go through my checklist here. I am sure others will question some things I put on the list and add some of their own particularly the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who certainly is an inspiring leader on so many of these important issues.\n\tFirst and foremost, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. That is what the President came to Washington to initiate to stop this recession and slow down the growth in unemployment. None of us is happy with the state of the economy, but it would have been dramatically worse had we not done that.\n\tTwo, Wall Street reform. We looked at the root causes of the recession and said we are going to change the law and add oversight and investigators to stop Wall Street from bringing us another recession some day in the future.\n\tNo. 3, the HIRE Act, a jobs package to encourage businesses to hire unemployed workers. We have been focusing on jobs since we got here, and we need to continue that focus.\n\tNo. 4 was a measure we passed in this lameduck session, the middle-class tax package, extending middle-class tax breaks for working families and lower income families, I might add, as well as others in the year to come so we can keep this economic growth moving in the right direction.\n\tNo. 5, credit card company regulations, long overdue. People complained about abuses by credit card companies, and we passed major regulatory reform.\n\tNo. 6, small business lending fund. The Small Business Credit and Jobs Act could provide up to $300 billion in loans to small businesses across America that were having trouble finding money in the private sector. That could, I think, dramatically increase jobs from small businesses.\n\tNo. 7 occurred as part of our agenda in the lameduck session, the extension of unemployment insurance. Time and again we did it and then in the tax package we extended it for 13 months so that millions of Americans would have a basic check to buy with each week.\n\tFirst-time home buyers tax credit is No. 8, which encourages more people to buy homes for the first time and it gave them a tax incentive to achieve that.\n\tThe next item I will mention is health care reform. Some would put it as No. 1. I certainly would put it as No. 1 or No. 2. This is the first President in almost 90 years to successfully tackle the challenge of the rising cost of health care and the need for basic reform. Sure, it is controversial, but as the provisions of this health care reform bill unfold and are implemented, they can bring us to a point where the cost of health care will come down and there will be more available to people who currently are not protected.\n\tNo. 10, the Children's Health Insurance Program. We reauthorized and expanded it. After two vetoes by the former President, this bill expanded health insurance coverage for over 4 million previously uninsured children.\n\tNo. 11--my hats off to the Senator from Iowa--food safety. There were times in the last week or two that it was a dead duck in the lameduck. Somehow or another, it found its wings and started to fly and was passed by both the House and the Senate.\n\tI worked on this measure for 16 years. The Senator from Iowa brought it across the finish line with the kind of skills he has developed as a leader in the Senate. It is great to team up with him. People's lives will be saved and people spared serious illness because of this bill.\n\tNo. 12, child nutrition, a favorite of the First Lady. I thank Senator Blanche Lincoln, who is leaving us, for her leadership on this issue. We are providing nutritious meals to hungry children and increasing the Federal reimbursement rate for school meals so local governments do not have to absorb the increased cost.\n\tNo. 13--here is an issue front and center in my career in the House and Senate--tobacco regulation. The bill we passed calls on the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the manufacture, sale, and promotion of tobacco products. The things we did in this bill, I say to Senator Harkin, would have been unthinkable 10 years ago. But we did them to try to keep these tobacco products out of the hands of kids.\n\tNo. 14 on my list is something that passed a few hours ago, ratifying the New START treaty. This is what the President needed. This is what America needed. We only have one President. We want to give him the authority to keep America safe. We want his word to be good. We want him to engage former adversaries as future allies with the passage of the New START treaty.\n\tNo. 15 is one near and dear to my heart. It was originally introduced by Hillary Clinton, and when she left to join the President's Cabinet, I asked if I could take up the cause of passing the veterans caregiver assistance bill. In a word, it means those disabled veterans who return home, who are fortunate to have a spouse, a parent, or a member of their family who will sacrifice their own lives to make sure they are comfortable in their homes will receive some help from the government. These are people who get to stay home as disabled veterans and, because someone in the family will stay with them where they want to be, at considerably less expense to our government but in the right, positive environment for our disabled veterans. This bill gives those veteran caregivers a little additional assistance, some respite time, and a modest stipend each month so they can continue to do this invaluable work on behalf of the men and women who sacrifice so much for our country.\n\tNo. 16 we passed today as well, the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. We said so much in tribute to first responders--police, firefighters and others--who came to Ground Zero when they were called. Today we said we were going to stand by them with any illness that came about as a result of that experience.\n\tNo. 17, repeal of don't ask, don't tell. I went to that ceremony today, and I have to tell you, I thought it was one of the most profound experiences I had. To see an auditorium filled with people who cared so much for this issue, many of whom have seen their lives wrecked because of discrimination based on their sexual orientation.

I thank him for his bipartisan cooperation.\n\tNo. 19 is the first bill signed by President Obama as President of the United States, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to try to once and for all end discrimination of women in the workplace.\n\tNo. 20, the hate crimes prevention bill.

That bill was long overdue.

Mr. President, time and time I have come to the floor to \ngive a few remarks about Senators who are retiring and leaving the \nSenate. They all contributed in their unique way one way or the other \nto the Senate. Now I find myself with two left about whom I want to \ncomment on their way out of the Senate.\n  In the closing days of the 111th Congress, we are saying goodbye to a \nnumber of colleagues, including a veteran Member, much respected on \nboth sides of the aisle. I speak of the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh.\n  I listened with great interest to Senator Bayh's eloquent farewell \nremarks earlier this month. The Senator was also kind enough to have \nthem typed up and sent to our offices.\n  Looking back on his 12 years in this body, he spoke about times of \nnational crisis, including after the 9/11 attacks and during the \nfinancial meltdown of 2008. He talked of a time when Senators acted not \nas Democrats and Republicans but as patriots concerned of doing one \nthing: doing what is right for the American people. He said that these \ntimes of bipartisan action were with the Senate at its very best.\n  For more than two decades, Senator Bayh has embodied everything that \nis\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\ngood about this body: a passion for public service, a sincere desire to \nreach out across the aisle, a great talent for forging coalitions and \nbringing people together, and a willingness to work long hours to \naccomplish important things.\n  As we all know, Evan is what we might call a ``son of the Senate.'' \nHe is enormously proud to have been elected to the same seat his father \nSenator Birch Bayh held for two terms and who remains a great friend of \nmine after all these years. He has followed in his father's footsteps \nin fighting for quality public schools, student loans, retirement \nsecurity, and giving every American access to quality, affordable \nhealth care.\n  In addition, he has been a leader in strengthening our Armed Forces \nand national security. I know that Senator Bayh takes special pride in \nleading the charge to provide our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with \nmuch improved mine-resistant armored vehicles.\n  As he leaves this body, Senator Bayh is still a young man with many \nchapters yet to be written in his life and career. For more than a \nquarter century, he has devoted himself to public service, first as \nIndiana's secretary of state, then as an enormously successful two-term \nGovernor of Indiana, and, of course, since 1999 as a Senator.\n  I have always been a big admirer of one of his signature \naccomplishments as Governor, which was passing legislation creating the \n21st Century Scholars Program. It is a wonderful program. Thanks to his \ninitiative, every child in Indiana who is eligible for the free lunch \nprogram in public schools, who graduates from high school, and signs a \npledge not to experiment with illegal drugs is entitled--get this--is \nentitled to a full tuition scholarship at the Indiana public university \nof his or her choice.\n  Over the years, many thousands of Hoosiers of modest means have been \nable to attend college thanks to this remarkable law. That is what I \ncall a great--I hope my friend does not mind me saying this--populist, \nprogressive accomplishment. It speaks volumes about Evan Bayh's \npriorities and values throughout his 24 years in public service.\n  During his two terms in this body, Senator Bayh has always faithfully \nserved the people of Indiana and the people of the United States. I \nhope and expect he will pursue new avenues of public service after he \nleaves the Senate because our country sorely needs public servants of \nhis caliber, intelligence, and accomplishments.\n  I will miss the day-to-day friendships, the counsels, the \ninterchanges we have had together in the Senate. I wish Evan and his \nwonderful wife Susan and their twin sons, Beau and Nick, the very best \nin the years ahead.\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to pay a farewell to another long-time \nlegislative partner, and that is Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.\n  I listened with great interest to Senator Specter's farewell remarks \nyesterday. He decried the decline of bipartisan cooperation in this \nbody. As he put it:\n\n       In some quarters, compromising has become a dirty word. \n     Politics is no longer the art of the possible when senators \n     are intransigent in their positions.\n\n  During his remarkable 30 years in the Senate--he is the longest \nserving U.S. Senator in Pennsylvania's history--Arlen Specter has been \nadmired for his fierce independence and for his willingness to cross \nparty lines in order to accomplish big and important things for this \ncountry.\n  Nowhere has this been more vividly on display than in the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services Subcommittee of the Committee on \nAppropriations, on which Senator Specter and I are senior members. \nBefore last year, when he returned to his roots as a Democrat, Arlen \nwas the senior Republican and I was the senior Democrat on that \nsubcommittee. Since 1989, as the majority in the Senate has gone back \nand forth between the two parties, we alternated as either chair or \nranking member. But the transitions were seamless as we passed the \ngavel back and forth because Arlen and I forged an unshakable \npartnership.\n  That partnership has been grounded in our shared commitment to \nfinding cures for diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease to \nAlzheimer's and in our determination to maintain the National \nInstitutes of Health as the jewel in the crown of international \nbiomedical research. Our proudest accomplishment was our collaboration \nin doubling funding for the National Institutes of Health over a 5-year \nperiod, between 1998 and 2003. Last year, we again collaborated in \nsecuring $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health in the \nRecovery Act, although I must be honest and give the senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania the lion's share of credit for that accomplishment.\n  I say without fear of contradiction that there has been no Member of \nCongress in the Senate or the House who has championed NIH as \npassionately and relentlessly and successfully as Senator Arlen \nSpecter. Indeed, at times, in my role when I was chair of the \nAppropriations Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee, I have \nhad to remind Arlen that there were other programs besides the NIH in \nour appropriations bill. In fairness, Senator Specter has also fought \npassionately to increase funding for public schools and to increase \naccess to higher education, but there is no question that his great \npassion, his living legacy has been the National Institutes of Health \nand biomedical research. Today, the prowess and excellence of the \nNational Institutes of Health is truly a living legacy to Senator \nSpecter, and we have countless new medical cures and therapies because \nof Senator Specter's long and determined advocacy.\n  Mr. President, I will miss my good friend and colleague from \nPennsylvania, who has been a tremendous ally for many years. As he \ndeparts the Senate, he can take enormous pride in 30 years of truly \ndistinguished service to the people of Pennsylvania and the United \nStates. I wish Arlen and his wonderful wife Joan the very best in the \nyears ahead.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and wish the occupant of \nthe chair the best of the holiday season and a happy New Year. We will \nsee you when we come back to the next Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Russ Feingold.\n  I have had the privilege of serving with Senator Feingold since he \nand I were both elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992. Over the past 18 \nyears, Senator Feingold has been an independent, passionate advocate \nfor his State and his Nation. He was consistently a voice of conscience \nin the Senate, never afraid to ask the tough questions or to speak out \nagainst policies he believed were flawed.\n  Over the years, Senator Feingold has distinguished himself as a \nleading expert on foreign and domestic policy who is willing to work \nacross party lines to get the job done, whether it was reforming our \nNation's campaign finance laws or working to end the atrocities \ncommitted by Ugandan rebels in the Lord's Resistance Army.\n  I have had the privilege of sitting next to Senator Feingold in the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee. I have been proud to witness how, \nas the chair of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, he has led the \nSenate in recognizing and addressing many of Africa's unique issues and \nchallenges. He was one of the first to speak out about the genocide in \nthe Darfur region of Sudan. He has advocated for an end to the illicit \nmining of conflict minerals that support armed conflict in the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo. And he has placed a spotlight on drug \ntrafficking in West Africa, the threat of terrorism in Somalia, and the \naffects of global diseases such as malaria on African populations.\n  Senator Feingold is a great reformer, taking the lead on campaign \nfinance reform and on the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Senator Feingold has been such an incredible champion for human \nrights, and I am personally grateful for his work on women's rights, \nparticularly his commitment to combating violence against women and \ngirls worldwide.\n  His passion, expertise, and dedication to these issues are unmatched \nand will be greatly missed.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Byron Dorgan.\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\n  It has been an honor to serve with Senator Dorgan since he and I were \nboth elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992.\n  Nobody can get to the heart of a matter like Byron Dorgan. He has an \nunbelievable ability to lay out both challenges and solutions with \nclarity. He is a populist in the best sense of the word, and our \ncountry is better for his service in this Chamber.\n  Senator Dorgan has always been a champion for the people of North \nDakota, for our workers, and for rural Americans. For the last 18 \nyears, he has devoted himself to supporting family farms and promoting \neconomic development across our country.\n  Senator Dorgan has been a leader in the Senate in fighting to \npreserve jobs here in America and end tax breaks for companies that \nship jobs overseas. No one has fought harder for the middle class.\n  He used his position as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water \nAppropriations Subcommittee to advance important projects and create \njobs, and I will always be thankful for his support in our efforts to \nprotect California communities from flooding.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Dorgan \nhas worked tirelessly to improve health care and economic opportunities \nfor Indians. He has helped streamline the bureaucracy of the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs. He developed the landmark Tribal Law and Order Act, \nwhich helped give tribal justice officials the tools they need to \nprotect their communities. I was so proud to cosponsor that bill and so \npleased that President Obama signed it into law this year.\n  He leaves a distinguished legacy and will be greatly missed by all of \nus.\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, \nSenator Arlen Specter.\n  Senator Specter has spent five terms serving the people of \nPennsylvania here in Congress--longer than any other Pennsylvania \nSenator. All of us can take a lesson from his dedication and passion \nfor fighting for the people of his State.\n  A member of the Judiciary Committee since he joined Congress, Senator \nSpecter built on his background as an attorney and eventually assumed \nthe chairmanship of the committee. His expertise on constitutional \nissues has long been admired by his colleagues.\n  Senator Specter was always a leader on issues relating to our \nNational Institutes of Health, championing investment in scientific \nresearch to find lifesaving treatments and cures for a range of \ndiseases. He understood firsthand how crucial such funding could be, \nhaving fought his own battle with cancer. When we passed the Recovery \nAct, it was Senator Specter who ensured that it would include \nsignificant investments in NIH. His efforts to help double NIH's budget \nhave contributed to advances in treatments for Parkinson's, cancer, \nheart disease and Alzheimer's.\n  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work closely with Senator \nSpecter on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He has \nbeen a thoughtful and constructive member committed to addressing \nclimate change and fighting for clean energy jobs.\n  Senator Specter loves this institution, and he will be missed. He has \nleft his mark, and I thank him for his decades of dedicated public \nservice.\n\n\n                               Chris Dodd\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me today in \nrecognize the extraordinary leadership and service of our friend, \nSenator Chris Dodd.\n  Senator Dodd has served the Senate with grace, intelligence, and \ncompassion for three decades. The son of a U.S. Senator, he loves this \ninstitution and has done everything he could to preserve its best \ntraditions. Senator Dodd has always encouraged all of us to keep our \ndisputes and differences from becoming personal.\n  He leaves behind an incredible legacy of accomplishments that have \ntouched the lives of virtually all Americans.\n  I will never forget the leadership role he played in helping to pass \nhealth care reform last spring--a fitting tribute to his close friend \nTed Kennedy, whose vision finally became a reality.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \nSenator Dodd led the effort to pass Wall Street reform legislation. He \nwas a forceful advocate for holding banks accountable for their \nactions, and we could not have enacted this landmark accomplishment \nwithout his leadership.\n  Senator Dodd has devoted his career in public service to making life \nbetter for our families and our children. I saw this firsthand as we \nworked together to ensure that our children have safe places to go \nafter school. As chairman of the Senate Afterschool Caucus and the \nfounder of the Senate's first Children's Caucus, Senator Dodd worked \nhard to expand the Head Start program, to reform the No Child Left \nBehind Act, and to make college more affordable for students and their \nfamilies.\n  In the face of Presidential vetoes, Senator Dodd dedicated 8 years to \nenacting the Family and Medical Leave Act, which has helped ensure that \n50 million Americans can care for their loved ones during difficult \ntimes without fearing for their jobs.\n  Senator Dodd is a fluent Spanish speaker and has been the Senate's \nleading expert on Latin America. I have been proud to work closely with \nhim to reform our Nation's drug certification laws.\n  His own years of service in the U.S. Peace Corps inspired Senator \nDodd to support and promote President Kennedy's call to service in this \nChamber. In the Senate, he has helped expand and modernize the Peace \nCorps and worked to provide loan forgiveness to Peace Corps volunteers, \nteachers, and others who devote themselves to public service.\n  All of us in the Senate will greatly miss Senator Dodd.\n\n\n                            Blanche Lincoln\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Blanche Lincoln.\n  Senator Lincoln has spent her entire career serving the people of \nArkansas, and she has been a passionate and effective leader for her \nState.\n  She has been an inspiration to so many women. Senator Lincoln made \nhistory as the first woman to chair the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry Committee, and I will never forget how Senator Lincoln led \nby example, showing us you could be a young mom in the Senate, \ndedicated to your children, while also being a strong advocate for your \nState.\n  She has been a leader in the Senate on child nutrition and has worked \ntirelessly to pass important legislation, including the Healthy, \nHunger-Free Kids Act that was just signed into law by President Obama. \nThe measure will help combat the nationwide epidemic of obesity by \nmaking sure our schoolchildren have access to healthy, nutritious \nmeals.\n  As a cofounder of the Senate Hunger Caucus, Senator Lincoln has \nplayed a crucial role in shedding light on a problem that affects so \nmany, both at home and abroad.\n  Senator Lincoln was never afraid to stand up for what she believed \nin. She showed her tenacity in fighting for greater transparency and \naccountability in derivatives markets during the debate over Wall \nStreet reform.\n  She has been a fighter for her State and her legislative \naccomplishments will have a profound impact on the lives of so many \nchildren and communities across our country.\n  I want to thank her for her years of friendship and for her dedicated \nservice here in the Senate. We will all miss her.\n\n\n                            christopher dodd\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \npaying tribute to Senator Christopher Dodd, a longtime public servant \nand fellow New Englander whose dedication to advancing the common good \nwith common sense, independence, and a genuine desire to solve problems \nhas served both his constituents of Connecticut as well as his country \nfor 36 years. With trust, comity, and a love for the institution of the \nSenate, Senator Dodd has for more than three decades contributed to \ncreating a legislative environment where at crucial moments in the life \nof the greatest deliberative body in human history, the upper Chamber \nwas able to work its will to the lasting benefit of the American \npeople, and we could not be more grateful.\n  Indisputably, and as countless colleagues have noted, public service \nhas\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\nalways been at the center of Senator Dodd's life--literally, as he is \nthe first son of Connecticut to follow his father into the U.S. Senate, \nand remarkably, for the past 30 years, Senator Dodd has had the \nprivilege of sitting at the same desk used by his father, Senator \nThomas Dodd, during his 12 years in the Senate. Chris Dodd's \nlongstanding devotion to the public arena has spanned from his three \nterms in the U.S. House--the last of which I was privileged to serve \nwith him--to his five terms in the U.S. Senate. And Senator Dodd earned \nthe lasting gratitude of his constituents and admiration of his \ncolleagues with his stalwart leadership in foreign policy, his vigorous \nand unwavering battle to enact the Family and Medical Leave Act, and \nhis longstanding stewardship of our Nation's most precious resource--\nour children.\n  And on this last point, like many in this Chamber, I cannot begin to \njustly measure the depth and breadth of the legacy Senator Dodd has \nforged in safeguarding the most vulnerable in our society. Consider for \nexample the issue of child care. Time and again, Senator Dodd has \nbattled to ensure both the quality of child care in America as well as \nthe funding for it, and as he keenly and presciently understood, in \nthis matter, our Nation could not have one without the other.\n  An undeniable focus of Senator Dodd's, child care has unquestionably \nbecome one of his crowning achievements and legislative hallmarks--and \nnowhere was his imprint on the issue greater than during the landmark \nwelfare reform debate in 1995 and 1996. I well recall working with \nSenator Dodd as we made the case that there was indeed a pivotal link \nbetween viable welfare reform and child care--that for families \nstruggling to reduce their dependency on welfare--especially single \nparents--unaffordable, unavailable, or unreliable childcare was the \nchief barrier to steady employment, and one that could and should be \nlessened, if not eliminated.\n  That is why I was pleased to join with Senator Dodd on our amendment \nto add $6 billion in child care funding to welfare reform legislation, \nespecially at a time when that funding was very much imperiled. \nArriving at a consensus required leaders from both parties to jettison \ntheir competing and hardened ideologies in favor not just of making \ndependable childcare more accessible, but in support of welfare reform \nthat would effectively move more Americans from welfare to work. \nSenator Dodd, as colleague after colleague can attest, heeded his own \nbeliefs that ``you don't begin the debate with bipartisanship--you \narrive there. And you can do so only when determined partisans create \nconsensus.'' Because he never lost sight of the primacy of working \nacross the aisle, we were victorious in including the funding we sought \nin the Senate-passed bill.\n  That bipartisan effort to garner concrete results designed to make a \ndifference in the daily lives of the American people was not an \nisolated instance. Senator Dodd and I collaborated on legislation to \nsupport campus-based child care for low income mothers trying to \nfurther their education, and we authored legislation to help states \nimprove training in early childhood development to make improved child \ncare more available to more people. With innate New England pragmatism \nand a desire for solutions, Senator Dodd saw impediments to success \nthat were impinging upon a segment of our society that if only reduced \nor removed would aid not only families striving to improve their lives, \nbut a Nation seeking to help stem the tide of dependency.\n  Ultimately, what occupied Senator Dodd's agenda was the active \npursuit of an even better America. We didn't always agree on what that \npath should be, but where we did find common ground, as in child care, \nwe cultivated it. That dynamic was at work recently as Senator Dodd and \nI, as the former chair and current ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, collaborated to help \nthe economic engines and catalysts of our economy--America's small \nbusinesses, the very enterprises that will lead us out of recession and \ninto recovery.\n  During the consideration of what would become The Dodd-Frank Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act, I truly appreciated Senator \nDodd's perseverance in including a provision I authored allowing small \nbusinesses to raise concerns over burdensome regulations through small \nbusiness review panels within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. \nSenator Dodd and I also worked to reduce the regulatory compliance \nburden for small banks by striking a provision of the bill which would \nhave required these lending institutions to report their transactions \nto the Federal Government down to each individual ATM.\n\n  This kind of rapport was emblematic of how Senator Dodd viewed good \ngovernance. In his valedictory address on the floor of the Senate, he \nobserved that ``in my three decades here, I cannot recall a single \nSenate colleague with whom I could not work.'' Indeed, Senator Dodd \nalways saw adversaries as potential allies--and foes as unwon friends.\n  From the days of his youth, Senator Dodd grew up steeped in the \ntradition of and respect for the Senate--and an abiding admiration for \nthis venerable institution that runs at its own pace and by its own \nrules. Instead of exhibiting rancor and a burning desire to win at all \ncosts, Senator Dodd sought instead to build relationships and by doing \nso, strengthened his capacity for legislating and contributed mightily \nto the advancement of this esteemed Chamber. Legendary American poet \nand son of Maine, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, once wrote that ``if you \nwould hit the mark, you must aim a little above it.'' Chris Dodd has \nalways aimed high--and met his target--leaving a legacy of enormous \naccomplishment to his constituents in Connecticut and to the American \npeople.\n  In closing, let me just extend my personal appreciation to his wife \nJackie and their daughters Grace and Christina for sharing Christopher \nDodd with us\n\n\n                               judd gregg\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in paying a well-\nearned tribute to Senator Judd Gregg, a fellow New Englander and one of \nNew Hampshire's much-admired icons of public service over the last \nthree decades.\n  Senator Gregg has been immersed in public service his entire life, \nbeginning with his father's election as Governor of New Hampshire in \n1952 when Judd was only 5 years old. And through the years, he has \namassed a record of leadership at every level of government that is \ntruly remarkable. It comes as no surprise that Judd is the first public \nservant from the Granite State ever to realize the political trifecta \nof being elected to the three offices of Congressman, Governor, and \nSenator. Serving others goes to the very core of Judd Gregg's persona \nand DNA. It always has and always will.\n  And let me just say, at every step along the way, it has been a \nprivilege for me to witness Senator Gregg's impressive trajectory in \npublic life firsthand. In fact, it was during Judd's years in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, where my husband, Jock McKernan, and I first \ngot to know him as well as his wonderful wife Kathy. And that \nfriendship grew further during Judd's time as Governor as both he and \nJock were chief executives of their respective States during the same \nperiod.\n  And having served with Judd for nearly his entire tenure in the \nSenate, I have been proud to work side by side with an individual whose \norganizing principle behind public service has always been driven by \ncommon sense, pragmatism, and the imperative to forge solutions across \nthe aisle. Time and again, Judd has sought to bridge the political \ndivide to garner results, whether by tackling our Nation's fiscal \nchallenges, promoting land conservation, or most notably, co-authoring \nthe No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 with the late Senator Edward \nKennedy.\n  Indeed, Senator Gregg's rigorous intellect, financial acumen, and \nbudgetary expertise have earned him the respect and admiration of his \nSenate colleagues from both parties and made him one of the Nation's \nmost well-regarded, leading champions of fiscal discipline and \naccountability, and one of the most knowledgeable voices and \nauthorities in addressing our Nation's deficits and debt.\n  In fact, the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility \nand Reform, created by President Obama, is modeled after legislation \nfirst introduced by Senator Gregg, the former chair and current ranking \nmember of\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\nthe Senate Budget Committee, and the current Chair, Senator Kent Conrad \nof North Dakota--both of whom are commissioners. What a fitting coda \nfor one of this generation's stalwart guardians of our Nation's budget.\n  And Senator Gregg's service could not be more emblematic of his \noverall approach to public service which has always hewed to principle \nwith a genuine desire to forge solutions across the aisle. No wonder \nthat earlier this month, Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus wrote \nthat in ``both parties, there are too few Greggs, and too many of them \n. . . are leaving public office.'' I couldn't agree more!\n  Just as Senator Gregg has rightly earned national acclaim as a fiscal \nsteward and sentinel on behalf of the American taxpayer, the heart of \nhis leadership has always remained with his beloved Granite State as \nwell as our region of New England. I well recall the ironclad \nsolidarity our two delegations have shared, particularly in defending \nagainst efforts to close the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Through each of \nthe five Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, rounds from 1988 through \n2005, we have left no stone unturned to champion the cause of the U.S. \nNavy's oldest and best shipyard--and to ensure that the BRAC Commission \nrecognized the legendary work-ethic and world-class craftsmanship of a \nworkforce that is second to none.\n  Former Senate majority and minority leader, Senator Robert Dole, with \nwhom Senator Gregg and I both served, once observed ``as long as there \nare only 3 to 4 people on the floor, the country is in good hands. It's \nonly when you have 50 to 60 in the Senate that you want to be \nconcerned.'' When Judd Gregg was on the floor the people of New \nHampshire and, indeed, the Nation knew that our country was in \ntremendously capable and conscientious hands, and we could not be more \ngrateful!\n  In thanking Senator Gregg for his immeasurable contributions to this \nstoried chamber, I know I join all of my colleagues in wishing him and \nhis beloved wife Kathy, Godspeed, as they embark on the well-earned, \nnext chapter of their lives.\n\n\n                            GEORGE VOINOVICH\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to join in paying tribute to my longtime \ngood friend and colleague, Senator George Voinovich of Ohio. In the \nU.S. Constitution, our Founding Fathers made it clear that there is no \none clear path, background, or station in life that leads to serving in \nthe U.S. Senate. There is an age requirement and a residency \nstipulation and no more. That said, if ever there were a job \ndescription for being a Senator, it occurs to me that a model example \nwe should consider is that of Senator George Voinovich.\n  Senator Voinovich's depth and breadth of wisdom, knowledge, and \nexperience about making government work at all levels which he has \nharnessed throughout his sterling, four decade trajectory in public \nlife recall what James Madison wrote in The Federalist, No. 62 in \nadvocating for a higher age requirement for Senators than members of \nthe House. Madison postulated that the deliberative disposition of the \nSenate required a ``greater extent of information and stability of \ncharacter.'' I don't think it's too far of a stretch to say that James \nMadison must have had a Senator like George Voinovich in mind when \nmaking this case.\n  Before Senator Voinovich even stepped onto the floor of the U.S. \nSenate he had already been Governor of Ohio, mayor of Cleveland, \nLieutenant Governor of Ohio, county commissioner, auditor, and a member \nof the Ohio House of Representatives. With a wealth of insights to draw \nupon through many years of public service, George has always been a \nforce with whom to be reckoned, someone whose viewpoint and counsel are \nsought, and whose example is worthy of being emulated many, many times \nover.\n  My husband Jock, former Governor of Maine, and I first got to know \nSenator Voinovich and his wonderful wife of nearly 50 years, Janet, in \nthe 1990s when Jock and George were both serving as Governor of their \nrespective States and active in the National Governors Association. In \nOhio's State capital of Columbus, George was building on his enormous \nsuccess as Mayor of Cleveland where he inherited a stagnant economy, \nrejuvenated it through fiscal discipline and acumen and public-private \npartnerships, and forged a three-time All-America City winner in the \n1980s.\n  George made similar, remarkable strides as Governor, where, under his \nwatch, unemployment hit a 25-year low and 600,000 new jobs were \ncreated. Many accolades were bestowed upon George for his \naccomplishments at the State level, and they were all well- earned to \nsay the least. In fact, he is still the only individual to serve as \nboth chairman of the National Governors Association and president of \nthe National League of Cities.\n  There are many laudatory characterizations of Senator Voinovich that \nhave already been expressed by my colleagues, and there are certainly \nsome that come to mind, especially as a highly regarded U.S. Senator--\nthoughtful, independent, principled, rigorous, courageous, and \npragmatic. With George, you always knew where he stood on an issue and \nfrankly where you stood with him. In an institution whose very \nfoundation is built upon trust and forging relationships, George was \nsomeone you could count on time and time again.\n  And to say that Senator Voinovich was a workhorse in this Chamber \nfrom day one is an understatement to be sure. His word is as good as \ngold--and as they say, you can take it to the bank. If he shook your \nhand on a deal, that was all that was required. The fact is, they don't \nmake enough legislators or public servants like Senator Voinovich \nanymore. Like the Ohio State flag, the only one in the U.S. not shaped \nlike a rectangle, George has been and will always be . . . one of a \nkind.\n  I can tell this Chamber from firsthand experience, there was no one \nyou would rather be in the trenches with in the Senate, especially when \nthe stakes were high, than George. I will never forget--and I know \nGeorge won't either--how we stood side by side as stewards of fiscal \naccountability during the tax cut debate in 2003. We were certain that \nreducing taxes and hewing to our budget concerns did not have to be \nmutually exclusive--that we could champion billions in tax cuts without \njeopardizing our Nation's fiscal future by proposing offsets.\n  The fact is, once Senator Voinovich determined to chart a particular \ncourse, he was not easily dissuaded--and rightfully earned a reputation \nfor being tireless and relentless in his pursuits. His moral fiber, \ncharacter, and integrity can be traced back to being the grandson of \nSerbian and Slovenian immigrants who crossed the Atlantic from Croatia \nat the turn of the century. As a proud Greek-American whose parents \nemigrated from Greece, I see in George the same stalwart work ethic so \nprevalent in my own roots and culture growing up in Maine.\n  Senator Voinovich once said that ``doing a good job at running your \ngovernment is the best politics,'' and that ``people just want you to \nget the job done.'' But for him, these weren't platitudes worthy of a \ngovernment class, they have been truly organizing tenets that have \nshaped a distinguished 40-year tenure of serving the common good for \nOhioans and the Nation.\n  In the Senate, when others refused to reach across the aisle, Senator \nVoinovich understood that doing so made the system work, especially for \nthose who elected us in the first place--the American people. When \npolitical scorekeeping and posturing have ruled the day, Senator \nVoinovich has managed to transcend the short-term efforts to jockey for \nposition in favor of immersing himself in the substance of the policy \nwith the intention of championing it or opposing it based on the facts, \nnot political sway or the temper of the times. The legacy of George's \nclear voice of reason and brave vision in this body will extend into \nthe next Congress and for Congresses to come. My only regret is that \nthe Senate could use more George Voinovichs, not fewer.\n  For all of his dedicated public service to his Buckeye State and this \ngreat land, undoubtedly, George will tell you that his greatest \nachievement is his marriage of 39 years to his beloved wife Janet, \ntheir three children, and eight grandchildren. I wish them all the \nbest.\n\n\n                            BLANCHE LINCOLN\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in paying tribute \nto Senator\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\nBlanche Lincoln, one of the finest public servants I have had the \npleasure not only to know, but to work with during our one term in the \nU.S. House together and her distinguished 11-year tenure in the Senate.\n  A seventh-generation Arkansan, Senator Lincoln has always been firmly \nrooted in the values and the people of her great State. Their concerns \nhave been her battles--their hopes have been her cause. Her State's \nbedrock values of family and faith have always been at the center of \nBlanche's life as a daughter, wife, mother, church member, and \nCongresswoman. She has always been as authentic as they come, warm as \nshe is determined, gracious as she is resolute, and Arkansans wouldn't \nhave it any other way.\n  Blanche understood the inherent human element and dimensions of \npublic service as well as anyone--that you pursued elective office not \nfor personal gain, but in order to make a difference on behalf of \nothers, especially for rural America. For Senator Lincoln, the phrase \n``The People Rule'' was more than her great State's cherished motto, it \nwas an organizing principle and a clarion call which inspired her to \nserve.\n  The youngest woman ever elected to the Senate and the first woman to \nserve as chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nCommittee in its 184 years of existence, Senator Lincoln was making her \nmark from the first time she entered the august Chamber of the U.S. \nSenate. From the beginning, she stood upon the mightiest of shoulders, \nArkansas's legendary Hattie Caraway, the first woman to win a statewide \nU.S. Senate race in Arkansas and the first woman to chair a U.S. Senate \ncommittee. How fitting it is that Senator Lincoln paid homage to her \npredecessor by using the same desk on the Senate floor that Senator \nCaraway used 60 years ago.\n  I was privileged to work with Senator Lincoln for her entire time and \nmine as well on the venerable Senate Finance Committee where we were \nkindred spirits and compatriots from day one. In fact, our very first \nyear on the committee we forged an historic, bipartisan alliance to \nmake the childcare tax credit refundable for the first time ever, and \nthe bond we formed during that undertaking only increased as we \nshepherded other dependent care issues through the years to help give \nfamilies the resources to be stronger and find empowerment through \nwork.\n  Senator Lincoln and I, as the former chair and current ranking member \nof the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, also \njoined forces on the Small Business Health Options Program, or the so-\ncalled SHOP Act, to increase the number of insurers available to small \nbusinesses, so that these engines of our economy could benefit from \ngreater competition. On issue after issue, I valued our collaborations, \nour mutual respect, and our common desire to achieve results and \njettison the partisan bickering that impedes not only progress, but our \nobligation to do the will of the American people.\n  Central to that collegiality has been our great tradition as women in \nthe Senate of getting together once a month for dinner, and there is no \nquestion that Senator Lincoln's absence will be keenly felt. \nAppropriately, we described one of our dinners in the prologue to the \nbook we labored on together in the 1990s, entitled ``Nine and \nCounting,'' to demonstrate the progress women had made in the upper \nChamber. In it, Blanche is described as ``ebullient, energetic, and \nunpretentious--she is the picture of representative government.'' That \nis the Blanche Lincoln I know and the Blanche Lincoln I will miss.\n  Like all of the women I have had the honor of serving with on both \nsides of the aisle, Blanche has been a bulwark against the all-too-\nprevalent dynamic confronting the American political system--the \nongoing erosion of bipartisanship, cooperation, and civility. She has \nhelped bridge the partisan divide as much as anyone, and has acted time \nand again as a catalyst for cultivating common ground in order to \nadvance the common good.\n  The Arkansas State flag contains diamond shapes in its center as \nArkansas is the only State where diamonds have been discovered. It has \nbeen the pinnacle of generosity for Arkansans to share one of their \ngems here in our Nation's Capital in the form of Senator Blanche \nLincoln. We also thank her husband Dr. Steve Lincoln and their twin \nboys, Reece and Bennett, for doing the same.\n\n\n                               evan bayh\n\n  Mr. President, today I wish to join in paying a well-deserved tribute \nto my good friend and colleague, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana. When it \ncomes to reflecting on his tremendous experience and influence in this \nesteemed Chamber for the past 12 years, the simple truth is that our \nNation and our government would be exponentially improved by having \nmore like Evan Bayh serving in the United States Senate.\n  A proud native of the Hoosier State--as well as a son of the \nlegendary former Senator Birch Bayh--Senator Evan Bayh is a man of \nunwavering principle and conviction, who has been a stalwart legislator \nand unparalleled guardian of the first branch of government over his \ntwo terms serving the people of Indiana. Born in Shirkieville, educated \nat Indiana University, and a graduate of the University of Virginia Law \nSchool, Senator Bayh went on to clerk for a Federal court judge, \neventually being elected as Indiana's secretary of state in 1986.\n  Yet even before Senator Bayh stepped onto the floor of the United \nStates Senate he had already served two terms as Governor of Indiana, \nbeginning in 1988. In fact, that is where I first got to know him as \nboth he and my husband, John McKernan, were chief executives of their \nrespective States during much of that same period. The depth and \nbreadth of Evan's insight and experience that was forged during his \nyears as Governor would become truly indispensable as a United States \nSenator.\n  Having served side-by-side with Evan for his entire tenure--including \nthis Congress as fellow members of the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence and the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, where I serve as ranking member--I can attest \nfirsthand to his intellect, independence, and integrity that will truly \nleave an indelible mark on this institution and this Nation. Evan has \nalso been a next-door neighbor in my hallway in the Russell Senate \nBuilding. So I will profoundly miss seeing him not only in the Senate, \nbut also simply walking down the hall outside my office.\n  Throughout his storied career, Senator Bayh has reached across the \naisle to find consensus on legislation to advance both Indiana and the \nNation. From focusing on job growth and fighting for America's small \nbusinesses to national security and trade, Evan has been a leader whose \nachievements truly leave an indelible mark.\n  Indeed, I was pleased to work with Senator Bayh on legislation in \n2007 that linked the troop surge in Iraq to meaningful consequences and \ntelegraphed to the Iraqi Government that they had to meet the \nbenchmarks they themselves had set. And just this year, Senator Bayh \nand I worked with a number of our colleagues in the Senate to crack \ndown on unfair currency manipulations in China--ensuring our government \nis equipped with the tools to adequately address inequities and provide \nconsequences for countries that violate our global trade rules by \nholding down the value of their currency.\n  Earlier, in 2001, Senator Bayh and I introduced a bipartisan \nresolution in the Senate, as well as a subsequent amendment on the \nSenate floor, to ensure that decisions on the use of the budget \nsurpluses that were projected at the time--whether for tax cuts or for \nspending--should be linked to the surpluses actually realized. Simply \nput, the idea, based on a proposal first outlined by then-Federal \nReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, was that long-term tax and spending \nplans should include a kind of ``trigger'' mechanism that limits the \nsurplus-reducing impact of those proposals if budget targets weren't \nachieved, such as specific levels of debt reduction.\n  We believed such a trigger would provide a strong incentive for \nCongress to act responsibly in the future allocation of any surpluses, \nwhile also serving as a ``backstop'' should estimates prove too \noptimistic. As I said at the time, we should have been utilizing those \nsurpluses as a window of opportunity to address our most pressing \ndomestic issues, such as strengthening Social\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\nSecurity and Medicare. And frankly, how prescient that trigger \nmechanism proved to be--just imagine where we might be today if it had \npassed nearly 10 years ago.\n  In multiple facets, Senator Bayh has been an esteemed colleague and \nfriend in our mutual cause to revitalize and advance the political \ncenter--in our concerted effort to answer the challenges facing our \nNation by producing results, not rancor, and accord instead of \nacrimony. His departure not only diminishes the Senate, but is also a \nloss for the country--because we require more voices seeking to craft \ncompromise and consensus to forge solutions, not fewer.\n  I have long argued that the legislative stalemate and political \nquagmire that has gripped much of this Congress has been to the \ndetriment of our country--especially at a time when our Nation faces a \nnumber of challenges, not the least of which is a struggling economy \nthat has caused far too many Americans to lose their jobs and their \npaychecks. In February, Senator Bayh wrote an op-ed for the New York \nTimes in which he said, ``The most ideologically devoted elements in \nboth parties must accept that not every compromise is a sign of \nbetrayal or an indication of moral lassitude. When too many of our \ncitizens take an all-or-nothing approach, we should not be surprised \nwhen nothing is the result.'' I could not agree more--and Senator \nBayh's advocacy of moderation and reason in this body will truly be \nmissed.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt once said that ``far and away the best \nprize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth \ndoing.'' Well, if ever there were a Senator who epitomizes that \nsentiment, it is Senator Bayh as he has given his very best to make an \nalready great Nation greater still. I wish Evan, his wife, Susan, and \ntheir two sons, Beau and Nick, all the best for the future.\n\n\n                               judd gregg\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it has been a great pleasure and honor to \nserve in this body with Judd Gregg. He and his wife Kathy have enriched \nour lives with their friendship and their contributions to the work and \nresponsibilities of the U.S. Senate.\n  Judd's leadership on the Budget and Appropriations Committees have \nbeen especially important and worthy of high praise.\n  His sense of humor has helped make our service in the Senate an \nenjoyable experience.\n  I wish for him and his family all the best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                             SAM BROWNBACK\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service of my \nfriend and colleague Sam Brownback. Sam was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1994 during the Republican Revolution and was \nsubsequently elected to the Senate 2 years later when former majority \nleader Bob Dole made his bid for the White House.\n  It has been both a privilege and a pleasure serving alongside Sam \nduring these past 16 years. All of us who seek public service want to \nmake a difference, and most certainly, Sam Brownback has done that. In \nthese endeavors I have enjoyed working with Sam in achieving some note \nworthy accomplishments for our State of Kansas. As I reflect upon our \nmutual efforts, it is hard to figure out who was driving the stage and \nwho was riding shotgun. Simply put, it has been a team effort, and I \nhave been both humbled and proud to work with my colleague who has \nprovided unique and respected leadership. Sam's record speaks for \nitself: bringing the Big Red One back home to Fort Riley, KS, where it \nstarted and now belongs; bringing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense \nFacility, NBAF, to Manhattan, KS; ensuring fair treatment of the \ngeneral aviation industry in FAA bills; and working together to rebuild \nGreensburg, KS, after 95 percent of the community was literally blown \naway by an EF5 tornado.\n  But beyond our work together on State specific issues, it is Sam's \nFederal legislative initiatives that I think will have the longest \nimpact on the Senate and the lives of so many people, pot only within \nKansas and our Nation but, indeed, around the world.\n  Since the late 1970s, the term ``compassionate conservative'' has \nbeen tossed around quite a bit to describe a philosophy--a philosophy \nthat states by applying conservative ideals, our government can best \nimprove the welfare of our society. I think many of my colleagues would \nagree that if anyone in public service over the past 30 years embodies \nthis philosophy, it would be Sam Brownback.\n  What is unique about Sam and his approach to politics these past 16 \nyears is that his ideas went beyond words and rhetoric. The Sam \nBrownback approach was simple but effective. He applied his beliefs to \naction, reflected by the many legislative accomplishments he championed \nduring his tenure in the Senate.\n  Sam is a big believer in forgiveness and second chances. How to put \nthat belief into action? Sam introduced a bill that really shows his \nheart for those in society who many times are not given an opportunity \nto make amends: the Second Chance Act.\n  Signed into law during the Bush administration, this act created a \ngrant program for State and local governments to fund job training and \nfamily mentoring programs to help reintegrate past offenders as they \nare granted release back into society.\n  But Sam's legislative victories did not focus solely on domestic \nissues. Sam has a great love for the continent of Africa.\n  Serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he traveled to \nAfrica on multiple occasions to gain a better understanding of how he \ncould help provide relief to those most vulnerable. His experiences led \nhim to champion the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006. \nEnacted that same year, this law created sanctions against individuals \nand groups responsible for the terrible crime of genocide in Darfur, \nwhile establishing measures to protect civilians and humanitarian \nefforts within the borders of Sudan.\n  The more Sam did, the more he felt called to do, and no one did more \nfor the protection of victims of human trafficking than Sam. In 2000, \nhe helped enact the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. This law \ncreated criminal punishments for individuals caught in the United \nStates operating as traffickers. It established an annual reporting \nmechanism to help track individuals engaged in sex trafficking and \ncreated a new immigration status for victims of sex trafficking.\n\n  Lastly, I believe Sam's prominence during his time in the Senate had \na great deal to do with his willingness to work across party lines on \nissues where he could seek and find common passion and ground.\n  The legislative item I think will leave the largest impact on many of \nus in the Senate is the bill upon which he worked tirelessly with the \nlate Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  Signed into law by President Bush, the Prenatally and Postnatally \nDiagnosed Conditions Act provides those families with children \ndiagnosed with Down Syndrome the support services and networks they \nneed to help them deal with the unique challenges they face. Put \nanother way, what better legislation to help protect the lives of those \nin our Nation uniquely challenged but who deserve every right to the \nsame opportunities we all enjoy everyday.\n  I could easily and proudly recount many more of Sam's achievements \nduring his time in the Senate, but I would do so in danger of Sam \nsaying ``enough'' and giving me ``the hook.'' I have often said that \nthe high road of humility is not often bothered by heavy traffic in \nWashington, but in Sam Brownback, we have indeed enjoyed the friendship \nof a humble man.\n  In closing, I leave my colleagues with one of Senator Brownback's \nfavorite quotes that I think sums up the man that Sam is and the love \nhe has for all people, regardless of their nationality or place in \nsociety.\n  Sam likes to say: `` I am pro-life and whole-life. Applying this \nbelief to the child in the womb and to the child in Darfur. It includes \nthe man in prison and the woman in poverty. It does not fail to cherish \nthe child with Down syndrome or stand for the inherent dignity of the \nimmigrant.''\n  Sam, I remember the first campaign rally we attended together. The \nfeatured guest speaker, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, introduced me as \none who made significant changes in the House of Representatives and \nthen introduced Sam as: ``One who not only wants to change things, but \nto make the right changes.''\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\n  Sam, you have done just that and it has been an honor to serve with \nyou over these past 16 years. I thank you for your courtesy, \ncooperation, leadership, example and your friendship and support. As \nyou head west, my friend, to lead our beloved State of Kansas, I look \nforward to continued cooperation and success. The people of Kansas are \nin good hands. God bless.\n\n\n                             arlen specter\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate in 2007 as a \nSenator-elect, one of the first things I did was to go see Senator \nSpecter. He asked me at the time to go to lunch, and from the moment \nthat I arrived in the Senate, he made it very clear to me, not only did \nthe people of Pennsylvania expect, but he expected as well that we work \ntogether. From the beginning of his service here in the United States \nSenate, way back when he was elected in 1980, all the way up to the \npresent moment, he has been a Senator who has focused on building \nbipartisan relationships and, of course, focusing on Pennsylvania \npriorities.\n  I have been honored to have worked with him on so many Pennsylvania \npriorities, whether it was veterans or workers, whether it was dairy \nfarmers or the economy of Pennsylvania, or whether it was our soldiers, \nor our children, or our families. He has been a champion for our state, \nand he has shown younger Senators the way to work together in the \ninterest of our state and our country. That bipartisanship wasn't just \na sentiment. He is a legislator who sought compromise that led to \nresults in a Senate often divided by partisanship.\n  His record is long, so I will only highlight a few areas.\n  He helped to lead the effort to dramatically increase funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health, that great generator of discoveries that \ncure diseases and create jobs and hope for people often without hope \nbecause of a disease or a malady of one kind or another.\n  His experience working on a farm as a boy, Kansas not in \nPennsylvania, helped him to understand and work on problems affecting \nPennsylvania agriculture and farm families.\n  He stood up for Pennsylvania industry and workers against subsidized \nor dumped products that hurt Pennsylvania's steel industry.\n  He fought to bring Federal funding back to Pennsylvania to create \njobs, build infrastructure and invest in local communities.\n  No Senator in the history of the Commonwealth has served longer than \nSenator Specter. In fact, the Senator that he outdistanced in a sense, \nin terms of service, was only elected by the people twice after several \nterms elected by the state legislature. Senator Specter was elected by \nthe people of Pennsylvania five times, but it is the life in those \nSenate years, the contribution to our Commonwealth and our country in \nthose 30 years that really matter. His impact will be felt for \ngenerations, not just decades, but for generations.\n  There was a history book of our State that came out in the year 2002. \nIt was a series of stories, essays and chapters on the history of \nPennsylvania, and it is a fascinating review of the State's history. \nThe foreword of that publication, that book, was written by Brent D. \nGlass, at the time the executive director of the Pennsylvania \nHistorical Museum Commission. He wrote this in March 2002. It is a long \nforeword which I won't read, but he wrote in the early part of this \nforeword the following, ``One way to understand the meaning of \nPennsylvania's past is to examine certain places around the state that \nare recognized for their significance to the entire nation.'' Then he \nlists and describes in detail significant places in Pennsylvania that \nhave a connection to our history, whether it's the Liberty Bell or the \nbattlefield at Gettysburg, whether it's the farms in our Amish \ncommunities or whether it's some other place of historic significance.\n  I have no doubt whatsoever that if the same history were recounted \nabout the people of Pennsylvania, the people who moved Pennsylvania \nforward, the people who in addition to moving our State forward had an \nimpact on the Nation; if we had to make a list of Pennsylvanians who \nmade such contributions; whether it would be William Penn, Benjamin \nFranklin, you can fill in the blanks from there, I have no doubt that \nthat list would include Senator Arlen Specter, a son of Kansas who made \nPennsylvania his home, a son of Kansas who fought every day for the \npeople of Pennsylvania.\n  So it is the work and the achievements and the passion and the \nresults in those years in the Senate that will put him on a very short \nlist of those who contributed so much to our Commonwealth that we love \nand to our country that we cherish.\n  So for all that and for so many other reasons, I, as a resident of \nPennsylvania and a citizen of the United States, but as a Senator, want \nto express my gratitude to Senator Arlen Specter for his 30 years of \nservice, but especially for what those 30 years meant to the people of \nPennsylvania. Thank you, Senator Specter.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \npay tribute to the 16 Senators who will be departing this body at the \nend of the year.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to serve alongside each \nof these Senators as colleagues and as friends. All served their States \nwith distinction and gave their constituents strong voices in the \nworld's greatest deliberative body. Senators Evan Bayh, Robert Bennett, \nKit Bond, Sam Brownback, Jim Bunning, Roland Burris, Chris Dodd, Byron \nDorgan, Russ Feingold, Carte Goodwin, Judd Gregg, Ted Kaufman, George \nLeMieux, Blanche Lincoln, Arlen Specter, and George Voinovich each left \nan indelible mark on the Senate, and I wish them well as they take on \nnew challenges and opportunities into the future.\n  I would like to speak briefly about a few of the Senators I knew best \nand served with in committees to recognize their contributions and \naccomplishments and share my fond memories of them and the legacies \nthey will leave behind.\n\n\n                              Bob Bennett\n\n  For nearly two decades, Senator Bob Bennett has honorably served the \npeople of Utah.\n  His career in the U.S. Senate has been marked by his commonsense \nsolutions to many of the most pressing issues facing our country.\n  Before serving in the Senate, Bob was a successful entrepreneur as \nthe CEO of Franklin International Institute. Under Bennett's \nleadership, the business grew from 4 employees to more than 1,000 and \nwas listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n  Bob brought his past experiences running a successful company with \nhim to the Senate. His business sense was certainly an asset that \ninformed his decisions as a U.S. Senator and made him an effective \nadvocate for businesses, large and small, who keep our economy strong. \nBeing a former businessowner myself, I valued his pragmatic perspective \nand ability to get things done.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee and a member of \nthe distinguished Joint Economic Committee, Bob has been a leader in \nmany national economic policy decisions.\n  In addition, while serving as the ranking republican on the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water, he has worked to \naddress the critical funding needs our country faces on a wide range of \nenergy and water related issues.\n  I am proud to have served with Bob for so many years, and his \nleadership and kind manner will be sorely missed in the Senate.\n\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n  I wish Senator Jim Bunning well as he departs the Senate. Much of his \nlegacy can be defined by his competitive spirit and strong work ethic. \nThese attributes have been evident throughout his many successes in \nlife, first in his career as a Hall of Fame baseball player and then \nlater as a public servant, representing the people of Kentucky. Being \nan avid sports fan myself, I hold deep admiration for those who can \nplay at the highest levels of competitive sports and later bring that \ndrive to the Senate!\n  Following his highly successful professional baseball career for 17 \nyears, Jim decided he wanted to give back to his community. In 1977, he \nran for city council and then later ran for the Kentucky State Senate \neventually becoming the Republican leader.\n  In 1986, Jim was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for the \n4th\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\nDistrict of Kentucky, where he served for 12 years before being elected \nto the U.S. Senate in 1998.\n  During Jim's tenure in Congress, he has established himself as an \nexpert and defender of social security, fighting hard to protect social \nsecurity for current and future generations.\n  His hard work and devotion will be missed by the people of Kentucky, \nwhom I know are grateful for his many years of service.\n\n\n                                Kit Bond\n\n  Kit Bond has a long and distinguished history of service to the \npeople of Missouri. As one of the longest serving Members in the U.S. \nSenate and a former two-term Governor, his life's work has been \ndedicated to the State of Missouri.\n  In the Senate, Kit has been a respected leader on many issues, such \nas national security, transportation, and global economic \ncompetiveness. While serving as the vice chairman on the Senate Select \nIntelligence Committee, he has worked hard to strengthen national \nsecurity through supporting the U.S. military and reforming the \nNation's intelligence community. And as the leader of the Senate \nNational Guard Caucus, no one has done more to support the role of the \nNational Guard in our defense.\n  Kit and I have worked on many issues together during our time in the \nSenate. In particular, last year when Democratic lawmakers tried to \npush cap-and-trade bills through Congress, Kit and I released the \nreport, ``Climate Change Legislation: A $3.6 Trillion Gas Tax.''\n  Our joint report revealed how climate legislation would result in a \nmassive new national gas tax on American families, farmers, workers and \ntruckers--by increasing the price of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.\n  It has been my pleasure to serve with Senator Bond. His office has \nbeen next to mine for 12 years and it will not be the same without that \nfamiliar cigar aroma lingering in the second floor halls of Russell. \nWithout a doubt, he will be missed by his colleagues in the Senate and \nhis constituents in Missouri.\n\n\n                             Sam Brownback\n\n  While Senator Sam Brownback will certainly be missed by the Senate, \nthe people of Kansas will continue to benefit from his leadership, as \nhe serves as their newly-elected Governor.\n  Prior to being elected to public office, Sam's professional \nexperiences include working as a radio broadcaster, attorney, teacher, \nand administrator.\n  From these varied professional experiences he brought with him a \nunique and dynamic perspective to the U.S. Senate.\n  Through his leadership as the ranking member on the Joint Economic \nCommittee, ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resource \nSubcommittee on Water and Power, Sam established himself as a leader on \na wide range of issues.\n  During his tenure in the Senate, he has supported aviation research \nand expanded global aviation markets. Through these efforts, he has \neffectively spurred economic growth and strengthened the U.S. military.\n  Some of Sam's most distinguishing characteristics are his personal \nintegrity and his commitment to his Catholic faith. These principles \ncame through in much of what he did in the Senate. I will always \nappreciate his passion and his work to translate his beliefs into his \nactions as a U.S. Senator.\n  I am confident Senator Brownback will continue to serve the people of \nKansas with the same character and dedication in his new role as \ngovernor.\n\n\n                              Chris Dodd \n\n  Senator Chris Dodd departs the Senate after nearly three decades \nfaithfully representing the people of Connecticut.\n  From his service in the Peace Corps, the U.S. Army National Guard and \nReserves as well as his many years in the U.S. Senate, Senator Dodd's \ncommitment to public service and love for his country have been evident \nthroughout his life.\n  Chris was a leader in the Senate, serving as the chairman of the \nBanking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and \nNarcotics, and chairman of its Children and Families Subcommittee.\n  Although we had our differences on various policy issues, I always \nappreciated his willingness to put partisanship aside to reach \nconsensus when possible in order to improve legislation. For instance, \nearlier this year when working on the financial reform bill, despite my \npublic opposition to the legislation, Chris worked with me to \nincorporate my amendments in the final version of the bill. I \nultimately voted against the bill, but I am grateful for the efforts he \nmade to include my amendments.\n  Today we bid him farewell after 29 years of tireless service in the \nU.S. Senate.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n  Today we say goodbye to Senator Byron Dorgan after 18 years in the \nSenate, serving the State of North Dakota.\n  First elected to Congress in 1980, Dorgan has devoted his career to \nserving North Dakota and fighting for the interests of rural America.\n  After serving six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, Byron \nwas elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992.\n  I have had the pleasure to serve with Senator Dorgan on the Senate \nCommerce Committee. Last summer, we joined together with several of our \ncolleagues in the Senate to introduce bipartisan legislation that \nreauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA.\n  The legislation accelerated the modernization of the Nation's air \ntraffic control, ATC system, addressed critical safety concerns in the \nnational airspace system, NAS, and improved rural community access to \nair service.\n  I appreciated Byron's willingness to champion good ideas put forward \nby members from either side of the aisle. By focusing on issues where \nconsensus could be achieved, he helped to move the debate forward on \nimportant issues and solve problems.\n  Senator Dorgan leaves the Senate with my best wishes and respect.\n\n\n                               Judd Gregg\n\n  As a leading voice for fiscal responsibility, Senator Judd Gregg will \nbe deeply missed in the Senate.\n  Throughout his long and distinguished career, with unparalleled \ncommitment to fiscal discipline, Senator Gregg worked to address many \npressing issues.\n  Senator Gregg is a well known budget expert and national leader on \nthe most critical issues facing our country in recent years, notably \nhealth care, economic issues, and financial regulation.\n  His efforts to address the looming entitlement crisis, the rising \ncost of health care, and the inefficient and complex tax system are \ncommendable and serve as an example to all elected officials.\n  In the Senate, Senator Gregg has also focused his efforts on helping \nthe U.S. maintain its position as the leading destination for capital \nand investment in the world.\n  I appreciate the job Senator Gregg has done in his position as the \nformer chairman and current ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n  In 2006, Judd sponsored an amendment that strengthened border \nsecurity by providing resources to integrate biometric databases as \nwell as construction of new stations and check points and tactical \ninfrastructure for immigration and customs enforcement.\n  Unlike other similar proposals at the time, his amendment was offset \nand did not add to the deficit.\n  I will miss working with him in this Chamber, and I will miss his \nfriendship and support on the issues that matter most to America.\n  In conclusion, the departing Senators' contributions, their dedicated \nservice, and the issues they championed will be remembered long after \ntheir final days in the Senate.\n  I believe I can speak for my fellow Senators when I say that we will \nall miss our departing friends.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when the 111th Congress draws to a \nclose, we will bid farewell to 16 colleagues who have collectively \ngiven more than 200 years of service to our Nation through their \nservice in the Senate. These include seven of the Senate's most \nexperienced Members. People like Chris Dodd and Arlen Specter who have \neach served five terms in the Senate. Kit Bond who has served\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\nfour terms and Bob Bennett, Byron Dorgan, Russ Feingold, and Judd \nGregg, who have each served three terms in this Chamber.\n  When the 112th Congress convenes in January, the ranks of women \nSenators will be reduced by one. In fact, the 112th Congress will be \nthe first Congress in recent memory in which the total number of women \nSenators will actually decline. And with the departure of our \ncolleague, Roland Burris, there will not be a single African-American \nSenator when the new Congress convenes.\n  In January we will feel the loss of the great pitching ace, Jim \nBunning, and Evan Bayh, both respected colleagues on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. They are among six of my Energy Committee \ncolleagues who are leaving the Senate this year.\n  Judd Gregg, one of our Nation's foremost experts on the Federal \nbudget leaves us at the end of the year. As this Senate comes to grips \nwith the challenges of a rising deficit and economic stagnation we will \nmiss his firm hand and thoughtful guidance. My neighbor in the Hart \nSenate Office Building, Arlen Specter, is one of the Senate's most \nindependent voices and perhaps the best friend that the National \nInstitutes of Health, and every American who benefits from its cutting \nedge research, has ever had on Capitol Hill. Bob Bennett, one of the \nmost thoughtful among us, who draws wisdom from experience as an \nentrepreneur as well as in public service, will not be among us. I \nlearned much from Senator Bennett during the period that he served as \ncounselor to the Republican leader and I served as vice chair of the \nSenate Republican Conference.\n  I would also like to acknowledge contributions of Kit Bond, one of \nthe foremost experts on our Nation's transportation and infrastructure \nneeds. I appreciate Senator Bond's interest in understanding the unique \ntransportation and infrastructure challenges that we in Alaska, the \nlargest State in our Union in terms of land mass and one of the \nyoungest must contend with. Senator Bond, like all of us, wears many \nhats in this institution. He has also earned the undying respect of our \nNation's citizen soldiers through his leadership of the Senate National \nGuard Caucus.\n  One of Chris Dodd's legacies to the Nation is legislation to ensure \nthat the unique needs of children are addressed in our Nation's \nresponse to catastrophic disasters. I was honored to partner with \nSenator Dodd in helping to pass this legislation.\n  Russ Feingold may have earned his place in history for his work on \ncampaign finance reform but I will also appreciate him for his efforts \nto ensure that members of the National Guard and Reserve do not fall \nthrough the cracks when they return home with battlefield injuries. \nSenator Feingold and I teamed on the Wounded Warrior Transition Act, a \nportion of which was included in the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2010. I will continue to pursue the remaining \nprovisions in the new Congress.\n  Sam Brownback has forever earned a place in the heart of our first \nAmericans for his work on the adoption of a joint resolution \napologizing to American Indians and Alaska Natives for centuries of ill \nconceived policies carried out by our Federal Government. He is known \naround the world as a champion of religious freedom as well.\n  George Voinovich came to the Senate after a distinguished career that \nincluded service as Governor of the State of Ohio and mayor of the city \nof Cleveland. He has made a substantial contribution to the efficient \noperation of our federal government as a leader of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee. I appreciate his support \nof the effort that Senator Akaka and I advanced, along with others, to \nmake locality pay available to Federal employees in Alaska and Hawaii \nthrough the Non-Foreign Act of 2009.\n  I would like to say a few words about my friend Byron Dorgan. In \n2007, following the sudden and unexpected death of our friend and \ncolleague Craig Thomas, I was elevated to vice chair of the Senate \nCommittee on Indian Affairs. Senator Dorgan was the chairman of that \ncommittee. Last week both of us had the honor of addressing the \nNational Congress of American Indians at one of the meetings that \npreceded President Obama's tribal summit. Each of us reflected on that \nfact that the committee has highly productive during the period we \nshared the gavel. During our time together the committee laid the \ngroundwork for reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct, more than a decade in the making. We reauthorized the Native \nAmerican Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act, we pursued a \nsettlement of the Cobell litigation, and we crafted and introduced the \nTribal Law and Order Act, which President Obama signed into law earlier \nthis year. Senator Dorgan has consistently championed adequate funding \nfor the Indian Health Service and he has come to the floor on many \noccasions to speak to the unacceptable rates of suicide among Native \nyouth. I am pleased to know that he will continue this work after he \nleaves the Senate. It comes from the heart.\n  As I noted at the outset, 2011 will be the first year in recent \nmemory that the number of women serving in the Senate has actually \ndeclined. All of the women of the Senate will miss our dear friend and \nhighly respected colleague Blanche Lincoln. Blanche Lincoln made \nhistory in her own right when she became the youngest woman ever \nelected to the Senate at the age of 38. Senator Lincoln represented the \npeople of Arkansas with distinction for two terms, juggling a demanding \ncareer in public service while raising two wonderful twin boys Reece \nand Bennett. She is truly a wonderful colleague to work with. A \ncentrist who comfortably works across the aisle and votes her \nconvictions. One of the kindest people in the Senate. I expect great \nthings of Blanche Lincoln  in the future and I have every confidence \nshe will deliver on that prediction.\n  It has been an honor and a pleasure to serve with each of the people \nwho will leave this Chamber when we adjourn sine die. Each has made \nsubstantial contributions to their States, to the Nation and to the \nSenate during their time here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                               Evan Bayh\n\n\tMr. HARKIN. Mr. President, time and time I have come to the floor to give a few remarks about Senators who are retiring and leaving the Senate. They all contributed in their unique way one way or the other to the Senate. Now I find myself with two left about whom I want to comment on their way out of the Senate.\n\tIn the closing days of the 111th Congress, we are saying goodbye to a number of colleagues, including a veteran Member, much respected on both sides of the aisle. I speak of the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh.\n\tI listened with great interest to Senator Bayh's eloquent farewell remarks earlier this month. The Senator was also kind enough to have them typed up and sent to our offices.\n\tLooking back on his 12 years in this body, he spoke about times of national crisis, including after the 9/11 attacks and during the financial meltdown of 2008. He talked of a time when Senators acted not as Democrats and Republicans but as patriots concerned of doing one thing: doing what is right for the American people. He said that these times of bipartisan action were with the Senate at its very best.\n\tFor more than two decades, Senator Bayh has embodied everything that is good about this body: a passion for public service, a sincere desire to reach out across the aisle, a great talent for forging coalitions and bringing people together, and a willingness to work long hours to accomplish important things.\n\tAs we all know, Evan is what we might call a ``son of the Senate.'' He is enormously proud to have been elected to the same seat his father Senator Birch Bayh held for two terms and who remains a great friend of mine after all these years. He has followed in his father's footsteps in fighting for quality public schools, student loans, retirement security, and giving every American access to quality, affordable health care.\n\tIn addition, he has been a leader in strengthening our Armed Forces and national security. I know that Senator Bayh takes special pride in leading the charge to provide our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with much improved mine-resistant armored vehicles.\n\tAs he leaves this body, Senator Bayh is still a young man with many chapters yet to be written in his life and career. For more than a quarter century, he has devoted himself to public service, first as Indiana's secretary of state, then as an enormously successful two-term Governor of Indiana, and, of course, since 1999 as a Senator.\n\tI have always been a big admirer of one of his signature accomplishments as Governor, which was passing legislation creating the 21st Century Scholars Program. It is a wonderful program. Thanks to his initiative, every child in Indiana who is eligible for the free lunch program in public schools, who graduates from high school, and signs a pledge not to experiment with illegal drugs is entitled--get this--is entitled to a full tuition scholarship at the Indiana public university of his or her choice.\n\tOver the years, many thousands of Hoosiers of modest means have been able to attend college thanks to this remarkable law. That is what I call a great--I hope my friend does not mind me saying this--populist, progressive accomplishment. It speaks volumes about Evan Bayh's priorities and values throughout his 24 years in public service.\n\tDuring his two terms in this body, Senator Bayh has always faithfully served the people of Indiana and the people of the United States. I hope and expect he will pursue new avenues of public service after he leaves the Senate because our country sorely needs public servants of his caliber, intelligence, and accomplishments.\n\tI will miss the day-to-day friendships, the counsels, the interchanges we have had together in the Senate. I wish Evan and his wonderful wife Susan and their twin sons, Beau and Nick, the very best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n\tMr. President, I also wish to pay a farewell to another long-time legislative partner, and that is Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.\n\tI listened with great interest to Senator Specter's farewell remarks yesterday. He decried the decline of bipartisan cooperation in this body. As he put it:\n\n       In some quarters, compromising has become a dirty word. \n     Politics is no longer the art of the possible when senators \n     are intransigent in their positions.\n\n\tDuring his remarkable 30 years in the Senate--he is the longest serving U.S. Senator in Pennsylvania's history--Arlen Specter has been admired for his fierce independence and for his willingness to cross party lines in order to accomplish big and important things for this country.\n\tNowhere has this been more vividly on display than in the Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations, on which Senator Specter and I are senior members. Before last year, when he returned to his roots as a Democrat, Arlen was the senior Republican and I was the senior Democrat on that subcommittee. Since 1989, as the majority in the Senate has gone back and forth between the two parties, we alternated as either chair or ranking member. But the transitions were seamless as we passed the gavel back and forth because Arlen and I forged an unshakable partnership.\n\tThat partnership has been grounded in our shared commitment to finding cures for diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease to Alzheimer's and in our determination to maintain the National Institutes of Health as the jewel in the crown of international biomedical research. Our proudest accomplishment was our collaboration in doubling funding for the National Institutes of Health over a 5-year period, between 1998 and 2003. Last year, we again collaborated in securing $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health in the Recovery Act, although I must be honest and give the senior Senator from Pennsylvania the lion's share of credit for that accomplishment.\n\tI say without fear of contradiction that there has been no Member of Congress in the Senate or the House who has championed NIH as passionately and relentlessly and successfully as Senator Arlen Specter. Indeed, at times, in my role when I was chair of the Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee, I have had to remind Arlen that there were other programs besides the NIH in our appropriations bill. In fairness, Senator Specter has also fought passionately to increase funding for public schools and to increase access to higher education, but there is no question that his great passion, his living legacy has been the National Institutes of Health and biomedical research. Today, the prowess and excellence of the National Institutes of Health is truly a living legacy to Senator Specter, and we have countless new medical cures and therapies because of Senator Specter's long and determined advocacy.\n\tMr. President, I will miss my good friend and colleague from Pennsylvania, who has been a tremendous ally for many years. As he departs the Senate, he can take enormous pride in 30 years of truly distinguished service to the people of Pennsylvania and the United States. I wish Arlen and his wonderful wife Joan the very best in the years ahead.\n\tWith that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and wish the occupant of the chair the best of the holiday season and a happy New Year. We will see you when we come back to the next Congress.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Russ Feingold\n\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and friend, Senator Russ Feingold.\n\tI have had the privilege of serving with Senator Feingold since he and I were both elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992. Over the past 18 years, Senator Feingold has been an independent, passionate advocate for his State and his Nation. He was consistently a voice of conscience in the Senate, never afraid to ask the tough questions or to speak out against policies he believed were flawed.\n\tOver the years, Senator Feingold has distinguished himself as a leading expert on foreign and domestic policy who is willing to work across party lines to get the job done, whether it was reforming our Nation's campaign finance laws or working to end the atrocities committed by Ugandan rebels in the Lord's Resistance Army.\n\tI have had the privilege of sitting next to Senator Feingold in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I have been proud to witness how, as the chair of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, he has led the Senate in recognizing and addressing many of Africa's unique issues and challenges. He was one of the first to speak out about the genocide in the Darfur region of Sudan. He has advocated for an end to the illicit mining of conflict minerals that support armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. And he has placed a spotlight on drug trafficking in West Africa, the threat of terrorism in Somalia, and the affects of global diseases such as malaria on African populations.\n\tSenator Feingold is a great reformer, taking the lead on campaign finance reform and on the Army Corps of Engineers.\n\tSenator Feingold has been such an incredible champion for human rights, and I am personally grateful for his work on women's rights, particularly his commitment to combating violence against women and girls worldwide.\n\tHis passion, expertise, and dedication to these issues are unmatched and will be greatly missed.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n\tMr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and friend, Senator Byron Dorgan. \n\tIt has been an honor to serve with Senator Dorgan since he and I were both elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992.\n\tNobody can get to the heart of a matter like Byron Dorgan. He has an unbelievable ability to lay out both challenges and solutions with clarity. He is a populist in the best sense of the word, and our country is better for his service in this Chamber.\n\tSenator Dorgan has always been a champion for the people of North Dakota, for our workers, and for rural Americans. For the last 18 years, he has devoted himself to supporting family farms and promoting economic development across our country.\n\tSenator Dorgan has been a leader in the Senate in fighting to preserve jobs here in America and end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas. No one has fought harder for the middle class.\n\tHe used his position as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee to advance important projects and create jobs, and I will always be thankful for his support in our efforts to protect California communities from flooding.\n\tAs chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Dorgan has worked tirelessly to improve health care and economic opportunities for Indians. He has helped streamline the bureaucracy of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He developed the landmark Tribal Law and Order Act, which helped give tribal justice officials the tools they need to protect their communities. I was so proud to cosponsor that bill and so pleased that President Obama signed it into law this year.\n\tHe leaves a distinguished legacy and will be greatly missed by all of us.\n\n\n                             Arlen Specter\n\n\tMr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, Senator Arlen Specter.\n\tSenator Specter has spent five terms serving the people of Pennsylvania here in Congress--longer than any other Pennsylvania Senator. All of us can take a lesson from his dedication and passion for fighting for the people of his State.\n\tA member of the Judiciary Committee since he joined Congress, Senator Specter built on his background as an attorney and eventually assumed the chairmanship of the committee. His expertise on constitutional issues has long been admired by his colleagues.\n\tSenator Specter was always a leader on issues relating to our National Institutes of Health, championing investment in scientific research to find lifesaving treatments and cures for a range of diseases. He understood firsthand how crucial such funding could be, having fought his own battle with cancer. When we passed the Recovery Act, it was Senator Specter who ensured that it would include significant investments in NIH. His efforts to help double NIH's budget have contributed to advances in treatments for Parkinson's, cancer, heart disease and Alzheimer's.\n\tI am pleased to have had the opportunity to work closely with Senator Specter on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He has been a thoughtful and constructive member committed to addressing climate change and fighting for clean energy jobs.\n\tSenator Specter loves this institution, and he will be missed. He has left his mark, and I thank him for his decades of dedicated public service.\n\n\n                               Chris Dodd\n\n\tMr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me today in recognize the extraordinary leadership and service of our friend, Senator Chris Dodd.\n\tSenator Dodd has served the Senate with grace, intelligence, and compassion for three decades. The son of a U.S. Senator, he loves this institution and has done everything he could to preserve its best traditions. Senator Dodd has always encouraged all of us to keep our disputes and differences from becoming personal.\n\tHe leaves behind an incredible legacy of accomplishments that have touched the lives of virtually all Americans.\n\tI will never forget the leadership role he played in helping to pass health care reform last spring--a fitting tribute to his close friend Ted Kennedy, whose vision finally became a reality.\n\tAs chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Senator Dodd led the effort to pass Wall Street reform legislation. He was a forceful advocate for holding banks accountable for their actions, and we could not have enacted this landmark accomplishment without his leadership.\n\tSenator Dodd has devoted his career in public service to making life better for our families and our children. I saw this firsthand as we worked together to ensure that our children have safe places to go after school. As chairman of the Senate Afterschool Caucus and the founder of the Senate's first Children's Caucus, Senator Dodd worked hard to expand the Head Start program, to reform the No Child Left Behind Act, and to make college more affordable for students and their families.\n\tIn the face of Presidential vetoes, Senator Dodd dedicated 8 years to enacting the Family and Medical Leave Act, which has helped ensure that 50 million Americans can care for their loved ones during difficult times without fearing for their jobs.\n\tSenator Dodd is a fluent Spanish speaker and has been the Senate's leading expert on Latin America. I have been proud to work closely with him to reform our Nation's drug certification laws.\n\tHis own years of service in the U.S. Peace Corps inspired Senator Dodd to support and promote President Kennedy's call to service in this Chamber. In the Senate, he has helped expand and modernize the Peace Corps and worked to provide loan forgiveness to Peace Corps volunteers, teachers, and others who devote themselves to public service.\n\tAll of us in the Senate will greatly miss Senator Dodd.\n\n\n                            Blanche Lincoln\n\n\tMr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and friend, Senator Blanche Lincoln.\n\tSenator Lincoln has spent her entire career serving the people of Arkansas, and she has been a passionate and effective leader for her State.\n\tShe has been an inspiration to so many women. Senator Lincoln made history as the first woman to chair the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, and I will never forget how Senator Lincoln led by example, showing us you could be a young mom in the Senate, dedicated to your children, while also being a strong advocate for your State.\n\tShe has been a leader in the Senate on child nutrition and has worked tirelessly to pass important legislation, including the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act that was just signed into law by President Obama. The measure will help combat the nationwide epidemic of obesity by making sure our schoolchildren have access to healthy, nutritious meals.\n\tAs a cofounder of the Senate Hunger Caucus, Senator Lincoln has played a crucial role in shedding light on a problem that affects so many, both at home and abroad.\n\tSenator Lincoln was never afraid to stand up for what she believed in. She showed her tenacity in fighting for greater transparency and accountability in derivatives markets during the debate over Wall Street reform.\n\tShe has been a fighter for her State and her legislative accomplishments will have a profound impact on the lives of so many children and communities across our country.\n\tI want to thank her for her years of friendship and for her dedicated service here in the Senate. We will all miss her.\n\n\n                            christopher dodd\n\n\tMs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in paying tribute to Senator Christopher Dodd, a longtime public servant and fellow New Englander whose dedication to advancing the common good with common sense, independence, and a genuine desire to solve problems has served both his constituents of Connecticut as well as his country for 36 years. With trust, comity, and a love for the institution of the Senate, Senator Dodd has for more than three decades contributed to creating a legislative environment where at crucial moments in the life of the greatest deliberative body in human history, the upper Chamber was able to work its will to the lasting benefit of the American people, and we could not be more grateful.\n\tIndisputably, and as countless colleagues have noted, public service has always been at the center of Senator Dodd's life--literally, as he is the first son of Connecticut to follow his father into the U.S. Senate, and remarkably, for the past 30 years, Senator Dodd has had the privilege of sitting at the same desk used by his father, Senator Thomas Dodd, during his 12 years in the Senate. Chris Dodd's longstanding devotion to the public arena has spanned from his three terms in the U.S. House--the last of which I was privileged to serve with him--to his five terms in the U.S. Senate. And Senator Dodd earned the lasting gratitude of his constituents and admiration of his colleagues with his stalwart leadership in foreign policy, his vigorous and unwavering battle to enact the Family and Medical Leave Act, and his longstanding stewardship of our Nation's most precious resource--our children.\n\tAnd on this last point, like many in this Chamber, I cannot begin to justly measure the depth and breadth of the legacy Senator Dodd has forged in safeguarding the most vulnerable in our society. Consider for example the issue of child care. Time and again, Senator Dodd has battled to ensure both the quality of child care in America as well as the funding for it, and as he keenly and presciently understood, in this matter, our Nation could not have one without the other.\n\tAn undeniable focus of Senator Dodd's, child care has unquestionably become one of his crowning achievements and legislative hallmarks--and nowhere was his imprint on the issue greater than during the landmark welfare reform debate in 1995 and 1996. I well recall working with Senator Dodd as we made the case that there was indeed a pivotal link between viable welfare reform and child care--that for families struggling to reduce their dependency on welfare--especially single parents--unaffordable, unavailable, or unreliable childcare was the chief barrier to steady employment, and one that could and should be lessened, if not eliminated.\n\tThat is why I was pleased to join with Senator Dodd on our amendment to add $6 billion in child care funding to welfare reform legislation, especially at a time when that funding was very much imperiled. Arriving at a consensus required leaders from both parties to jettison their competing and hardened ideologies in favor not just of making dependable childcare more accessible, but in support of welfare reform that would effectively move more Americans from welfare to work. Senator Dodd, as colleague after colleague can attest, heeded his own beliefs that ``you don't begin the debate with bipartisanship--you arrive there. And you can do so only when determined partisans create consensus.'' Because he never lost sight of the primacy of working across the aisle, we were victorious in including the funding we sought in the Senate-passed bill.\n\tThat bipartisan effort to garner concrete results designed to make a difference in the daily lives of the American people was not an isolated instance. Senator Dodd and I collaborated on legislation to support campus-based child care for low income mothers trying to further their education, and we authored legislation to help states improve training in early childhood development to make improved child care more available to more people. With innate New England pragmatism and a desire for solutions, Senator Dodd saw impediments to success that were impinging upon a segment of our society that if only reduced or removed would aid not only families striving to improve their lives, but a Nation seeking to help stem the tide of dependency.\n\tUltimately, what occupied Senator Dodd's agenda was the active pursuit of an even better America. We didn't always agree on what that path should be, but where we did find common ground, as in child care, we cultivated it. That dynamic was at work recently as Senator Dodd and I, as the former chair and current ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, collaborated to help the economic engines and catalysts of our economy--America's small businesses, the very enterprises that will lead us out of recession and into recovery.\n\tDuring the consideration of what would become The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, I truly appreciated Senator Dodd's perseverance in including a provision I authored allowing small businesses to raise concerns over burdensome regulations through small business review panels within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Senator Dodd and I also worked to reduce the regulatory compliance burden for small banks by striking a provision of the bill which would have required these lending institutions to report their transactions to the Federal Government down to each individual ATM.\n\n\tThis kind of rapport was emblematic of how Senator Dodd viewed good governance. In his valedictory address on the floor of the Senate, he observed that ``in my three decades here, I cannot recall a single Senate colleague with whom I could not work.'' Indeed, Senator Dodd always saw adversaries as potential allies--and foes as unwon friends.\n\tFrom the days of his youth, Senator Dodd grew up steeped in the tradition of and respect for the Senate--and an abiding admiration for this venerable institution that runs at its own pace and by its own rules. Instead of exhibiting rancor and a burning desire to win at all costs, Senator Dodd sought instead to build relationships and by doing so, strengthened his capacity for legislating and contributed mightily to the advancement of this esteemed Chamber. Legendary American poet and son of Maine, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, once wrote that ``if you would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it.'' Chris Dodd has always aimed high--and met his target--leaving a legacy of enormous accomplishment to his constituents in Connecticut and to the American people.\n\tIn closing, let me just extend my personal appreciation to his wife Jackie and their daughters Grace and Christina for sharing Christopher Dodd with us\n\n\n                               judd gregg\n\n\tMr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in paying a well-earned tribute to Senator Judd Gregg, a fellow New Englander and one of New Hampshire's much-admired icons of public service over the last three decades.\n\tSenator Gregg has been immersed in public service his entire life, beginning with his father's election as Governor of New Hampshire in 1952 when Judd was only 5 years old. And through the years, he has amassed a record of leadership at every level of government that is truly remarkable. It comes as no surprise that Judd is the first public servant from the Granite State ever to realize the political trifecta of being elected to the three offices of Congressman, Governor, and Senator. Serving others goes to the very core of Judd Gregg's persona and DNA. It always has and always will.\n\tAnd let me just say, at every step along the way, it has been a privilege for me to witness Senator Gregg's impressive trajectory in public life firsthand. In fact, it was during Judd's years in the U.S. House of Representatives, where my husband, Jock McKernan, and I first got to know him as well as his wonderful wife Kathy. And that friendship grew further during Judd's time as Governor as both he and Jock were chief executives of their respective States during the same period.\n\tAnd having served with Judd for nearly his entire tenure in the Senate, I have been proud to work side by side with an individual whose organizing principle behind public service has always been driven by common sense, pragmatism, and the imperative to forge solutions across the aisle. Time and again, Judd has sought to bridge the political divide to garner results, whether by tackling our Nation's fiscal challenges, promoting land conservation, or most notably, co-authoring the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 with the late Senator Edward Kennedy.\n\tIndeed, Senator Gregg's rigorous intellect, financial acumen, and budgetary expertise have earned him the respect and admiration of his Senate colleagues from both parties and made him one of the Nation's most well-regarded, leading champions of fiscal discipline and accountability, and one of the most knowledgeable voices and authorities in addressing our Nation's deficits and debt.\n\tIn fact, the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, created by President Obama, is modeled after legislation first introduced by Senator Gregg, the former chair and current ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, and the current Chair, Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota--both of whom are commissioners. What a fitting coda for one of this generation's stalwart guardians of our Nation's budget.\n\tAnd Senator Gregg's service could not be more emblematic of his overall approach to public service which has always hewed to principle with a genuine desire to forge solutions across the aisle. No wonder that earlier this month, Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus wrote that in ``both parties, there are too few Greggs, and too many of them . . . are leaving public office.'' I couldn't agree more!\n\tJust as Senator Gregg has rightly earned national acclaim as a fiscal steward and sentinel on behalf of the American taxpayer, the heart of his leadership has always remained with his beloved Granite State as well as our region of New England. I well recall the ironclad solidarity our two delegations have shared, particularly in defending against efforts to close the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Through each of the five Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, rounds from 1988 through 2005, we have left no stone unturned to champion the cause of the U.S. Navy's oldest and best shipyard--and to ensure that the BRAC Commission recognized the legendary work-ethic and world-class craftsmanship of a workforce that is second to none.\n\tFormer Senate majority and minority leader, Senator Robert Dole, with whom Senator Gregg and I both served, once observed ``as long as there are only 3 to 4 people on the floor, the country is in good hands. It's only when you have 50 to 60 in the Senate that you want to be concerned.'' When Judd Gregg was on the floor the people of New Hampshire and, indeed, the Nation knew that our country was in tremendously capable and conscientious hands, and we could not be more grateful!\n\tIn thanking Senator Gregg for his immeasurable contributions to this storied chamber, I know I join all of my colleagues in wishing him and his beloved wife Kathy, Godspeed, as they embark on the well-earned, next chapter of their lives.\n\n\n                            GEORGE VOINOVICH\n\n\tMr. President, I rise today to join in paying tribute to my longtime good friend and colleague, Senator George Voinovich of Ohio. In the U.S. Constitution, our Founding Fathers made it clear that there is no one clear path, background, or station in life that leads to serving in the U.S. Senate. There is an age requirement and a residency stipulation and no more. That said, if ever there were a job description for being a Senator, it occurs to me that a model example we should consider is that of Senator George Voinovich.\n\tSenator Voinovich's depth and breadth of wisdom, knowledge, and experience about making government work at all levels which he has harnessed throughout his sterling, four decade trajectory in public life recall what James Madison wrote in The Federalist, No. 62 in advocating for a higher age requirement for Senators than members of the House. Madison postulated that the deliberative disposition of the Senate required a ``greater extent of information and stability of character.'' I don't think it's too far of a stretch to say that James Madison must have had a Senator like George Voinovich in mind when making this case.\n\tBefore Senator Voinovich even stepped onto the floor of the U.S. Senate he had already been Governor of Ohio, mayor of Cleveland, Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, county commissioner, auditor, and a member of the Ohio House of Representatives. With a wealth of insights to draw upon through many years of public service, George has always been a force with whom to be reckoned, someone whose viewpoint and counsel are sought, and whose example is worthy of being emulated many, many times over.\n\tMy husband Jock, former Governor of Maine, and I first got to know Senator Voinovich and his wonderful wife of nearly 50 years, Janet, in the 1990s when Jock and George were both serving as Governor of their respective States and active in the National Governors Association. In Ohio's State capital of Columbus, George was building on his enormous success as Mayor of Cleveland where he inherited a stagnant economy, rejuvenated it through fiscal discipline and acumen and public-private partnerships, and forged a three-time All-America City winner in the 1980s.\n\tGeorge made similar, remarkable strides as Governor, where, under his watch, unemployment hit a 25-year low and 600,000 new jobs were created. Many accolades were bestowed upon George for his accomplishments at the State level, and they were all well- earned to say the least. In fact, he is still the only individual to serve as both chairman of the National Governors Association and president of the National League of Cities.\n\tThere are many laudatory characterizations of Senator Voinovich that have already been expressed by my colleagues, and there are certainly some that come to mind, especially as a highly regarded U.S. Senator--thoughtful, independent, principled, rigorous, courageous, and pragmatic. With George, you always knew where he stood on an issue and frankly where you stood with him. In an institution whose very foundation is built upon trust and forging relationships, George was someone you could count on time and time again.\n\tAnd to say that Senator Voinovich was a workhorse in this Chamber from day one is an understatement to be sure. His word is as good as gold--and as they say, you can take it to the bank. If he shook your hand on a deal, that was all that was required. The fact is, they don't make enough legislators or public servants like Senator Voinovich anymore. Like the Ohio State flag, the only one in the U.S. not shaped like a rectangle, George has been and will always be . . . one of a kind.\n\tI can tell this Chamber from firsthand experience, there was no one you would rather be in the trenches with in the Senate, especially when the stakes were high, than George. I will never forget--and I know George won't either--how we stood side by side as stewards of fiscal accountability during the tax cut debate in 2003. We were certain that reducing taxes and hewing to our budget concerns did not have to be mutually exclusive--that we could champion billions in tax cuts without jeopardizing our Nation's fiscal future by proposing offsets.\n\tThe fact is, once Senator Voinovich determined to chart a particular course, he was not easily dissuaded--and rightfully earned a reputation for being tireless and relentless in his pursuits. His moral fiber, character, and integrity can be traced back to being the grandson of Serbian and Slovenian immigrants who crossed the Atlantic from Croatia at the turn of the century. As a proud Greek-American whose parents emigrated from Greece, I see in George the same stalwart work ethic so prevalent in my own roots and culture growing up in Maine.\n\tSenator Voinovich once said that ``doing a good job at running your government is the best politics,'' and that ``people just want you to get the job done.'' But for him, these weren't platitudes worthy of a government class, they have been truly organizing tenets that have shaped a distinguished 40-year tenure of serving the common good for Ohioans and the Nation.\n\tIn the Senate, when others refused to reach across the aisle, Senator Voinovich understood that doing so made the system work, especially for those who elected us in the first place--the American people. When political scorekeeping and posturing have ruled the day, Senator Voinovich has managed to transcend the short-term efforts to jockey for position in favor of immersing himself in the substance of the policy with the intention of championing it or opposing it based on the facts, not political sway or the temper of the times. The legacy of George's clear voice of reason and brave vision in this body will extend into the next Congress and for Congresses to come. My only regret is that the Senate could use more George Voinovichs, not fewer.\n\tFor all of his dedicated public service to his Buckeye State and this great land, undoubtedly, George will tell you that his greatest achievement is his marriage of 39 years to his beloved wife Janet, their three children, and eight grandchildren. I wish them all the best.\n\n\n                            BLANCHE LINCOLN\n\n\tMr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in paying tribute to Senator Blanche Lincoln, one of the finest public servants I have had the pleasure not only to know, but to work with during our one term in the U.S. House together and her distinguished 11-year tenure in the Senate.\n\tA seventh-generation Arkansan, Senator Lincoln has always been firmly rooted in the values and the people of her great State. Their concerns have been her battles--their hopes have been her cause. Her State's bedrock values of family and faith have always been at the center of Blanche's life as a daughter, wife, mother, church member, and Congresswoman. She has always been as authentic as they come, warm as she is determined, gracious as she is resolute, and Arkansans wouldn't have it any other way.\n\tBlanche understood the inherent human element and dimensions of public service as well as anyone--that you pursued elective office not for personal gain, but in order to make a difference on behalf of others, especially for rural America. For Senator Lincoln, the phrase ``The People Rule'' was more than her great State's cherished motto, it was an organizing principle and a clarion call which inspired her to serve.\n\tThe youngest woman ever elected to the Senate and the first woman to serve as chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee in its 184 years of existence, Senator Lincoln was making her mark from the first time she entered the august Chamber of the U.S. Senate. From the beginning, she stood upon the mightiest of shoulders, Arkansas's legendary Hattie Caraway, the first woman to win a statewide U.S. Senate race in Arkansas and the first woman to chair a U.S. Senate committee. How fitting it is that Senator Lincoln paid homage to her predecessor by using the same desk on the Senate floor that Senator Caraway used 60 years ago.\n\tI was privileged to work with Senator Lincoln for her entire time and mine as well on the venerable Senate Finance Committee where we were kindred spirits and compatriots from day one. In fact, our very first year on the committee we forged an historic, bipartisan alliance to make the childcare tax credit refundable for the first time ever, and the bond we formed during that undertaking only increased as we shepherded other dependent care issues through the years to help give families the resources to be stronger and find empowerment through work.\n\tSenator Lincoln and I, as the former chair and current ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, also joined forces on the Small Business Health Options Program, or the so-called SHOP Act, to increase the number of insurers available to small businesses, so that these engines of our economy could benefit from greater competition. On issue after issue, I valued our collaborations, our mutual respect, and our common desire to achieve results and jettison the partisan bickering that impedes not only progress, but our obligation to do the will of the American people.\n\tCentral to that collegiality has been our great tradition as women in the Senate of getting together once a month for dinner, and there is no question that Senator Lincoln's absence will be keenly felt. Appropriately, we described one of our dinners in the prologue to the book we labored on together in the 1990s, entitled ``Nine and Counting,'' to demonstrate the progress women had made in the upper Chamber. In it, Blanche is described as ``ebullient, energetic, and unpretentious--she is the picture of representative government.'' That is the Blanche Lincoln I know and the Blanche Lincoln I will miss.\n\tLike all of the women I have had the honor of serving with on both sides of the aisle, Blanche has been a bulwark against the all-too-prevalent dynamic confronting the American political system--the ongoing erosion of bipartisanship, cooperation, and civility. She has helped bridge the partisan divide as much as anyone, and has acted time and again as a catalyst for cultivating common ground in order to advance the common good.\n\tThe Arkansas State flag contains diamond shapes in its center as Arkansas is the only State where diamonds have been discovered. It has been the pinnacle of generosity for Arkansans to share one of their gems here in our Nation's Capital in the form of Senator Blanche Lincoln. We also thank her husband Dr. Steve Lincoln and their twin boys, Reece and Bennett, for doing the same.\n\n\n                               evan bayh\n\n\tMr. President, today I wish to join in paying a well-deserved tribute to my good friend and colleague, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana. When it comes to reflecting on his tremendous experience and influence in this esteemed Chamber for the past 12 years, the simple truth is that our Nation and our government would be exponentially improved by having more like Evan Bayh serving in the United States Senate.\n\tA proud native of the Hoosier State--as well as a son of the legendary former Senator Birch Bayh--Senator Evan Bayh is a man of unwavering principle and conviction, who has been a stalwart legislator and unparalleled guardian of the first branch of government over his two terms serving the people of Indiana. Born in Shirkieville, educated at Indiana University, and a graduate of the University of Virginia Law School, Senator Bayh went on to clerk for a Federal court judge, eventually being elected as Indiana's secretary of state in 1986.\n\tYet even before Senator Bayh stepped onto the floor of the United States Senate he had already served two terms as Governor of Indiana, beginning in 1988. In fact, that is where I first got to know him as both he and my husband, John McKernan, were chief executives of their respective States during much of that same period. The depth and breadth of Evan's insight and experience that was forged during his years as Governor would become truly indispensable as a United States Senator.\n\tHaving served side-by-side with Evan for his entire tenure--including this Congress as fellow members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, where I serve as ranking member--I can attest firsthand to his intellect, independence, and integrity that will truly leave an indelible mark on this institution and this Nation. Evan has also been a next-door neighbor in my hallway in the Russell Senate Building. So I will profoundly miss seeing him not only in the Senate, but also simply walking down the hall outside my office.\n\tThroughout his storied career, Senator Bayh has reached across the aisle to find consensus on legislation to advance both Indiana and the Nation. From focusing on job growth and fighting for America's small businesses to national security and trade, Evan has been a leader whose achievements truly leave an indelible mark.\n\tIndeed, I was pleased to work with Senator Bayh on legislation in 2007 that linked the troop surge in Iraq to meaningful consequences and telegraphed to the Iraqi Government that they had to meet the benchmarks they themselves had set. And just this year, Senator Bayh and I worked with a number of our colleagues in the Senate to crack down on unfair currency manipulations in China--ensuring our government is equipped with the tools to adequately address inequities and provide consequences for countries that violate our global trade rules by holding down the value of their currency.\n\tEarlier, in 2001, Senator Bayh and I introduced a bipartisan resolution in the Senate, as well as a subsequent amendment on the Senate floor, to ensure that decisions on the use of the budget surpluses that were projected at the time--whether for tax cuts or for spending--should be linked to the surpluses actually realized. Simply put, the idea, based on a proposal first outlined by then-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, was that long-term tax and spending plans should include a kind of ``trigger'' mechanism that limits the surplus-reducing impact of those proposals if budget targets weren't achieved, such as specific levels of debt reduction.\n\tWe believed such a trigger would provide a strong incentive for Congress to act responsibly in the future allocation of any surpluses, while also serving as a ``backstop'' should estimates prove too optimistic. As I said at the time, we should have been utilizing those surpluses as a window of opportunity to address our most pressing domestic issues, such as strengthening Social Security and Medicare. And frankly, how prescient that trigger mechanism proved to be--just imagine where we might be today if it had passed nearly 10 years ago.\n\tIn multiple facets, Senator Bayh has been an esteemed colleague and friend in our mutual cause to revitalize and advance the political center--in our concerted effort to answer the challenges facing our Nation by producing results, not rancor, and accord instead of acrimony. His departure not only diminishes the Senate, but is also a loss for the country--because we require more voices seeking to craft compromise and consensus to forge solutions, not fewer.\n\tI have long argued that the legislative stalemate and political quagmire that has gripped much of this Congress has been to the detriment of our country--especially at a time when our Nation faces a number of challenges, not the least of which is a struggling economy that has caused far too many Americans to lose their jobs and their paychecks. In February, Senator Bayh wrote an op-ed for the New York Times in which he said, ``The most ideologically devoted elements in both parties must accept that not every compromise is a sign of betrayal or an indication of moral lassitude. When too many of our citizens take an all-or-nothing approach, we should not be surprised when nothing is the result.'' I could not agree more--and Senator Bayh's advocacy of moderation and reason in this body will truly be missed.\n\tPresident Theodore Roosevelt once said that ``far and away the best prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.'' Well, if ever there were a Senator who epitomizes that sentiment, it is Senator Bayh as he has given his very best to make an already great Nation greater still. I wish Evan, his wife, Susan, and their two sons, Beau and Nick, all the best for the future.\n\n\n                               judd gregg\n\n\tMr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it has been a great pleasure and honor to serve in this body with Judd Gregg. He and his wife Kathy have enriched our lives with their friendship and their contributions to the work and responsibilities of the U.S. Senate.\n\tJudd's leadership on the Budget and Appropriations Committees have been especially important and worthy of high praise.\n\tHis sense of humor has helped make our service in the Senate an enjoyable experience.\n\tI wish for him and his family all the best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                             SAM BROWNBACK\n\n\tMr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service of my friend and colleague Sam Brownback. Sam was elected to the House of Representatives in 1994 during the Republican Revolution and was subsequently elected to the Senate 2 years later when former majority leader Bob Dole made his bid for the White House.\n\tIt has been both a privilege and a pleasure serving alongside Sam during these past 16 years. All of us who seek public service want to make a difference, and most certainly, Sam Brownback has done that. In these endeavors I have enjoyed working with Sam in achieving some note worthy accomplishments for our State of Kansas. As I reflect upon our mutual efforts, it is hard to figure out who was driving the stage and who was riding shotgun. Simply put, it has been a team effort, and I have been both humbled and proud to work with my colleague who has provided unique and respected leadership. Sam's record speaks for itself: bringing the Big Red One back home to Fort Riley, KS, where it started and now belongs; bringing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility, NBAF, to Manhattan, KS; ensuring fair treatment of the general aviation industry in FAA bills; and working together to rebuild Greensburg, KS, after 95 percent of the community was literally blown away by an EF5 tornado.\n\tBut beyond our work together on State specific issues, it is Sam's Federal legislative initiatives that I think will have the longest impact on the Senate and the lives of so many people, pot only within Kansas and our Nation but, indeed, around the world.\n\tSince the late 1970s, the term ``compassionate conservative'' has been tossed around quite a bit to describe a philosophy--a philosophy that states by applying conservative ideals, our government can best improve the welfare of our society. I think many of my colleagues would agree that if anyone in public service over the past 30 years embodies this philosophy, it would be Sam Brownback.\n\tWhat is unique about Sam and his approach to politics these past 16 years is that his ideas went beyond words and rhetoric. The Sam Brownback approach was simple but effective. He applied his beliefs to action, reflected by the many legislative accomplishments he championed during his tenure in the Senate.\n\tSam is a big believer in forgiveness and second chances. How to put that belief into action? Sam introduced a bill that really shows his heart for those in society who many times are not given an opportunity to make amends: the Second Chance Act.\n\tSigned into law during the Bush administration, this act created a grant program for State and local governments to fund job training and family mentoring programs to help reintegrate past offenders as they are granted release back into society.\n\tBut Sam's legislative victories did not focus solely on domestic issues. Sam has a great love for the continent of Africa.\n\tServing on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he traveled to Africa on multiple occasions to gain a better understanding of how he could help provide relief to those most vulnerable. His experiences led him to champion the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006. Enacted that same year, this law created sanctions against individuals and groups responsible for the terrible crime of genocide in Darfur, while establishing measures to protect civilians and humanitarian efforts within the borders of Sudan.\n\tThe more Sam did, the more he felt called to do, and no one did more for the protection of victims of human trafficking than Sam. In 2000, he helped enact the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. This law created criminal punishments for individuals caught in the United States operating as traffickers. It established an annual reporting mechanism to help track individuals engaged in sex trafficking and created a new immigration status for victims of sex trafficking.\n\n\tLastly, I believe Sam's prominence during his time in the Senate had a great deal to do with his willingness to work across party lines on issues where he could seek and find common passion and ground.\n\tThe legislative item I think will leave the largest impact on many of us in the Senate is the bill upon which he worked tirelessly with the late Senator Ted Kennedy.\n\tSigned into law by President Bush, the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions Act provides those families with children diagnosed with Down Syndrome the support services and networks they need to help them deal with the unique challenges they face. Put another way, what better legislation to help protect the lives of those in our Nation uniquely challenged but who deserve every right to the same opportunities we all enjoy everyday.\n\tI could easily and proudly recount many more of Sam's achievements during his time in the Senate, but I would do so in danger of Sam saying ``enough'' and giving me ``the hook.'' I have often said that the high road of humility is not often bothered by heavy traffic in Washington, but in Sam Brownback, we have indeed enjoyed the friendship of a humble man.\n\tIn closing, I leave my colleagues with one of Senator Brownback's favorite quotes that I think sums up the man that Sam is and the love he has for all people, regardless of their nationality or place in society.\n\tSam likes to say: `` I am pro-life and whole-life. Applying this belief to the child in the womb and to the child in Darfur. It includes the man in prison and the woman in poverty. It does not fail to cherish the child with Down syndrome or stand for the inherent dignity of the immigrant.''\n\tSam, I remember the first campaign rally we attended together. The featured guest speaker, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, introduced me as one who made significant changes in the House of Representatives and then introduced Sam as: ``One who not only wants to change things, but to make the right changes.'' \n\tSam, you have done just that and it has been an honor to serve with you over these past 16 years. I thank you for your courtesy, cooperation, leadership, example and your friendship and support. As you head west, my friend, to lead our beloved State of Kansas, I look forward to continued cooperation and success. The people of Kansas are in good hands. God bless.\n\n\n                             arlen specter\n\n\tMr. CASEY. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate in 2007 as a Senator-elect, one of the first things I did was to go see Senator Specter. He asked me at the time to go to lunch, and from the moment that I arrived in the Senate, he made it very clear to me, not only did the people of Pennsylvania expect, but he expected as well that we work together. From the beginning of his service here in the United States Senate, way back when he was elected in 1980, all the way up to the present moment, he has been a Senator who has focused on building bipartisan relationships and, of course, focusing on Pennsylvania priorities.\n\tI have been honored to have worked with him on so many Pennsylvania priorities, whether it was veterans or workers, whether it was dairy farmers or the economy of Pennsylvania, or whether it was our soldiers, or our children, or our families. He has been a champion for our state, and he has shown younger Senators the way to work together in the interest of our state and our country. That bipartisanship wasn't just a sentiment. He is a legislator who sought compromise that led to results in a Senate often divided by partisanship.\n\tHis record is long, so I will only highlight a few areas.\n\tHe helped to lead the effort to dramatically increase funding for the National Institutes of Health, that great generator of discoveries that cure diseases and create jobs and hope for people often without hope because of a disease or a malady of one kind or another.\n\tHis experience working on a farm as a boy, Kansas not in Pennsylvania, helped him to understand and work on problems affecting Pennsylvania agriculture and farm families.\n\tHe stood up for Pennsylvania industry and workers against subsidized or dumped products that hurt Pennsylvania's steel industry.\n\tHe fought to bring Federal funding back to Pennsylvania to create jobs, build infrastructure and invest in local communities.\n\tNo Senator in the history of the Commonwealth has served longer than Senator Specter. In fact, the Senator that he outdistanced in a sense, in terms of service, was only elected by the people twice after several terms elected by the state legislature. Senator Specter was elected by the people of Pennsylvania five times, but it is the life in those Senate years, the contribution to our Commonwealth and our country in those 30 years that really matter. His impact will be felt for generations, not just decades, but for generations.\n\tThere was a history book of our State that came out in the year 2002. It was a series of stories, essays and chapters on the history of Pennsylvania, and it is a fascinating review of the State's history. The foreword of that publication, that book, was written by Brent D. Glass, at the time the executive director of the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission. He wrote this in March 2002. It is a long foreword which I won't read, but he wrote in the early part of this foreword the following, ``One way to understand the meaning of Pennsylvania's past is to examine certain places around the state that are recognized for their significance to the entire nation.'' Then he lists and describes in detail significant places in Pennsylvania that have a connection to our history, whether it's the Liberty Bell or the battlefield at Gettysburg, whether it's the farms in our Amish communities or whether it's some other place of historic significance.\n\tI have no doubt whatsoever that if the same history were recounted about the people of Pennsylvania, the people who moved Pennsylvania forward, the people who in addition to moving our State forward had an impact on the Nation; if we had to make a list of Pennsylvanians who made such contributions; whether it would be William Penn, Benjamin Franklin, you can fill in the blanks from there, I have no doubt that that list would include Senator Arlen Specter, a son of Kansas who made Pennsylvania his home, a son of Kansas who fought every day for the people of Pennsylvania.\n\tSo it is the work and the achievements and the passion and the results in those years in the Senate that will put him on a very short list of those who contributed so much to our Commonwealth that we love and to our country that we cherish.\n\tSo for all that and for so many other reasons, I, as a resident of Pennsylvania and a citizen of the United States, but as a Senator, want to express my gratitude to Senator Arlen Specter for his 30 years of service, but especially for what those 30 years meant to the people of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Senator Specter.\n\tMrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to pay tribute to the 16 Senators who will be departing this body at the end of the year.\n\tI am grateful for the opportunity I have had to serve alongside each of these Senators as colleagues and as friends. All served their States with distinction and gave their constituents strong voices in the world's greatest deliberative body. Senators Evan Bayh, Robert Bennett, Kit Bond, Sam Brownback, Jim Bunning, Roland Burris, Chris Dodd, Byron Dorgan, Russ Feingold, Carte Goodwin, Judd Gregg, Ted Kaufman, George LeMieux, Blanche Lincoln, Arlen Specter, and George Voinovich each left an indelible mark on the Senate, and I wish them well as they take on new challenges and opportunities into the future.\n\tI would like to speak briefly about a few of the Senators I knew best and served with in committees to recognize their contributions and accomplishments and share my fond memories of them and the legacies they will leave behind.\n\n\n                              Bob Bennett\n\n\tFor nearly two decades, Senator Bob Bennett has honorably served the people of Utah.\n\tHis career in the U.S. Senate has been marked by his commonsense solutions to many of the most pressing issues facing our country.\n\tBefore serving in the Senate, Bob was a successful entrepreneur as the CEO of Franklin International Institute. Under Bennett's leadership, the business grew from 4 employees to more than 1,000 and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\tBob brought his past experiences running a successful company with him to the Senate. His business sense was certainly an asset that informed his decisions as a U.S. Senator and made him an effective advocate for businesses, large and small, who keep our economy strong. Being a former businessowner myself, I valued his pragmatic perspective and ability to get things done.\n\tAs a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee and a member of the distinguished Joint Economic Committee, Bob has been a leader in many national economic policy decisions.\n\tIn addition, while serving as the ranking republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water, he has worked to address the critical funding needs our country faces on a wide range of energy and water related issues.\n\tI am proud to have served with Bob for so many years, and his leadership and kind manner will be sorely missed in the Senate.\n\n\n                              Jim Bunning\n\n\tI wish Senator Jim Bunning well as he departs the Senate. Much of his legacy can be defined by his competitive spirit and strong work ethic. These attributes have been evident throughout his many successes in life, first in his career as a Hall of Fame baseball player and then later as a public servant, representing the people of Kentucky. Being an avid sports fan myself, I hold deep admiration for those who can play at the highest levels of competitive sports and later bring that drive to the Senate!\n\tFollowing his highly successful professional baseball career for 17 years, Jim decided he wanted to give back to his community. In 1977, he ran for city council and then later ran for the Kentucky State Senate eventually becoming the Republican leader.\n\tIn 1986, Jim was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for the 4th District of Kentucky, where he served for 12 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1998.\n\tDuring Jim's tenure in Congress, he has established himself as an expert and defender of social security, fighting hard to protect social security for current and future generations.\n\tHis hard work and devotion will be missed by the people of Kentucky, whom I know are grateful for his many years of service.\n\n\n                                Kit Bond\n\n\tKit Bond has a long and distinguished history of service to the people of Missouri. As one of the longest serving Members in the U.S. Senate and a former two-term Governor, his life's work has been dedicated to the State of Missouri.\n\tIn the Senate, Kit has been a respected leader on many issues, such as national security, transportation, and global economic competiveness. While serving as the vice chairman on the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, he has worked hard to strengthen national security through supporting the U.S. military and reforming the Nation's intelligence community. And as the leader of the Senate National Guard Caucus, no one has done more to support the role of the National Guard in our defense.\n\tKit and I have worked on many issues together during our time in the Senate. In particular, last year when Democratic lawmakers tried to push cap-and-trade bills through Congress, Kit and I released the report, ``Climate Change Legislation: A $3.6 Trillion Gas Tax.''\n\tOur joint report revealed how climate legislation would result in a massive new national gas tax on American families, farmers, workers and truckers--by increasing the price of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.\n\tIt has been my pleasure to serve with Senator Bond. His office has been next to mine for 12 years and it will not be the same without that familiar cigar aroma lingering in the second floor halls of Russell. Without a doubt, he will be missed by his colleagues in the Senate and his constituents in Missouri.\n\n\n                             Sam Brownback\n\n\tWhile Senator Sam Brownback will certainly be missed by the Senate, the people of Kansas will continue to benefit from his leadership, as he serves as their newly-elected Governor.\n\tPrior to being elected to public office, Sam's professional experiences include working as a radio broadcaster, attorney, teacher, and administrator.\n\tFrom these varied professional experiences he brought with him a unique and dynamic perspective to the U.S. Senate.\n\tThrough his leadership as the ranking member on the Joint Economic Committee, ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resource Subcommittee on Water and Power, Sam established himself as a leader on a wide range of issues.\n\tDuring his tenure in the Senate, he has supported aviation research and expanded global aviation markets. Through these efforts, he has effectively spurred economic growth and strengthened the U.S. military.\n\tSome of Sam's most distinguishing characteristics are his personal integrity and his commitment to his Catholic faith. These principles came through in much of what he did in the Senate. I will always appreciate his passion and his work to translate his beliefs into his actions as a U.S. Senator.\n\tI am confident Senator Brownback will continue to serve the people of Kansas with the same character and dedication in his new role as governor.\n\n\n                              Chris Dodd \n\n\tSenator Chris Dodd departs the Senate after nearly three decades faithfully representing the people of Connecticut.\n\tFrom his service in the Peace Corps, the U.S. Army National Guard and Reserves as well as his many years in the U.S. Senate, Senator Dodd's commitment to public service and love for his country have been evident throughout his life.\n\tChris was a leader in the Senate, serving as the chairman of the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, chairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and Narcotics, and chairman of its Children and Families Subcommittee.\n\tAlthough we had our differences on various policy issues, I always appreciated his willingness to put partisanship aside to reach consensus when possible in order to improve legislation. For instance, earlier this year when working on the financial reform bill, despite my public opposition to the legislation, Chris worked with me to incorporate my amendments in the final version of the bill. I ultimately voted against the bill, but I am grateful for the efforts he made to include my amendments.\n\tToday we bid him farewell after 29 years of tireless service in the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                              Byron Dorgan\n\n\tToday we say goodbye to Senator Byron Dorgan after 18 years in the Senate, serving the State of North Dakota.\n\tFirst elected to Congress in 1980, Dorgan has devoted his career to serving North Dakota and fighting for the interests of rural America.\n\tAfter serving six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, Byron was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992.\n\tI have had the pleasure to serve with Senator Dorgan on the Senate Commerce Committee. Last summer, we joined together with several of our colleagues in the Senate to introduce bipartisan legislation that reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA.\n\tThe legislation accelerated the modernization of the Nation's air traffic control, ATC system, addressed critical safety concerns in the national airspace system, NAS, and improved rural community access to air service.\n\tI appreciated Byron's willingness to champion good ideas put forward by members from either side of the aisle. By focusing on issues where consensus could be achieved, he helped to move the debate forward on important issues and solve problems.\n\tSenator Dorgan leaves the Senate with my best wishes and respect.\n\n\n                               Judd Gregg\n\n\tAs a leading voice for fiscal responsibility, Senator Judd Gregg will be deeply missed in the Senate.\n\tThroughout his long and distinguished career, with unparalleled commitment to fiscal discipline, Senator Gregg worked to address many pressing issues.\n\tSenator Gregg is a well known budget expert and national leader on the most critical issues facing our country in recent years, notably health care, economic issues, and financial regulation.\n\tHis efforts to address the looming entitlement crisis, the rising cost of health care, and the inefficient and complex tax system are commendable and serve as an example to all elected officials.\n\tIn the Senate, Senator Gregg has also focused his efforts on helping the U.S. maintain its position as the leading destination for capital and investment in the world.\n\tI appreciate the job Senator Gregg has done in his position as the former chairman and current ranking member of the Budget Committee.\n\tIn 2006, Judd sponsored an amendment that strengthened border security by providing resources to integrate biometric databases as well as construction of new stations and check points and tactical infrastructure for immigration and customs enforcement.\n\tUnlike other similar proposals at the time, his amendment was offset and did not add to the deficit.\n\tI will miss working with him in this Chamber, and I will miss his friendship and support on the issues that matter most to America.\n\tIn conclusion, the departing Senators' contributions, their dedicated service, and the issues they championed will be remembered long after their final days in the Senate.\n\tI believe I can speak for my fellow Senators when I say that we will all miss our departing friends.\n\tMs. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when the 111th Congress draws to a close, we will bid farewell to 16 colleagues who have collectively given more than 200 years of service to our Nation through their service in the Senate. These include seven of the Senate's most experienced Members. People like Chris Dodd and Arlen Specter who have each served five terms in the Senate. Kit Bond who has served four terms and Bob Bennett, Byron Dorgan, Russ Feingold, and Judd Gregg, who have each served three terms in this Chamber.\n\tWhen the 112th Congress convenes in January, the ranks of women Senators will be reduced by one. In fact, the 112th Congress will be the first Congress in recent memory in which the total number of women Senators will actually decline. And with the departure of our colleague, Roland Burris, there will not be a single African-American Senator when the new Congress convenes.\n\tIn January we will feel the loss of the great pitching ace, Jim Bunning, and Evan Bayh, both respected colleagues on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. They are among six of my Energy Committee colleagues who are leaving the Senate this year.\n\tJudd Gregg, one of our Nation's foremost experts on the Federal budget leaves us at the end of the year. As this Senate comes to grips with the challenges of a rising deficit and economic stagnation we will miss his firm hand and thoughtful guidance. My neighbor in the Hart Senate Office Building, Arlen Specter, is one of the Senate's most independent voices and perhaps the best friend that the National Institutes of Health, and every American who benefits from its cutting edge research, has ever had on Capitol Hill. Bob Bennett, one of the most thoughtful among us, who draws wisdom from experience as an entrepreneur as well as in public service, will not be among us. I learned much from Senator Bennett during the period that he served as counselor to the Republican leader and I served as vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference.\n\tI would also like to acknowledge contributions of Kit Bond, one of the foremost experts on our Nation's transportation and infrastructure needs. I appreciate Senator Bond's interest in understanding the unique transportation and infrastructure challenges that we in Alaska, the largest State in our Union in terms of land mass and one of the youngest must contend with. Senator Bond, like all of us, wears many hats in this institution. He has also earned the undying respect of our Nation's citizen soldiers through his leadership of the Senate National Guard Caucus.\n\tOne of Chris Dodd's legacies to the Nation is legislation to ensure that the unique needs of children are addressed in our Nation's response to catastrophic disasters. I was honored to partner with Senator Dodd in helping to pass this legislation.\n\tRuss Feingold may have earned his place in history for his work on campaign finance reform but I will also appreciate him for his efforts to ensure that members of the National Guard and Reserve do not fall through the cracks when they return home with battlefield injuries. Senator Feingold and I teamed on the Wounded Warrior Transition Act, a portion of which was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. I will continue to pursue the remaining provisions in the new Congress.\n\tSam Brownback has forever earned a place in the heart of our first Americans for his work on the adoption of a joint resolution apologizing to American Indians and Alaska Natives for centuries of ill conceived policies carried out by our Federal Government. He is known around the world as a champion of religious freedom as well.\n\tGeorge Voinovich came to the Senate after a distinguished career that included service as Governor of the State of Ohio and mayor of the city of Cleveland. He has made a substantial contribution to the efficient operation of our federal government as a leader of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. I appreciate his support of the effort that Senator Akaka and I advanced, along with others, to make locality pay available to Federal employees in Alaska and Hawaii through the Non-Foreign Act of 2009.\n\tI would like to say a few words about my friend Byron Dorgan. In 2007, following the sudden and unexpected death of our friend and colleague Craig Thomas, I was elevated to vice chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. Senator Dorgan was the chairman of that committee. Last week both of us had the honor of addressing the National Congress of American Indians at one of the meetings that preceded President Obama's tribal summit. Each of us reflected on that fact that the committee has highly productive during the period we shared the gavel. During our time together the committee laid the groundwork for reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, more than a decade in the making. We reauthorized the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act, we pursued a settlement of the Cobell litigation, and we crafted and introduced the Tribal Law and Order Act, which President Obama signed into law earlier this year. Senator Dorgan has consistently championed adequate funding for the Indian Health Service and he has come to the floor on many occasions to speak to the unacceptable rates of suicide among Native youth. I am pleased to know that he will continue this work after he leaves the Senate. It comes from the heart.\n\tAs I noted at the outset, 2011 will be the first year in recent memory that the number of women serving in the Senate has actually declined. All of the women of the Senate will miss our dear friend and highly respected colleague Blanche Lincoln. Blanche Lincoln made history in her own right when she became the youngest woman ever elected to the Senate at the age of 38. Senator Lincoln represented the people of Arkansas with distinction for two terms, juggling a demanding career in public service while raising two wonderful twin boys Reece and Bennett. She is truly a wonderful colleague to work with. A centrist who comfortably works across the aisle and votes her convictions. One of the kindest people in the Senate. I expect great things of Blanche Lincoln  in the future and I have every confidence she will deliver on that prediction.\n\tIt has been an honor and a pleasure to serve with each of the people who will leave this Chamber when we adjourn sine die. Each has made substantial contributions to their States, to the Nation and to the Senate during their time here.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Tom Harkin", "Barbara Boxer", "Olympia J.

Mr. President, I want to make a few observations about the \ncontinuing resolution and the appropriations process this year.\n  First, I want to commend Chairman Inouye for his leadership and \nefforts to accommodate the views and input of all senators in crafting \nthe omnibus appropriations bill. He went a long way to meet the demands \nof the minority leader and other senators to include a $29 billion cut \nfrom the budget level requested by the President. Indeed, I was deeply \ndisappointed that the proposed omnibus would have eliminated the \nLeveraging Educational Assistance Program, LEAP. For more than a \ndecade, I worked with states, educators, and others to reauthorize and \nfund this program, which uses Federal resources to leverage additional \nstate aid to help low income students attend college. As much as I was \ndissatisfied by this outcome, I was prepared to vote for this bill \nbecause it is far superior to the inefficiencies and consequences of a \ncontinuing resolution. I am disappointed that such a significant \ncompromise was blocked by the other side of the aisle.\n  Instead, we are being forced to adopt a short-term continuing \nresolution, CR, through March 4, 2011. With few exceptions, the CR \nprovides no direction from Congress on how funds can be used, while at \nthe same time failing to make critical adjustments and investments for \ncertain programs and agencies. Critics of the omnibus appropriations \nbill should understand that unlike the thoughtful, lengthy, and open \nappropriations process that produced the omnibus, this CR was put \ntogether quickly without the input of most senators. As a result, it is \nhardly a thoughtful instrument for funding the government.\n  I am particularly concerned about the impact the CR will have on the \ncapabilities of the Securities and Exchange Commission to provide \nrobust oversight of financial markets.\n  Fair and orderly markets are critical to restoring confidence in the \nAmerican economy. Despite considerable increases in the number of firms \nit is required to oversee and tremendous growth in the size and \ncomplexity of the securities markets and products it regulates, the \nSEC's workforce and technology investments are only now returning to \nthe levels of five years ago.\n  Under the CR, the SEC will be funded at the fiscal year 2010 rate, \nwhich is nearly $200 million less than what was included during \nbipartisan negotiations on the omnibus. Without the omnibus's funding \nlevel, the SEC will have to halt several technology projects and forgo \nreplacement of departing staff. Shortchanging the SEC will also make it \nextraordinarily difficult to fulfill new statutory requirements under \nthe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The SEC \nhas been tasked with helping establish an effective regulatory system \nfor the previously unseen and largely unregulated over-the-counter \nderivatives market and the hedge fund markets. It has new \nresponsibilities over credit rating agencies, including annual exams.\n  We should not make the past mistake of underfunding the SEC. This \nagency is critical to restoring the confidence of retirees and \ninvestors in the United States capital markets, so that they will again \ninvest in American companies, helping inject new life into our economy. \nWe should not be penny-wise and pound-foolish. Continuing to starve the \nSEC of the funds it needs to police markets will ultimately make it \nmore likely to see a major fraud. Any incremental savings will be cold \ncomfort for the losses incurred by taxpayers and investors.\n  Likewise, I believe we need to fully fund the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. At a hearing that Senator Levin and I held on \nDecember 8, 2010, Chairman Gensler informed us that his agency is going \nto be woefully short of resources. The continuing resolution for the \nCFTC will leave them about $116 million short of the funding level \nincluded in the omnibus.\n  I hope that we will have chance to address these critical shortfalls \nin the next funding vehicle to come before the Senate.\n  While it is true that overall the 36-page CR did not provide \nsufficient direction and oversight, it is important to acknowledge that \nthe CR does make a few adjustments--some that are essential and others \nwhich I believe deserved greater consideration.\n  I want to applaud the addition of language in the CR that requires \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to obligate the same amount \nof funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program as it did \nduring the same period last year. This will make a total of $3.95 \nbillion available to low-income families and individuals during the \ncold winter months. I hope that in the final appropriations bill we \nwill meet the bipartisan request of 44 Senators to fully fund this \nprogram at the $5.1 billion level for the entirety of fiscal year 2011.\n  I am also pleased that the CR addresses funding for the Pell grant. \nAccording to recent estimates from the Office of Management and Budget, \nstudents would have faced a reduction of as much as $1,840 from the \nmaximum grant. The CR will address the shortfall and ensure that we can \nmaintain the Pell grant maximum at $5,550. Despite the economic \nhardships families are facing, they continue to prioritize education. \nThey know that it is the foundation for our economic recovery and \nfuture prosperity. We must keep our end of the bargain by maintaining \nour commitment to the Pell grant.\n  I am, however, concerned that the CR includes a provision to codify a \nmisguided Bush-era regulation that undermines our central goal of \nensuring that students in high poverty schools are taught by highly \nqualified teachers and that parents know the qualifications of their \nchildren's teachers. Under the No Child Left Behind Act, enacted in \n2002, a highly qualified teacher must have obtained full state \ncertification, which may include certification obtained through \nalternative routes. The Bush administration published regulations \nallowing that a teacher who is merely enrolled in or making progress \ntoward state certification to be deemed highly qualified. Parents in \nCalifornia have challenged the regulation in the courts and have won a \nfavorable decision on appeal. Quite simply, they want to know whether \ntheir children's teachers are fully certified or just in the process of \nbecoming certified. This provision prevents them from knowing that.\n  I am also deeply disappointed that this CR does not contain important \nlanguage that would have allowed the Department of Defense to reprogram \nfunds for new starts, increases in production, or other realignments. \nThis provision would have given the Department further flexibility to \nensure critical defense programs stay on schedule and on cost. This is \nespecially important for the Navy's ship construction programs--\nprograms that the Navy supports, were authorized by the Defense \nAuthorization Act, and employ thousands of Rhode Islanders.\n  Without this provision, the Navy, and all of the services, will be \nfurther limited and constrained to execute programs within the funding \nlevels set last year.\n  I have described some of the pitfalls with this CR. It is a crude \ninstrument that has many shortcomings. Regrettably, the decision by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to walk away from the omnibus \nplaced the continued operation of government agencies from the Pentagon \nto the FBI to the FDA to the Treasury at risk. Adopting the CR, \nnotwithstanding its significant flaws, is the only responsible option \navailable. In the coming months, it is my hope that we can craft a full \nyear funding measure that corrects the serious issues the CR has \ncreated and failed to address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n\tMr. REED.

Mr. President, as we end this year, I wanted to look back \nat what we have been able to accomplish--and look ahead at some of the \nimportant priorities we must tackle next year.\n  The 111th Congress has been one of the most productive in our \nNation's history.\n  Congressional scholar Norman Ornstein has said the legislative \nachievements of this session are ``at least on par with the 89th \nCongress'' of 1965-1966, under President Johnson, which produced \nlandmark civil rights legislation as well as Medicaid and Medicare.\n  We should take a moment to reflect on some of those accomplishments.\n  After years of unsupervised gambling on Wall Street fueled an \nunsustainable housing bubble, we inherited the worst economic crisis \nsince the Great Depression. We helped bring our economy back from the \nbrink by taking bold action.\n  We passed the Economic Recovery Act, which has created or saved more \nthan 350,000 jobs in my home State of California alone.\n  We approved the bipartisan HIRE Act--a jobs package that cut taxes \nfor companies that hire unemployed workers and extended the highway \ntrust fund. As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I was pleased to help advance this critical measure to \nprotect more than 1 million jobs nationwide building our roads, bridges \nand transit systems.\n  We helped small businesses--which are the true engines of our \neconomic growth--by passing the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act. I \nwas proud to join with Senator Jeff Merkley to create the new $30 \nbillion small business lending fund, which will help community banks \ngive small businesses the credit they need to create hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs.\n  We approved legislation to help save up to 16,500 teacher jobs in \nCalifornia--and nearly 160,000 teachers' jobs nationwide--and paid for \nit by closing tax loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas.\n  We worked across the aisle to give much-needed tax relief to millions \nof middle-class families and extend unemployment insurance for 2 \nmillion out-of-work Americans and 400,000 Californians who would \notherwise have lost their benefits this month. And I was proud to work \nwith Senator Feinstein and others to make sure this tax-relief package \ninvests in clean energy, which will create tens of thousands of jobs in \nCalifornia and across the country.\n  And to ensure that we never again face a similar financial crisis, we \npassed landmark legislation to crack down on the reckless gambling on \nWall Street, enacting tough reforms that will curb abuses, shine a \nlight on dark markets and put a new cop on the beat to protect \nconsumers. I was proud to offer the first amendment, which will ensure \nthat taxpayers are never again on the hook to bail out Wall Street.\n  The 111th Congress was a landmark Congress for advancing civil rights \nfor all Americans.\n  We approved the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to help ensure equal \npay for equal work--regardless of age, race, gender, religion or \nnational origin. It was the first bill signed into law by President \nObama last year.\n  We passed the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act to strengthen the ability of law enforcement to \ninvestigate and prosecute hate crimes. The law adds gender, sexual \norientation, disability and gender identity as protected categories \nunder Federal hate crimes law.\n  Last week, in a historic step, we repealed the discriminatory don't \nask, don't tell policy that has banned gays and lesbians from serving \nopenly in the U.S. military. Back in 1993, I offered an amendment on \nthe Senate floor to keep this unjust policy from being codified into \nlaw. Now, 17 years later, I am so proud to witness this incredible \nvictory for civil rights, equality and a stronger nation.\n  I was also proud to join in confirming two new Supreme Court \nJustices--Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina to serve on the high court, \nand Elena Kagan. When Kagan was sworn in this fall, it marked the first \ntime our country has had three women serving together on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  We also confirmed some highly qualified and historic judicial \nnominees from California this Congress--including Judge Lucy Koh for \nthe Northern District of California, Judge Jacqueline Nguyen for the \nCentral District of California, Judge Dolly Gee for the Central \nDistrict of California, and Judge Kimberly Mueller for the Eastern \nDistrict of California.\n  The 111th Congress also took momentous steps forward in protecting \nconsumers, children and all our families.\n  We passed a landmark health care reform bill that will extend \ncoverage to 7 million uninsured Californians, help seniors pay for \nprescription drugs, provide tax credits to help small business owners \nafford coverage, and ensure that insurance companies can no longer deny \ncoverage because of preexisting conditions.\n  We approved legislation to allow the Food and Drug Administration to \nregulate tobacco and crack down on cigarette marketing and sales to \nkids.\n  We approved major reforms to the student loan system--ending \nsubsidies to big banks, saving taxpayers money and providing Pell \ngrants to 63,000 more students in California over the next decade.\n  We passed credit card reform legislation to protect consumers from \nexcessive fees and deceptive practices.\n  And this month, we enacted a food safety bill that will help \nconsumers and California's agriculture industry by protecting our \nNation's food supply from outbreaks of foodborne illnesses.\n  I am also pleased that the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights that I \nhave championed with Senator Olympia Snowe is now being implemented by \nthe Department of Transportation. As a result, we are already seeing \nfewer long tarmac delays for airline passengers.\n  The 111th Congress has also taken great strides to protect public \nhealth and our environment.\n  We passed legislation protecting more than 2 million acres of \nwilderness and creating a national system to conserve land held by the \nBureau of Land Management. The legislation included three bills I \nsponsored designating 700,000 additional acres of wilderness in \nCalifornia, from the Eastern Sierra Nevada to the San Jacinto Mountains \nin Riverside County.\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\n  I have been honored to serve as chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee during a period of extraordinary \naccomplishments. In the 111th Congress, the EPW Committee held more \nthan 80 hearings and approved more than 70 pieces of legislation. More \nthan 20 EPW bills have gone to President Obama for his signature, \nincluding legislation to create jobs and accelerate economic recovery, \nto protect children and families from dangerous chemicals in the \nenvironment, and to address the dangers of unchecked climate change.\n  The committee has played a critical oversight role. While the oil was \nstill gushing into the Gulf of Mexico, we held hearings to demand \nanswers from oil company executives and Administration officials on the \ncauses and impacts of the BP Deepwater Horizon oilspill disaster. As a \nresult, BP provided the committee with previously unavailable video \nrecords gathered since the incident. EPW then provided scientists, the \npublic and the media with access to this important underwater video.\n  One of our most basic responsibilities is to protect children and \nfamilies from dangerous toxins in the air they breathe and the water \nthey drink.\n  Parents have a right to expect that their children are safe from \nenvironmental hazards when they are at school. But following reports \nthat found toxic air pollution levels at schools across the country, \nour oversight efforts led to additional EPA monitoring of air pollution \nat schools in California and in other States.\n  Emissions from ships' engines are a major cause of persistent air-\nquality problems at California's ports, including the Ports of Long \nBeach and Los Angeles, and at other ports around the Nation. EPW \noversight helped shine a light on the importance of setting strong \nsafeguards to reduce air pollution from marine vessels, and earlier \nthis year international authorities officially designated waters off \nNorth American coasts as subject to strong international emission \nstandards for ships.\n  I was also pleased when the Senate passed a bipartisan bill I \nsponsored with my ranking member, Senator James Inhofe, to protect \npeople from toxic lead in drinking water pipes, pipe fittings and \nplumbing fixtures. The bill is now on its way to the President's desk.\n  I was also pleased to work with Senators George Voinovich, Tom Carper \nand Inhofe to pass bipartisan legislation to strengthen efforts to \nreduce pollution from diesel engines. Diesel exhaust contributes to \npollution that threatens the health of millions of people in California \nand contributes to asthma, heart disease, cancer and other illnesses.\n  We also enacted legislation to study the impact of black carbon \npollution, and bipartisan legislation to enforce more protective \nstandards on cancer-causing formaldehyde in wood products.\n  After the Tennessee Valley Authority, TVA, coal ash disaster 2 years \nago released more than 1 billion gallons of toxic material, EPW held \nhearings into the incident and we initiated an investigation of the \ndangers of coal combustion waste. We succeeded in ensuring that the \nObama administration publicly released the list of other high-hazard \nash sites because families have a right to know about dangers to their \ncommunities.\n  Making the transition to the clean energy economy is one of the best \nways to create millions of jobs and protect our children from dangerous \npollution, and it will help break our dangerous dependence on foreign \noil, which costs us a billion dollars a day and threatens our national \nsecurity.\n  Thanks in large part to the groundwork laid by the EPW Committee's \nvigilant oversight during the 110th Congress, the EPA finally in 2009 \ngranted California's request for a waiver to tackle tailpipe emissions \nof global warming pollution and incorporated the waiver into a landmark \nagreement that will boost fuel efficiency, save consumers money, cut \ncarbon pollution, and save billions of barrels of oil.\n  As chairman, I am committed to continuing to work on legislation that \nreduces pollution, promotes energy efficiency and creates incentives to \nspeed the transition to clean, renewable sources of energy.\n  President Obama has already signed EPW legislation to train building \noperators and contractors to improve the energy efficiency of federal \nfacilities, and our committee passed bills to make schools and other \npublic buildings more energy efficient, and to provide incentives for \nclean energy development on abandoned or formerly contaminated sites. \nIn the new Congress, I plan to continue to work to ensure that the U.S. \nGovernment facilities are models of clean-energy technology and energy \nefficiency\n  This Congress has also taken action to protect our national security \nand support our troops and our veterans.\n  We just came together in a bipartisan fashion to ratify the New START \ntreaty, which will help protect the national security of the United \nStates by ensuring there are mutual reductions in nuclear weapons and \ndelivery systems, and ensuring that our nuclear inspectors are on the \nground in Russia.\n  We enacted tough new sanctions against Iran--another bipartisan vote \nthat sends a clear and resounding message to Iran that it will pay a \nheavy price for its reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n  We also passed legislation to improve the way the VA is funded, \nhelping veterans get timely access to services and care. And we passed \nimportant legislation to compensate the family caregivers of our \nseverely wounded service men and women. No one should have to face \nfinancial hardship for choosing to care for a loved one who was wounded \nin war.\n  As chair of the Senate Military Family Caucus, I was pleased to see \nthe Senate approve my legislation to help reimburse military families \nfor the cost of traveling off base to obtain needed specialty medical \ncare.\n  Senators Kit Bond, Joe Lieberman and I also worked to expand the use \nof veterans centers to active, Guard and Reserve U.S. military \npersonnel.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I was proud to \nhelp secure $30 million to help women-led nongovernmental organizations \nin Afghanistan provide direct services such as adult literacy programs, \nvocational training and health services.\n  And I was proud to join Senator Bond to help secure funding for an \nadditional eight C-17 aircraft, which are built in Long Beach and are \ncritical to our national defense.\n  While we have made significant progress, there is still more to be \ndone to create jobs, get our economy back on track, protect consumers \nand the environment, and make life better for all Californians and all \nAmericans.\n  We must ensure that California and other states can continue to lead \nthe way toward a clean energy future, which is already creating \nhundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  We must continue to put Californians and Americans back to work by \nrebuilding our road, bridges and transit systems.\n  As we look to the 112th Congress, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee will continue to focus on creating jobs and turning our \neconomy around through the next surface transportation authorization \nand through a new Water Resources Development Act.\n  And we will continue to shine a spotlight on the need to ensure the \nair our families breathe and the water our children drink is clean and \nsafe. After the recent reports that found toxic chromium-6 \ncontamination in drinking water in California and across the Nation, we \nhave planned hearings on chromium-6 for early 2012. Senator Feinstein \nand I sent a letter urging the EPA to act, and the agency has already \nbegun to respond by offering assistance to affected communities.\n  We will also work to ensure communities that suspect they have a \ncluster of environmentally caused illness have access to the federal \nexperts and other resources that can help them get the answers they \ndeserve.\n  We must provide incentives for U.S.-based companies to bring home \nbillions of dollars sitting offshore from foreign sales. Bringing those \nfunds home could be major boost to our economic recovery from the \nprivate sector.\n  While I was disappointed that our efforts to pass the DREAM Act were \nblocked, we must continue to work to pass comprehensive immigration \nreform. Our broken immigration system tears families apart and hurts \nour economic competitiveness, and we must\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\nwork together to fix it. I will keep fighting for these young people \nwho are raised in America and I will continue to work to pass AgJobs.\n  And we cannot rest until other important judicial nominees are \nconfirmed, including professor Goodwin Liu for the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, Judge Edward Chen for the Northern District of California, \nJudge Edward Davila for the Northern District of California, and Judge \nAnthony Battaglia for the Southern District of California.\n  While we passed legislation to help the 9/11 first responders, now we \nmust finish the work of making sure our firefighters and public safety \nworkers have fair working conditions.\n  I will also keep working to pass important bills that we approved in \ncommittee this year to protect our public lands, waterways and ocean \nresources, including legislation to help restore the Chesapeake Bay, \nthe Great Lakes, Lake Tahoe, and the San Francisco Bay.\n  I am grateful to the people of the California for the opportunity to \nrepresent them in the United States Senate. I look forward to hearing \ntheir ideas as we continue our work in the 112th Congress next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE 111TH CONGRESS\n\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as we end this year, I wanted to look back at what we have been able to accomplish--and look ahead at some of the important priorities we must tackle next year.\n\tThe 111th Congress has been one of the most productive in our Nation's history.\n\tCongressional scholar Norman Ornstein has said the legislative achievements of this session are ``at least on par with the 89th Congress'' of 1965-1966, under President Johnson, which produced landmark civil rights legislation as well as Medicaid and Medicare.\n\tWe should take a moment to reflect on some of those accomplishments.\n\tAfter years of unsupervised gambling on Wall Street fueled an unsustainable housing bubble, we inherited the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. We helped bring our economy back from the brink by taking bold action.\n\tWe passed the Economic Recovery Act, which has created or saved more than 350,000 jobs in my home State of California alone.\n\tWe approved the bipartisan HIRE Act--a jobs package that cut taxes for companies that hire unemployed workers and extended the highway trust fund. As chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, I was pleased to help advance this critical measure to protect more than 1 million jobs nationwide building our roads, bridges and transit systems.\n\tWe helped small businesses--which are the true engines of our economic growth--by passing the Small Business Jobs and Credit Act. I was proud to join with Senator Jeff Merkley to create the new $30 billion small business lending fund, which will help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.\n\tWe approved legislation to help save up to 16,500 teacher jobs in California--and nearly 160,000 teachers' jobs nationwide--and paid for it by closing tax loopholes for companies that ship jobs overseas.\n\tWe worked across the aisle to give much-needed tax relief to millions of middle-class families and extend unemployment insurance for 2 million out-of-work Americans and 400,000 Californians who would otherwise have lost their benefits this month. And I was proud to work with Senator Feinstein and others to make sure this tax-relief package invests in clean energy, which will create tens of thousands of jobs in California and across the country.\n\tAnd to ensure that we never again face a similar financial crisis, we passed landmark legislation to crack down on the reckless gambling on Wall Street, enacting tough reforms that will curb abuses, shine a light on dark markets and put a new cop on the beat to protect consumers. I was proud to offer the first amendment, which will ensure that taxpayers are never again on the hook to bail out Wall Street.\n\tThe 111th Congress was a landmark Congress for advancing civil rights for all Americans.\n\tWe approved the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to help ensure equal pay for equal work--regardless of age, race, gender, religion or national origin. It was the first bill signed into law by President Obama last year.\n\tWe passed the Matthew Shepard Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act to strengthen the ability of law enforcement to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. The law adds gender, sexual orientation, disability and gender identity as protected categories under Federal hate crimes law.\n\tLast week, in a historic step, we repealed the discriminatory don't ask, don't tell policy that has banned gays and lesbians from serving openly in the U.S. military. Back in 1993, I offered an amendment on the Senate floor to keep this unjust policy from being codified into law. Now, 17 years later, I am so proud to witness this incredible victory for civil rights, equality and a stronger nation.\n\tI was also proud to join in confirming two new Supreme Court Justices--Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina to serve on the high court, and Elena Kagan.

Mr. President, as we approach the end of another year--and \nthe end of the 111th Congress--millions of Americans continue to face \ngrowing threats to their privacy and security because of data security \nbreaches involving their most sensitive personal information. Last \nyear, I reintroduced the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act--a \nbipartisan and comprehensive bill that will better protect Americans \nfrom the growing threats of data breaches and identity theft. I am \ndisappointed that the Senate will adjourn for the year without \nconsidering this important privacy legislation.\n  This long overdue privacy bill would establish a national standard \nfor breach notification and requirements for securing Americans' most \nsensitive personal data. The bill--as improved by my manager's \namendment--strikes the right balance to protect privacy, promote \ncommerce, and successfully combat identity theft. I urged the Senate to \nconsider and pass this important privacy legislation before we adjourn \nfor the year. Despite its bipartisan approval by the Judiciary \nCommittee, the ranking Republican is objecting and refusing to allow \nthe Senate to proceed.\n  When I first introduced this bill 6 years ago, I had high hopes of \nbringing urgently needed data privacy reforms to the American people. I \nhave worked closely with both Republican and Democratic Senators since \nto enact this important privacy legislation. Although the Judiciary \nCommittee favorably reported this bill three times--in 2005, 2007, and \nyet again in 2009--it remains stalled on the Senate Calendar. While the \nSenate has waited to act, the dangers to our privacy, economic \nprosperity, and national security posed by data breaches have not gone \naway.\n  The recently reported cyber attacks in response to the WikiLeaks \ndisclosures are fresh reminders of the urgent need to have national \nstandards to protect the privacy of America's digital information. In \nJune, the insurance company WellPoint, Inc., announced that 470,000 \nindividuals who used the company's Web site to apply for insurance may \nhave unwittingly exposed their Social Security numbers and other \nsensitive data to the public. Just last month, the University of Hawaii \nsuffered a major data breach involving sensitive student data, \nincluding Social Security numbers, dates of birth, names, and grades. \nAnd a recent data breach at the Department of Veterans Affairs resulted \nin the unauthorized release of the Social Security numbers and other \npersonal information of at least 180 of our veterans. These troubling \ndata breaches are painful reminders of the need to enact comprehensive \nFederal data privacy legislation this year.\n  This bill offers meaningful solutions to the vexing problem of data \nsecurity breaches. It requires that data brokers let consumers know \nwhat sensitive personal information they have about them and to allow \nindividuals to correct inaccurate information. The bill also requires \nthat companies that have databases with sensitive personal information \non Americans establish and implement data privacy and security \nprograms.\n  In addition, the bill requires notice when sensitive personal \ninformation has been compromised. The bill provides for tough criminal \npenalties for anyone who would intentionally and willfully conceal the \nfact that a data breach has occurred when the breach causes economic \ndamage to consumers.

Mr. President, as we approach the end of another year--and the end of the 111th Congress--millions of Americans continue to face growing threats to their privacy and security because of data security breaches involving their most sensitive personal information. Last year, I reintroduced the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act--a bipartisan and comprehensive bill that will better protect Americans from the growing threats of data breaches and identity theft. I am disappointed that the Senate will adjourn for the year without considering this important privacy legislation.\n\tThis long overdue privacy bill would establish a national standard for breach notification and requirements for securing Americans' most sensitive personal data. The bill--as improved by my manager's amendment--strikes the right balance to protect privacy, promote commerce, and successfully combat identity theft. I urged the Senate to consider and pass this important privacy legislation before we adjourn for the year. Despite its bipartisan approval by the Judiciary Committee, the ranking Republican is objecting and refusing to allow the Senate to proceed.\n\tWhen I first introduced this bill 6 years ago, I had high hopes of bringing urgently needed data privacy reforms to the American people. I have worked closely with both Republican and Democratic Senators since to enact this important privacy legislation. Although the Judiciary Committee favorably reported this bill three times--in 2005, 2007, and yet again in 2009--it remains stalled on the Senate Calendar. While the Senate has waited to act, the dangers to our privacy, economic prosperity, and national security posed by data breaches have not gone away.\n\tThe recently reported cyber attacks in response to the WikiLeaks disclosures are fresh reminders of the urgent need to have national standards to protect the privacy of America's digital information. In June, the insurance company WellPoint, Inc., announced that 470,000 individuals who used the company's Web site to apply for insurance may have unwittingly exposed their Social Security numbers and other sensitive data to the public. Just last month, the University of Hawaii suffered a major data breach involving sensitive student data, including Social Security numbers, dates of birth, names, and grades. And a recent data breach at the Department of Veterans Affairs resulted in the unauthorized release of the Social Security numbers and other personal information of at least 180 of our veterans. These troubling data breaches are painful reminders of the need to enact comprehensive Federal data privacy legislation this year.\n\tThis bill offers meaningful solutions to the vexing problem of data security breaches. It requires that data brokers let consumers know what sensitive personal information they have about them and to allow individuals to correct inaccurate information. The bill also requires that companies that have databases with sensitive personal information on Americans establish and implement data privacy and security programs.\n\tIn addition, the bill requires notice when sensitive personal information has been compromised. The bill provides for tough criminal penalties for anyone who would intentionally and willfully conceal the fact that a data breach has occurred when the breach causes economic damage to consumers. Finally, the bill addresses the important issue of the government's use of personal data.\n\tI am pleased that the Obama administration has recently issued two privacy reports that make recommendations to improve data privacy that are consistent with the approach adopted in my bill.\n\tI drafted this bill after long and thoughtful consultation with many of the stakeholders on this issue, including the privacy, consumer protection, and business communities. I have also worked closely with other Senators, including Senators Feinstein, Hatch, Feingold, Specter, and Schumer.\n\tThis is a comprehensive bill that not only deals with the need to provide Americans with notice when they have been victims of a data breach but that also deals with the underlying problem of lax security to help prevent data breaches from occurring in the first place. The House of Representatives has passed comprehensive data privacy legislation. The Senate should also pass comprehensive data privacy legislation and should have done so this Congress.\n\tThere has been ample time to resolve any concerns, but still there are those who are refusing to allow the Senate to act. We cannot afford to continue to wait to address this important privacy issue.

Some estimates put the number \nof al-Qaida operatives in Afghanistan at fewer than one hundred.\n  We are now engaged in fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan and, \nfrankly, there are a number of foreign armies that have tried and \nfailed in Afghanistan over many centuries.\n  I don't believe there is any chance of our ever controlling the \ntribal regions of Afghanistan.\n  Furthermore, we ought to be fighting terrorism where terrorists, are \nrather than where terrorists were.

Mr. President, it is with great sadness and concern \nthat I report that more and more kids are turning to drugs. Recently \nreleased annual studies that track drug use trends among youth and \nadults are indicating rapid increases in drug use among all age groups. \nThe most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health indicates drug \nuse among people aged 12 and older increased by 9 percent since 2008. \nAccording to this survey, over 7 million people in the past year are \nestimated to have used drugs. Among these\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\nnumbers, it is estimated that over 4 million people have abused \nmarijuana, which is well over half of all drug abusers in this survey.\n  Even more disturbing are the rapid increases in drug use among \nAmerica's youth. New figures from the Monitoring the Future Study, \nwhich is conducted by the University of Michigan and surveys school age \nkids' drug use from 8th grade to 12th grade, have shot up \nsignificantly. The rapid increases are due to higher use rates of \nmarijuana among all age groups. Among the youngest surveyed, marijuana \nuse jumped to 16 percent from 14.5 percent in the past year. Marijuana \nuse has increased so much among high school seniors that more are now \nsmoking marijuana than tobacco in the past 30 days. According to this \nsurvey, more than one in three high school seniors have smoked \nmarijuana in the past year. Also troubling are the increases in the use \nof ecstasy, heroin, and the ongoing high abuse rates of prescription \nand over-the-counter medicines. On top of all this, the survey also \ndetermined that accompanying the increased drug use was a decreased \nperception that drugs are harmful.\n  In my home State of Iowa, the Governor's Office of Drug Control \nPolicy reports in their 2011 Drug Control Strategy that marijuana \ncontinues to be the most abused illegal drug in Iowa. According to this \nreport, nearly two-thirds of all children in substance abuse treatment \nare there for marijuana use. It is reported that these are the highest \nrates of marijuana-using treatment clients in recent Iowa history. The \n2008 Iowa youth survey also shows that over one in four Iowa 11th \ngraders have used marijuana in the past year.\n  It is easy to read these numbers but not fully grasp the magnitude of \nwhat is happening in this country. Dr. Nora Volkow, the director of the \nNational Institute on Drug Abuse, states that the earlier teenagers \nstart using marijuana the greater the risk they will have down the \nroad. Dr. Volkow states, ``Not only does marijuana affect learning, \njudgment, and motor skills, but research tells us that about 1 in 6 \npeople who start using it as adolescents become addicted.'' The more we \nhave young people turning to drugs the more they are putting their \nhealth and futures on the line. Not only do these numbers suggest more \nyoung people are putting themselves at risk, but they also show that \nthe future of the country is at risk. These numbers are completely \nunacceptable and they illustrate that we are failing our kids.\n  How did we get to this point? The National Survey on Drug Use and \nHealth stated that while their findings are disappointing, they were \nnot unexpected. The survey reported that data from the past two years \nhave shown that young people's attitudes about drugs and their risks \nhave been ``softening.'' This means that kids are more and more coming \nto the conclusion that drug use really isn't as bad as it is made out \nto be. The Monitoring the Future Survey also indicates that young \npeople's perceptions on drug use, especially the harms associated with \nmarijuana use, are rapidly moving in a negative direction. The survey \nstates, ``Increases in youth drug use . . . are disappointing, and \nmixed messages about drug legalization--particularly of marijuana--may \nbe contributing to the trend. Such messages only hinder the efforts of \nparents who are trying to prevent their kids from using drugs.'' Dr. \nVolkow also agrees that the debate over legalizing marijuana is \ncontributing to the rising youth drug abuse rates. Dr. Volkow states, \n``We should examine the extent to which the debate over medical \nmarijuana and marijuana legalization for adults is affecting teens' \nperceptions of risk.''\n  The Obama administration also appears to agree with the above \nconclusions. The national drug czar, Gil Kerlikowski, who is Director \nof the Office of National Drug Control Policy states, ``The increases \nin youth drug use . . . are disappointing. And mixed messages about \ndrug legalization, particularly marijuana legalization, may be to \nblame. Such messages certainly don't help parents who are trying to \nprevent young people from using drugs.'' I could not agree more with \nthis statement. However, I can't help but feel that this administration \nis contributing to the problem and not the solution.\n  In October 2009, the Department of Justice issued a memorandum to all \nU.S. attorneys regarding the prosecution of individuals who use or sell \nmarijuana for medical purposes in states that allow it. This new policy \nstates that U.S. attorneys should not expend resources to prosecute \nindividuals who are complying with State laws regarding selling, \npossession, and use of marijuana for medical purposes. These State laws \nare in direct conflict with long existing Federal laws. The memorandum \nalso states that this new policy will not alter the Department's \nauthority to enforce Federal law.\n  This confusing policy attempts to have it both ways. The DOJ is \ntelling U.S. attorneys that they should not prosecute people in States \nthat allow medical marijuana, but the policy does not prevent them from \ndoing so. This policy is a departure from the longstanding DOJ position \nto prosecute individuals who violate Federal law notwithstanding State \nlaw. This policy is ill advised, misguided, and internally \ninconsistent. It also sends the wrong message that this administration \nis deciding which laws it would prefer to enforce rather than upholding \nand aggressively enforcing all existing laws.\n  Unfortunately, the mixed messages don't stop there. Just a few weeks \nago, the Judiciary Committee took up the nomination of Michelle \nLeonhart to be Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. \nFollowing her hearing, I asked a pretty straight forward question, did \nshe support efforts to decriminalize or legalize the use, production, \nor distribution of marijuana, for medical purposes or otherwise. I was \ndisappointed when I received her response that simply stated, ``I \nsupport the Administration in its clear and steadfast opposition to the \nlegalization of marijuana.'' While I agree that the administration \nshould be ``clear and steadfast'' in opposing the legalization of \nmarijuana, her answers did not address the issue of decriminalization. \nIn fact, it took a follow-up letter from me to Ms. Leonhart to clarify \nthis response where she finally stated she was ``concerned with any \nactions that would lead to increased use of abuse and therefore, do[es] \nnot support decriminalizing the cultivation, distribution, and use of \nmarijuana for any purpose other than legitimate research.'' While I \nappreciate this more detailed response, it raises questions as to why \nthis more comprehensive answer wasn't part of her initial response to \nmy question. It is this sort of inconsistent response to simple \nquestions on drug use that is sending mixed messages to minors across \nthe county regarding the legalization and decriminalization of \nmarijuana.\n  We should not be getting mixed messages on marijuana use. The Obama \nadministration should send a strong, unequivocal message to kids that \nmarijuana use is harmful, rather than issuing inconsistent statements \nand new policies that endorse State efforts to legalize marijuana use \nin certain instances.\n  I have long supported a unified, and consistent antidrug message \ncombined with grassroots community efforts to combat drug abuse in all \nforms. Kids need to constantly hear the message that drug use is \nharmful and not safe. They need to hear it from all sectors of the \ncommunity whether it comes from home, school, or anywhere else. That is \nwhy I continually support local community antidrug coalitions. These \ncoalitions are on the front lines in communities and are probably our \nbest weapon in the fight against drug abuse. The people who comprise \nthese coalitions care deeply about their communities and they should be \nsupported in their efforts.\n  If the Obama administration truly believes that the rise in youth \ndrug use is blamed in part on sending mixed messages about marijuana \nthen they need to reconsider their own actions. We need to recognize \nthe importance of sending strong and united messages about marijuana \nand drug use at large. We can start by being consistent with our own \nwords and actions. Perhaps then we may be able to start to reverse the \nrising trends in youth drug use that have occurred since President \nObama took office.\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "YOUTH DRUG USE\n\n\tMr. GRASSLEY.

E. Warren Air Force Base and asked him what he was \ngoing to do for Thanksgiving. The airman guessed he would be spending \nit on the base. The barber, Glen Chavez said, Why don't you have \nThanksgiving with my wife and I? Then Glen decided he better tell his \nwife. When he did she said, ``Glen, I know you. It won't be just one \nand it won't be limited to a dozen. I'll help, but we need to find \nsomeplace bigger than our home.'' So Glen asked the Masonic Lodge if he \ncould use their building. They said yes and Glen with the help of some \nfriends fed 300 people from the base. Yes, the base serves a \nThanksgiving dinner, but it is not the same if you eat it in the same \nmess hall you eat in every day. Chavez said he started the event to \ncombat the loneliness that many members of the military feel when they \nare away from their families during the holidays\n  The dinner was such a success that Glen decided to invite even more \nfor the next year and to have more of the community involved. I am sure \nthere is not a base and city anywhere that has the degree of \ncooperation and concern as Cheyenne and Warren Air Force Base. For \nexample, people from the base help construct Habitat for Humanity \nhomes. The school district built a new school on the base that also has \nkids attend who do not live on the base and have no military \nconnection. The mix benefits everyone. Glen spent the year getting \nready for this event speaking and enlisting the Chamber of Commerce and \nspeaking at Lions, Rotary, and Kiwanis, to name a few.\n  So this year was the Second Annual Salute to our Troops. Steve Sears \nof Cheyenne Stitch donated T-shirts for the volunteers. The fire \ndepartment cooked turkeys. They deep fried seven an hour for the 24 \nhours before the meal. A service club cooked 750 pounds of potatoes and \nmashed them. People from all over the community baked pies and cakes. \nDozens of other volunteers helped out. Businesses donated door prizes. \nOne prize was a 40-inch HD TV. This Thanksgiving they served over 500 \npeople.\n  This year there was publicity to be sure all were invited. Posters \nwent up all over the base and town. Some of that publicity made it to \nthe blogosphere nationally. Glen got calls from 14 States commenting on \nthe good idea and checking to see if they could duplicate it. Many who \ncalled told of personal difficulties, some with tragic endings, that \nthis kind of an event can perhaps prevent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an article about the event \nfrom the Wyoming Tribune Eagle to be printed in the Record. I want to \nthank Glen Chavez, the barber, for his idea and his ability to turn a \ndream into reality. Thanks also to all who made the dinner and \nappreciation of our troops possible.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle, Nov. 13, 2010]\n\n                       Troops Get a Big Thank-You\n\n                           (By Josh Mitchell)\n\n       Cheyenne--Daniel Fletcher with the Army National Guard has \n     two families, and he felt fortunate to be with one of them on \n     Thanksgiving.\n       The family he was with consisted of fellow soldiers and was \n     some 500 members strong.\n       His other family is spread across the United States.\n       As Fletcher sat at a table surrounded by other soldiers at \n     the Masonic Lodge, he reflected on the importance of being \n     with loved ones on Thanksgiving.\n       ``It means quite a bit,'' he said.\n       But Fletcher, 28, would have been alone on Thanksgiving had \n     it not been for the outpouring of support from about 150 \n     volunteers.\n       ``I was going to sit at home and eat a TV dinner,'' \n     Fletcher said.\n       The Second Annual Military Appreciation Free Thanksgiving \n     Dinner hosted by Glen's Barber Shop of Cheyenne is an effort \n     to show the gratitude owed to members of the armed services, \n     organizer Glen Chavez said.\n       As Chavez looked across the dining room at families \n     gathered around tables, he noted, ``This is going to change \n     Thanksgiving forever. Look at how awesome this is.''\n       Chavez said he started the event to combat the loneliness \n     that many members of the military feel when they are away \n     from their families during the holidays.\n       The military serves the United States all year, and Chavez \n     said it feels good to serve the soldiers for one day.\n       The support that Cheyenne shows for the military surprised \n     Fletcher, who is from Poison, Mont. He said when he returned \n     from Iraq he didn't think he would be greeted with much \n     respect, but now he sees that that there is a lot of support \n     for the soldiers.\n       Sue Mattingly is not a member of the military, but she \n     still feels a camaraderie with the local soldiers. Mattingly \n     broke down into tears as she talked about losing her dad this \n     year.\n       After her loss, local soldiers were there for Mattingly, \n     who is a cook at the bowling alley, where many of the \n     soldiers spend time. ``They're like a family to me,'' \n     Mattingly said. ``Even though I'm a civilian, I feel like \n     I've known them all my life.''\n       Being away from family while serving overseas is just part \n     of being a soldier, Greg Wheeler with the Wyoming Air \n     National Guard said.\n       ``It is what it is,'' Wheeler said. ``You don't join the \n     military and expect to be home every holiday.''\n       But Wheeler was fortunate to be sitting at a table with his \n     wife, children, mom and dad this Thanksgiving.\n       Marvin Wolf of Cheyenne remembers spending a Thanksgiving \n     in South Korea during the Korean War.\n       ``We had turkey, shrimp and all the trimmings,'' Wolf said. \n     Wolf agreed that spending Thanksgiving with fellow soldiers \n     is like being with a big family.\n       This Thanksgiving, Wolf said he is thankful for being an \n     American citizen and for all the opportunities that the \n     United States has offered his family.\n       Life is all about love and family, Wolf said. ``That's what \n     brings us together,'' he said.\n       Jennifer Roberts, whose husband is in the Air Force, was \n     enjoying the Thanksgiving meal with her three children. Her \n     husband couldn't attend the dinner because he was scheduled \n     to work on the base in Cheyenne.\n       But having him at the base here was better than a couple of \n     years ago when he was in Iraq over the holidays.\n       Her daughter, Brooke Roberts, 12, said, she is grateful to \n     have her dad home this year.\n       Jennifer Roberts said tears came to her eyes when she \n     arrived at the military Thanksgiving dinner Thursday.\n       ``It makes you feel at home,'' said Roberts, who is from \n     North Carolina.\n       There were over 50 sponsors for the event. U.S. Sen. Mike \n     Enzi, R-Wyo., also made an appearance.\n       Chavez said he wants Enzi to take the idea of the military \n     Thanksgiving dinner back to Washington to make it a national \n     event.\n       Volunteer Terri Clark said, ``It's an honor to serve them. \n     They serve us.

SFMOMA hosts 800,000 visitors annually and boasts the largest member base of any modern or contemporary art museum in the United States. I commend SFMOMA for serving the community superbly for the past 75 years. Audiences have been captivated and inspired by SFMOMA's collections and special exhibitions, and I wish this venerable cultural institution much success in the decades to come.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Barbara Boxer"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "156 Cong.

Mr. President, last weekend the Nation lost Dr. Helen \nMaynor Scheirbeck--a great civil rights leader and a passionate \nadvocate for American Indian rights.\n  Born in Lumberton, NC, as a proud member of the Lumbee Tribe, Dr. \nScheirbeck's passing is a true loss for the Lumbee and the greater \nAmerican Indian community. A champion for American Indian sovereignty, \nDr. Scheirbeck worked constantly throughout her incredibly prolific \ncareer to enable future generations of Indian leaders to build \nhealthier and better-educated communities.\n  In her early work on Capitol Hill, Dr. Scheirbeck served on the staff \nof North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin, then chair of Senate Subcommittee \non Constitutional Rights. This work helped lay the foundation for the \nhistoric 1968 Indian Bill of Rights that extended constitutional rights \nand protections to American Indians nationwide. Similarly, Dr. \nScheirbeck's efforts to organize the 1962 Capitol Conference on Poverty \nhelped to ensure that Indian communities were a focus of the nationwide \nwar on poverty.\n  Her commitment to self-determination and individual responsibility is \nfurther exemplified by Dr. Scheirbeck's work to empower tribal leaders \nto govern and educate their communities. Working on behalf of the \nCarter administration, Dr. Scheirbeck's leadership was instrumental in \nrealigning Federal policies to support Indian sovereignty. Most \nnotably, her efforts helped to ensure the passage of the Indian \nEducation Act of 1975 and the Tribally Controlled Community College \nAssistance Act of 1978, which have enabled Indian leaders to provide \nbetter educational opportunities for current and future generations.\n  Working throughout her life to provide a forum for Indian leaders in \nour Nation's Capital, Dr. Scheirbeck was instrumental in establishing \nthe National Museum of the American Indian. As Assistant Director in \nthe early years of the museum, Dr. Scheirbeck guided the Office of \nEducation and its program in cultural arts. In so doing, she sought to \nbring the experience of the American Indian to the National Mall and to \ndemonstrate the applicability of Indian education models to educators \nthroughout the world.\n  Finally, much of Dr. Scheirbeck's life was devoted to the cause of \nrecognition for the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina. Her life's work \nhelped reverse the Federal Government's efforts to terminate \nrelationships with American Indian tribes. Sadly, though, Dr. \nScheirbeck's own Lumbee Tribe still bears the burden of this \nunfortunate policy, and she fought throughout her life to provide the \nLumbee with the full recognition that they so deserve. While Dr. \nScheirbeck did not live to see this dream become a reality, her life \nand work have helped to sustain the drive for Lumbee recognition for \ndecades.\n  Dr. Helen Maynor Scheirbeck's presence and contributions throughout \nIndian Country are irreplaceable, and her tireless efforts on behalf of \nAmerican Indians throughout the country will continue to inspire future \nIndian leaders for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "REMEMBERING DR.

Greenberg, one of my \nconstituents, who was honored on October 14, 2010, with the Rutgers Law \nSchool Alumni Association Public Service Award. Bill Greenberg has a \nlong association with Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. He \nis a member of the Newark law class of 1967. In 1966, as president of \nthe Student Bar Association, he gave a memorable speech accepting the \nnew law school building on behalf of the student body. He was joined in \nthat ceremony by then-Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren.\n  Following his graduation from Rutgers, he enlisted in the 5th \nSquadron of the 117th Cavalry of the 50th Armored Division, the Jersey \nBlues, and was selected as the outstanding enlisted cavalry trooper of \nthe training cycle while at Fort Knox. Returning to New Jersey, he \nserved as law secretary to Judge Robert A. Matthews, a Rutgers Law \nSchool alumnus, then sitting as a judge of the New Jersey Superior \nCourt, Chancery Division, in Hudson County, and later as presiding \njudge of the Superior Court, Appellate Division.\n  Bill Greenberg began a long and distinguished career as a lawyer, bar \nleader, and soldier, author, public servant, and benefactor with \nMcCarter & English, New Jersey's oldest and largest law firm and one of \nthe region's most respected, where Bill is a senior partner today.\n  Throughout his career, his connection to Rutgers has remained strong, \nas exemplified by his support of the Justice Morris Pashman Scholarship \nFund. He was chosen one of four commissioners of the New Jersey State \nCommission of Investigation by his Rutgers Law classmate, the late Alan \nJ. Karcher, then-speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly. During a \npublic-service leave from McCarter & English, he served as assistant \ncounsel to Gov. Richard J. Hughes, himself a graduate of Rutgers Law \nSchool. He represented the Governor in an important case involving \nsenatorial courtesy before the New Jersey Supreme Court. This was the \nfirst of many important cases Bill Greenberg has argued. He has more \nthan 100 published opinions to his credit. During his more than 40 \nyears of private practice, he has founded his own law firm, served in \nmany public positions, has been a noted litigator and bar association \nleader, as well as an author and benefactor of many educational and \ncharitable institutions.\n  He served as prosecutor of Princeton. He was a commissioner of the \nNew Jersey State Scholarship Commission. He was appointed by the \nSupreme Court of New Jersey to the Mercer County Ethics Committee and \nthe Civil Practice Committee. He also served as a member of the New \nJersey Supreme Court Committee on the admission of foreign attorneys, a \ngroundbreaking effort by the New Jersey Supreme Court to permit Cuban \nlawyers who had emigrated to New Jersey to be permitted to take the bar \nexaminations.\n  He was a trustee of both the New Jersey State Bar Association and the \nNew Jersey State Bar Foundation. He served as chair of the Military Law \nSection of the New Jersey State Bar Association. In addition to holding \nmany offices in the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, New \nJersey--the New Jersey Association for Justice--he served as its \npresident. He is an author and frequent lecturer on many litigation \nmatters, and for over 20 years he has been the author and editor of the \nCivil Trial Handbook, Volume 47 of the New Jersey Practice Series, now \nin its fifth edition.\n  Civic minded and charitable, Bill Greenberg serves as a vice \npresident of the Thanks To Scandinavia Educational and Charitable Trust \nof New York, which gives educational scholarships to recognize the \nefforts made by the Scandinavian countries to save Jews during World \nWar II. He is chairman of the Mary Sachs Charitable Trust in \nHarrisburg, PA, established by his great aunt, which has over the past \n50 years distributed millions of dollars in scholarships and other aid \nto educational and charitable organizations in central Pennsylvania. He \nand his wife, the former Betty Kaufmann Wolf of Pittsburgh, have \nestablished the Dr. Peter Scardino Trust at the Memorial Sloan \nKettering Cancer Center to aid needy cancer patients. In addition, he \nand his wife have established endowed scholarships at Johns Hopkins and \nBrown Universities for needy students and have contributed \nsubstantially to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.\n  He recently received the Distinguished Alumnus Award from Johns \nHopkins and serves on its undergraduate advisory board. In December \n2009, he was selected Lawyer of the Year by the New Jersey Law Journal, \nthe leading law publication of record in our State. This year, he \nreceived the Major General Howard Louderback Award for lifetime service \nfrom the New Jersey Committee of the Department of Defense Committee \nfor Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve.\n  I was pleased to recommend Bill Greenberg to the White House to be \nChairman of the Reserve Forces Policy Board. He was selected by \nSecretary Gates for that important position in August 2009 and \nreappointed in August 2010. This board, created by Congress in 1952, is \nthe principal policy adviser to the Secretary of Defense for Reserve \ncomponent matters. I was pleased to make this recommendation because of \nGeneral Greenberg's background of 27 years of military service in the \nReserve components as an enlisted cavalry trooper, a member of the \nJudge Advocate General's Corps, and as a flag officer. More \nimportantly, he established the Military Legal Assistance Program of \nthe New Jersey State Bar Association for wounded or injured reservists \ncalled to duty after September 11, 2001.

Mr. President, small businesses are the engine of \nour economy. There are literally millions of unique stories about how \nthese companies had developed since they opened their doors. Some of \nthe most impressive businesses are family-owned entities that start \nwith a handful of workers and a commitment to filling a niche in their \ncity or town. Today I recognize Agren Appliance, a company that started \nwith the basics and has blossomed into a familiar name to residents of \nLewiston-Auburn, ME, for over 40 years.\n  The Agren family began serving the community in 1969, when they \noperated two repair trucks to fix appliances for families and \nindividuals throughout the greater Lewiston-Auburn area. Their only \ntechnology was a rotary telephone to receive calls from those requiring \nassistance. Over time, the family developed a reputation for its \nreliability, gaining regular customers and parlaying that recognition \ninto future success.\n  As a result of its strong and growing standing, Agren opened its \nfirst brick-and-mortar store in Auburn in 1978, carrying the Whirlpool \nbrand of products. Over time, the company further expanded its reach, \nopening branches in the coastal town of Brunswick in 1983, as well as \nsouth Paris, in western Maine, in 1986.

Mr. President, small businesses are the engine of our economy. There are literally millions of unique stories about how these companies had developed since they opened their doors. Some of the most impressive businesses are family-owned entities that start with a handful of workers and a commitment to filling a niche in their city or town. Today I recognize Agren Appliance, a company that started with the basics and has blossomed into a familiar name to residents of Lewiston-Auburn, ME, for over 40 years.\n\tThe Agren family began serving the community in 1969, when they operated two repair trucks to fix appliances for families and individuals throughout the greater Lewiston-Auburn area. Their only technology was a rotary telephone to receive calls from those requiring assistance. Over time, the family developed a reputation for its reliability, gaining regular customers and parlaying that recognition into future success.\n\tAs a result of its strong and growing standing, Agren opened its first brick-and-mortar store in Auburn in 1978, carrying the Whirlpool brand of products. Over time, the company further expanded its reach, opening branches in the coastal town of Brunswick in 1983, as well as south Paris, in western Maine, in 1986. Later, Agren Appliance opened stores in south Portland and midcoast Maine, covering a large swath of the State's population. And on Monday, Agren Appliance moved from its former south Paris location to a newer, larger, 25,000-square-foot space in the neighboring town of Norway. The company has been recognized as one of the Nation's top 100 appliance retailers, an impressive feat in such a competitive market.\n\tAgren now offers its customers a variety of products and brands--including televisions, beds, mattresses, and dining room sets. Nonetheless, each store is still a one-stop shop for all appliance needs, from dishwashers and refrigerators, to laundry machines and dryers. And the business stays true to its roots, boasting Maine's largest independent appliance repair team, as well as a fleet of repair trucks.\n\tFurthermore, Agren Appliance is still family-owned and remains an integral part of the communities which it serves. The company frequently makes donations to organizations across the State, often providing gift certificates or various small appliances for silent auctions to benefit those in need. Additionally, at certain locations, Agren posts messages on their large electronic outdoor signs, advertising upcoming events and fundraising efforts from various members of the community--a generous act that helps promote worthwhile occasions and causes.\n\tWith five stores spread across the southern part of the State, Agren has developed from a small-town appliance repair business into a trusted name for appliance and furniture needs. I am always impressed by the ingenuity of small businesses like Agren, which has witnessed marked growth because of a strong work ethic and dedication to knowing and serving the community.

A bill to restore the law governing pleading and pleading \nmotions that existed before the decisions of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), and \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2009); to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, last year I introduced the Notice \nPleading Restoration Act of 2009, H.R. 1504. As I explained in my \naccompanying floor statement, my objective was to restore the pleading \nstandard that had governed federal civil practice if not since the \nFederal Rules of Procedure originally took effect in 1938, then at very \nleast since the Supreme Court decided Conley v. Gibson in 1957. Several \nmonths earlier the Supreme Court had issued the second of two \ncontroversial decisions--Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 2007, and \nIqbal v. Ashcroft, 2009--in which it had replaced that standard with a \nheightened pleading standard that, not least among its several flaws, \nwas plainly inconsistent with the original meaning of the Federal \nRules. My concern was not only that the Court had closed the courthouse \ndoors to plaintiffs with meritorious claims and limited the private \nenforcement of public law, but also that, in yet another of its recent \nincursions on Congress's lawmaking powers, it had end-run the process \nfor amending the Rules established by the Rules Enabling Act of 1934. \nThat process includes, as its last step, Congressional approval of any \namendment.\n  While there was widespread agreement among the country's leading \nacademic proceduralists on the need for legislation overruling the \nCourt's decisions, there was much less agreement among them as to what, \nexactly, the\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\nlegislation should say. I chose in S. 1504 to incorporate the pleading \nstandard set forth in Conley. A companion House bill introduced after \nS. 1504, H.R. 4115, took a somewhat different approach. Various \ncommentators proposed yet other approaches.\n  After a hearing on the legislation before the Judiciary Committee, I \nconsulted through my general counsel, Matthew L. Wiener, with leading \nacademic proceduralists and several distinguished practicing lawyers \nwith an eye toward offering a possible substitute amendment. The \nconclusion I soon drew was that Congress must indeed overrule Twombly \nand Iqbal but without (as the Court had done) prescribing a pleading \nstandard outside the rulemaking process established by the Enabling \nAct. The best way to do so, I concluded, was simply to draft \nlegislation requiring adherence to the Supreme Court's pre-Twombly \ndecisions interpreting the applicable federal rules unless and until \nthey are amended in accordance with the Enabling Act. The bill I have \nintroduced today, the Notice Pleading Restoration Act of 2010, takes \njust that approach. I urge the next Congress to take up this bill when \nit convenes in January.\n  For their wise counsel in helping me work through the issues \npresented by the legislation, I would like to acknowledge and thank the \nfollowing lawyers, most of them professors of civil procedure: Allen D. \nBlack, a partner at Fine, Kaplan & Black, R.P.C.; John S.

Res. 78\n\n       Whereas President Clinton, with the approval of Congress \n     and the bipartisan support of congressional sponsors, \n     representing the States of the Delta in both the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate, launched the Delta Regional \n     Authority on December 21, 2000, in an effort to alleviate the \n     economic hardship facing the Delta region and to create a \n     more level playing field for the counties and parishes of \n     such States to compete for jobs and investment;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority is a Federal-State \n     partnership that serves 252 counties and parishes in parts of \n     Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee;\n       Whereas the Delta region holds great promise for access and \n     trade, as the region borders the world's greatest \n     transportation arterial in the Mississippi River;\n       Whereas the Delta boasts a strong cultural heritage as the \n     birthplace of the blues and jazz music and as home to world \n     famous cuisine, which people throughout the United States and \n     the world identify with the region;\n       Whereas the counties and parishes served by the Delta \n     Regional Authority constitute an economically-distressed area \n     facing challenges such as undeveloped infrastructure systems, \n     insufficient transportation options, struggling education \n     systems, migration out of the region, substandard health \n     care, and the needs to develop, recruit, and retain a \n     qualified workforce and to build strong communities that \n     attract new industries and employment opportunities;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has made significant \n     progress toward addressing such challenges during its first \n     10 years of work;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority operates a highly \n     successful grant program in each of the 8 States it serves, \n     allowing cities, counties, and parishes to leverage money \n     from other Federal agencies and private investors;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has invested nearly \n     $86,200,000 into more than 600 projects during the first \n     decade of existence, leveraging $1,400,000,000 in private \n     sector investment and producing an overall 22 to 1 return on \n     taxpayer dollars;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority is working with \n     partners to create or retain approximately 19,000 jobs and is \n     bringing the critical infrastructure to sustain new water and \n     sewer services for more than 43,000 families;\n       Whereas an independent report from the Department of \n     Agriculture's Economic Research Service found that per capita \n     income \n     grew more rapidly in counties and parishes where the Delta \n     Regional Authority had the greatest investment, showing that \n     each additional dollar of Delta Regional Authority's per \n     capita spending results in a $15 increase in personal income;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has developed a \n     culture of transparency, passing 9 independent audits showing \n     tangible results;\n       Whereas during its first 10 years, the Delta Regional \n     Authority has laid a strong foundation for working with State \n     Governors, Federal partners, community leaders, and private \n     sector investors to capitalize on the region's strong points \n     and serve as an economic multiplier for the 8-State region, \n     helping communities tackle challenges and cultivating a \n     climate conducive to job creation;\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has expanded its \n     regional initiatives in the areas of health care, \n     transportation, leadership training, and information \n     technology, and is also increasing efforts in the areas of \n     small business development, entrepreneurship, and alternative \n     energy jobs; and\n       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority stands prepared to use \n     the groundwork established during its first decade as a \n     springboard to create new opportunities for Delta communities \n     in the future: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 10th anniversary of the founding of the \n     Delta Regional Authority; and\n       (2) honors and celebrates the Delta Regional Authority's \n     first decade of work to improve the economy and well-being of \n     the 8-State Delta region, and the promise of the Delta \n     Regional Authority's continued work in the future.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Evan Bayh"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "156 Cong.

Con. Res. 71\n\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the Holocaust, the \n     international community vowed ``never again'' to allow \n     systematic killings on the basis of nationality, ethnicity, \n     race, or religion;\n       Whereas a number of other genocides and mass atrocities \n     have occurred, both prior to and since that time;\n       Whereas the United States Government has undertaken many \n     initiatives to ensure that victims of genocide and mass \n     atrocities are not forgotten, and as a leader in the \n     international community, the United States has committed to \n     work with international partners to help to prevent genocide \n     and mass atrocities and to help protect civilian populations \n     at risk of such;\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly adopted the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide in 1948, which declares genocide, whether committed \n     in a time of peace or in a time of war, a crime under \n     international law, and declares that the parties to the \n     Convention will undertake to prevent and to punish that \n     crime;\n       Whereas the United States was the first nation to sign the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide, and the Senate voted to ratify the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on \n     February 11, 1986;\n       Whereas the Act entitled, ``An Act to establish the United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Council'', approved October 7, 1980 \n     (Public Law 96-388), established the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Council to commemorate the Holocaust, establish a \n     memorial museum to the victims, and develop a committee to \n     stimulate worldwide action to prevent or stop future \n     genocides;\n       Whereas the passage of the Genocide Convention \n     Implementation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-606), also known \n     as the Proxmire Act, made genocide a crime under United \n     States law;\n       Whereas in response to lessons learned from Rwanda and \n     Bosnia, President William J.

It is a moral imperative that states take \n     action to prevent and punish genocide. . . .

Looking ahead over the next 5 years, a number of \n     countries in Africa and Asia are at significant risk for a \n     new outbreak of mass killing.'';\n       Whereas the Quadrennial Defense Review, released in \n     February 2010, states that the Defense Department should be \n     prepared to provide the President with options for \n     ``preventing human suffering due to mass atrocities or large-\n     scale natural disasters abroad'';\n       Whereas the 2010 National Security Strategy notes, ``The \n     United States is committed to working with our allies, and to \n     strengthening our own internal capabilities, in order to \n     ensure that the United States and the international community \n     are proactively engaged in a strategic effort to prevent mass \n     atrocities and genocide. In the event that prevention fails, \n     the United States will work both multilaterally and \n     bilaterally to mobilize diplomatic, humanitarian, financial, \n     and--in certain instances--military means to prevent and \n     respond to genocide and mass atrocities.'';\n       Whereas genocide and mass atrocities often result from and \n     contribute to instability and conflict, which can cross \n     borders and exacerbate threats to international security and \n     the national security of the United States;\n       Whereas the failure to prevent genocide and mass atrocities \n     can lead to significant costs resulting from regional \n     instability, refugee flows, peacekeeping, economic loss, and \n     the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction and \n     reconciliation; and\n       Whereas United States leadership and actions toward \n     preventing and mitigating future genocides and mass \n     atrocities can save human lives and help foster beneficial \n     global partnerships: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Senate--\n       (1) recommits to honor the memory of the victims of the \n     Holocaust as well as the victims of all past genocides and \n     mass atrocities;\n       (2) affirms that it is in the national interest and aligned \n     with the values of the United States to work vigorously with \n     international partners to prevent and mitigate future \n     genocides and mass atrocities;\n\n[[Page S11057]]\n\n       (3) supports the establishment of an interagency policy \n     committee and a National Security Council position dedicated \n     to the prevention of genocide and other mass atrocities;\n       (4) urges the President--\n       (A) to direct relevant departments and agencies of the \n     United States Government to review and evaluate existing \n     capacities for anticipating, preventing, and responding to \n     genocide and other mass atrocities, and to determine specific \n     steps to coordinate and enhance those capacities;

Looking ahead over the next 5 years, a number of \n     countries in Africa and Asia are at significant risk for a \n     new outbreak of mass killing.'';\n       Whereas the Quadrennial Defense Review, released in \n     February 2010, states that the Defense Department should be \n     prepared to provide the President with options for \n     ``preventing human suffering due to mass atrocities or large-\n     scale natural disasters abroad'';\n       Whereas the 2010 National Security Strategy notes, ``The \n     United States is committed to working with our allies, and to \n     strengthening our own internal capabilities, in order to \n     ensure that the United States and the international community \n     are proactively engaged in a strategic effort to prevent mass \n     atrocities and genocide. In the event that prevention fails, \n     the United States will work both multilaterally and \n     bilaterally to mobilize diplomatic, humanitarian, financial, \n     and--in certain instances--military means to prevent and \n     respond to genocide and mass atrocities.'';\n       Whereas genocide and mass atrocities often result from and \n     contribute to instability and conflict, which can cross \n     borders and exacerbate threats to international security and \n     the national security of the United States;\n       Whereas the failure to prevent genocide and mass atrocities \n     can lead to significant costs resulting from regional \n     instability, refugee flows, peacekeeping, economic loss, and \n     the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction and \n     reconciliation; and\n       Whereas United States leadership and actions toward \n     preventing and mitigating future genocides and mass \n     atrocities can save human lives and help foster beneficial \n     global partnerships: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), [That the Senate--\n       [(1) recommits to honor the memory of the victims of the \n     Holocaust as well as the victims of all past genocides and \n     mass atrocities;\n       [(2) affirms that it is in the national interest and \n     aligned with the values of the United States to work \n     vigorously with international partners to prevent and \n     mitigate future genocides and mass atrocities;\n       [(3) supports efforts made thus far by the President, the \n     Secretary of State, the Administrator of the United States \n     Agency for International Development, the Secretary of \n     Defense, and the Director of National Intelligence to improve \n     the capacity of the United States Government to anticipate, \n     prevent, and address genocide and mass atrocities, including \n     the establishment of an interagency policy committee and a \n     National Security Council position dedicated to the \n     prevention of genocide and other mass atrocities;\n       [(4) urges the President--\n       [(A) to direct relevant departments and agencies of the \n     United States Government to review and evaluate existing \n     capacities for anticipating, preventing, and responding to \n     genocide and other mass atrocities, and to determine specific \n     steps to coordinate and enhance those capacities;

Con. Res. 71\n\n       Whereas in the aftermath of the Holocaust, the \n     international community vowed ``never again'' to allow \n     systematic killings on the basis of nationality, ethnicity, \n     race, or religion;\n       Whereas a number of other genocides and mass atrocities \n     have occurred, both prior to and since that time;\n       Whereas the United States Government has undertaken many \n     initiatives to ensure that victims of genocide and mass \n     atrocities are not forgotten, and as a leader in the \n     international community, the United States has committed to \n     work with international partners to help to prevent genocide \n     and mass atrocities and to help protect civilian populations \n     at risk of such;\n       Whereas the United Nations General Assembly adopted the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide in 1948, which declares genocide, whether committed \n     in a time of peace or in a time of war, a crime under \n     international law, and declares that the parties to the \n     Convention will undertake to prevent and to punish that \n     crime;\n       Whereas the United States was the first nation to sign the \n     Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \n     Genocide, and the Senate voted to ratify the Convention on \n     the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide on \n     February 11, 1986;\n       Whereas the Act entitled, ``An Act to establish the United \n     States Holocaust Memorial Council'', approved October 7, 1980 \n     (Public Law 96-388), established the United States Holocaust \n     Memorial Council to commemorate the Holocaust, establish a \n     memorial museum to the victims, and develop a committee to \n     stimulate worldwide action to prevent or stop future \n     genocides;\n       Whereas the passage of the Genocide Convention \n     Implementation Act of 1987 (Public Law 100-606), also known \n     as the Proxmire Act, made genocide a crime under United \n     States law;\n       Whereas in response to lessons learned from Rwanda and \n     Bosnia, President William J.

Res. 432\n\n       Whereas millions of people around the world struggle each \n     year for life and breath due to lung diseases, including \n     tuberculosis, asthma, pneumonia, influenza, lung cancer and \n     chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary \n     fibrosis, and more than 8,100,000 die each year;\n       Whereas lung diseases afflict people in every country and \n     every socioeconomic group, but take the heaviest toll on the \n     poor, children, the elderly, and the weak;\n       Whereas lung disease is a serious public health problem in \n     the United States that affects adults and children of every \n     age and race;\n       Whereas lower respiratory diseases are the fourth leading \n     cause of death in the United States;\n       Whereas the economic cost of lung diseases is expected to \n     be $177,000,000,000 in 2009, including $114,000,000,000 in \n     direct health expenditures and $64,000,000,000 in indirect \n     morbidity and mortality costs;\n       Whereas nearly half of the world's population lives in or \n     near areas with poor air quality, which significantly \n     increases the incidence of lung diseases such as asthma and \n     COPD, and more than 2,000,000 people die prematurely due to \n     indoor and outdoor air pollution;\n       Whereas tuberculosis, an airborne infection that attacks \n     the lungs and other major organs, is a leading global \n     infectious disease;\n       Whereas no new drugs have been developed for tuberculosis \n     in more than 5 decades and the only vaccine is nearly a

and other major organs, is a leading global \n     infectious disease;\n       Whereas no new drugs have been developed for tuberculosis \n     in more than 5 decades and the only vaccine is nearly a

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 707, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 707) honoring Lula Davis.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, every working body needs a strong heart to \nfunction. This legislative body, the Senate, is no different. For many \nyears--as long as I have been in the Senate, and that is a while--Lula \nDavis has been the heart of the Senate.\n  In 1997, when we elected her as assistant Democratic secretary, she \nwas the first woman to hold that position. Before the 111th Congress, \nwe elected her to be the secretary of the majority--the first African \nAmerican in that role. Over the last 2 years, she has expertly tackled \none of the toughest jobs anywhere in politics.\n  More importantly, the last 2 years have also seen the debate and \npassage of some of the most historic legislation in the entire history \nof the country--laws to protect Americans from health insurance \ncompanies, from Wall Street banks, from credit card companies, from \ntobacco companies, from mortgage fraudsters, from unsafe food, from \ndiscrimination, from inequality, and so, so much more.\n  Any one of these bills by itself would define a session of Congress. \nWe did all of them in just the last 2 years, and we could not have done \nany of it without Lula Davis's leadership.\n  Lula has come a long way since her days as a teacher and guidance \ncounselor, and even further from her time in rural Louisiana. She \nstarted her Senate career as a legislative aide to her home State \nSenator, the legendary Russell Long, and went on to serve in almost \nevery position on the floor staff: office assistant, floor assistant, \nchief floor assistant, assistant secretary, and secretary.\n  Anyone who has watched the Senate knows it is not always an easy \nplace to understand, and I am an expert on how hard it is to understand \nit. Anyone who has studied this institution, its idiosyncrasies and \nintricacies knows it can be extremely baffling. But Lula knows this \nplace inside and out like no one else. She is fluent in the rhythms of \nthe Senate. She knows and respects its complex rules, both formal and \ninformal. Her counsel, as a result, has always been thoughtful and \nreliable to every one of us.\n  She is loyal to the Senate and to its Senators, and she respects the \ntraditions that make this body great--which is why, in return, this \nbody has great respect for her and her hard work.\n\n[[Page S11059]]\n\n  Lula has spent her Senate career behind the scenes not just helping \nSenators do our jobs but also quietly helping young people, the hungry, \nand those in need. As tough and hard as Lula must be here on the Senate \nfloor, she has a heart of gold.\n  She founded and runs a nonprofit called Leadership Cares, which each \nyear helps children in our community provide quality meals to more than \n650 families. She has encouraged many of her fellow Senate staffers to \njoin her family and friends and volunteer to help. She has never asked \nfor any recognition for this work or any of her work because that is \nthe kind of person she is. But Lula deserves our praise and thanks for \nso much more.\n  Senator Landrieu of Louisiana likes to tell a story about how much a \npart of the Senate Lula really is, how great an institution our \noutgoing secretary of the majority is. Senator Landrieu once asked a \ngroup of Senate pages if they had had a chance to meet the Senate \nleaders. They said: Yes. They had met Lula.\n  Lula Davis has been the heart of the Senate, and our appreciation for \nher is heartfelt. I speak for each Senator, Democrats and Republicans.\n  For me, personally, Lula has been strong, resolute, and very wise. \nWords cannot describe how I will miss Lula Davis. She has been \nindispensable and she is irreplaceable.\n  On behalf of every Senator, I thank Lula for her years of service to \nour caucus and for her more than 25 years of service to the Senate and \nthe United States of America.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise this evening to acknowledge \nthe retirement of Lula Davis, in appreciation of her dedication to the \nSenate and her many years of service to this institution. Lula has been \na force in every legislative effort we have engaged in since my tenure \nas Republican leader began, and long before that. I have come to \nrespect her deep knowledge of the Senate rules and the important role \nshe has played in advising Democratic Senators over the past 2 years. \nShe is a constant presence on the floor and an important part of Senate \nlife. We congratulate her on her professional success, from her days as \na school teacher to her work on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and we \nwish her every happiness in the years ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, before I make a statement on another \nissue, I join the majority leader in his comments about the retirement \nof Lula Johnson Davis from the Senate.\n  Before I came to the Senate, I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives for 14 years, and I greatly enjoyed that experience. It \nwas certainly an amazing change to come from the House to the Senate, \nto move from one congressional district to representing the entire \nState, to move from a 2-year term to a 6-year term, to move from 434 \ncolleagues to 99 fellow colleagues. All of these things took some \ngetting used to, plus the fact that, in the House, you were constricted \non the use of time for speeches on the floor, and in the Senate, there \nis almost no limit. If you want to speak forever, I think the Senate \nrules will accommodate you.\n  Those changes all pale in comparison to the single biggest change I \nran into here, and that was facing the secretary to the majority, Lula \nJohnson Davis. I knew that people throughout Capitol Hill on both the \nHouse and Senate sides at the staff level were extremely courteous, \nkind, and helpful. I found that throughout my career in the House, and \nI certainly found it in the Senate. But the good thing about Lula Davis \nwas that she was respectful of Senators, but not deferential. She would \nbe happy to tell you when she thought you had stepped out of line in \nwhat you were wearing, and what you were chewing, and what you might be \nusing your microphone for, your conversations on the floor, and on and \non. She did this in a way that first startled me, because I wasn't used \nto it in the House. There was nobody like Lula in the House of \nRepresentatives to keep you in line. She did it, and I came to not only \nlike it but respect it so much, because I knew she was doing it not in \nany personal way but because of her love for the Senate.\n  They do a Roll Call survey about the most powerful staffers on \nCapitol Hill, and they rate them in four ways: know-how, muscle, spin \ncontrol, and access. Lula always received the highest check marks in \nevery category but one--spin control. That is about right. Lula Davis \nwas never one to mince words in her role as secretary to the majority \nof the Senate. Tough, fair, insisting on the strict observance of \nSenate rules and protocols, she reflected love for this institution in \nall that she did for us.\n  The National Journal described her as ``an internally legendary \nstaffer.'' That is true. In the 221-year history of the Senate, Lula \nDavis is only the second woman--and the first African American--ever to \nhold the position of secretary to the majority.\n  Her loyalty and devotion to this Senate are unmatched. She was the \nfirst one here in the morning and the last one to leave at night.\n  I know I speak for all Senators from the Democratic side and the \nRepublican side, as well, in saying she is going to be missed. Unlike \nmany, Lula Davis did not move to Washington to get involved in \npolitics. She started her career as a high school teacher and guidance \ncounselor. A friend told Lula about an opening in the office of her \nhome State Senator, Russell Long, of Louisiana. She started her Hill \ncareer at the bottom, as a legislative correspondent, answering mail.\n  When Senator Long retired in 1989, Lula moved to the Democratic floor \nstaff and worked her way up from the lowliest assistant position to \nbecome secretary to the majority.\n  As many hours as Lula devoted to the Senate, it is hard to believe \nthat she had time for anything else. But she founded an organization \ncalled LeadershipCares, which tries to guide young people into \nsuccessful lives by helping others who are less fortunate. Almost every \nclass of pages on the Democratic side would tell a story about Lula, \nbecause she became not only their boss but their friend. She taught \nthem a lot about life in their life experience here in the Senate.\n  I join my colleagues in wishing Lula the very best of luck as she \nbegins the next chapter in life.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, although I don't have anything written, \nI was listening to the leader speak and the whip talk about Lula Davis \nand all she has done here in the Senate. I, too, wish to pay my \nrespects and give my thanks and my best wishes to Lula Davis as she \nleaves the Senate.\n  For 30 years, she has been a loyal, hard-working, passionate advocate \nfor the people of this country in an unelected role--a role that \nrequired her to make sure the business of the Senate was conducted. I \nknow of no one who knows the rules and how things work and how things \nshould go better than Lula Davis. At times, she knew everything, it \nseemed to me. Many times, we would go to her because we would have a \nbill on the floor and we would have something that would get tied up. I \nwould be managing a bill, and things would get into a big ball of wax \nsometimes or seem like a big ball of string and you had to figure out \nhow to unwind it. I would always go to Lula Davis and say: OK, how do \nwe get out of this mess? We have an amendment on an amendment and a \nmotion to recommit and all these things piled up. And she always knew \nhow to do it. She always knew how to make sure the place would run.\n  If you ever needed advice on how to do something or accomplish \nsomething, you could go to her. Of course, sometimes she would give you \nadvice you didn't want to hear. Sometimes you wanted to do something, \nand she had to be the person to say: Well, the rules just won't allow \nyou to do that. So there were times I would get frustrated, and I would \nsay: But I want to do this; this is for the good of the country. And \nLula Davis would say: Well, Senator, you are just going to have to find \nsome other way to do it.\n  So that is just my way to pay respect to a person who devoted so much \nof her life to this Senate. A lot of times, we find ourselves here late \nat night, and once in a while, I would think I was the last person to \nleave, but Lula was always the last person to leave and always the \nperson--if you came in early in the day, she was the first person here. \nSo she has really been such an integral part of the Senate, the Senate \nfloor is going to have a vacancy without her in the future.\n  So to Lula Davis, I say: Thank you for so many years of friendship \nand\n\n[[Page S11060]]\n\nloyalty and hard work in helping to make the Senate a more efficient, \ncompatible working environment.\n  I thank Lula Davis, and I wish her the best in her retirement. I hope \nshe doesn't get too far away from the Senate and that she comes back to \nsee us once in a while to help us untangle that ball of string, as I am \nsure it is bound to become tangled again sometime.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand that any statements relating to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 707) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 707\n\n       Whereas Lula Davis, the Secretary for the Majority, will be \n     retiring at the end of the 111th Congress, after a long and \n     distinguished career;\n       Whereas Lula Davis was first elected as Assistant \n     Democratic Secretary in 1997, and she was the first woman \n     ever to hold that position;\n       Whereas Lula Davis was elected to be the Secretary for the \n     Majority at the beginning of the 111th Congress, the first \n     African American to serve in this position, and during the \n     111th Congress she has expertly tackled one of the toughest \n     jobs in politics;\n       Whereas throughout her time in the Senate, Lula Davis has \n     played a major role in managing the debate and passage of \n     many significant pieces of legislation;\n       Whereas many legislative accomplishments over the years \n     would not have happened without the leadership of Lula Davis;\n       Whereas Lula Davis lived in rural Louisiana, and worked as \n     a teacher and guidance counselor;\n       Whereas Lula Davis remains committed to children in our \n     community, founding and continuing to run a nonprofit \n     mentoring and charitable organization called ``Leadership \n     Cares,'' which provides holiday meals to more than 650 \n     families annually;\n       Whereas Lula Davis has encouraged many of her fellow Senate \n     staff to volunteer alongside her family and friends to make a \n     difference for those in need;\n       Whereas Lula Davis started her Senate career as a \n     legislative aide to her home-state Senator, Russell Long, and \n     went on to serve in almost every position on the floor staff, \n     including office assistant, floor assistant, chief floor \n     assistant, Assistant Secretary, and Secretary;\n       Whereas Lula Davis is a master of the complex formal and \n     informal rules under which the Senate operates;\n       Whereas Lula Davis has consistently provided thoughtful and \n     reliable advice to both Democratic and Republican leadership \n     and all members of the Senate;\n       Whereas Lula Davis is loyal to the Senate and to Senators, \n     and respects the traditions that make this body great;\n       Whereas the Senate has tremendous respect for Lula Davis \n     and her hard work, and deeply appreciates her enormous \n     contributions to the Senate and to the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate expresses its deepest thanks to \n     Lula Davis for her many years of outstanding service to the \n     United States Senate and to the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "HONORING LULA DAVIS\n\n\tMr. BAYH.

Madam President, when we convened this Congress in January \n2009, 750,000 Americans were losing their jobs every month. Soon after \nthis Congress began, an auto industry nearly imploded, and within a \nyear an oil well exploded. It was a tough 2 years for our Nation and \nfor so many families. It was also a time of remarkable progress.\n  When this Congress began, insurance companies were free to deny \nhealth care to the sick for any excuse they could come up with. The \ndoughnut hole that sent seniors' prescription drug costs through the \nroof was wide open. Wall Street firms had just crashed our economy, but \nthey were still free to rip off investors while the Nation smoldered.\n  Cigarette companies could prey on children, credit card companies \ncould prey on consumers, and con artists could prey on families' \nmortgages.\n  Employers were free to pay women less than men, the safety of our \nfood supply was dangerously inadequate, and the definition of a hate \ncrime was shamefully insufficient. Gay men and women who volunteered to \ndefend and die for our country were asked to fight and die for values \nand principles they didn't have for themselves in America.\n  More than a year has passed since American inspectors were on the \nground to monitor the Russian nuclear weapons arsenal.\n  We have turned each of these around. Because of what we did in this \nCongress, we brought the economy back from the brink of collapse, we \ncut taxes for 95 percent of Americans, we invested in important job-\ncreating projects, and we will keep working until everyone who wants to \nwork can find a job.\n  Because of what we did, families are safer from health insurance \ncompanies. Our economy and its investors are safer from big banks. \nConsumers are safer from credit card companies, homeowners are safer \nfrom mortgage fraud, and all of us are safer from corporate fraud.\n  Parents can know their children are safer from cigarette companies, \nthanks to legislation we passed that will save\n\n[[Page S11061]]\n\nlives. Our food safety protections will save countless more lives.\n  We also made historic strides for equality and justice. With a hate \ncrimes bill that bears Emmitt Till's name, we stood up for those who \nare victims of violence because of their race, ethnicity, or sexual \norientation. With a fair pay bill in Lilly Ledbetter's name, we stood \nup for those who are targets of discrimination in the workplace because \nof their gender or background. And we made right a wrong done long ago \nto African Americans and American Indian farmers.\n  Because we repealed don't ask, don't tell, our military is stronger \nand we can still fulfill our Nation's promise. And because we ratified \nthe START treaty today, America and the world are safer from nuclear \ndevastation.\n  These are just the ones that got the biggest headlines. The 111th \nCongress did much more.\n  We cut taxes for the middle class and small business multiple times. \nWe made it easier for families to buy their first home. We made it \neasier for students to afford to go to college, and strengthened our \ncommitment to research, math and science education, technological \ninnovation, and maintaining this country's competitive edge. We made \nsure children can afford to get the health care they need no matter how \nmuch money their parents make, and made sure even more schoolchildren \nwho would otherwise go hungry can get healthier meals.\n  We extended unemployment insurance for millions still struggling to \nfind a job and extended COBRA subsidies so those still struggling to \nfind work can feed their families, fuel our economy and afford decent \nmedical care. We strengthened Medicaid and made sure doctors can still \nafford to treat seniors on Medicare. We helped hundreds of thousands \nafford more fuel-efficient cars and trucks.\n  With a national service bill named for Senator Ted Kennedy, we made \nit easier for more Americans to serve their country, like our heroes of \ngenerations past. With one of the most important conservation bills in \ndecades, we protected our public lands for generations to come. We cut \nwaste and fraud in the way the Pentagon purchases military weapons. We \nmade sure our troops have the equipment they need on the battlefield \nand that our veterans have the care they need when they come home. We \ngave everyone in the military a well-deserved pay raise.\n  We secured our borders with guards, fencing, and predator drones. We \nimposed sanctions on Iran to deter this regime from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon. We thawed our credit markets so Americans can get the loans \nthey need to buy a car, send a child to college, or even start a new \nbusiness. We supported the travel and tourism industries, which will \ncreate tens of thousands of jobs and cut our deficit by hundreds of \nmillions of dollars.\n  We confirmed many well-qualified nominees for positions in public \nservice and on the bench, including the third and fourth women--and the \nfirst ever Latina--to serve on our Supreme Court.\n  We began this Congress with the challenge of keeping our economy from \na second Great Depression. We are not all the way out of the ditch yet. \nWe have come a long way since President Bush's Treasury Secretary sat \ndown with us and warned us of the dire stakes of inaction.\n  In 2011, we have to do even more to put middle-class families first, \nto create jobs and cut taxes. We will continue to move America toward \nenergy independence. We will continue to fight to fix our broken \nimmigration system. And we will continue fighting for fairness--\nincluding giving our first responders the same workplace rights \neveryone else has.\n  This was, by far, the most productive Congress in American history. \nAnd the lameduck session we are finishing was the most productive of \nits kind. Why? Because we heard the message the American people sent us \nlast month. They do not want us to sit around and waste our time. They \nwant us to work together and work for them. They want us to get things \ndone.\n  We have been productive beyond any historical measure. But we cannot \nforget the context: We have had to do more with less--passing some of \nthe most major pieces of legislation in history with the least \nbipartisan cooperation in history. I am sorry the minority party \ndecided to sit on the sidelines. I know the history books will remember \nwho was on the field.\n  I thank every Senator and every staffer who has worked so hard. They \nhave worked so tirelessly over these past 2 years. The distance we took \nAmerica from January 2009 to December 2010 is one of the most \nremarkable times in the history of the world and our country.\n  I am very proud of the work this Congress did, and I sincerely hope \nthat, despite a divided Capitol, the 112th Congress will surpass only \nits record for significant legislation and not those for endless \nstalemates.\n  I want to express my appreciation to this wonderful staff we have \nhere. They work so very, very hard. They are here before we arrive in \nthe morning, they are here after we leave, and I am grateful for all \nthey do.\n  The court reporters are here taking down every word that we say--very \nprofessional. The enrollment clerks. Everybody who is here. The \nParliamentarians, whom we go to often to tell us the hole we are in and \nhow to get out of it.\n  I am grateful for everyone here for putting up with me and the hours \nI feel we have to work with never a complaint. I wish I had the ability \nto convey what is in my heart--and I certainly don't have the ability \nto do that--but I want everyone here to know that I am very grateful \nfor everyone here working in such a wonderful manner for our country.\n  I say to each one of you--I went through a long list of things we \nhave been able to accomplish--we couldn't have done any of this without \nyou. As much as I know about the rules, and I know quite a bit about \nthe rules, I have to depend on the Parliamentarians to tell me--really, \nto get the real scoop. I admire what they do. They are very fine \nlawyers. This area of the law they know better than anyone else in the \nworld.\n\n  Madam President, I haven't mentioned the police officers, the \ndoorkeepers. These police officers, they are here right now as we \nspeak. Most all in the Chamber, of course, without uniform. We have \npeople every day without any exception wanting to do bad things to this \nbeautiful Capitol Complex. These wonderful police officers keep this \nbuilding and its inhabitants, the people who work in this building--it \nis not inhabitants, although I feel I live here sometimes--they keep \nthe thousands of people who work in these Capitol buildings safe. They \ndo such a wonderful job of taking care of us.\n  Chief Gainer, who is the Sergeant at Arms, is responsible for the \npolice force. He does a wonderful job on this side of the Capitol.\n  Madam President, I wish you, the Presiding Officer, my dear friend, \nand everyone here a very happy holiday season. I wish it could have \nbeen a little longer, but it is better than a lot thought it would be.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss two \npromising Asian-American judicial nominees from my State of California \nwho have been denied simple, straightforward up-or-down votes on the \nfloor of this body for what I believe are very spurious reasons.\n  Goodwin Liu is associate dean and professor of law at the University \nof California, Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law. He has a truly \noutstanding record as a great legal mind:\n\n       Phi Beta Kappa from Stanford and co-president of the \n     Student Body; a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford; a J.D. from Yale \n     Law School and an editor on the Yale Law Journal; judicial \n     clerkships on the D.C. Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court; \n     recipient of both the Education Law Association's Award for \n     Distinguished Scholarship and the University of California at \n     Berkeley's highest award for teaching.\n\n  Recognizing his brilliance, President Obama chose Professor Liu for a \nseat on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  I have met personally with Goodwin Liu on several occasions, \nincluding a 4-hour discussion. I had him to my home for dinner. His \nstatus as a first-rate legal mind is undeniable.\n  And his support for this nomination is legion:\n\n       Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, former judge and Solicitor \n     General Ken Starr, leading conservative lawyer Clint Bolick, \n     California Correctional Peace Officers Association, 34 former \n     prosecutors, Numerous education leaders, including former \n     Secretary of Education Richard Riley and Joel Klein, the \n     Chancellor of the New York City schools, and Numerous \n     representatives of the Asian-American community.\n\n  One set of support was particularly impressive to me. In the only \ntime that I have seen the serving president and two former presidents \nof a major university write in support of a nominee or issue, the three \nmost recent presidents of Stanford University, John Hennessy, Gerhard \nCasper, and Donald Kennedy, wrote to support Professor Liu's \nnomination, saying, in part:\n\n       Goodwin Liu as a student, scholar, and trustee has \n     epitomized the goal of Stanford's founders, which was ``to \n     promote the public welfare by exercising an influence on \n     behalf of humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings \n     of liberty regulated by law, and inculcating love and \n     reverence for the great principles of government as derived \n     from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty and the \n     pursuit of happiness.'' We highly recommend Goodwin Liu for \n     the honor and responsibility of serving on the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n\n  I admit that some of Professor Liu's writing have been questioned by \nconservatives. It is true that Goodwin Liu would not be a conservative \njudge. However, I do not believe that he would be an activist judge.\n  As I have watched debates over the judiciary in my eighteen years in \nthe Senate, the perception of ``judicial activism'' is for the party on \nthe other side. Many believe that this current Supreme Court under \nChief Justice Roberts is one of the more activist courts ever. It is \nindisputable that it has overturned many precedents that had stood for \ndecades.\n  Goodwin Liu deserves to have a fair up-or-down vote, as other \ncontroversial circuit court nominees have received. If a senator \nopposes his nomination, let them vote against him. That is what we are \nhere for--to cast our votes yea or nay, up or down. But don't let \nProfessor Liu die on the calendar, without even having the courage to \ngive him a vote.\n  Even worse in many ways is the similar treatment that Magistrate \nJudge Edward Chen has received. I recommended Judge Chen for a \njudgeship in the Northern District of California. If confirmed, he \nwould be the first judge of Chinese descent to serve in this district, \nwith its notable Chinese heritage.\n  This would not be a novel role for Judge Chen: for the past 9 years, \nhe has served as a magistrate judge on this same court. And his service \nthere has been impeccable, and apparently unassailable: he has written \nmore than 350 published opinions in that time, and there has not been \nan objection to a single one of them.\n  But opponents of his nomination are hanging their hat on one quote \nfrom him, taken out of context.\n  One of the darkest chapters in this country's history was the \nwholesale internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. The \nSupreme Court upheld this heinous practice in the notorious case of \nKorematsu v. United States. In 1988, Congress passed and President \nReagan signed the Civil Liberties Act and issued a formal apology for \nthe internment. Before serving as a magistrate judge, Ed Chen \nrepresented the name party in that case, Fred\n\n[[Page S11067]]\n\nKorematsu, in his successful effort to overturn his conviction for \ndefying the internment order.\n  In 2005, Judge Chen attended Mr. Korematsu's funeral, and spoke about \nit a month later to law students. The line that critics have seized \nupon came from this speech, where Judge Chen said that, while listening \nto the congregation sing ``America the Beautiful'' at the funeral, he \nsometimes had ``Feelings of ambivalence and cynicism when confronted \nwith appeals to patriotism--sometimes I cannot help but feel that there \nare too much [sic] injustice and too many inequalities that prevent far \ntoo many Americans from enjoying the beauty extolled in that anthem.''\n  But the critics omit what Chen said right after that quotation:\n       Yet I was moved to tears at Fred's memorial. Why? In part, \n     Fred was a living example of the patriotism embodied in the \n     song. Korematsu demonstrated that patriotism not by waving an \n     American flag, but by trying to vindicate the values and \n     principles that are embodied in that flag freedom, justice \n     and equality under the law. . . . I was also moved not only \n     because ``America the Beautiful'' echoed what I saw [in] \n     Fred. It was also because the song described the America that \n     Fred envision[ed]. The America whose promised beauty he \n     sought to fulfill, an America true to its founding \n     principles.\n  Judge Chen didn't object to singing ``America the Beautiful''--he was \nmoved to tears by it.\n  Judge Chen's nomination enjoys widespread support, with extensive \nsupport from the law enforcement community, including: San Francisco \nDeputy Sheriffs' Association, Northern Alliance of Law Enforcement, \nwhich represents 20 different law enforcement associations in Northern \nCalifornia, Peace Officers Research Association of California, 11 \nformer Federal prosecutors for the Northern District of California and \nformer San Francisco Chief of Police Anthony Ribera.\n  And the list goes on.\n  He also has widespread support from the bar, including the Bar \nAssociation of San Francisco, Hispanic National Bar Association, and \nmany others.\n  Yet despite this support, his nomination has been subjected to \nrepeated, exceptional delay and obstruction, even being returned to the \nPresident during congressional recesses.\n  The day was when district court nominees supported by both home State \nSenators with extensive law enforcement and legal community support \nwere confirmed routinely. It is time now to end this delay and \nobstruction, give Ed Chen the fair up-or-down vote he so richly \ndeserves, and confirm this well-proven, qualified nominee to the \nFederal district court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "NOMINATIONS OF GOODWIN LIU AND EDWARD CHEN\n\n\tMrs. FEINSTEIN.

I want to say a few words about one of the highly \nqualified nominees belatedly confirmed by the Senate today. Beryl \nHowell has been confirmed to fill a vacancy on the District Court for \nthe District of Columbia. Many of us on the Judiciary Committee \nremember her from the 10 years she served as my general counsel and as \none of the most effective members of our Judiciary Committee staff. \nWith her background as a highly decorated Federal prosecutor, she \nworked on issues ranging from criminal justice and national security, \nto the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Anti-Cybersquatting \nConsumer Protection Act, and the No Electronic Theft Act. She worked on \nthe National Information Infrastructure Protection Act and the computer \nfraud and abuse statute, and on important oversight matters including \nthe Judiciary Committee's bipartisan hearings on Ruby Ridge that led to \nimprovements at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI. She also \nplayed important roles in electronic freedom of information \ninitiatives, which earned her induction into the Freedom of Information \nAct Hall of Fame.\n  When I had the chance to introduce Ms. Howell to the committee at her \nhearing in July, I discussed her impressive background before she \njoined the committee staff. She grew up in a proud military family. She \nwas awarded her undergraduate degree with honors in philosophy from \nBryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, and earned her law degree at \nColumbia University School of Law, where she was a Harlan Fiske Stone \nScholar. She clerked for Judge Dickinson Debevoise on the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of New Jersey.\n  Having worked as a student assistant in a U.S. Attorney's Office, she \njoined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York \nin 1987, working there almost 6 years, rising to be the Deputy Chief of \nthe Narcotics Section. Her grand jury investigations and prosecutions \nincluded complex public corruption, narcotics, and money laundering \ncases.\n  Descriptions of her cases read like crime novels. She successfully \nprosecuted the leadership of a Chinatown gang, called the Flying \nDragons, for heroin trafficking, and extradited the head of the gang \nafter he fled to Hong Kong. She successfully prosecuted a group of \nColombian drug dealers and arrested the gang members just as they were \npacking almost $20 million in cash from narcotics proceeds into a \nhidden compartment of a truck to smuggle it out of the country. Then \nsome of these defendants attempted a prison escape by bribing \nofficials, and she successfully prosecuted the perpetrators of the \nescape plan. She also handled the successful investigation and \nprosecution of over 20 corrupt New York City building inspectors \nengaged in extortion.\n  Ms. Howell's work was recognized by her twice being awarded the U.S. \nAttorney Special Achievement Award for Sustained Superior Performance, \nby commendations from the FBI, DEA, and the New York City Department of \nInvestigation, and ultimately by the prestigious Attorney General's \nDirector's Award for Superior Performance. I always felt lucky to have \nhired her.\n  Ms. Howell's career since she left us 7 years ago has been equally \nimpressive. She established the Washington, DC, office of a consulting \nand technical services firm specializing in digital forensics, computer \nfraud, and abuse investigations as the Executive Managing Director and \ngeneral counsel of Stroz Friedberg. While in the private sector, she \nreceived the FBI Director's Award for her work assisting in a \nGovernment cyber-extortion investigation.\n  Ms. Howell has twice been confirmed by the Senate to serve as a \nmember of the bipartisan U.S. Sentencing Commission, to which she was \nappointed by President Bush. She contributed to the Sentencing \nCommission report that led to our breakthrough this year with Senate \npassage of historic legislation that Senator Durbin crafted to end \nsentencing disparities, the Fair Sentencing Act.\n  She and her husband have raised their three children in the District \nand are long-time citizens here. That involvement, her public service \nbackground, and her steadfast commitment to justice make her an ideal \nnominee. I commend President Obama for choosing to nominate her. I \nthank the committee for acting to favorably report her nomination \nunanimously in September. I am glad the Senate has now followed suit \nand confirmed her unanimously to serve all the people of the District \nof Columbia fairly and impartially as a U.S. district court judge.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate in this \nCongress was able to make good progress on filling judicial vacancies, \nespecially those vacancies that the Democratic majority unfortunately \nand sometimes inexplicably failed to fill during the last 2 years of \nthe Bush Administration.\n  The progress we have made is especially noteworthy given the demands \nplaced upon the Judiciary Committee by having to process not one, but \ntwo, Supreme Court nominations. The Sotomayor and Kagan nominations \ntogether took approximately 6 months of the Committee's time. \nNevertheless, the Senate was able to confirm a total of 60 lower court \nnominations in this Congress, including 19 nominations while the Kagan \nnomination was pending. By comparison, the last time the Senate had to \nprocess two Supreme Court nominations in the same Congress, which were \nthe Roberts and Alito nominations during the 109th Congress, the Senate \nwas able to fill only 51 lower court judicial vacancies, and it \nconfirmed far fewer lower court nominations while the Roberts and Altio \nnominations were pending.\n  This Congress was also able to fill some long-standing vacancies, \nespecially on our courts of appeals. At the end of the Bush \nadministration, there\n\n[[Page S11068]]\n\nwere 15 judicial emergencies; this Congress was able to fill 10 of \nthose 15 judicial emergencies, including numerous judicial emergencies \non our circuit courts. The Fourth Circuit is illustrative of the \ncommitment of Senate Republicans to work in a bipartisan fashion to \nthis end.\n  At the end of the last Congress, the Fourth Circuit was almost one-\nthird vacant, despite the fact that President Bush had nominated \noutstanding candidates for these positions. These nominees enjoyed \nstrong home State support, including some with strong bi-partisan, \nhome-state support. Yet our Democratic friends refused to move these \nnominations. By contrast, this Congress put partisanship aside and \nfilled all four of these vacancies, giving badly-needed relief to a \nlong suffering Federal circuit.\n  We could have made more progress still. But unfortunately, the \nPresident failed to put forth, and the Democratic Majority failed to \nmove, nominations for the vast majority of the current federal \nvacancies. Specifically, the President has failed to even nominate \nindividuals for most of the current district court vacancies, putting \nforth only 34 nominations, even though there are 76 vacancies. And of \nthose district court nominations he has put forth, 18 of them remain in \nthe Democratic-controlled Judiciary Committee. The story is similar for \nour circuit courts: there are 16 vacancies there, but the White House \nhas failed to even nominate candidates for seven of those vacancies. \nAnd of those circuit court nominations he has made, 6 remain in the \nJudiciary Committee. All told, of the current vacancies on our Federal \ncourts 80 percent of these seats remain vacant because the President \neither has not nominated anyone, or our Democratic colleagues have not \nprocessed the ones he has nominated.\n  Which brings us to the judicial nominations remaining on the Senate \nfloor. Four of these nominations are very controversial. Their \nstatements, writings, and records show a willingness to put their own \nviews ahead of the dictates of the law and the Constitution. As a \nresult, Senate Republicans are not prepared to consent to their \nconfirmation, or to a process that will facilitate their confirmation.\n  The remaining 15 nominations pending on the Senate floor were not \nreported out of the Judiciary Committee until the waning days of this \nCongress. This is unfortunate. Most of these nominations are to fill \nvacancies that have existed for years; in some cases, for 2 or 3 years, \nor even longer. I do not know why these nominations were not reported \nout of the Judiciary Committee until December. While we were worked \ndiligently in the lameduck session to fill numerous judicial \nvacancies--confirming 19 judicial nominees total--we were not able to \nprocess the remaining 15 nominations that the committee approved late \nin this year.\n  But our record of confirming judicial nominations in this lameduck \nCongress certainly compares favorably to the progress that was made on \njudicial nominations in other lameduck Congresses. In the lameduck \nsession of the last Congress, the Senate did not confirm any judicial \nnominees. Thirty judicial nominations were not acted upon in that \nsession, despite the urgent need for judges on places like the Fourth \nCircuit. In the lameduck session of the Congress before that, our \nDemocratic colleagues did not consent to confirming any judicial \nnominees; the one judicial nomination that occurred in the lameduck \nsession of the 109th Congress was achieved by the Republican majority \nfiling cloture on a nominee. Cloture was invoked on that nomination by \na vote of 93 to 0, and he was confirmed. But 38 other judicial \nnominations were not acted upon in that Congress, including 15 who were \nripe for action on the Senate floor. In the lameduck session of the \n108th Congress, only 3 nominations were confirmed, all to the district \ncourt. Almost two dozen judicial nominations were not acted upon in \nthat lameduck session, including several who were pending on the Senate \nfloor. In fact, the last time a Senate confirmed as many judicial \nnominations in a lameduck session of Congress as were confirmed in the \nlameduck session of this Congress was in 2002, when 20 judicial \nnominees were confirmed at the end of the 107th Congress.\n  I am hopeful we can continue to work in a bipartisan fashion in the \nnext Congress on judicial nominations and that the President will join \nus in that effort by not nominating or re-nominating judicial nominees \nwho show a willingness to follow their own beliefs, rather than the \nrequirements of the law.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, as the 111th Congress draws to a close, \nSenate Republicans have finally consented to consider half of the \njudicial nominations that have been pending on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar, some for nearly a year, awaiting a final Senate vote. We \nbegan with 38 judicial nominees to be considered and the Senate is \nbeing prevented from voting on 19. These are all superbly qualified \nnominees, most were reported with bipartisan support and many \nunanimously. Thirteen of these nominations on which we are not being \nallowed to vote are to fill judicial emergency vacancies, as determined \nby the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Yet for \nmonth after month, many of these nominations have been stalled, just \nlanguishing before the Senate as Senate Republicans refused to consent \nto moving forward. Congress will adjourn for the year without \ncompleting its work on these nominations.\n  Senate Republicans' strategy of delaying and blocking judicial \nnominations across the board has led to judicial vacancies nearly \ndoubling over the last 2 years. Vacancies remain at nearly 100 with \nmore than 40 judicial emergencies. The Republican leadership was \nunmoved by pleas from the President, the Attorney General, two Supreme \nCourt Justices, the President of the American Bar Association, the \nFederal Bar Association, retired Federal judges, current chief judges \nand Federal prosecutors calling on the Senate to address the growing \nvacancies crisis. They disregarded the pleas to end the senseless \ndelays and needless blockade of consensus nominations and to vote \nwhether to confirm the nominations sent forward by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to fill the vacancies in the Federal courts.\n  Each of the judicial nominations now before the Senate will upon \nadjournment be returned to the President, the vacancy will remain, and \nthe confirmation process will have to start over next year. Just a few \nyears ago Senate Republicans were united in demanding that every \nnomination reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Senate \ndeserved a vote. They argued that was our constitutional duty. Well, \nthe Constitution has not been amended. The only thing that has changed \nis that the American people changed Presidents.\n  In 2001 and 2002, the first 2 years of the Bush administration, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee reported 100 judicial nominees of President \nBush. I was the chairman. We did not adjourn in 2002 until we had given \na vote to every one of those 100 nominees and confirmed them. I did not \nsupport all of them but I did not prevent those votes. I worked to fill \nthe vacancies on the Federal courts. That was with a Democratic \nmajority in the Senate. All 100 were considered before the end of the \n107th Congress, including two controversial circuit court nominations \nreported and then confirmed during the lameduck session in 2002, after \nthe midterm elections.\n  This Congress the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings, \nconsidered and was able to favorably report 80 nominees to Federal \ncircuit and district court vacancies. Only 60 have been allowed Senate \nvotes. This is a historically low number and percentage for the first \ntwo years of a new Presidency. Last year only 12 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court judges were confirmed. It was the lowest number in more \nthan 50 years. This year the Senate has been allowed to consider fewer \nthan 50 judicial nominees. That has led to the lowest confirmation \ntotal for the first 2 years of a new Presidency in 35 years. And this \nis taking place during a period when Federal judicial vacancies have \ndoubled.\n  By nearly every measure--the number of nominees confirmed, the \npercentage of nominees confirmed, the pace of nominees being considered \non the floor, the skyrocketing vacancy numbers--the results are dismal. \nDuring the first 2 years of the Bush administration, Democrats in the \nSenate worked to consider and confirm 100 judicial nominees. During the \nfirst two years of the Obama administration,\n\n[[Page S11069]]\n\nSenate Republicans have limited Federal circuit and district court \nconfirmations to 60. They were delayed on average six times longer than \nit took President Bush's judicial nominees to be considered by the \nSenate.\n  Senate Republicans have returned to the strategy they used during the \nClinton administration, when they pocket filibustered more than 60 of \nhis judicial nominations, leading to a vacancy crisis. Their years of \nrefusing to proceed on President Clinton's nominations led Chief \nJustice William Rehnquist, a conservative appointed by Republican \nPresidents, to chastise them for failing to address the needs of the \nFederal judiciary. In those days, Federal judicial vacancies rose to \nmore than 110 by the end of the Clinton administration, a historically \nhigh vacancy number. Current across the board delays eventuated in 111 \nFederal court vacancies this year.\n  When Democrats regained the Senate majority halfway into President \nBush's first year in office, we reported and confirmed 100 judicial \nnominees during the 17 months I served as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee in the 107th Congress. We continued to work cooperatively to \nmake progress on nominations whether in the majority or the minority \nfor the rest of President Bush's administration. As a result, overall \njudicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years from more than 10 \npercent to less than four percent. During the Bush years, the Federal \ncourt vacancies were reduced from 110 to 34 and Federal circuit court \nvacancies were reduced from a high of 32 down to single digits.\n  This progress has not continued once the American people elected \nPresident Obama. Senate Republicans have returned to the strategy of \nacross-the-board delays and obstruction of the President's judicial \nnominations, again leading to skyrocketing vacancies. Last year the \nSenate confirmed only 12 Federal circuit and district court judges, the \nlowest total in 50 years. This year we confirmed less than 50 more \nFederal circuit and district judges. That has led to the lowest \nconfirmation total for the first 2 years of a new Presidency in 35 \nyears. We are not even keeping up with retirements and attrition. As a \nresult, judicial vacancies rose again over 110 again this year.\n  The Senate's Republican leadership seems determined to end the \nCongress as it began it, obstructing President Obama's judicial \nnominations. In November 2009, the Senate confirmed Judge David \nHamilton of Indiana to the Seventh Circuit after rejecting a Republican \nfilibuster of President Obama's first judicial nomination. Judge \nHamilton was no radical. He had the support of the Senate's senior \nRepublican, the senior Senator from Indiana. He had served nearly 15 \nyears on the Federal bench. Rather than welcome the nomination as an \neffort by President Obama to step away from the ideological battles of \nthe past, Senate Republicans ignored Senator Lugar's support, \ndistorting Judge Hamilton's record and filibustering his nomination. \nRepublican Senators who had recently pledged never to filibuster a \njudicial nominee and those who had said they would do so only under \nextraordinary circumstances reversed themselves and joined the partisan \nfilibuster. Republican Senators who just a few years earlier had \nproclaimed such filibusters unconstitutional also joined. They \nabandoned all they had said and filibustered a preacher's son and fine \njudge who was known to and supported by his respected Republican home \nState Senator.\n\n  In filibustering President Obama's first judicial nomination, Senate \nRepublicans also ignored the standard they had set in a letter they \nsent to President Obama before he had made a single judicial \nnomination. In that letter, they threatened to filibuster any \nnomination made without consultation. Despite the fact that President \nObama has reached across the aisle to consult, as he did with Senator \nLugar of Indiana, Senate Republicans have filibustered and delayed \njudicial nominations virtually across the board.\n  Delays and obstruction of Senate consideration has attended virtually \nall of well-qualified judicial nominees. Contrary to their statements \nduring the Bush administration that every judicial nomination reported \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee was entitled to an up-or-down vote, \nSenate Republicans have refused consent for up-or-down votes on nominee \nafter nominee. Since the filibuster of Judge Hamilton, they have \nrequired the Majority Leader to file cloture on other highly qualified \ncircuit court nominees, indeed on a quarter of the 16 circuit court \nnominees the Senate has been allowed to consider.\n  No Senator could claim the circumstances surrounding the filibusters \nof President Obama's circuit court nominations to be extraordinary. \nRepublicans filibustered the nomination of Judge Barbara Keenan, a \nnominee with nearly 30 years of judicial experience, and the first \nwoman to hold a number of important judicial roles in Virginia. She was \nthen confirmed 99-0 as the first woman from Virginia to serve on the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals. They filibustered the nomination of \nJudge Thomas Vanaskie, whose 16 years of a experience as a Federal \ndistrict court judge in Pennsylvania are now being put to good use on \nthe Third Circuit. They filibustered Judge Denny Chin of the Second \nCircuit, who also had 16 years of experience as a Federal district \ncourt judge. He is now the only active Asian Pacific American judge to \nserve on a Federal appellate court, and his nomination was confirmed \nunanimously.\n  Senate Republicans' tactics reached a new low as they obstructed \nconsideration of district court nominations. The blockade of these \nnominations is a dramatic departure from the traditional practice of \nconsidering district court nominations expeditiously and with deference \nto home state Senators. Among these nominations were Louis Butler of \nWisconsin, Edward Chen of California, and John McConnell of Rhode \nIsland. These nominees were reported by the Committee several times \nwith strong support from their home State Senators who know the \nnominees and the needs of the courts in their States best. All three \nwere pending for months on the Senate Calendar. In fact, Justice Butler \nand Judge Chen were first reported by the Judiciary Committee over a \nyear ago. Obstruction of these district court nominations is \nunprecedented.\n  Since 1945, the Judiciary Committee has reported more than 2,100 \ndistrict court nominees to the Senate. Out of these 2,100 nominees, \nonly 5 have been reported by party-line votes, and 4 of the 5 occurred \nin this Congress. Less than 20 of the 2,100 nominees faced any \nopposition in Committee. Since 1949, cloture motions have been filed on \nonly three district court nominations. All three nominations were \nconfirmed, and in fact two of the cloture petitions were withdrawn. \nThis year Republican opposition to the Butler, Chen and McConnell \nnominations would have required clotures on all three, meaning that in \n1 year they would have matched the number of cloture motions filed on \ndistrict court nominees over the past 62 years.\n  These nominees are outstanding Americans who do us a great service by \ntheir willingness to serve on our Federal courts. Justice Louis Butler, \nJr., was nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District \nCourt for the Western District of Wisconsin. He has 16 years of \njudicial experience at the municipal and State court level and was the \nfirst African American to serve on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. He has \nthe strong support of both of his home State Senators and he earned the \nhighest possible rating, unanimously well qualified, from the Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Association, \nABA.\n  Judge Edward Chen was nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the \nU.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. He has \nserved that court as a Magistrate Judge for the last nine years and has \naccrued an impeccable record of fairness and impartiality. He would \nhave been only the second Asian American to serve as a Federal Judge in \nthe 150-year history of that District. He was also the first Asian \nAmerican to serve the District as a Magistrate Judge. Judge Chen earned \nthe highest possible rating, unanimously well qualified, from the ABA's \nStanding Committee on the Federal Judiciary, and he has the strong \nsupport of both of his home State Senators.\n  Jack McConnell was nominated to serve as a Federal district court \njudge in Rhode Island. With more than 25\n\n[[Page S11070]]\n\nyears of experience as a lawyer in private practice, Mr. McConnell has \nthe strong support of both Senators from Rhode Island. Individuals and \norganizations from across the political spectrum in that state have \ncalled for Mr. McConnell's confirmation. The Providence\n  Journal endorsed his nomination by saying that he ``in his legal work \nand community leadership has shown that he has the legal intelligence, \ncharacter, compassion, and independence to be a distinguished jurist.'' \nA two-thirds majority of the Judiciary Committee, including Senator \nGraham, voted to favorably report Mr. McConnell's nomination for \nconfirmation.\n  The Senate should also have been able to have a debate and a vote on \nthe nomination of Goodwin Liu of California to the Ninth Circuit Court \nof Appeals. He is a professor at the University of California, \nBerkeley, School of Law, and was nominated by President Obama to fill \nan emergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit. An acclaimed scholar and a \nnationally recognized expert on constitutional law and educational law \nand policy, Professor Liu earned the highest possible rating, \nunanimously well qualified, from the ABA's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary. He is a former Supreme Court clerk and a Rhodes \nScholar who would be only the second, active Asian Pacific American \njudge to serve on a Federal appellate court. Both of Professor Liu's \nhome state Senators support his nomination.\n  The conservative, Republican-appointed Chief Judge of the Ninth \nCircuit to which Professor Liu has been nominated has written the \nSenate to inform us of crushing caseloads and the urgent need for new \njudges. Justice Anthony Kennedy this August warned the Ninth Circuit \nJudicial Conference about the threat posed by skyrocketing judicial \nvacancies in California and throughout the country. He noted that, ``if \njudicial excellence is cast upon a sea of congressional indifference, \nthe rule of law is imperiled.''\n  Rather than following a partisan playbook, I wish Republican Senators \nhad listened to the cross-section of people and organizations from \nacross the political spectrum that have written in strong support of \nProfessor Liu's qualifications to serve on the Ninth Circuit. These \nformer prosecutors and judges, presidents of universities, renowned \nacademics, distinguished practitioners, advocacy groups, and district \nattorneys believe Professor Liu would make an excellent Federal judge. \nSo do I.\n  I reviewed the record of each of these nominees targeted for \nRepublican opposition and carefully considered their character, \nbackground, and qualifications. I believe they each would have been \nconfirmed by the Senate. That they will not be conservative activist \njudges should not disqualify them from consideration by the Senate or \nfrom serving on the Federal bench.\n  In addition to these nominees, there has been a destructive tact in \nwhich Senate Republicans have systematically delayed votes on consensus \nnominations. The length of time nominations were stalled before a final \nSenate vote is the product of that systematic delay. The fact is that \nnominations have taken on average six times as long before final Senate \nconsideration after being reported from the Judiciary Committee, when \ncomparing the confirmations in the first two years of the Bush and \nObama administrations. Several consensus nominations that were \neventually confirmed unanimously required cloture petitions to be filed \njust to be considered. Other evidence is the fact that more than a \ndozen consensus judicial nominations that have been through the entire \nprocess are being denied a final vote as the Senate adjourns. I know of \nno precedent for this. Indeed, in the lame duck session at the end of \nPresident Bush's second year in office, we proceeded to report and \nconfirm controversial circuit court nominees. That the Senate is not \nbeing allowed to consider consensus nominees awaiting a final vote is a \nshame and an unnecessary burden on them and their families and for the \ncourts and people they would serve.\n  It is a travesty that all of the well-qualified nominees favorably \nreported by the Judiciary Committee could not be confirmed before this \nCongress adjourns. That is what we did when we confirmed 100 judicial \nnominees of President Bush in 2001 and 2002. All 100 of the nominees \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee received Senate votes and \nwere confirmed, all 100. They include 20 during the lameduck session \nthat year and circuit court nominees reported after the election. This \nyear even consensus nominees are not being allowed to be considered.\n  When the Senate returns for the 112th Congress I hope that all \nSenators will learn from the mounting judicial vacancies and failure to \nmake progress in this Congress. I hope that we can follow a path toward \nrestoring the Senate's longstanding traditions of expeditiously \nconsidering nominations and reject the obstruction that blocked \nprogress. We must do better to address the needs of the Federal courts \nand the American people who depend on them for justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "NOMINATION OF BERYL HOWELL\n\n\tMr. LEAHY. I want to say a few words about one of the highly qualified nominees belatedly confirmed by the Senate today. Beryl Howell has been confirmed to fill a vacancy on the District Court for the District of Columbia. Many of us on the Judiciary Committee remember her from the 10 years she served as my general counsel and as one of the most effective members of our Judiciary Committee staff. With her background as a highly decorated Federal prosecutor, she worked on issues ranging from criminal justice and national security, to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, and the No Electronic Theft Act. She worked on the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act and the computer fraud and abuse statute, and on important oversight matters including the Judiciary Committee's bipartisan hearings on Ruby Ridge that led to improvements at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI. She also played important roles in electronic freedom of information initiatives, which earned her induction into the Freedom of Information Act Hall of Fame.\n\tWhen I had the chance to introduce Ms. Howell to the committee at her hearing in July, I discussed her impressive background before she joined the committee staff. She grew up in a proud military family. She was awarded her undergraduate degree with honors in philosophy from Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, and earned her law degree at Columbia University School of Law, where she was a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar. She clerked for Judge Dickinson Debevoise on the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.\n\tHaving worked as a student assistant in a U.S. Attorney's Office, she joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York in 1987, working there almost 6 years, rising to be the Deputy Chief of the Narcotics Section. Her grand jury investigations and prosecutions included complex public corruption, narcotics, and money laundering cases.\n\tDescriptions of her cases read like crime novels. She successfully prosecuted the leadership of a Chinatown gang, called the Flying Dragons, for heroin trafficking, and extradited the head of the gang after he fled to Hong Kong. She successfully prosecuted a group of Colombian drug dealers and arrested the gang members just as they were packing almost $20 million in cash from narcotics proceeds into a hidden compartment of a truck to smuggle it out of the country. Then some of these defendants attempted a prison escape by bribing officials, and she successfully prosecuted the perpetrators of the escape plan. She also handled the successful investigation and prosecution of over 20 corrupt New York City building inspectors engaged in extortion.\n\tMs. Howell's work was recognized by her twice being awarded the U.S. Attorney Special Achievement Award for Sustained Superior Performance, by commendations from the FBI, DEA, and the New York City Department of Investigation, and ultimately by the prestigious Attorney General's Director's Award for Superior Performance. I always felt lucky to have hired her.\n\tMs. Howell's career since she left us 7 years ago has been equally impressive. She established the Washington, DC, office of a consulting and technical services firm specializing in digital forensics, computer fraud, and abuse investigations as the Executive Managing Director and general counsel of Stroz Friedberg. While in the private sector, she received the FBI Director's Award for her work assisting in a Government cyber-extortion investigation.\n\tMs. Howell has twice been confirmed by the Senate to serve as a member of the bipartisan U.S. Sentencing Commission, to which she was appointed by President Bush. She contributed to the Sentencing Commission report that led to our breakthrough this year with Senate passage of historic legislation that Senator Durbin crafted to end sentencing disparities, the Fair Sentencing Act.\n\tShe and her husband have raised their three children in the District and are long-time citizens here. That involvement, her public service background, and her steadfast commitment to justice make her an ideal nominee. I commend President Obama for choosing to nominate her. I thank the committee for acting to favorably report her nomination unanimously in September. I am glad the Senate has now followed suit and confirmed her unanimously to serve all the people of the District of Columbia fairly and impartially as a U.S. district court judge.\n\tMr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate in this Congress was able to make good progress on filling judicial vacancies, especially those vacancies that the Democratic majority unfortunately and sometimes inexplicably failed to fill during the last 2 years of the Bush Administration.\n\tThe progress we have made is especially noteworthy given the demands placed upon the Judiciary Committee by having to process not one, but two, Supreme Court nominations.

Just a few years ago Senate Republicans were united in demanding that every nomination reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee to the Senate deserved a vote. They argued that was our constitutional duty. Well, the Constitution has not been amended. The only thing that has changed is that the American people changed Presidents.\n\tIn 2001 and 2002, the first 2 years of the Bush administration, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported 100 judicial nominees of President Bush. I was the chairman. We did not adjourn in 2002 until we had given a vote to every one of those 100 nominees and confirmed them. I did not support all of them but I did not prevent those votes. I worked to fill the vacancies on the Federal courts. That was with a Democratic majority in the Senate. All 100 were considered before the end of the 107th Congress, including two controversial circuit court nominations reported and then confirmed during the lameduck session in 2002, after the midterm elections.\n\tThis Congress the Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings, considered and was able to favorably report 80 nominees to Federal circuit and district court vacancies. Only 60 have been allowed Senate votes. This is a historically low number and percentage for the first two years of a new Presidency. Last year only 12 Federal circuit and district court judges were confirmed. It was the lowest number in more than 50 years. This year the Senate has been allowed to consider fewer than 50 judicial nominees. That has led to the lowest confirmation total for the first 2 years of a new Presidency in 35 years. And this is taking place during a period when Federal judicial vacancies have doubled.\n\tBy nearly every measure--the number of nominees confirmed, the percentage of nominees confirmed, the pace of nominees being considered on the floor, the skyrocketing vacancy numbers--the results are dismal. During the first 2 years of the Bush administration, Democrats in the Senate worked to consider and confirm 100 judicial nominees. During the first two years of the Obama administration, Senate Republicans have limited Federal circuit and district court confirmations to 60. They were delayed on average six times longer than it took President Bush's judicial nominees to be considered by the Senate.\n\tSenate Republicans have returned to the strategy they used during the Clinton administration, when they pocket filibustered more than 60 of his judicial nominations, leading to a vacancy crisis. Their years of refusing to proceed on President Clinton's nominations led Chief Justice William Rehnquist, a conservative appointed by Republican Presidents, to chastise them for failing to address the needs of the Federal judiciary. In those days, Federal judicial vacancies rose to more than 110 by the end of the Clinton administration, a historically high vacancy number. Current across the board delays eventuated in 111 Federal court vacancies this year.\n\tWhen Democrats regained the Senate majority halfway into President Bush's first year in office, we reported and confirmed 100 judicial nominees during the 17 months I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the 107th Congress. We continued to work cooperatively to make progress on nominations whether in the majority or the minority for the rest of President Bush's administration. As a result, overall judicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years from more than 10 percent to less than four percent. During the Bush years, the Federal court vacancies were reduced from 110 to 34 and Federal circuit court vacancies were reduced from a high of 32 down to single digits.\n\tThis progress has not continued once the American people elected President Obama. Senate Republicans have returned to the strategy of across-the-board delays and obstruction of the President's judicial nominations, again leading to skyrocketing vacancies. Last year the Senate confirmed only 12 Federal circuit and district court judges, the lowest total in 50 years. This year we confirmed less than 50 more Federal circuit and district judges. That has led to the lowest confirmation total for the first 2 years of a new Presidency in 35 years. We are not even keeping up with retirements and attrition. As a result, judicial vacancies rose again over 110 again this year.\n\tThe Senate's Republican leadership seems determined to end the Congress as it began it, obstructing President Obama's judicial nominations. In November 2009, the Senate confirmed Judge David Hamilton of Indiana to the Seventh Circuit after rejecting a Republican filibuster of President Obama's first judicial nomination. Judge Hamilton was no radical. He had the support of the Senate's senior Republican, the senior Senator from Indiana. He had served nearly 15 years on the Federal bench. Rather than welcome the nomination as an effort by President Obama to step away from the ideological battles of the past, Senate Republicans ignored Senator Lugar's support, distorting Judge Hamilton's record and filibustering his nomination. Republican Senators who had recently pledged never to filibuster a judicial nominee and those who had said they would do so only under extraordinary circumstances reversed themselves and joined the partisan filibuster. Republican Senators who just a few years earlier had proclaimed such filibusters unconstitutional also joined. They abandoned all they had said and filibustered a preacher's son and fine judge who was known to and supported by his respected Republican home State Senator.\n\n\tIn filibustering President Obama's first judicial nomination, Senate Republicans also ignored the standard they had set in a letter they sent to President Obama before he had made a single judicial nomination. In that letter, they threatened to filibuster any nomination made without consultation. Despite the fact that President Obama has reached across the aisle to consult, as he did with Senator Lugar of Indiana, Senate Republicans have filibustered and delayed judicial nominations virtually across the board.\n\tDelays and obstruction of Senate consideration has attended virtually all of well-qualified judicial nominees. Contrary to their statements during the Bush administration that every judicial nomination reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee was entitled to an up-or-down vote, Senate Republicans have refused consent for up-or-down votes on nominee after nominee. Since the filibuster of Judge Hamilton, they have required the Majority Leader to file cloture on other highly qualified circuit court nominees, indeed on a quarter of the 16 circuit court nominees the Senate has been allowed to consider.\n\tNo Senator could claim the circumstances surrounding the filibusters of President Obama's circuit court nominations to be extraordinary. Republicans filibustered the nomination of Judge Barbara Keenan, a nominee with nearly 30 years of judicial experience, and the first woman to hold a number of important judicial roles in Virginia. She was then confirmed 99-0 as the first woman from Virginia to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. They filibustered the nomination of Judge Thomas Vanaskie, whose 16 years of a experience as a Federal district court judge in Pennsylvania are now being put to good use on the Third Circuit. They filibustered Judge Denny Chin of the Second Circuit, who also had 16 years of experience as a Federal district court judge. He is now the only active Asian Pacific American judge to serve on a Federal appellate court, and his nomination was confirmed unanimously.\n\tSenate Republicans' tactics reached a new low as they obstructed consideration of district court nominations. The blockade of these nominations is a dramatic departure from the traditional practice of considering district court nominations expeditiously and with deference to home state Senators. Among these nominations were Louis Butler of Wisconsin, Edward Chen of California, and John McConnell of Rhode Island. These nominees were reported by the Committee several times with strong support from their home State Senators who know the nominees and the needs of the courts in their States best. All three were pending for months on the Senate Calendar. In fact, Justice Butler and Judge Chen were first reported by the Judiciary Committee over a year ago. Obstruction of these district court nominations is unprecedented.\n\tSince 1945, the Judiciary Committee has reported more than 2,100 district court nominees to the Senate. Out of these 2,100 nominees, only 5 have been reported by party-line votes, and 4 of the 5 occurred in this Congress. Less than 20 of the 2,100 nominees faced any opposition in Committee. Since 1949, cloture motions have been filed on only three district court nominations. All three nominations were confirmed, and in fact two of the cloture petitions were withdrawn. This year Republican opposition to the Butler, Chen and McConnell nominations would have required clotures on all three, meaning that in 1 year they would have matched the number of cloture motions filed on district court nominees over the past 62 years.\n\tThese nominees are outstanding Americans who do us a great service by their willingness to serve on our Federal courts. Justice Louis Butler, Jr., was nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. He has 16 years of judicial experience at the municipal and State court level and was the first African American to serve on the Wisconsin Supreme Court. He has the strong support of both of his home State Senators and he earned the highest possible rating, unanimously well qualified, from the Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary of the American Bar Association, ABA.\n\tJudge Edward Chen was nominated to fill an emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. He has served that court as a Magistrate Judge for the last nine years and has accrued an impeccable record of fairness and impartiality. He would have been only the second Asian American to serve as a Federal Judge in the 150-year history of that District. He was also the first Asian American to serve the District as a Magistrate Judge. Judge Chen earned the highest possible rating, unanimously well qualified, from the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, and he has the strong support of both of his home State Senators.\n\tJack McConnell was nominated to serve as a Federal district court judge in Rhode Island. With more than 25 years of experience as a lawyer in private practice, Mr. McConnell has the strong support of both Senators from Rhode Island. Individuals and organizations from across the political spectrum in that state have called for Mr. McConnell's confirmation. The Providence\n\tJournal endorsed his nomination by saying that he ``in his legal work and community leadership has shown that he has the legal intelligence, character, compassion, and independence to be a distinguished jurist.'' A two-thirds majority of the Judiciary Committee, including Senator Graham, voted to favorably report Mr. McConnell's nomination for confirmation.\n\tThe Senate should also have been able to have a debate and a vote on the nomination of Goodwin Liu of California to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. He is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law, and was nominated by President Obama to fill an emergency vacancy on the Ninth Circuit. An acclaimed scholar and a nationally recognized expert on constitutional law and educational law and policy, Professor Liu earned the highest possible rating, unanimously well qualified, from the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. He is a former Supreme Court clerk and a Rhodes Scholar who would be only the second, active Asian Pacific American judge to serve on a Federal appellate court. Both of Professor Liu's home state Senators support his nomination.\n\tThe conservative, Republican-appointed Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit to which Professor Liu has been nominated has written the Senate to inform us of crushing caseloads and the urgent need for new judges. Justice Anthony Kennedy this August warned the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference about the threat posed by skyrocketing judicial vacancies in California and throughout the country. He noted that, ``if judicial excellence is cast upon a sea of congressional indifference, the rule of law is imperiled.''\n\tRather than following a partisan playbook, I wish Republican Senators had listened to the cross-section of people and organizations from across the political spectrum that have written in strong support of Professor Liu's qualifications to serve on the Ninth Circuit. These former prosecutors and judges, presidents of universities, renowned academics, distinguished practitioners, advocacy groups, and district attorneys believe Professor Liu would make an excellent Federal judge. So do I.\n\tI reviewed the record of each of these nominees targeted for Republican opposition and carefully considered their character, background, and qualifications. I believe they each would have been confirmed by the Senate. That they will not be conservative activist judges should not disqualify them from consideration by the Senate or from serving on the Federal bench.\n\tIn addition to these nominees, there has been a destructive tact in which Senate Republicans have systematically delayed votes on consensus nominations. The length of time nominations were stalled before a final Senate vote is the product of that systematic delay. The fact is that nominations have taken on average six times as long before final Senate consideration after being reported from the Judiciary Committee, when comparing the confirmations in the first two years of the Bush and Obama administrations. Several consensus nominations that were eventually confirmed unanimously required cloture petitions to be filed just to be considered. Other evidence is the fact that more than a dozen consensus judicial nominations that have been through the entire process are being denied a final vote as the Senate adjourns. I know of no precedent for this. Indeed, in the lame duck session at the end of President Bush's second year in office, we proceeded to report and confirm controversial circuit court nominees. That the Senate is not being allowed to consider consensus nominees awaiting a final vote is a shame and an unnecessary burden on them and their families and for the courts and people they would serve.\n\tIt is a travesty that all of the well-qualified nominees favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee could not be confirmed before this Congress adjourns. That is what we did when we confirmed 100 judicial nominees of President Bush in 2001 and 2002. All 100 of the nominees reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee received Senate votes and were confirmed, all 100. They include 20 during the lameduck session that year and circuit court nominees reported after the election. This year even consensus nominees are not being allowed to be considered.\n\tWhen the Senate returns for the 112th Congress I hope that all Senators will learn from the mounting judicial vacancies and failure to make progress in this Congress. I hope that we can follow a path toward restoring the Senate's longstanding traditions of expeditiously considering nominations and reject the obstruction that blocked progress. We must do better to address the needs of the Federal courts and the American people who depend on them for justice.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Patrick J.
