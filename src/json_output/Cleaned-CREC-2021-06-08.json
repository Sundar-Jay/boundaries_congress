His mother, Alberta, taught him the \nvalue of hard work and respect at an early age.\n  Later on in life, Albert met his wife, Earlene, while at church. The \ncouple married in 1959 and continued to attend church together \nthroughout the next six decades. Together, they had five children and \n13 grandchildren.\n  Throughout his life, Albert never forgot the value of hard work that \nhis mother instilled in him. After dropping out of college to take an \nentry-level job at Sears Roebuck and Company, he eventually worked his \nway up as the corporation's first African American store manager. In \n1976, he relocated to Miami, where he eventually decided to launch \nseveral of his own businesses with his wife.\n  Education was always very important to Albert and Earlene. After \nwatching all five of their children graduate from college, they decided \nto go back to school themselves and complete their undergraduate \ndegrees. Albert eventually went on to complete his PhD in Philosophy in \n2004.\n  Albert continuously remained active in the higher education \ncommunity, serving on Florida International University's (FIU) \nFoundation Board of Directors for nearly two decades to secure research \nfunding for architecture and medical students. He eventually went on to \nchair the FIU Board of Trustees from 2009 to 2011.\n  Albert cared deeply for the Miami community, being involved with \ncommunity groups like the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce and the Miami-\nDade School Board.

Madam Speaker, today, I introduce the STEM Educator \nAwards Equity Act to ensure educators from the Northern Mariana \nIslands, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa are represented in \nthe annual Presidential Awards for Excellence in Math and Science \nTeaching.\n  Established by Congress in 1983, the Presidential Award is the \nhighest recognition that an elementary or secondary school mathematics \nor science teacher may receive in the United States. Over 4,800 \nteachers have been recognized for their contributions in the classroom \nand to their profession.\n  Unlike the fifty States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and \nDepartment of Defense schools, each of which may recognize a STEM \neducator, no more than two awards in total can go to teachers from the \nfour insular areas: the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, \nGuam, and American Samoa. This limitation has resulted in many years in \nwhich no teacher from one of those four areas is selected. No teacher \nfrom the Marianas, for instance, was selected this year.

These statutory limits, also, unfairly deny \ndeserving educators in the insular areas the national recognition and \nprofessional development opportunities we provide to STEM educators \nelsewhere in our Nation.\n  My bill provides a more equitable process by requiring awards to at \nleast one teacher from each of the four areas.

Here, Robert saw \nthat while gay bars were some of the only places LGBT individuals could \nopenly be themselves, many establishments weren't uplifting the causes \nof the LGBT community. Robert realized he should open a business in Des \nMoines that would provide philanthropic support to multiple causes \nimpacting his community.\n  Robert opened the Blazing Saddles in Des Moines in 1983, 38 years \nago, which is now the oldest gay bar in the Midwest. Robert's work has \nallowed him to create charities, such as the All Iowa AIDs Benefits to \nsupport Iowans suffering from HIV/AIDS during the height of the \nepidemic, as well as helping fundraise to support the needs of LGBT \nIowans. Robert founded the Imperial Court of Iowa which funds \neducational scholarships for high school students and adult education \nseekers. He's known to pitch in for causes like voter education and \nadvocacy, equal rights, and much more. Robert has always made sure his \nemployees at the Blazing Saddles were paid competitive wages and had \njob protection to be themselves, protection that would not be given to \nmost LGBT workers until 2020.\n  In his over 40 years of activism, Robert has come face-to-face with \nhate and discrimination right here in Iowa. His bar had their windows \nsmashed, flags burned, received threatening letters, and various other \nacts of vandalism over the years. ``You can't make fear a part of your \nlife'', he said, reflecting on that fact that the fight for LGBT \nequality has historically been met with violence and intimidation. \n``But they can't scare us back into closet'' he said with a chuckle. \nAlthough LGBT equality has made strides recently, Robert has said there \nis still more work to do. ``Everyone needs a place to be themselves'' \nhe said.\n  His bar was named after the 1974 movie, Blazing Saddles, where a \nplucky group of immigrants, railroad workers, white townsfolk, and a \nblack Sheriff who pull together to save their town for those who wish \nthem harm and in turn, live safely together.

MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise to \nrecognize Fraydun Manocherian on the 75-year anniversary of his \nimmigration to the United States from Tehran, Iran and for his \nsteadfast dedication to and impactful advocacy for automobile safety. \nMr. Manocherian is also a successful entrepreneur embodying the \nAmerican Dream with his wife Jennifer, their five children, and 13 \ngrandchildren.\n  In 1932, Fraydun Manocherian emigrated to the United States at the \nage of 14 with his mother and brother. He soon became an entrepreneur \npursing the American Dream, starting his first business venture in high \nschool by buying and selling used cars. Then, while attending New York \nUniversity, he turned his sights to New York's skyline--embarking on \nhis career in real estate development.\n  He acquired three adjacent five-story walk up buildings in Manhattan \nfor $15,000 a piece which he then redeveloped. During the 1960's and \n1970's, Mr. Manocherian was one of the most prolific developers in \nManhattan. In the 1980's he expanded his ventures nationwide through \nreal estate investments and high-rise developments, among a multitude \nof other enterprises. He was the originator of the mega-health-club \nconcept, opening the first New York Health & Racquet Club in 1973, \nfollowed by ten additional Manhattan locations. He also developed The \nKimberly Suite Hotel in midtown Manhattan in 1985, and has since \nacquired other hotels which he still personally oversees.\n  However, among all this success, Mr. Manocherian is, at his core a \npublic servant and philanthropist. And it is for his accomplishments in \nautomobile safety that I, his family, and all Americans are most proud.\n  In 1951, two of Mr. Manocherian's high school friends were killed by \na drunk driver. At the age of nineteen, he turned his grief into \nactivism and became an advocate for federal funding of public education \nin traffic safety. After learning that automobile accidents were the \nnumber one killer of all young adults aged 16-25 years old, and the \nnumber one cause of physical disabilities--causing agonizing tragedy \nand grief for countless families, a 19-year-old Mr. Manocherian sent a \ntelegram to President Eisenhower. The President arranged a meeting with \nSenator Irving Ives.\n  He continued meeting with congressional leaders in Washington, D.C. \nto urge President Eisenhower's Committee on Traffic Safety to begin a \nnational mass media educational program. While his determined efforts \nand countless contributions were impressive, he was not satisfied with \nthe speed of progress. In 1962, he founded the National Road Safety \nFoundation with the purpose of reducing the 55,000 auto related \nfatalities every year. In 1970, he wrote Flesh, Metal, and Glass, a \nbook on auto safety. Over the past 50 years, more than two million \ncopies of Mr. Manocherian's book have been distributed free to \nthousands of high schools and drivers' education programs across the \ncountry. The publication has been updated several times and is now \navailable online. The National Road Safety Foundation has also produced \ndozens of educational videos and public service announcements. The book \nand videos, along with other educational materials, are still used as \nimportant tools in driver's education programs throughout the country.\n  Over the last half century, The National Road Safety Foundation has \neducated millions on how to become better and safer drivers through \ncollaborating with educators, private groups, legislators, and \ngovernment agencies to effect national standards in driving competence. \nThe National Road Safety Foundation has also played an important role \nin seat belt laws, drunken driving policy, safer car regulations, and \nhelmet and tum signal legislation for motorcycles. Mr. Manocherian has \nbeen a persuasive and influential force in Congress as this body \nenacted policies and legislation focused on driver safety.\n  Mr. Manocherian's voice was among the first to rally the nation \nagainst drunk driving and his advocacy for federal funding of public \neducation in traffic safety contributed toward passage of The Highway \nSafety Act of 1970, which established the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration. He is currently working to secure increased \nfunding from the Federal Highway Trust Fund for a sustained National \nTraffic Safety Education media program. These efforts, among countless \nothers, have helped reduce fatalities from 55,000 a year to 38,000 a \nyear. This 30 percent reduction in fatalities is astonishing \nconsidering that in that same time, the number of drivers and mile \ndriven have grown exponentially.\n  For his dedication and accomplishments in the field of auto safety, \nMr. Manocherian has received the ``Man of the Year'' award from the New \nYork Council for Civic Affairs, the ``Man of the Year'' award from the \nGreater New York Automobile Dealers Association, an Honorary Doctorate \nin Humane Letters from St. John's University, a Master of Arts degree \nfrom the International University of Communications in Washington, \nD.C., the 1997 Distinguished Service to Safety Award from the National \nSafety Council, and the 2005 Public Service Award, one of the highest \nawards given by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. He \nhas met with almost every President since President Eisenhower, is a \nfounder of the Carter Center, and was appointed by President H. W. Bush \nto serve on the National Driver Register Advisory Committee.\n  At 89 years young, Fraydun Manocherian is not only a nationally \nrecognized powerful public service advocate, but also a rated jet \npilot, and, more importantly, a greater husband, father, and \ngrandfather than businessman, entrepreneur, or philanthropist.\n  Madam Speaker, I ask my distinguished colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Fraydun Manocherian for his public service and incredible \ncontributions to society and a lifetime of dedication to automobile and \ndriver safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "IN RECOGNITION OF FRAYDUN MANOCHERIAN\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HON.

MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Fraydun Manocherian on the 75-year anniversary of his immigration to the United States from Tehran, Iran and for his steadfast dedication to and impactful advocacy for automobile safety. Mr. Manocherian is also a successful entrepreneur embodying the American Dream with his wife Jennifer, their five children, and 13 grandchildren.\n\tIn 1932, Fraydun Manocherian emigrated to the United States at the age of 14 with his mother and brother. He soon became an entrepreneur pursing the American Dream, starting his first business venture in high school by buying and selling used cars. Then, while attending New York University, he turned his sights to New York's skyline--embarking on his career in real estate development.\n\tHe acquired three adjacent five-story walk up buildings in Manhattan for $15,000 a piece which he then redeveloped. During the 1960's and 1970's, Mr. Manocherian was one of the most prolific developers in Manhattan. In the 1980's he expanded his ventures nationwide through real estate investments and high-rise developments, among a multitude of other enterprises. He was the originator of the mega-health-club concept, opening the first New York Health & Racquet Club in 1973, followed by ten additional Manhattan locations. He also developed The Kimberly Suite Hotel in midtown Manhattan in 1985, and has since acquired other hotels which he still personally oversees.\n\tHowever, among all this success, Mr. Manocherian is, at his core a public servant and philanthropist. And it is for his accomplishments in automobile safety that I, his family, and all Americans are most proud.\n\tIn 1951, two of Mr. Manocherian's high school friends were killed by a drunk driver. At the age of nineteen, he turned his grief into activism and became an advocate for federal funding of public education in traffic safety.

The publication has been updated several times and is now available online. The National Road Safety Foundation has also produced dozens of educational videos and public service announcements. The book and videos, along with other educational materials, are still used as important tools in driver's education programs throughout the country.\n\tOver the last half century, The National Road Safety Foundation has educated millions on how to become better and safer drivers through collaborating with educators, private groups, legislators, and government agencies to effect national standards in driving competence.

In 1943, The YMCA outgrew their \nsmall house and moved to a property at Chestnut and Biddle. This new \nDownriver YMCA represented the first ``family'' YMCA branch including \nboys and girls as well as men and women. Sixteen years later, they made \nthe big move to their new home in Southgate at Fort Street and Eureka, \npartnering with the YWCA. Together they built two new pools and \nimproved their offerings constantly to continue to serve the bustling \narea of Downriver. On May 11, 2003, to meet the growing needs of the \ncommunity the YMCA and the City of Southgate held the grand opening for \ntheir brand-new building, The Southgate Fun and Fitness Center.\n  Serving over 15,000 members, the Downriver Family YMCA is the largest \nbranch in Metro Detroit. This organization has supported generations of \nDownriver families from childhood well into their senior years. \nProviding after-school programs, summer camps, food drives, active \nliving classes, and activities for seniors, the Downriver Family YMCA's \ncommitment to the promotion of health and wellness has impacted the \nlives of thousands of Michiganders of all ages as they enter their \neighth decade of service to the people of Downriver.\n  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the \nDownriver Family YMCA's 80 years of service to our community.

This new Downriver YMCA represented the first ``family'' YMCA branch including boys and girls as well as men and women. Sixteen years later, they made the big move to their new home in Southgate at Fort Street and Eureka, partnering with the YWCA. Together they built two new pools and improved their offerings constantly to continue to serve the bustling area of Downriver. On May 11, 2003, to meet the growing needs of the community the YMCA and the City of Southgate held the grand opening for their brand-new building, The Southgate Fun and Fitness Center.\n\tServing over 15,000 members, the Downriver Family YMCA is the largest branch in Metro Detroit. This organization has supported generations of Downriver families from childhood well into their senior years. Providing after-school programs, summer camps, food drives, active living classes, and activities for seniors, the Downriver Family YMCA's commitment to the promotion of health and wellness has impacted the lives of thousands of Michiganders of all ages as they enter their eighth decade of service to the people of Downriver.\n\tMadam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the Downriver Family YMCA's 80 years of service to our community. The Downriver Family YMCA has been a constant in the lives of the Downriver area's children and families for decades. I extend my gratitude to the entire Downriver Family YMCA team and wish them continued success in service and healthy living for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Debbie Dingell"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "167 Cong.

This \n56th year, Pastor Roberts will be elevated to the honorable status of \nPastor Emeritus.\n  Born in Bryant, Mississippi in 1927 to George and Melvina Roberts, \nJohn E. Roberts came to Toledo, Ohio in 1944. A founding member of \nIndiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church, he has been part of the \nchurch since it was organized in 1946. As noted in his biography, ``He \nhas served and walked in the footsteps of most positions in the church, \nfrom custodian to Pastor'' and was called to pastor the church on the \n3rd Sunday of January l965. Even while Pastor, he pursued his Bachelor \nof Arts and Bachelor of Religious Education degrees in 1975, his Master \nof Theology in 1984, and his Doctorate in Biblical Theology in 1985.\n  His biography highlights his many roles in his capacity as pastor: \nteacher, preacher, counsellor, and builder.

His \nlife, with its results, is a never-failing inspiration and challenges \npeople of all ages and races, creating strong men around him.''\n  Though Pastor Roberts has been the guiding light of his congregation \nand family for decades, standing beside him always has been his wife, \nFirst Lady Mother Bernice Roberts.

Roberts came to retirement at age 93 in March of \n2021. He was the oldest serving Baptist pastor in Toledo, Lucas County, \nOhio, and the Nation.

They moved to the \nPacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1972 and raised three \nchildren, Richard, Nanette and Mark. They resided in the Palisades for \n49 years.

For \n22 years he championed this cause to ensure more veterans in the region \ncould be laid to rest closer to their families and homes. The process \nwas a labor of love and he prodded and cajoled several Secretaries of \nVeterans Affairs for years, knocking down one hurdle after another.

Madam Speaker, this year, I hosted the first-ever Asian \nand Pacific Islander Heritage Month Essay Contest for Northern Mariana \nIslands middle school and high school students. This contest gives \nstudents in my district the opportunity to showcase their writing \nskills and reflect on their unique experiences living in the Northern \nMariana Islands. This year's essay prompt encouraged students to share \nhow the Asian and Pacific Islander community has impacted them, and \nwhat the Marianas community can do to best celebrate and respect the \ndiversity in our islands.\n  I would like to congratulate the 44 students who participated. A \nvolunteer panel of judges reviewed the essays and chose Jia Ross Nicdao \nand Camille Torres Hocog as this year's winners of the middle school \nand high school division, respectively. Jia, an 8th grade student at \nAdmiral Herbert G. Hopwood Middle School, wrote about her experience as \na young Asian American in the Northern Mariana Islands. Camille, a \nsophomore at Marianas High School, wrote about diversity and unity.\n  I am proud to include in the Record the essays submitted by Jia and \nCamille:\n\n\n   Middle School Winner, Jia Ross Nicdao, Admiral Herbert G. Hopwood \n                        Middle School, 8th Grade\n\n       Even though it is a small area, the Northern Marianas \n     Islands are undeniably full of different cultures and \n     traditions. Many ethnic groups, specifically Asian citizens \n     and Pacific Islanders, proudly call the CNMI their home; they \n     comprise more than 80 percent of Saipan's population. Whether \n     you were born or migrated from a different country, we still \n     thrive as a community to empower one another.\n       My parents immigrated to the CNMI for work and started a \n     family here. My identity as Asian American has been a little \n     confusing. In the beginning, I felt as if I did not deserve \n     to be a member of the Filipino community. I felt like my \n     opinions and thoughts were invalid when discussing Filipino \n     topics because I was raised away from the area of action and \n     lived abroad. My different living situation made me feel as \n     if I do not deserve the recognition Filipinos got. I \n     struggled to find a label that I connected to, so I decided \n     to research Filipino culture. At that moment was when I found \n     out about the ethnic group that I was unknowingly part of, \n     known as Asian Americans, who are Americans with Asian \n     ancestry and/or children of immigrated parents. This \n     community was something I finally related to. On the island, \n     I never felt indifferent because of my ethnicity, which was \n     opposite to my other feelings. I was surrounded by other \n     Asians, so whenever I was around them, I felt like I belonged \n     with them. I liked that I could relate with other Asian \n     Americans through shared experiences; it gave me comfort. \n     Most of the representation here in the CNMI has been \n     positive. When I see members from this community succeed, it \n     not only impacts the view and generalization for our \n     community, but it also empowers me personally to strive for \n     that success. It pushes me to fulfill the achievements that \n     others succeeded in. It motivates me to become involved in \n     that success and also positively represent the community. I \n     am one of those community members, and I am proud to \n     represent the Asian American Community.\n       I believe one of the best ways to respect and celebrate \n     diversity in this community is by educating ourselves on each \n     other's cultures. We can set an example for other communities \n     to participate in Asian American and Pacific Islander \n     appreciation month by first doing it within the community. \n     Sharing about our experiences; getting to know each others' \n     viewpoints is an expressive way to understand each others' \n     lifestyles. Also, researching appropriate behaviors and \n     mannerism is critical to be aware of when talking to other \n     people from different countries; we should never offend \n     anyone and be disrespectful. If we remove the negative energy \n     between nationalities in the community, we can work together \n     as one and spread love with other communities. Overall, being \n     part of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community \n     comes with many responsibilities, so being one with each \n     other will help us all accomplish many goals.\n\n\n    High School Winner, Camille Torres Hocog, Marianas High School, \n                               Sophomore\n\n       The Northern Mariana Islands; an archipelago of islands in \n     the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Despite our small and rather \n     remote location, an abundance of cultures within the Asian \n     and Pacific Islander community reside here. Descendants from \n     all around the Asian-Pacific region call our islands home.\n       As a young Chamorro woman who is indigenous to these \n     islands, this place means a significant amount to me. I take \n     great pride in my roots and where I come from, for it is a \n     source of my values, confidence, goals, and morals. But \n     there's one thing about my Chamorro identity that has always \n     stuck out to me; I am a result of the perseverance of my \n     people. Among the Pacific Islands, the Marianas has the \n     longest history of colonialism. To this day, we are still \n     experiencing its lasting effects. As I grow and learn even \n     more about my heritage, the more I have an understanding of \n     who I am in this world. Each moment of understanding reminds \n     me that because of my ancestor's resilience, I want to live \n     my life in fulfilling ways that would make them and my \n     islands proud today.\n       Being from the islands also means connecting and building \n     friendships with people of different cultures, majority of \n     them being from within the API community. Reflecting on these \n     friendships made me realize how truly broad the term ``API'' \n     is, almost like it's a bigger picture. Despite all of us \n     being boxed into this term, looking a bit closer and seeing \n     the great amount of cultural diversity within this group \n     makes you realize how beautifully inclusive it is. Without a \n     doubt, there is a wealth of culture within the Asian-Pacific \n     region, and it's absolutely evident here in the Marianas. \n     Being able to share our cultural stories, arts, and \n     experiences with each other is, in my opinion, the best way \n     to celebrate our similarities and differences this month.\n       One unforgettable experience in regards to the sharing of \n     my culture would be in 2016, where I went on a student \n     exchange trip to Japan. I was in 6th grade at the time. For a \n     couple of days, I stayed with a host family of four; one mom, \n     one dad, one daughter, and one younger son. The mom was the \n     only one who spoke English. I remember they'd take me to \n     different places around their hometown, such as restaurants, \n     the park, and different Japanese sites. With them, I was able \n     to experience firsthand what it was like to live in a \n     Japanese household.\n       One morning before the daughter had to go to school, she \n     asked me to teach her some Chamorro words so that she could \n     show them to her friends. I taught her a few simple phrases \n     such as ``Hafa Adai'' and ``Buenas Dias''. Her mom translated \n     for us, and she was able to write down these words on a \n     notepad and take it with her to school.\n       Having that experience at such a young age shaped the way I \n     see culture today. It showed me that simply sharing our parts \n     of the world and understanding each other's background is, \n     again, the best way to celebrate our cultural diversities.\n       As we all know, May is a special month for us Asian and \n     Pacific Islanders. It's a month for us to celebrate our \n     achievements, contributions, and our heritage. It's an \n     occasion where many within the community open up about their \n     experiences being Asian and/or Pacific Islander. Whether it \n     be about the struggles or moments of contentment, it would be \n     the time to listen to and grasp onto our words. Despite this \n     month being named API Heritage Month, we shall continue to \n     listen to and uplift each other's voices even after May ends. \n     All throughout time, we will celebrate diversity and unity. \n     Thank you for reading.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HERITAGE MONTH \n                         ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  HON.

Reflecting on these \n     friendships made me realize how truly broad the term ``API'' \n     is, almost like it's a bigger picture. Despite all of us \n     being boxed into this term, looking a bit closer and seeing \n     the great amount of cultural diversity within this group \n     makes you realize how beautifully inclusive it is. Without a \n     doubt, there is a wealth of culture within the Asian-Pacific \n     region, and it's absolutely evident here in the Marianas. \n     Being able to share our cultural stories, arts, and \n     experiences with each other is, in my opinion, the best way \n     to celebrate our similarities and differences this month.\n       One unforgettable experience in regards to the sharing of \n     my culture would be in 2016, where I went on a student \n     exchange trip to Japan. I was in 6th grade at the time. For a \n     couple of days, I stayed with a host family of four; one mom, \n     one dad, one daughter, and one younger son. The mom was the \n     only one who spoke English. I remember they'd take me to \n     different places around their hometown, such as restaurants, \n     the park, and different Japanese sites. With them, I was able \n     to experience firsthand what it was like to live in a \n     Japanese household.\n       One morning before the daughter had to go to school, she \n     asked me to teach her some Chamorro words so that she could \n     show them to her friends. I taught her a few simple phrases \n     such as ``Hafa Adai'' and ``Buenas Dias''. Her mom translated \n     for us, and she was able to write down these words on a \n     notepad and take it with her to school.\n       Having that experience at such a young age shaped the way I \n     see culture today. It showed me that simply sharing our parts \n     of the world and understanding each other's background is, \n     again, the best way to celebrate our cultural diversities.\n       As we all know, May is a special month for us Asian and \n     Pacific Islanders. It's a month for us to celebrate our \n     achievements, contributions, and our heritage. It's an \n     occasion where many within the community open up about their \n     experiences being Asian and/or Pacific Islander. Whether it \n     be about the struggles or moments of contentment, it would be \n     the time to listen to and grasp onto our words. Despite this \n     month being named API Heritage Month, we shall continue to \n     listen to and uplift each other's voices even after May ends. \n     All throughout time, we will celebrate diversity and unity. \n     Thank you for reading.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Gregorio Kilili Camacho Sablan"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "167 Cong.

In fact, as the ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee noted when it was reported out, the legislation was ``not \nready for prime time.''\n  Rather, we took it up precisely because it deserved robust debate and \namendment. So I was glad that several of our colleagues were allowed to \noffer substantial revisions here on the floor. In particular, I am glad \nthe Democratic leader thought better of blocking Chairman Wyden and \nRanking Member Crapo from including their bipartisan provision on \ncombating illicit trade practices.\n  But I was disappointed that he proceeded with an effort to end this \nimportant debate without allowing the Senate to consider a number of \nother outstanding Republican amendments.\n  There is no practical reason our consideration of this important \nissue should have to compete for sufficient space on the Democrats' \ndance card.\n  We are talking about making America more competitive with its biggest \nand fastest growing rival. If any issue demands thorough, exhaustive \ndebate, it is this one.\n  Unfortunately, the final bill we will be voting on today will remain \nincomplete. It includes several smart, targeted measures but leaves \nmany more on the table. And so it will advance as an imperfect approach \nto an extremely consequential challenge.\n  One thing this legislation did demonstrate extremely well, however, \nwas that the rules of the Senate don't stand in the way of bipartisan \nlegislating.\n  Needless to say, final passage of this legislation cannot be the \nSenate's final word--final word on our competition with China. It \ncertainly won't be mine. As I have warned repeatedly, soft power is \nonly as strong as the hard power underpinning it.\n  The Chinese Communist Party doesn't hesitate in investing the \nproceeds of its predatory trade practices and influence campaigns \ndirectly into modernizing its hard power arsenal.\n  Over the past two decades, defense spending in Beijing has increased \nastronomically. Meanwhile, the Biden administration's proposal for \ndefense spending puts forward such a meager--meager--year-on-year \nincrease, it fails to keep pace with inflation, let alone with our \nrivals.\n  The White House request would degrade our ability to project power\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nquickly out in the Western Pacific. It would cannibalize Pacific \nDeterrence Initiative funds intended to build infrastructure and \nenhance interoperability with our partners in the region just to cover \nshortfalls elsewhere in the budget. And it would cut procurement of \ncritical munitions that are already in short supply.\n  The administration is playing a dangerous shell game, and the \npolitical consequences aren't lost on either side of the Pacific.\n  The perception that the United States might be any less than fully \ncommitted to prevailing in great power competition has left China \nemboldened and our friends in the region quite worried.\n  Here at home, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs sounded the alarm, \nwarning that great power peace was ``fraying at the edge.''\n  Preserving that peace will require more than the action we will take \ntoday. It will require this administration to get serious about funding \nour national defense. It will require major investment in the sorts of \ncutting-edge capabilities that deter those who intend harm on America \nand our allies.\n  So in the coming weeks, we will see whether Democrats' talk about \nrebuilding alliances has any substance to it. In the annual Defense \nauthorization and the appropriations process, the Senate will embrace \nthis essential debate about restoring America's hard power head-on. \nThis is a pivotal moment, not a time for half measures on America's \nnational security.\n\n\n                               January 6\n\n  Mr. President, now on another matter, today, the Homeland Security \nand Rules Committees released the conclusions of their monthslong \ninvestigation into the circumstances of the unprecedented breach of \nsecurity here at the Capitol on January 6.\n  I am grateful to our colleagues on both committees whose hard work \nmade this invaluable report possible.\n  My assessment of the terrible events of the 6th has been consistent \nfrom the beginning. I have condemned the perpetrators, as well as those \nwho enabled and encouraged them, and I have given full-throated support \nto our colleagues' bipartisan inquiry, along with the work of Federal \ninvestigators and prosecutors, to ensure that every criminal \nparticipant faces justice.\n  The Rules and Homeland Security report identifies a number of serious \nshortcomings in Capitol security that were exposed and exploited on the \n6th. It directs our attention to the most glaring gaps that could leave \nthe complex vulnerable to future incidents.\n  Through the efforts of the Capitol Police, the Senate Sergeant At \nArms, and other institutional partners, the Senate's work to close \nthese gaps is already well underway. The committee's inquiry into \nJanuary 6 is ongoing, and the nationwide search for a new Chief of the \nCapitol Police is making progress. Our colleagues' latest findings \nshould guide the entire institution's ongoing security reviews.\n  Today's report is one of the many reasons I am confident in the \nability of existing investigations to uncover all actionable facts \nabout the events of January 6. I will continue to support these efforts \nover any that seek to politicize the process, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

And it would cut procurement of critical munitions that are already in short supply.\n\tThe administration is playing a dangerous shell game, and the political consequences aren't lost on either side of the Pacific.\n\tThe perception that the United States might be any less than fully committed to prevailing in great power competition has left China emboldened and our friends in the region quite worried.\n\tHere at home, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs sounded the alarm, warning that great power peace was ``fraying at the edge.''\n\tPreserving that peace will require more than the action we will take today. It will require this administration to get serious about funding our national defense. It will require major investment in the sorts of cutting-edge capabilities that deter those who intend harm on America and our allies.\n\tSo in the coming weeks, we will see whether Democrats' talk about rebuilding alliances has any substance to it. In the annual Defense authorization and the appropriations process, the Senate will embrace this essential debate about restoring America's hard power head-on. This is a pivotal moment, not a time for half measures on America's national security.\n\n\n                               January 6\n\n\tMr. President, now on another matter, today, the Homeland Security and Rules Committees released the conclusions of their monthslong investigation into the circumstances of the unprecedented breach of security here at the Capitol on January 6.\n\tI am grateful to our colleagues on both committees whose hard work made this invaluable report possible.\n\tMy assessment of the terrible events of the 6th has been consistent from the beginning. I have condemned the perpetrators, as well as those who enabled and encouraged them, and I have given full-throated support to our colleagues' bipartisan inquiry, along with the work of Federal investigators and prosecutors, to ensure that every criminal participant faces justice.\n\tThe Rules and Homeland Security report identifies a number of serious shortcomings in Capitol security that were exposed and exploited on the 6th. It directs our attention to the most glaring gaps that could leave the complex vulnerable to future incidents.\n\tThrough the efforts of the Capitol Police, the Senate Sergeant At Arms, and other institutional partners, the Senate's work to close these gaps is already well underway. The committee's inquiry into January 6 is ongoing, and the nationwide search for a new Chief of the Capitol Police is making progress. Our colleagues' latest findings should guide the entire institution's ongoing security reviews.\n\tToday's report is one of the many reasons I am confident in the ability of existing investigations to uncover all actionable facts about the events of January 6. I will continue to support these efforts over any that seek to politicize the process, and I would urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, one of the major responsibilities of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, is the selection of judges \nto serve our Nation. It is important not only because it is a question \nof measuring their standards of integrity, honesty, and judgment but \nalso because these are lifetime appointments. Literally, the women and \nmen who are chosen for these slots will have an impact on the future of \nAmerica in their courts which could last for many years and decades. \nThat is why we are careful with the Biden administration to not only \nbring good nominees before the Committee but to make certain they bring \nthe necessary qualities.\n  This week, the Senate will consider several of President Biden's \njudicial nominees. I believe they understand the role of a judge in our \nsystem. They will bring much needed experiential and demographic \ndiversity to our Nation's courts.\n  I have tried throughout my career, and many others like me have \ntried, to choose men and women for the bench who will reflect the \ndiversity of America. The face of justice is often as important as the \nfact of justice, and if people appearing before our courts feel that \nthere is at least a chance for success based on the background and \nexperience of a judge, I think it is a positive thing.\n  Given the background of these judges in trying cases, arguing \nappeals, and issuing rulings from the bench, I believe, and the \ncommittee agreed, that these judicial nominees are ready for service.\n  Today, I would like to speak in support of two of them: Julien Neals, \nnominated to the District Court of New Jersey, and Regina Rodriguez, \nnominated to the District Court of Colorado.\n  New Jersey is really in desperate need of Federal judges. They are \nfacing a judicial emergency. In each of the States' six judicial \nvacancies, they have been designated as a judicial emergency status by \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.\n  Today, we can begin to address this judicial emergency by finally \nconfirming Julien Neals to the U.S. District Court for the District of \nNew Jersey. He is an extraordinary public servant. He has served the \npeople of the State of New Jersey for decades. As an expert in \nmunicipal law, he handled several legal disputes that were tried to \nverdict, judgment, or final decision, including multiple--multiple--\njury trials. He was the chief judge of the Newark Municipal Court. He \npresided over 6,000 cases in that capacity.\n  He received a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' from the \nAmerican Bar Association. He has the strong support of his home State \nSenators, Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez. He has received broad \nbipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee, with five Republicans \njoining all the Democrats in supporting his nomination.\n  I urge my colleagues to support him.\n  This week, the Senate will also consider the nomination of Regina \nRodriguez to be a judge in the District Court of Colorado. What a life \nstory she brings. Ms. Rodriguez is the daughter of a Japanese-American \nmother, whose family was interned during World War II, and a Mexican-\nAmerican father who was one of the first Hispanic coaches in the \nNational Football League. Her father's job as a coach took the family \nacross the country.\n  Although Ms. Rodriguez was born in Colorado, she spent several of her \nformative years in my home State of Illinois. When she was 17 years \nold, Ms. Rodriguez thought she might want to be a lawyer, so she put on \nher best suit, as she says, and knocked on doors in Macomb, IL, until \nshe found a lawyer who said: ``Come on in. I'll show you the ropes.''\n  Lucky for us, Ms. Rodriguez held on to that passion that first \ndeveloped when she was a teenager. Over the past 30 years, she has \nserved as a talented litigator who has tried 35 cases to verdict.\n  She has a range of experience in government and the private sector. \nIn the public sector, she served as an assistant U.S. attorney and rose \nto become the first Latina Chief of the Civil Division of the U.S. \nAttorney's Office for the District of Colorado. In private practice, \nshe represented a broad array of clients, from individuals to Fortune \n500 firms. During her tenure as a litigator, Ms. Rodriguez has \ndemonstrated that she understands the importance of applying the law to \nthe facts in a fair manner. She has represented plaintiffs, defendants, \ngovernment, and those who have sued the government. As a woman of \ncolor, she has risen as a partner in several leading law firms--no mean \nfeat.\n  Ms. Rodriguez has taken out time from her demanding schedule to \nmentor young attorneys, just as that lawyer in Macomb, IL, did for her.\n  She has received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, as well as positive\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\nblue slips from both Senators Bennet and Hickenlooper. Her nomination \nis also supported by the National Asian Pacific American Bar \nAssociation, the Latinas First Foundation, and the Colorado Lawyers \nCommittee.\n  She has earned support across the aisle. On May 20, Ms. Rodriguez was \nvoted out of the committee by a vote of 17 to 5, with the support of \nsix of my Republican colleagues.\n  When confirmed, she will be the first Asian-American judge to serve \nnot only in the District of Colorado but in the entire Tenth Circuit. \nHer historic, well-deserved confirmation will bring our Federal \njudiciary closer to reflecting the lives and experiences of all \nAmericans. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for Ms. \nRodriguez's nomination.\n  The judicial nominees we are voting on this week illustrate something \nthat is substantial and profound. They illustrate that President Joe \nBiden is dedicated to appointing legal experts with outstanding \ncredentials and a wealth of experience.\n  During his first several months in office, President Biden has \nnominated public servants who will bring to the bench a variety of \nprofessional perspectives and personal experiences. Too often, those \nthings have been missing in previous nominees. By confirming judges who \nreflect the experience of all Americans and who demonstrate fealty to \nthe rule of law, we can continue building a justice system that works \nfor everyone.\n  Over the last 4 years, we have seen a concerted effort on the \nRepublican side to fill vacancies. They broke records, in some \nrespects, in the number of nominees that they brought before the Senate \nfor approval. Some of the records are not ones to be proud of, from my \nperspective, and 10 of the nominees who were submitted for \nconsideration during the last 4 years before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee were found unqualified by the American Bar Association. \nNevertheless, most of them made it to the bench in lifetime \nappointments.\n  Many nominees came before us, of the Trump administration, who were \nseeking lifetime appointments to become a trial judge and had no \npersonal experience in a courtroom. It is hard to imagine that anyone \nwould be thrust into that situation and expected to perform as a \nprofessional. Imagine, if you will, the parties to those lawsuits, many \nof whom stake their lives and reputations on the outcome, to find a \njudge who couldn't find their way through the Code of Civil Procedure \nif they were forced to. That, unfortunately, was the standard that was \nused. As long as these nominees in the past had the blessing of the so-\ncalled Federalist Society, that was good enough for many of my \nRepublican colleagues.\n  Joe Biden is really responding to that by suggesting nominees who \nmeet much higher standards. I want to work with the Biden \nadministration to continue in that tradition, so at the end of the day \nwe can fill the vacancies with women and men who are not only competent \nand honest but have the integrity and experience, both legal and \notherwise, to serve our Nation for the rest of their lives, should they \nchoose, in these judicial capacities.\n  I commend these two nominees who passed out of our committee with a \nstrong bipartisan votes. To my colleagues on the floor today, I hope \nthey will join me in supporting them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I am grateful \nto Senators Klobuchar, Blunt, Peters, and Portman and the two Senate \ncommittees that they lead for their bipartisan investigation into the \nevents of January 6, and for producing a detailed report in a short \namount of time. The report makes clear that there is more work ahead \nfor the committees. More importantly, it also highlights the immense \nbravery of the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police who defended \nthe Capitol Complex on January 6.\n  In the coming days, after a thorough review of the 100-page report, I \nwill discuss its recommendations with my colleagues and work to \ninstitute reforms that will make a meaningful change to better protect \nthe U.S. Capitol\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Judicial Nominations\n\n\tMr. DURBIN.

All told, the Biden budget proposes at \nleast 30 separate tax increases, ranging from a hike in the capital \ngains tax to a hike in the top income tax rate, to a new death tax. And \nit would raise taxes on middle-class families by allowing the tax \nrelief the Republicans passed in 2017 to expire.\n  Under the Biden budget, in just a few short years, working Americans \ncould be facing thousands of dollars in higher taxes. All these tax \nhikes, of course, are an attempt to pay for the Biden administration's \nnew spending.\n  Under the Biden budget, government spending would exceed $6 trillion \nevery year. To put that in perspective, the total--total--Federal \nbudget in 2019 was $4.4 trillion. An increase to $6 trillion plus per \nyear--$8.2 trillion by 2031--is a massive, massive hike in Federal \nspending.\n  Over the course of the Biden budget, government spending would equal \naround 25 percent of our gross domestic product--far exceeding the \naverage of the past five decades for spending, as a percentage of our \ntotal economic outlook.\n  So what would the consequences of all this spending look like? Well, \nI have already mentioned the $3.6 trillion in new tax hikes. Another \nwould be the deficits, which would exceed $1.3 trillion every year for \nthe next 10 years. By 2031, the end of the Biden budget window, our \ndebt would be--get ready for this--$39 trillion. Our debt would equal \n117 percent of the U.S. economy--again, the highest level in our \nNation's history, debt to GDP.\n  The interest payments on the debt would triple over the next 10 years \nto $914 billion. That is right. By 2031, we would be paying nearly $1 \ntrillion a year just in interest on the debt. That is more money than \nour Nation will spend on Medicare this year.\n  So let's review. The Biden budget equals taxes, spending, and debt. \nAnd here is the real kicker: The Biden budget hikes taxes, hikes \nspending, and drives up the debt for pretty much nothing. That is \nright. After an initial good year or two, the Biden budget projects \npermanently weak economic growth. For a majority of the next 10 years, \neconomic growth wouldn't even hit 2 percent.\n  All that government spending and debt isn't going to result in \nprosperity. It is going to result in permanent economic stagnation, and \nthat means permanently diminished opportunities for American families, \nfewer jobs, lower wages, and weaker career prospects.\n  Democrats like to talk as if government can provide security and \nsalvation. But the truth is, government is not an engine of prosperity. \nGovernment might serve as a safety net in difficult circumstances, but \ngovernment will never make you prosperous. It is a robust economy, not \na robust government, that would produce prosperity, that would produce \nthe good jobs and good salaries and good benefits and good careers.\n  That is why one of the most important jobs of government is creating \nthe conditions that will allow the economy to flourish. That is what \nRepublicans worked to do with the tax relief that we passed in 2017. \nAnd, as we saw before the pandemic hit, it was working.\n  The Biden budget, on the other hand, focuses on creating a \nflourishing government, and the economy would pay the price. And \nworking Americans would face a future of diminished earnings and \nreduced opportunity.\n  There is a lot more that could be said about the Biden budget. I \nhaven't even mentioned the diminished investment\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\nin our national defense, which could have very serious consequences for \nour national security.\n  Less than 3 years ago, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy \nCommission released a report warning--warning--that our readiness had \neroded to the point where we might struggle to win the war against a \nmajor power like Russia or China. And while we have made some real \nprogress since then, we still have a lot of work to do to ensure that \nour military is prepared to defend our Nation and meet the threats of \nthe 21st century. The Biden budget would send us right back to the \nsituation that we faced 3 years ago.\n  I guess it is not surprising that a budget that fails to be serious \nabout fiscal realities would fail to be serious about national security \nrealities, but it is deeply concerning that the President doesn't seem \nto understand the importance of investing in our national defense.\n  President Biden has made the priorities of liberal interest groups \nthe top priorities for his administration--whether that is canceling \nthe Keystone XL's good-paying jobs and economic growth to please the \nenvironmental left or overturning the Mexico City policy so that \ntaxpayer dollars can go to fund abortions overseas.\n  On the question of abortion, President Biden's budget abandons \ndecades of bipartisan compromise and eliminates the Hyde amendment, \nwhich protects taxpayers from having their tax dollars used to fund \nabortions here at home. You would think that if we can't agree that the \nhuman rights of unborn children should be protected, we should at least \nagree that a taxpayer shouldn't be forced to pay for the killing of \nunborn children.\n  Almost 60 percent of Americans oppose using taxpayer dollars to pay \nfor abortions, but President Biden has made it clear that his \nallegiance to the radical abortion left trumps the opinions of the \nAmerican people. So his budget eliminates the Hyde amendment and \nimposes a number of other pro-abortion measures, like additional \ngovernment funding access for the Nation's largest abortion provider, \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  The Biden budget might be good news for liberal interest groups, but \nit is bad news for the American people and bad news for our country. I \nhope that my Democratic colleagues will think twice before forcing this \nmassive government expansion onto the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Padilla). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BENNET.

It is a robust economy, not a robust government, that would produce prosperity, that would produce the good jobs and good salaries and good benefits and good careers.\n\tThat is why one of the most important jobs of government is creating the conditions that will allow the economy to flourish. That is what Republicans worked to do with the tax relief that we passed in 2017. And, as we saw before the pandemic hit, it was working.\n\tThe Biden budget, on the other hand, focuses on creating a flourishing government, and the economy would pay the price. And working Americans would face a future of diminished earnings and reduced opportunity.\n\tThere is a lot more that could be said about the Biden budget. I haven't even mentioned the diminished investment in our national defense, which could have very serious consequences for our national security.\n\tLess than 3 years ago, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission released a report warning--warning--that our readiness had eroded to the point where we might struggle to win the war against a major power like Russia or China. And while we have made some real progress since then, we still have a lot of work to do to ensure that our military is prepared to defend our Nation and meet the threats of the 21st century. The Biden budget would send us right back to the situation that we faced 3 years ago.\n\tI guess it is not surprising that a budget that fails to be serious about fiscal realities would fail to be serious about national security realities, but it is deeply concerning that the President doesn't seem to understand the importance of investing in our national defense.\n\tPresident Biden has made the priorities of liberal interest groups the top priorities for his administration--whether that is canceling the Keystone XL's good-paying jobs and economic growth to please the environmental left or overturning the Mexico City policy so that taxpayer dollars can go to fund abortions overseas.\n\tOn the question of abortion, President Biden's budget abandons decades of bipartisan compromise and eliminates the Hyde amendment, which protects taxpayers from having their tax dollars used to fund abortions here at home. You would think that if we can't agree that the human rights of unborn children should be protected, we should at least agree that a taxpayer shouldn't be forced to pay for the killing of unborn children.\n\tAlmost 60 percent of Americans oppose using taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions, but President Biden has made it clear that his allegiance to the radical abortion left trumps the opinions of the American people. So his budget eliminates the Hyde amendment and imposes a number of other pro-abortion measures, like additional government funding access for the Nation's largest abortion provider, Planned Parenthood.\n\tThe Biden budget might be good news for liberal interest groups, but it is bad news for the American people and bad news for our country. I hope that my Democratic colleagues will think twice before forcing this massive government expansion onto the American people.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

This bill \nwill provide much needed assistance to the employees of the \nIntelligence Community, the State Department, and other Federal \nAgencies who have suffered from often debilitating brain injuries at \nthe hands of our foreign adversaries.

He has \nbeen relentless in his pursuit of care for these injured public \nservants who risk their lives for us, who serve in difficult and \ndangerous environments. Senator Warner and the vice chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee, Senator Rubio, and Senator Shaheen of \nNew Hampshire worked with me to draft the bill that the Senate \nunanimously cleared last night.\n  We are very pleased that the following Senators cosponsored our \nlegislation: Senators Cornyn, Bennet, Burr, Gillibrand, Blunt, \nHeinrich, Sasse, Feinstein, Cotton, King, Risch, Durbin, Scott, \nMenendez, Blumenthal, and Hassan. I mentioned those cosponsors to show \nthe breadth of concern in the Senate about these injured employees.\n  For several years, American personnel serving our country in Cuba, \nChina, and elsewhere have experienced unexplained, serious medical \nharm, including, in some cases, permanent brain injuries. Their \nconditions are believed to be the consequence of a mysterious, directed \nenergy weapon used by an adversary.\n  As we investigate the source of previous attacks and seek to prevent \nfuture ones, the bill that passed the Senate last night would provide \nadditional medical care and financial compensation to Americans who \ncontinue to experience debilitating symptoms as a result of these \nheinous attacks.\n  The injuries that many of these victims have endured are significant \nand life-altering. I have talked with many of these victims. They have \ndescribed debilitating headaches, a loss of vision, a decreased ability \nto hear, dizziness, and many other symptoms as well, including a \ndecline in their cognitive abilities. In some cases, they have been \nforced to medically retire. In other cases, they somehow continue on \nwhile coping with these symptoms.\n  I have spoken several times to CIA Director Burns and the Director of \nNational Intelligence, Haines, about these attacks, and I am heartened \nby the commitments that they have made to me and to other members of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee to care for the victims and to \nidentify the perpetrators and the weapon used in these attacks.\n  We can speculate. We have our suspicions. But the fact is, we do not \nknow exactly what the weapon is nor who is wielding it. We need a \nwhole-of-government approach to identify the adversary who is targeting \nour American personnel, and I am grateful to the chairman and vice \nchair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who I know are committed to \ngetting to the bottom of these attacks.\n  I hope, when President Biden meets with President Putin, that he will \nask President Putin about these attacks, that he will grill him about \nthem to see if the Russians are responsible. At this point, we don't \nknow.\n  The public servants who work in our embassies and consulates overseas \nmake many personal sacrifices to represent America's interests. They \ndeserve our unwavering support when they are harmed in the line of \nduty, just as we care for soldiers who are injured on the battlefield. \nLast night, we took an important step in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to echo what my good friend\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\nand colleague, Senator Collins, has already said. Let me be clear. She \npointed out the virtual unanimous support this legislation has from \nmembers of the Intelligence Committee--both sides. Let there be no \nmistake in terms of who was the relentless driver--some might even say \n``persistent-beyond-belief driver'' of this issue. It was Susan \nCollins, and, once again, her service shows that she is standing up for \nAmerica's diplomats and the intel community serving our country around \nthe world who, as Senator Collins already indicated, have been involved \nin dangerous incidents resulting in brain trauma and other unexplained \nillnesses. We have called it the Havana syndrome\n  The remarkable thing is that for nearly 5 years, we have been aware \nof these reports, and we have seen, as the Senator mentioned, attacks \non U.S. personnel in Cuba, in China, and around the world. We have \nthese reports here in this country, and rather than disappearing or \ngoing down in number, they actually appear to be increasing.\n  Five years after the start of this effort, we don't know what \nhappened, we don't know who did it, and we don't know what kind of \ndevice was used.\n  This is wrong. Particularly, I want to point out--this is an area \nwhere, again, we were in bipartisan agreement--that under the last \nadministration, we just didn't treat these victims from the intel \ncommunity, the State Department, and DOD with the seriousness they \ndeserved.\n  As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know the \nhardships, sacrifices, and risks our intelligence officers, diplomats, \nand other personnel serving overseas endure--often anonymously, often \nwithout recognition.\n  The fact that some of these brave women and men have been subjected \nto these serious health issues by unknown attackers is unacceptable. \nThat their own government did not believe them when they were injured \nor denied them proper medical attention and care is beyond the pale. \nThese are folks who were injured while serving our government and, in \nsome cases, facing lifelong health consequences, and, for a while, we \njust got blown off. It is inexcusable that they were treated this way, \nand it is outrageous that we still don't know who did it or what tool \nwas used in these attacks.\n  Their country, after their service, needs to have their backs. With \nSenator Collins's legislation--now that it has passed the Senate, and \nour hope is that it will soon pass the House--we will show that the \ncountry will have their backs.\n  I also want to give credit to the new CIA Director, Ambassador Burns, \nfor making this a top priority. On the Senate Intelligence Committee, \nthere is complete bipartisan unanimity on this issue. We are going to \nensure that the United States gets to the bottom of this, identifies \nthose responsible for those attacks on American personnel, holds them \naccountable, and ensures that these attacks on American personnel stop \nonce and for all.\n  Let me echo what Senator Collins said. This should be one in an ever \ngrowing list of topics that President Biden ought to raise with \nPresident Putin.\n  We must protect our people around the globe. At the same time, it is \nmore important than ever that the United States also provides those \naffected by these attacks with the medical and financial support they \ndeserve. Again, that is why Senator Collins' legislation, the HAVANA \nAct, is so important.\n  Let me echo again what Senator Collins said. My partner in this, as \nwell, has been Vice Chairman Rubio, and our good friend Senator \nShaheen. The fact that this passed this quickly, unanimously, is \nextraordinarily important, but it is just the first step in having the \nbacks of our diplomats, our intel personnel, our DOD, and, for that \nmatter, anyone who has been a victim of this kind of activity. Again, I \nwant to thank Senator Collins for her leadership on this issue. I can \nassure you, as Senator Collins said and Senator Rubio and I have \nrepeated a number of number of times, the Intelligence Committee of the \nSenate is going to get to the bottom of this. We are going to make \nsure--and we have taken a giant step on this by passing this \nlegislation--that the personnel will get the medical and, if necessary, \nfinancial assistance they need; that we are going to find out who did \nit, we are going to find out what type of device, and we are going to \nhold them accountable.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act\n\n\tMs. COLLINS.

We need a whole-of-government approach to identify the adversary who is targeting our American personnel, and I am grateful to the chairman and vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who I know are committed to getting to the bottom of these attacks.\n\tI hope, when President Biden meets with President Putin, that he will ask President Putin about these attacks, that he will grill him about them to see if the Russians are responsible. At this point, we don't know.\n\tThe public servants who work in our embassies and consulates overseas make many personal sacrifices to represent America's interests. They deserve our unwavering support when they are harmed in the line of duty, just as we care for soldiers who are injured on the battlefield. Last night, we took an important step in that direction.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\tMr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to echo what my good friend and colleague, Senator Collins, has already said. Let me be clear. She pointed out the virtual unanimous support this legislation has from members of the Intelligence Committee--both sides. Let there be no mistake in terms of who was the relentless driver--some might even say ``persistent-beyond-belief driver'' of this issue. It was Susan Collins, and, once again, her service shows that she is standing up for America's diplomats and the intel community serving our country around the world who, as Senator Collins already indicated, have been involved in dangerous incidents resulting in brain trauma and other unexplained illnesses. We have called it the Havana syndrome\n\tThe remarkable thing is that for nearly 5 years, we have been aware of these reports, and we have seen, as the Senator mentioned, attacks on U.S. personnel in Cuba, in China, and around the world. We have these reports here in this country, and rather than disappearing or going down in number, they actually appear to be increasing.\n\tFive years after the start of this effort, we don't know what happened, we don't know who did it, and we don't know what kind of device was used.\n\tThis is wrong. Particularly, I want to point out--this is an area where, again, we were in bipartisan agreement--that under the last administration, we just didn't treat these victims from the intel community, the State Department, and DOD with the seriousness they deserved.\n\tAs chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know the hardships, sacrifices, and risks our intelligence officers, diplomats, and other personnel serving overseas endure--often anonymously, often without recognition.\n\tThe fact that some of these brave women and men have been subjected to these serious health issues by unknown attackers is unacceptable. That their own government did not believe them when they were injured or denied them proper medical attention and care is beyond the pale. These are folks who were injured while serving our government and, in some cases, facing lifelong health consequences, and, for a while, we just got blown off. It is inexcusable that they were treated this way, and it is outrageous that we still don't know who did it or what tool was used in these attacks.\n\tTheir country, after their service, needs to have their backs. With Senator Collins's legislation--now that it has passed the Senate, and our hope is that it will soon pass the House--we will show that the country will have their backs.\n\tI also want to give credit to the new CIA Director, Ambassador Burns, for making this a top priority. On the Senate Intelligence Committee, there is complete bipartisan unanimity on this issue. We are going to ensure that the United States gets to the bottom of this, identifies those responsible for those attacks on American personnel, holds them accountable, and ensures that these attacks on American personnel stop once and for all.\n\tLet me echo what Senator Collins said. This should be one in an ever growing list of topics that President Biden ought to raise with President Putin.\n\tWe must protect our people around the globe. At the same time, it is more important than ever that the United States also provides those affected by these attacks with the medical and financial support they deserve. Again, that is why Senator Collins' legislation, the HAVANA Act, is so important.\n\tLet me echo again what Senator Collins said. My partner in this, as well, has been Vice Chairman Rubio, and our good friend Senator Shaheen. The fact that this passed this quickly, unanimously, is extraordinarily important, but it is just the first step in having the backs of our diplomats, our intel personnel, our DOD, and, for that matter, anyone who has been a victim of this kind of activity. Again, I want to thank Senator Collins for her leadership on this issue. I can assure you, as Senator Collins said and Senator Rubio and I have repeated a number of number of times, the Intelligence Committee of the Senate is going to get to the bottom of this. We are going to make sure--and we have taken a giant step on this by passing this legislation--that the personnel will get the medical and, if necessary, financial assistance they need; that we are going to find out who did it, we are going to find out what type of device, and we are going to hold them accountable.\n\tWith that, I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in January of 2020, when reports began \nto circulate about the coronavirus, I instructed my oversight and \ninvestigations staff to get a classified briefing from the Department \nof Health and Human Services' Office of National Security. Around that \nsame time, I publicly said that there were signs that the virus could \ndevelop into a worldwide threat.

We lost over 500,000 of our \nfellow Americans, and this body has spent trillions of dollars to \nsupport the U.S. economy during the pandemic.\n  We the people have an absolute right to know everything that the U.S. \nGovernment knows about the origins of the coronavirus. On March 8, \n2021, I wrote to the Director of National Intelligence and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services requesting all intelligence, \namong other requests, relating to what the government knows about the \norigin of the coronavirus. I received some intelligence product, and \nthat product causes very serious concern and further supports my belief \nthat the ongoing review of its origin can't leave any stone unturned. \nThe effort must be a whole-of-government approach.\n  In response to my letter, the National Institutes of Health, an \nAgency within the Department of Health and Human Services, stated that \nit hasn't funded gain-of-function research on the coronavirus. Recent \nreports have cast doubts on that position.\n  Dr. Fauci's unit provided $3.4 million in taxpayer grants to a \nresearch organization called EcoHealth Alliance. That group then issued \nsubgrants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It has been reported that \nfrom this $3.4 million, somewhere between $600,000 and $826,000 was \nsent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That money, by the way, is \nU.S. taxpayer money. It was spent on researching bat coronaviruses.\n  As the Wall Street Journal noted last week, it is likely that the \nWuhan Institute of Virology was doing gain-of-function research. If \ntrue, that research could have strengthened the virus to the version \nthat caused the global pandemic.\n  Dr. Fauci has said that Chinese scientists are trustworthy, that ``we \ngenerally always trust the grantee to do what they say,'' and that ``I \ncan't guarantee that a grantee hasn't lied to us because you never \nknow.'' He also said, ``I can't guarantee everything that is going on \nin the Wuhan lab, we can't do that.'' What complete nonsense and a mess \nthat it is.\n  Well, Dr. Fauci, why can't you know what is going on inside the Wuhan \nplant if you are going to send taxpayers' money to do it?

We know that \nsending money to any entity affiliated with the Chinese Government is a \nrisky proposition, which is why any sign of any taxpayer money sent to \nthe Chinese Government should be subject to the most rigorous and \ncomprehensive oversight.\n  If Dr. Fauci and his team know that taxpayer money is going to the \nChinese Government, what steps did he and they take to oversee how that \nmoney was used? Well, that question is exactly what I asked in my March \n8, 2021, letter to the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS \nfailed to answer what, if any, oversight was done.\n  In my followup letter to the Department of Health and Human Services \non May 26 of this year, I stated the following:\n\n       Your letter failed to describe the steps the Department of \n     Health and Human Services took to oversee the research done \n     at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in light of it being \n     funded by the taxpayer.\n\n  The taxpayers expect the Federal Government to, at a minimum, know \nwhat their money is buying.\n  Congress expects the Federal Government to perform aggressive \noversight, especially when the funded research involves highly \ninfectious and deadly viruses. Furthermore, if no oversight were \nperformed, then that would call into question the government's \nconfidence that no gain-of-function research was supported by \ntaxpayers' dollars, because that is what I was told by the HHS.\n  The people have a right to know what the government knows about the \norigins of the coronavirus. The people have a right to know if Dr. \nFauci and other government officials were derelict in their duty to \nconduct oversight of the money that they knew would end up with the \nCommunist Chinese Government.\n  Dr. Fauci is constantly going on television to talk about anything \nthat he wants to talk about.

Madam President, I come to the floor, hopefully today \nwill be the day we wrap up debate on the America Competes-Endless \nFrontier legislation now known as the USICA, United States Innovation \nand Competition Act of 2021. We come to talk about this now, primarily \nbecause we know that the research dollars invested today are going to \ndecide the jobs of the future. And we know that we all believe a \nsignificant increase in the investment in research and development \ndollars will help us spur innovation, continue to help us compete, and \ncontinue to be competitive in key sectors of our economy that are so \nimportant to us.\n  We know that we have been having this debate literally now for more \nthan a decade, starting with President Bush's 2006 report saying \nAmerica needed to invest more in the National Science Foundation. And \nat the time, I am pretty sure we thought we were in a track meet where \nour competitor was maybe half a lap behind us\n  I am pretty sure now, as the decade has moved on, we are looking over \nour shoulder and realizing that the competition is gaining. So we need \nto make this investment in research and development to stay \ncompetitive, to grow jobs for tomorrow, and solve some of our most \npressing problems, whether that is climate change, national security on \ncyber issues, or the advent and usage of artificial intelligence and \nwhat that will mean both for our opportunities and for our challenges.\n  So we are making a renewed commitment to the National Science \nFoundation. I thank my colleagues again, Senator Schumer and Senator \nYoung, for\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\ntheir innovative legislation. They are telling us a couple of things. \nThey are saying, one, invest more money in research and development, so \nthis bill not only increases the NSF budget, it increases DOE's budget \nand increases the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency's funding as \nwell by $17.5 billion.\n  So it is saying, yes, basic research is still very important. But it \nis also saying, for the first time, we need to get more out of the \nresearch that we do, and we need to have more translational science, \nthat is, taking the basic research and applied research and actually \nusing the applications of that in a more robust way so that we can \ntranslate more of that into actual science and manufacturing.\n  Why is this so important? Because we know that our competitiveness as \na nation is suffering from the fact that people are looking at our own \nresearch and development. They are looking at our teachings and our \npublishing at universities and actually going and implementing this. So \nwe need to do better on tech transfer.\n  This underlying legislation not only helps us do that by helping to \nhelp universities who are our No. 1 research partner with Federal \ndollars, it allows those universities to help us with more tech \ntransfer in innovative ways, that universities not just do the \nresearch, but help commercialize it. It also makes investments and \nhelping them protect the patenting of that critical information, so no \nlonger having that patentable information used in other places around \nthe globe, but actually capitalizing on the jobs here in the United \nStates.\n  It also makes a huge investment in STEM, the science, technology, \nengineering, and math jobs that we need for the future. And clearly, \nyou can't make a major investment in research and development if you \ndon't have the workforce to carry it out. And we need a workforce to \ncarry it out. So this underlying legislation helps us not only \ndiversify our workforce by a major investment in STEM, going from an \nannual budget of about $1 billion in the year 2020 to about $4 billion \na year by 2026. So we are going to get a more diversified STEM \nworkforce with women and minorities participating.\n  And we are also trying to distribute more of our engineering and \nscience capacity around the United States. Our colleagues, Senators \nSchumer and Young, were adamant that we also look at innovation \ninfrastructure happening in more regional places in the United States, \nwhere they may not currently have the R&D capability of some of our \nmajor institutions.\n  So this legislation promises 20 percent of the research and \ninvestment dollars go to those EPSCoR states, Established Program to \nStimulate Competitive Research, an already identified landmark in how \nwe distribute research dollars, that tries to grow the regional \nresearch infrastructure in more places in the United States. Again, I \nthank my colleagues Senator Wicker for leading the charge on that and \nhelping us make that investment. And it also triples the Manufacturing \nExtension Partnership Program, so that we get more out of manufacturing \nworkforce training and resiliency of our supply chain for the future.\n  As I mentioned before we left, it also includes an authorization for \nNASA and the Artemis mission and making sure that we are staying \ncompetitive. As Senator Nelson said in a House hearing on our mission \nand challenges, as China has made it clear, they are going to Mars, we \nare going back to the Moon to ready ourselves to go to Mars, and we \nthink that it, too, deserves the funding and support to make us \ncompetitive.\n  I think the bottom line here is that we know that American innovation \ndrives the economy of the future. In a lot of ways, in passing this \nlegislation today--and just so our colleagues know, we will have a \ncouple of votes here before we get to a final passage--we really are \ndoing our part.\n  People hopefully will support this legislation enthusiastically, well \npast the majority of Members, because you believe in the history of the \nUnited States research and development that we have achieved innovation \ngoals--whether that was what we did with the internet, whether that was \nwhat we have done on biosciences, even on some of our issues as it \nrelates to energy. We have achieved big breakthroughs.\n  So today's vote is about investing in that innovation economy of the \nfuture. I am pretty confident because I have met some of these \ninnovators across the United States. I don't know if everything that we \nhave done so far will be absorbed by universities, our researchers, and \nour labs, but literally, we are trying to dust off R&D skills and make \nthem more competitive for today.\n  I guarantee you, though, these dollars that reach American \nentrepreneurs, who reach American innovators, they are ready and \nwilling to take up this challenge. Give them those collaborative \nresearch resources through innovation at universities, through tech \nhubs, through more collaboration on workforce training, through \ninvestments in semiconductors, and I guarantee you these entrepreneurs \nin America will innovate our economy and create the economies of the \nfuture.\n  And what is at stake? If my colleagues have a better idea, I am \nwilling to hear it. But I know this: Americans want us to lead on their \nregional economies, on the U.S. economies, and on global economies. \nThey do not want to get left behind. They look at this time and era as \na challenge to the leadership we have provided in the past.\n  So settling for Federal investment being near their lowest point as a \npercentage of GDP in 60 years won't cut it. What cuts it is making an \ninvestment in R&D and empowering those entrepreneurs so they will \ncreate those future economies.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Endless Frontier Act\n\n\tMs. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the floor, hopefully today will be the day we wrap up debate on the America Competes-Endless Frontier legislation now known as the USICA, United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021. We come to talk about this now, primarily because we know that the research dollars invested today are going to decide the jobs of the future. And we know that we all believe a significant increase in the investment in research and development dollars will help us spur innovation, continue to help us compete, and continue to be competitive in key sectors of our economy that are so important to us.\n\tWe know that we have been having this debate literally now for more than a decade, starting with President Bush's 2006 report saying America needed to invest more in the National Science Foundation. And at the time, I am pretty sure we thought we were in a track meet where our competitor was maybe half a lap behind us\n\tI am pretty sure now, as the decade has moved on, we are looking over our shoulder and realizing that the competition is gaining. So we need to make this investment in research and development to stay competitive, to grow jobs for tomorrow, and solve some of our most pressing problems, whether that is climate change, national security on cyber issues, or the advent and usage of artificial intelligence and what that will mean both for our opportunities and for our challenges.\n\tSo we are making a renewed commitment to the National Science Foundation. I thank my colleagues again, Senator Schumer and Senator Young, for their innovative legislation. They are telling us a couple of things. They are saying, one, invest more money in research and development, so this bill not only increases the NSF budget, it increases DOE's budget and increases the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency's funding as well by $17.5 billion.\n\tSo it is saying, yes, basic research is still very important. But it is also saying, for the first time, we need to get more out of the research that we do, and we need to have more translational science, that is, taking the basic research and applied research and actually using the applications of that in a more robust way so that we can translate more of that into actual science and manufacturing.\n\tWhy is this so important? Because we know that our competitiveness as a nation is suffering from the fact that people are looking at our own research and development. They are looking at our teachings and our publishing at universities and actually going and implementing this. So we need to do better on tech transfer.\n\tThis underlying legislation not only helps us do that by helping to help universities who are our No. 1 research partner with Federal dollars, it allows those universities to help us with more tech transfer in innovative ways, that universities not just do the research, but help commercialize it. It also makes investments and helping them protect the patenting of that critical information, so no longer having that patentable information used in other places around the globe, but actually capitalizing on the jobs here in the United States.\n\tIt also makes a huge investment in STEM, the science, technology, engineering, and math jobs that we need for the future. And clearly, you can't make a major investment in research and development if you don't have the workforce to carry it out. And we need a workforce to carry it out. So this underlying legislation helps us not only diversify our workforce by a major investment in STEM, going from an annual budget of about $1 billion in the year 2020 to about $4 billion a year by 2026. So we are going to get a more diversified STEM workforce with women and minorities participating.\n\tAnd we are also trying to distribute more of our engineering and science capacity around the United States. Our colleagues, Senators Schumer and Young, were adamant that we also look at innovation infrastructure happening in more regional places in the United States, where they may not currently have the R&D capability of some of our major institutions.\n\tSo this legislation promises 20 percent of the research and investment dollars go to those EPSCoR states, Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research, an already identified landmark in how we distribute research dollars, that tries to grow the regional research infrastructure in more places in the United States.

In a lot of ways, in passing this legislation today--and just so our colleagues know, we will have a couple of votes here before we get to a final passage--we really are doing our part.\n\tPeople hopefully will support this legislation enthusiastically, well past the majority of Members, because you believe in the history of the United States research and development that we have achieved innovation goals--whether that was what we did with the internet, whether that was what we have done on biosciences, even on some of our issues as it relates to energy. We have achieved big breakthroughs.\n\tSo today's vote is about investing in that innovation economy of the future. I am pretty confident because I have met some of these innovators across the United States. I don't know if everything that we have done so far will be absorbed by universities, our researchers, and our labs, but literally, we are trying to dust off R&D skills and make them more competitive for today.\n\tI guarantee you, though, these dollars that reach American entrepreneurs, who reach American innovators, they are ready and willing to take up this challenge. Give them those collaborative research resources through innovation at universities, through tech hubs, through more collaboration on workforce training, through investments in semiconductors, and I guarantee you these entrepreneurs in America will innovate our economy and create the economies of the future.\n\tAnd what is at stake?

Madam President, during the committee markup on this bill \nin the Commerce Committee, there was an amendment offered that was \naccepted that added Davis-Bacon prevailing wage protection to the \nunderlying bill, which is now in the bill before us.\n  This is purely a gratuitous addition to this bill because the fact \nis, in constructing these major semiconductor fabs, they pay far \ngreater than the prevailing wage. But perhaps the most dangerous part \nof this is the fact that this now is being applied to private \nconstruction.\n  Davis-Bacon historically and statutorily has been applied only to \npublic workers. But this is an unnecessary expansion and, frankly, \njeopardizes some of the support we are getting for the underlying bill, \nwhich we cannot afford to lose any of that support in our competition \nagainst China, particularly when it comes to manufacturing \nsemiconductors here onshore and shoring up the vulnerable supply chain.\n  I would ask colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, construction is hard, dangerous work, \nand too often, when it comes to wages for workers, we see a race to the \nbottom, where workers and communities lose.\n  Prevailing wage requirements, such as we have in this bill, help make \nsure that construction jobs created by the Federal Government come with \na fair wage that supports our local community.\n  Prevailing wage requirements have long had bipartisan support, \nincluding in this bill. This amendment would strip those protections \nfor construction workers at the same time we need to help rebuild our \ncountry's infrastructure.\n  The workers and the communities that build our bridges and our \nhighways and other critical infrastructure deserve the protections and \nbenefits prevailing wage provides.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose amendment No. 1858.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1858\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, there is clearly an urgent need \nfor the United States to address the growing threat posed by Communist \nChina. In so doing, we can't forget the commitment we all made to \nAmerican taxpayers to be responsible stewards of their tax dollars.\n  America is in a nearly $30 trillion debt crisis. We can't afford to \nspend more than $250 billion on a bill that doesn't pay for itself. \nWorse, it would add to our national yearly deficit in dramatic fashion, \nwhich is what triggers the point of order I am raising today.\n  In 2018, we agreed not to pass spending bills without a way to pay \nfor them, but there is no plan to pay for this. We are completely \nignoring our own rules to advance this spending.\n  Spending beyond our means has consequences. There will be a day of \nreckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502 to S. 1260, \nwould violate the Senate pay-go rule by increasing the on-budget \ndeficit. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure \npursuant to section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71 to the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S3976, June 8, 2021, second column, the following \nappears: There will be a day of reckoning. The pending measure, \nSenate amendment No. 1502 to amendment No. 1260, would violate the \nSenate pay-go.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: There will be a \nday of reckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502 \nto S. 1260, would violate the Senate pay-go.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                            Motion to Waive\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, and \nsection 4(g)3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to \nwaive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget \nresolutions for the purposes of the pending measure, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. If I could explain to my colleagues about this vote \nbecause it goes far beyond the simplicity of just the debate regarding \nthe semiconductor chips and emergency appropriations.\n  The way this point of order is drafted, basically, it would gut the \nbill. Basically, it not only guts the provisions related to the chips \nemergency appropriations, but it strikes the Foreign Relations \nCommittee's work, it strikes the Homeland Security Committee's work, it \nstrikes the Banking Committee's work, it effectively strikes the HELP \nCommittee's work and the Judiciary's, and most importantly, the Finance \nCommittee's work, which it was the entire Finance Committee's \ninsistence that the GSP, the System of Preferences, be included in the \nbill.\n  So all of those things that everybody wishes would be in the bill \nwould no longer be in the bill, including the Department of Energy \nfunding, the increase in STEM funding, and many other provisions.\n  I ask my colleagues to waive the budget point of order.

Mr. President, we have been working for almost a month \nto review and vet hundreds of amendments filed by my colleagues on both \nsides. You maybe followed the floor debate here, where we agreed to \nnumerous amendments and had discussions on many more--I think 20, to be \nexact.\n  We had been working on a managers' package that was previously \nobjected to before we left for the recess. Since then, we have been \nworking diligently with our colleague Senator Wicker, on the Commerce \nCommittee, to put forth a bipartisan package of amendments to improve \nthe legislation. Many of these provisions have been great bipartisan \nefforts: Senators Ernst and Hassan's bipartisan amendment to improve \ntransparency of the National Science Foundation grant funding; Senator \nCollins' amendment to require an update on implementation of the Energy \nImplementation Act; Senator Blackburn had a technical fix on studying \nthe possible threats to our communications network and fiber optic \ntransmission; Senator Warnock's amendment to clarify the definition of \nminority-serving institutions on STEM grants; Senator Cortez Masto \nworked on several bipartisan pieces of legislation to resolve issues on \namendments dealing with critical minerals and recycling, something very \nimportant to us as a nation.\n  So, in total, we have 42 amendments--23 led by Republicans, 19 led by \nDemocrats--many of which, as I said, are bipartisan. These amendments \nwould seek to improve the bill and accomplish Member priorities. And \nthis is what happens when you negotiate on the Senate floor in regular \norder. You vote on amendments; you have some voice vote amendments; and \nyou have a managers' package.\n  So I hope our colleagues will consider giving our colleagues a chance \nto have their amendments that have been agreed to accepted into this \npackage.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be agreed to \nen bloc: Collins 1583; Fischer 1637; Johnson 1701; Shaheen 1758; Rubio \n1777; Thune 1851; Wicker 1943; Hagerty 1958; Cotton 1964; Blunt 1988; \nScott 2000; Ernst-Hassan 2017; Romney-Menendez 2025; Johnson 2048; \nLujan 2082; Rosen 1768; Merkley 1823; Warnock 1980; Murray 1981; Hassan \n2001; Warren-Rubio 2104; Collins 1622; Wicker 1801; Leahy-Tillis 2093; \nVan Hollen-Tillis 2049; Blackburn 2085; Cortez Masto 2083, which \nincludes language from Senator Durbin; Lankford 1945; Baldwin-Braun \n2026; Hyde-Smith 1933; Hyde-Smith 1841; Merkley-Rubio-Romney 2103; \nOssoff 2105; Kennedy 2113; Barrasso 2094; Rubio 2106; Kaine 2090; \nBarrasso-Cardin 2101; Peters 2112; Cantwell 1905; Baldwin 2081; and \nCardin-Wicker, as modified, 1782.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. PAUL. This bill adds over $250 billion to our debt. The \nadditional debt will make us weaker, not stronger. As we speak, the \nmassive Federal spending of the last 2 years is already causing \ninflation throughout the supply chain and eventually will lead to \neconomic stagnation.\n  There is nothing conservative about this bill. The bill is nothing \nmore than a Big Government response that will make our country weaker, \nnot stronger. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I do believe our colleagues have worked \nhard to have their legislation considered. I want them to know I am \ngoing to continue to promulgate these ideas about competitiveness.\n  You know, I had a chance to fly home, and for me it is a long way. It \nis 5\\1/2\\ hours so you get a lot of reading done. And I read Chris \nWallace's new book about 1945 and the number of days that our Nation \nhad to respond to the threat of war, what it took them to go out and \ndevelop the Manhattan Project, to get them to go and not only in my \nState, develop the Hanford site--Los Alamos developed that--and not \nonly that, developed what happened at Oak Ridge and a scientific \nresponse to make our Nation more secure. All we are asking for here is \na little R&D dollars. So I can tell you that I wish we would find a \nLeslie Groves of today because those are the people who responded to \nour Nation when we needed to respond in a competitive fashion.\n  I am so sorry that our colleagues' amendments are not going to be \nconsidered, but if my colleague's underlying premise is that you don't \nwant to respond to the competitive threats to our Nation, you have a \nright to vote no. But holding up our colleagues' good work, I think, is \na mistake.\n  I will commit to our colleagues that these important things on \ncritical minerals, on transparency, and on moving forward on science, \nwe will continue to work with you.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I think now we have a vote on the \nsubstitute amendment.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 1502, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1502, as amended.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the cloture motion \nis withdrawn.\n  The clerk will read the title of the bill for the third time.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, China announced that it would \nnow allow families to have three children--a profound shift from their \nprevious one- and two-child policies.\n  Why the change? China looked to the future and realized that its \npopulation policies would hamper economic growth. Now, the U.S. \nGovernment will never tell families how many children to have. That \nchoice is profoundly personal. Yet we must ask ourselves the same \nquestions China is asking: What kind of changes will lead or deter the \nUnited States from a future of economic growth and prosperity? How can \nwe enhance America's competitiveness? And more than just compete, how \ncan we make sure America comes in first?\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\n  The answer is obvious: Invest in American creativity. China is \ninvesting heavily in electric vehicles, critical minerals, energy \nproduction, computer chips--the list goes on. In all of these areas, \nChina is beginning to pull ahead of the pack. They are aiming for \nfirst.\n  And what underscores all of their efforts? Research. Every \nbreakthrough, every new technology, every scientific step forward opens \nnew markets and drives their economy into the future at high speed.\n  Unfortunately, it is a different story in America. For decades, in \nboth the public and private sectors, we have downsized our discovery \nand innovation investments. Since the days of the space race, we have \nstepped away from the great challenge of discovery. If we were to \ncommit the same percentage of our national budget to research today as \nwe did in the Apollo era, we would invest $900 billion over 5 years. \nThat kind of an investment puts people on the Moon. That kind of \ninvestment puts us in first.\n  So how do we get there? The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act would \nset us back on track and at a fraction of the cost of Apollo-era \nspending. As we debate and hopefully pass this bill, we must keep \nasking: What are we willing to do to be No. 1?\n  One important way we can compete with countries like China is by \nincreasing support for domestic manufacturing and strengthening our \ndomestic supply chains. The legislation before us does exactly that. It \nprovides $52 billion in emergency funding to boost our domestic \nsemiconductor manufacturing capabilities. In 1990, the United States \nproduced 37 percent of the world's semiconductors, but today, just 12 \npercent of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States. Now, \nwe are facing a global shortage of microchips, which is impacting jobs \nin my State and many others.\n  I am proud that Illinois has long been a leader in auto \nmanufacturing, thanks to dedicated workers like those at a Stellantis \nplant in Belvidere, IL, who assemble Jeep Cherokees. Unfortunately, \nthat plant was forced to shut down in March due to the global shortage \nof semiconductors. And last month, Stellantis announced that as many as \n1,640 employees at the plant could be laid off in July--again, because \nit does not have enough microchips. After briefly resuming operations \nlast week, the plant already has had to shut down again for 2 weeks \nbecause of this shortage. Last week, I spoke to representatives from \nStellantis who shared that the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act \ncould make a real difference in terms of boosting supply of these \nchips.\n  This funding is not just important for the assembly plant in \nBelvidere. Sadly, we are seeing similar impacts of the semiconductor \nshortage at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, which supports 5,800 jobs. \nThat plant was idled through April, with shutdowns extended into May.\n  We urgently need to act to address this global microchip shortage to \nprovide certainty to the workers whose livelihoods depend on a stable \nsupply of semiconductors. The legislation before us will not only \naddress our immediate market needs but it will also help prevent these \nshortages again the future. This investment supports jobs across the \nentire supply chain, from construction of new facilities, to \nmanufacturing and development of chips, to workers in the auto industry \nwho depend on a reliable supply of semiconductors, to American \nconsumers.\n  The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is the result of weeks of \nnegotiation and bipartisan work. I was puzzled by some of my Republican \ncolleagues' arguments for voting against cloture on this bill. If you \ndon't want China's products and values to dominate the global \nmarketplace, why would you cede that marketplace to China--or anyone \nelse, for that matter? If you believe in America's products, values, \nand most of all, its people, then do the smart thing: Invest in them. \nAlthough some of my colleagues seem to believe otherwise, invective \nisn't going to win this global competition. We need investment to \nremain No. 1.\n  No one bill will secure America's economic prosperity or national \nsecurity or resolve all of the outstanding issues in our relationship \nwith China, but strengthening America's role as a global leader in \nscience and technology is an essential piece of our effort to \npreserving American leadership in this world. So I put it to my fellow \nSenators: Let's take a step forward today. Let's invest in the \nresearch, the jobs, and the future that all Americans deserve. I plan \nto vote in favor of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, and I urge \nmy colleagues to do the same.\n  Let's not settle for second best. Let's put America in the lead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that myself, \nSenator Cantwell, Senator Wicker, Senator Young, and Senator Schumer be \nallowed to speak before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I just wanted to take a moment to thank, \nobviously, my colleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator Young, for their \nhard work on this legislation and thank my counterpart, Senator Wicker, \nfor his tremendous effort in moving this bill.\n  We have now been on this bill, and we reported it out May 12. I think \nit came on the calendar May 13, and, literally, we have been working on \nit since. So this is a very hard effort to produce something very \nimportant to today's economy. So I want to thank Senator Schumer's \nstaff, Mike Lynch, Meghan Taira, Gerry Petrella; and John Keast, \nCrystal Tully, Steven Wall, James Mazol, Cheri Pascoe of Senator \nWicker's office.\n  On my team, David Strickland, Melissa Porter, and Mary Guenther. But, \nspecifically, I want to thank Richard-Duane Chambers, who came to the \nSenate from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, I think, \nmaybe like a week before we started working on this bill. So, \nliterally, since he joined the Senate Commerce Committee, he has been \njust knee-deep in the conversation of dusting off our R&D for the \nNation, making a new investment, making more translational science. So \nI really appreciate Richard-Duane's effort.\n  I also want to thank Gigi Slais, Shawn Bone, John Branscome, Ronce \nAlmond, Alex Simpson, Jared Bomberg, Shannon Smith, John Beezer, Noam \nKantor, Tiffany George, Jordan Blue, Kara Fischer, Nikky Teutschel, \nMatthew Bobbink, Caitlin Warner, Alex Kiles, George Greenwell, Elle \nWibisono, Alexis Gutierrez, Eric Vryheid, Brian McDermott, Lucy Koch, \nHunter Blackburn, and Alex Hall. So all of these people.\n  I think my colleagues know that these bills don't come about easily. \nThey come through a lot of hard work. And we thank everybody for \nparticipating in a regular order process out here on the Senate floor \nto produce a bipartisan result for something so important to our \nNation's competitiveness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I certainly rise in support of this \nlegislation and urge a ``yes'' vote. This is an opportunity for the \nUnited States to strike a blow on behalf of answering the unfair \ncompetition that we are seeing from Communist China, and it is an \nopportunity to have a game changer in terms of geographic diversity in \nour research effort.\n  This morning, the Armed Services Committee heard extensive testimony \nabout the need to compete with China at the military level. This is an \nopportunity to compete with China at the research level. This bill will \nstrengthen our country's innovation in key technology fields of the \nfuture--in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum \ncomputing, and communications.\n  And this bill also is a game changer in terms of giving universities \nall over the United States an opportunity to participate in game-\nchanging research, which will help us compete. Universities, largely in \nsmaller States such as mine, have been left behind in the past. They \nwill finally, under this legislation, have an opportunity to \nparticipate in research at a meaningful level--so two good reasons to \nvote yes.\n  The distinguished chair of the committee has been gracious in \nthanking all of our staffs on the majority and the minority side. I \nappreciate her doing that, as well as Senator Cantwell's admirable job \nof managing this bill through the committee.\n  I congratulate the two authors of this bill, Senator Schumer and \nSenator\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\nYoung, who sponsored this legislation. This bill is headed toward \npassage with a fine bipartisan vote, and I am pleased to support \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues: \nSenator Schumer, Senator Wicker, and Senator Cantwell. All showed \nexceptional leadership over the course of drafting this legislation and \nensuring that it made it through the process.\n  I also want to thank members of my team: Lauren O'Brien, my \nlegislative director; Brandt Anderson, my national security adviser; \nDan Cheever; Nancy Martinez, on my ledge staff. They went above and \nbeyond.\n  So this piece of legislation, yes, it, indeed, is related to \ncountering the threat that the Chinese Communist Party presents to this \ncountry. But it also is a piece of legislation that we are considering \nat a time when so many of our citizens feel overlooked, when the \nintimate communities that they call home feel hollowed out, when trust \nin our civic institutions is eroding, and when allegiance seems \nincreasingly to our political tribes and not to one another on behalf \nof the common good.\n\n  So let's not kid ourselves. The Chinese Communist Party aims to \nexploit all of these divisions. They aim to exploit the insecurities of \nthe global age. They aim to ensure that their power and their \ncapabilities continue to grow. And they are, indeed, locked in a global \ncompetition with the United States of America and with our partners and \nallies.\n  So let's do what we have always done as Americans in times like this. \nLet's come together, and let's use this as an opportunity to become a \nbetter version of ourselves.\n  I will end with this. When generation after generation of immigrants \nhave come into the New York Harbor, they have seen that beautiful \nStatue of Liberty. And at the base of the Statue of Liberty is a \nsonnet, and everyone here in this Chamber and so many across America \nare familiar with the words of that sonnet: ``Give me your tired, your \npoor, your huddled masses . . . ''\n  There is also a line in there that I particularly love about \n``imprisoned lightning''--``imprisoned lightning.'' I am not sure what \nEmma Lazarus meant by the phrase ``imprisoned lightning,'' but to me \nthat ``imprisoned lightning'' refers to the untapped potential, the \nGod-given potential of every human being. And this legislation, the \nEndless Frontier Act, aims to tap into that ``imprisoned lightning'' of \npeople across the heartland to ensure that they can stay part of the \neconomic game in the 21st century and that they help us outcompete, \noutinnovate, and outgrow the Chinese Communist Party. We will win. We \nare going to get a great vote today, and I thank all of my colleagues \nfor their intention to support this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I, too, would like to thank \nSenators Cantwell and Wicker for an amazing, bipartisan job; and \nSenators Menendez and Risch, another great bipartisan contribution. All \nthe Members--just about every Member has contributed to this bill.\n  I do want to single out two of my staff members who just slaved over \nthis bill relentlessly, and that is Mike Kuiken and Jon Cardinal. Mike \nis there. I don't know if Jon is here. But they deserve tremendous \nkudos for what they did. Without them I don't think we would have had a \nbill, to be honest with you--and everybody else, all the other staffs \nwho worked so hard.\n  Now, this is a quote from Dr. Vannevar Bush: ``Without scientific \nprogress, no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our \nhealth, prosperity, and security in the modern world.''\n  That was Dr. Vannevar Bush, the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific \nResearch, writing in 1945. His report to President Truman was titled: \n``Science--The Endless Frontier''--an inspiration to the legislation we \nconsidered today.\n  In the wake of Dr. Bush's report, we created the National Science \nFoundation. We funded the National Laboratories. We split the atom. We \nspliced the gene. We landed a man on the Moon. We unleashed the \ninternet. We generated 75 years of American prosperity and fostered an \ninnate sense of optimism in the American spirit.\n  We face a challenge now--in this century--to replicate the success of \nthe previous one. But the Federal Government's commitment to science, \nunfortunately, has waned. As a percentage of GDP, we spend less than \nhalf as much as the Chinese Communist Party on basic research.\n  We rely on foreign nations to supply critical technologies that we \ninvented, like semiconductors. That sunny American optimism has \nflickered as well.\n  The world is more competitive now than at any time since the end of \nthe Second World War. If we do nothing, our days as the dominant \nsuperpower may be ending.\n  We don't mean to let those days end on our watch. We don't mean to \nsee America become a middling nation in this century. We mean for \nAmerica to lead it. Passing this bill--now called the U.S. Innovation \nand Competition Act--is the moment when the Senate lays the foundation \nfor another century of American leadership.\n  Let me say that again. This bill could be the turning point for \nAmerican leadership in the 21st century, and for that reason, this \nlegislation will go down as one of the most significant bipartisan \nachievements of the U.S. Senate in recent history.\n  Around the globe, authoritarian governments believe that squabbling \ndemocracies like ours can't unite around national priorities. They \nbelieve that democracy itself is a relic of the past and that by \nbeating us to emerging technologies, they--many of the meritocracies--\nwill be able to reshape the world in their own image.\n  Well, let me tell you something. I believe they are wrong. I believe \nthat this legislation will enable the United States to outinnovate, \noutproduce, and outcompete the world in the industries of the future. I \nbelieve that the strongly bipartisan work on this bill has revealed \nthat in this Chamber, we all believe that another American century lies \non the horizon.

Madam President, during the committee markup on this bill in the Commerce Committee, there was an amendment offered that was accepted that added Davis-Bacon prevailing wage protection to the underlying bill, which is now in the bill before us.\n\tThis is purely a gratuitous addition to this bill because the fact is, in constructing these major semiconductor fabs, they pay far greater than the prevailing wage. But perhaps the most dangerous part of this is the fact that this now is being applied to private construction.\n\tDavis-Bacon historically and statutorily has been applied only to public workers. But this is an unnecessary expansion and, frankly, jeopardizes some of the support we are getting for the underlying bill, which we cannot afford to lose any of that support in our competition against China, particularly when it comes to manufacturing semiconductors here onshore and shoring up the vulnerable supply chain.\n\tI would ask colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\tMrs. MURRAY. Madam President, construction is hard, dangerous work, and too often, when it comes to wages for workers, we see a race to the bottom, where workers and communities lose.\n\tPrevailing wage requirements, such as we have in this bill, help make sure that construction jobs created by the Federal Government come with a fair wage that supports our local community.\n\tPrevailing wage requirements have long had bipartisan support, including in this bill. This amendment would strip those protections for construction workers at the same time we need to help rebuild our country's infrastructure.\n\tThe workers and the communities that build our bridges and our highways and other critical infrastructure deserve the protections and benefits prevailing wage provides.\n\tI urge my colleagues to oppose amendment No. 1858.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 1858\n\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n\tMr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, there is clearly an urgent need for the United States to address the growing threat posed by Communist China. In so doing, we can't forget the commitment we all made to American taxpayers to be responsible stewards of their tax dollars.\n\tAmerica is in a nearly $30 trillion debt crisis. We can't afford to spend more than $250 billion on a bill that doesn't pay for itself. Worse, it would add to our national yearly deficit in dramatic fashion, which is what triggers the point of order I am raising today.\n\tIn 2018, we agreed not to pass spending bills without a way to pay for them, but there is no plan to pay for this. We are completely ignoring our own rules to advance this spending.\n\tSpending beyond our means has consequences. There will be a day of reckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502 to S. 1260, would violate the Senate pay-go rule by increasing the on-budget deficit. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure pursuant to section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71 to the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n\tOn page S3976, June 8, 2021, second column, the following appears: There will be a day of reckoning.

Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, and section 4(g)3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of the pending measure, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\tThere appears to be a sufficient second.\n\tThe yeas and nays are ordered.\n\tThe Senator from Washington.\n\tMs. CANTWELL. If I could explain to my colleagues about this vote because it goes far beyond the simplicity of just the debate regarding the semiconductor chips and emergency appropriations.\n\tThe way this point of order is drafted, basically, it would gut the bill. Basically, it not only guts the provisions related to the chips emergency appropriations, but it strikes the Foreign Relations Committee's work, it strikes the Homeland Security Committee's work, it strikes the Banking Committee's work, it effectively strikes the HELP Committee's work and the Judiciary's, and most importantly, the Finance Committee's work, which it was the entire Finance Committee's insistence that the GSP, the System of Preferences, be included in the bill.\n\tSo all of those things that everybody wishes would be in the bill would no longer be in the bill, including the Department of Energy funding, the increase in STEM funding, and many other provisions.\n\tI ask my colleagues to waive the budget point of order. Vote yes, and let us move this legislation forward.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have been working for almost a month to review and vet hundreds of amendments filed by my colleagues on both sides. You maybe followed the floor debate here, where we agreed to numerous amendments and had discussions on many more--I think 20, to be exact.\n\tWe had been working on a managers' package that was previously objected to before we left for the recess. Since then, we have been working diligently with our colleague Senator Wicker, on the Commerce Committee, to put forth a bipartisan package of amendments to improve the legislation. Many of these provisions have been great bipartisan efforts: Senators Ernst and Hassan's bipartisan amendment to improve transparency of the National Science Foundation grant funding; Senator Collins' amendment to require an update on implementation of the Energy Implementation Act; Senator Blackburn had a technical fix on studying the possible threats to our communications network and fiber optic transmission; Senator Warnock's amendment to clarify the definition of minority-serving institutions on STEM grants; Senator Cortez Masto worked on several bipartisan pieces of legislation to resolve issues on amendments dealing with critical minerals and recycling, something very important to us as a nation.\n\tSo, in total, we have 42 amendments--23 led by Republicans, 19 led by Democrats--many of which, as I said, are bipartisan. These amendments would seek to improve the bill and accomplish Member priorities. And this is what happens when you negotiate on the Senate floor in regular order. You vote on amendments; you have some voice vote amendments; and you have a managers' package.\n\tSo I hope our colleagues will consider giving our colleagues a chance to have their amendments that have been agreed to accepted into this package.\n\tSo I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be agreed to en bloc: Collins 1583; Fischer 1637; Johnson 1701; Shaheen 1758; Rubio 1777; Thune 1851; Wicker 1943; Hagerty 1958; Cotton 1964; Blunt 1988; Scott 2000; Ernst-Hassan 2017; Romney-Menendez 2025; Johnson 2048; Lujan 2082; Rosen 1768; Merkley 1823; Warnock 1980; Murray 1981; Hassan 2001; Warren-Rubio 2104; Collins 1622; Wicker 1801; Leahy-Tillis 2093; Van Hollen-Tillis 2049; Blackburn 2085; Cortez Masto 2083, which includes language from Senator Durbin; Lankford 1945; Baldwin-Braun 2026; Hyde-Smith 1933; Hyde-Smith 1841; Merkley-Rubio-Romney 2103; Ossoff 2105; Kennedy 2113; Barrasso 2094; Rubio 2106; Kaine 2090; Barrasso-Cardin 2101; Peters 2112; Cantwell 1905; Baldwin 2081; and Cardin-Wicker, as modified, 1782.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\tThe Senator from Kentucky.\n\tMr. PAUL. This bill adds over $250 billion to our debt. The additional debt will make us weaker, not stronger. As we speak, the massive Federal spending of the last 2 years is already causing inflation throughout the supply chain and eventually will lead to economic stagnation.\n\tThere is nothing conservative about this bill. The bill is nothing more than a Big Government response that will make our country weaker, not stronger. I object.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n\tMs. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I do believe our colleagues have worked hard to have their legislation considered. I want them to know I am going to continue to promulgate these ideas about competitiveness.\n\tYou know, I had a chance to fly home, and for me it is a long way. It is 5\\1/2\\ hours so you get a lot of reading done. And I read Chris Wallace's new book about 1945 and the number of days that our Nation had to respond to the threat of war, what it took them to go out and develop the Manhattan Project, to get them to go and not only in my State, develop the Hanford site--Los Alamos developed that--and not only that, developed what happened at Oak Ridge and a scientific response to make our Nation more secure. All we are asking for here is a little R&D dollars. So I can tell you that I wish we would find a Leslie Groves of today because those are the people who responded to our Nation when we needed to respond in a competitive fashion.\n\tI am so sorry that our colleagues' amendments are not going to be considered, but if my colleague's underlying premise is that you don't want to respond to the competitive threats to our Nation, you have a right to vote no. But holding up our colleagues' good work, I think, is a mistake.\n\tI will commit to our colleagues that these important things on critical minerals, on transparency, and on moving forward on science, we will continue to work with you.\n\tI thank the Presiding Officer, and I think now we have a vote on the substitute amendment.\n\n\n                 Vote on Amendment No. 1502, as Amended\n\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the cloture motion is withdrawn.\n\tThe clerk will read the title of the bill for the third time.\n\tThe bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read the third time\n\tMr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, China announced that it would now allow families to have three children--a profound shift from their previous one- and two-child policies.\n\tWhy the change? China looked to the future and realized that its population policies would hamper economic growth. Now, the U.S. Government will never tell families how many children to have. That choice is profoundly personal. Yet we must ask ourselves the same questions China is asking: What kind of changes will lead or deter the United States from a future of economic growth and prosperity? How can we enhance America's competitiveness? And more than just compete, how can we make sure America comes in first? \n\tThe answer is obvious: Invest in American creativity. China is investing heavily in electric vehicles, critical minerals, energy production, computer chips--the list goes on. In all of these areas, China is beginning to pull ahead of the pack. They are aiming for first.\n\tAnd what underscores all of their efforts? Research. Every breakthrough, every new technology, every scientific step forward opens new markets and drives their economy into the future at high speed.\n\tUnfortunately, it is a different story in America. For decades, in both the public and private sectors, we have downsized our discovery and innovation investments. Since the days of the space race, we have stepped away from the great challenge of discovery. If we were to commit the same percentage of our national budget to research today as we did in the Apollo era, we would invest $900 billion over 5 years. That kind of an investment puts people on the Moon. That kind of investment puts us in first.\n\tSo how do we get there? The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act would set us back on track and at a fraction of the cost of Apollo-era spending. As we debate and hopefully pass this bill, we must keep asking: What are we willing to do to be No. 1?\n\tOne important way we can compete with countries like China is by increasing support for domestic manufacturing and strengthening our domestic supply chains. The legislation before us does exactly that. It provides $52 billion in emergency funding to boost our domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. In 1990, the United States produced 37 percent of the world's semiconductors, but today, just 12 percent of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States. Now, we are facing a global shortage of microchips, which is impacting jobs in my State and many others.\n\tI am proud that Illinois has long been a leader in auto manufacturing, thanks to dedicated workers like those at a Stellantis plant in Belvidere, IL, who assemble Jeep Cherokees. Unfortunately, that plant was forced to shut down in March due to the global shortage of semiconductors. And last month, Stellantis announced that as many as 1,640 employees at the plant could be laid off in July--again, because it does not have enough microchips. After briefly resuming operations last week, the plant already has had to shut down again for 2 weeks because of this shortage. Last week, I spoke to representatives from Stellantis who shared that the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act could make a real difference in terms of boosting supply of these chips.\n\tThis funding is not just important for the assembly plant in Belvidere. Sadly, we are seeing similar impacts of the semiconductor shortage at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, which supports 5,800 jobs. That plant was idled through April, with shutdowns extended into May.\n\tWe urgently need to act to address this global microchip shortage to provide certainty to the workers whose livelihoods depend on a stable supply of semiconductors. The legislation before us will not only address our immediate market needs but it will also help prevent these shortages again the future. This investment supports jobs across the entire supply chain, from construction of new facilities, to manufacturing and development of chips, to workers in the auto industry who depend on a reliable supply of semiconductors, to American consumers.\n\tThe U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is the result of weeks of negotiation and bipartisan work. I was puzzled by some of my Republican colleagues' arguments for voting against cloture on this bill. If you don't want China's products and values to dominate the global marketplace, why would you cede that marketplace to China--or anyone else, for that matter? If you believe in America's products, values, and most of all, its people, then do the smart thing: Invest in them. Although some of my colleagues seem to believe otherwise, invective isn't going to win this global competition. We need investment to remain No. 1.\n\tNo one bill will secure America's economic prosperity or national security or resolve all of the outstanding issues in our relationship with China, but strengthening America's role as a global leader in science and technology is an essential piece of our effort to preserving American leadership in this world. So I put it to my fellow Senators: Let's take a step forward today. Let's invest in the research, the jobs, and the future that all Americans deserve. I plan to vote in favor of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n\tLet's not settle for second best. Let's put America in the lead.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\tMs. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that myself, Senator Cantwell, Senator Wicker, Senator Young, and Senator Schumer be allowed to speak before the vote.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n\tWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMs. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I just wanted to take a moment to thank, obviously, my colleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator Young, for their hard work on this legislation and thank my counterpart, Senator Wicker, for his tremendous effort in moving this bill.\n\tWe have now been on this bill, and we reported it out May 12. I think it came on the calendar May 13, and, literally, we have been working on it since. So this is a very hard effort to produce something very important to today's economy. So I want to thank Senator Schumer's staff, Mike Lynch, Meghan Taira, Gerry Petrella; and John Keast, Crystal Tully, Steven Wall, James Mazol, Cheri Pascoe of Senator Wicker's office.\n\tOn my team, David Strickland, Melissa Porter, and Mary Guenther. But, specifically, I want to thank Richard-Duane Chambers, who came to the Senate from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, I think, maybe like a week before we started working on this bill. So, literally, since he joined the Senate Commerce Committee, he has been just knee-deep in the conversation of dusting off our R&D for the Nation, making a new investment, making more translational science. So I really appreciate Richard-Duane's effort.\n\tI also want to thank Gigi Slais, Shawn Bone, John Branscome, Ronce Almond, Alex Simpson, Jared Bomberg, Shannon Smith, John Beezer, Noam Kantor, Tiffany George, Jordan Blue, Kara Fischer, Nikky Teutschel, Matthew Bobbink, Caitlin Warner, Alex Kiles, George Greenwell, Elle Wibisono, Alexis Gutierrez, Eric Vryheid, Brian McDermott, Lucy Koch, Hunter Blackburn, and Alex Hall. So all of these people.\n\tI think my colleagues know that these bills don't come about easily. They come through a lot of hard work. And we thank everybody for participating in a regular order process out here on the Senate floor to produce a bipartisan result for something so important to our Nation's competitiveness.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\tMr. WICKER. Mr. President, I certainly rise in support of this legislation and urge a ``yes'' vote. This is an opportunity for the United States to strike a blow on behalf of answering the unfair competition that we are seeing from Communist China, and it is an opportunity to have a game changer in terms of geographic diversity in our research effort.\n\tThis morning, the Armed Services Committee heard extensive testimony about the need to compete with China at the military level. This is an opportunity to compete with China at the research level. This bill will strengthen our country's innovation in key technology fields of the future--in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing, and communications.\n\tAnd this bill also is a game changer in terms of giving universities all over the United States an opportunity to participate in game-changing research, which will help us compete. Universities, largely in smaller States such as mine, have been left behind in the past. They will finally, under this legislation, have an opportunity to participate in research at a meaningful level--so two good reasons to vote yes.\n\tThe distinguished chair of the committee has been gracious in thanking all of our staffs on the majority and the minority side. I appreciate her doing that, as well as Senator Cantwell's admirable job of managing this bill through the committee.\n\tI congratulate the two authors of this bill, Senator Schumer and Senator Young, who sponsored this legislation. This bill is headed toward passage with a fine bipartisan vote, and I am pleased to support passage.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\tMr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues: Senator Schumer, Senator Wicker, and Senator Cantwell. All showed exceptional leadership over the course of drafting this legislation and ensuring that it made it through the process.\n\tI also want to thank members of my team: Lauren O'Brien, my legislative director; Brandt Anderson, my national security adviser; Dan Cheever; Nancy Martinez, on my ledge staff. They went above and beyond.\n\tSo this piece of legislation, yes, it, indeed, is related to countering the threat that the Chinese Communist Party presents to this country. But it also is a piece of legislation that we are considering at a time when so many of our citizens feel overlooked, when the intimate communities that they call home feel hollowed out, when trust in our civic institutions is eroding, and when allegiance seems increasingly to our political tribes and not to one another on behalf of the common good.\n\n\tSo let's not kid ourselves. The Chinese Communist Party aims to exploit all of these divisions. They aim to exploit the insecurities of the global age. They aim to ensure that their power and their capabilities continue to grow. And they are, indeed, locked in a global competition with the United States of America and with our partners and allies.\n\tSo let's do what we have always done as Americans in times like this. Let's come together, and let's use this as an opportunity to become a better version of ourselves.\n\tI will end with this. When generation after generation of immigrants have come into the New York Harbor, they have seen that beautiful Statue of Liberty. And at the base of the Statue of Liberty is a sonnet, and everyone here in this Chamber and so many across America are familiar with the words of that sonnet: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses . . . ''\n\tThere is also a line in there that I particularly love about ``imprisoned lightning''--``imprisoned lightning.'' I am not sure what Emma Lazarus meant by the phrase ``imprisoned lightning,'' but to me that ``imprisoned lightning'' refers to the untapped potential, the God-given potential of every human being. And this legislation, the Endless Frontier Act, aims to tap into that ``imprisoned lightning'' of people across the heartland to ensure that they can stay part of the economic game in the 21st century and that they help us outcompete, outinnovate, and outgrow the Chinese Communist Party. We will win. We are going to get a great vote today, and I thank all of my colleagues for their intention to support this legislation.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\tMr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I, too, would like to thank Senators Cantwell and Wicker for an amazing, bipartisan job; and Senators Menendez and Risch, another great bipartisan contribution. All the Members--just about every Member has contributed to this bill.\n\tI do want to single out two of my staff members who just slaved over this bill relentlessly, and that is Mike Kuiken and Jon Cardinal. Mike is there. I don't know if Jon is here. But they deserve tremendous kudos for what they did. Without them I don't think we would have had a bill, to be honest with you--and everybody else, all the other staffs who worked so hard.\n\tNow, this is a quote from Dr. Vannevar Bush: ``Without scientific progress, no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health, prosperity, and security in the modern world.''\n\tThat was Dr. Vannevar Bush, the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research, writing in 1945. His report to President Truman was titled: ``Science--The Endless Frontier''--an inspiration to the legislation we considered today.\n\tIn the wake of Dr. Bush's report, we created the National Science Foundation. We funded the National Laboratories. We split the atom. We spliced the gene. We landed a man on the Moon. We unleashed the internet. We generated 75 years of American prosperity and fostered an innate sense of optimism in the American spirit.\n\tWe face a challenge now--in this century--to replicate the success of the previous one. But the Federal Government's commitment to science, unfortunately, has waned. As a percentage of GDP, we spend less than half as much as the Chinese Communist Party on basic research.\n\tWe rely on foreign nations to supply critical technologies that we invented, like semiconductors. That sunny American optimism has flickered as well.\n\tThe world is more competitive now than at any time since the end of the Second World War. If we do nothing, our days as the dominant superpower may be ending.\n\tWe don't mean to let those days end on our watch. We don't mean to see America become a middling nation in this century. We mean for America to lead it. Passing this bill--now called the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act--is the moment when the Senate lays the foundation for another century of American leadership.\n\tLet me say that again. This bill could be the turning point for American leadership in the 21st century, and for that reason, this legislation will go down as one of the most significant bipartisan achievements of the U.S. Senate in recent history.\n\tAround the globe, authoritarian governments believe that squabbling democracies like ours can't unite around national priorities. They believe that democracy itself is a relic of the past and that by beating us to emerging technologies, they--many of the meritocracies--will be able to reshape the world in their own image.\n\tWell, let me tell you something. I believe they are wrong. I believe that this legislation will enable the United States to outinnovate, outproduce, and outcompete the world in the industries of the future. I believe that the strongly bipartisan work on this bill has revealed that in this Chamber, we all believe that another American century lies on the horizon. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.\n\n\tI yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Vote on S. 1260\n\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n\tMr. WICKER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, there are still millions of women across \nthis country today who are doing the same jobs as their male colleagues \nand are being paid less. It is more clear than ever that we must take \nsteps to close loopholes that allow for pay discrimination and empower \nwomen to hold their employers accountable when pay discrimination \noccurs. Nearly 60 years after passage of the Equal Pay Act and 12 years \nafter passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, women still only \nearn 82 cents for every dollar paid to men on average. For women of \ncolor, the wage gap is even worse. Black women make only 63 cents for \nevery dollar paid to White men, and Latina women make only 55 cents. \nMothers make just 75 cents for every dollar paid to fathers.\n  Throughout the pandemic, too many families have wondered how they \nwill feed their families, keep their homes, and care for their children \namid an unprecedented public health and economic crisis. For working \nmothers, it has been especially challenging. The labor force \nparticipation rate among women has dropped to 57.4 percent, the lowest \nit has been since 1988. A survey last fall found that almost 40 percent \nof working mothers in Illinois lost their jobs or were working reduced \nhours. Nearly half of working mothers of color reported the same.\n  Why has this economic crisis been so economically devastating for so \nmany women? The reasons are clear. Women tend to be overrepresented in \nthe industries that were hit hardest by the pandemic, such as \nrestaurants, retail, and leisure and hospitality. And many women are \nthe primary caretakers for their families. With schools and childcare \nprograms closed, what choice did mothers have other than to step back \nfrom work?\n  The economic hardship women have faced during the pandemic has only \nbeen made worse by the wage gap. From wage discrimination to the \nunavailability of childcare, women are not getting a fair deal. That \nmeans working families are not getting a fair deal, and it must change.\n  This week, we have the opportunity to pass legislation that would \nclose the loopholes that allow paycheck discrimination to continue. The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which prohibits gender-based pay \ndiscrimination, was the first bill signed into law by President Obama \nback in 2009. Unfortunately, it is hard to enforce because employers \nstill maintain policies that punish employees who voluntarily share \nsalary information with their coworkers. Women can't demand equal pay \nif they don't know they are being underpaid.\n  The Paycheck Fairness Act would ensure workers cannot be retaliated \nagainst if they disclose their wages. It also would prohibit employers \nfrom asking prospective employees about their salary history. And it \nwould require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for \nlegitimate, job-related reasons--not just because they believe \n``women's work'' is worth less. I am happy to join Senator Murray and \nmy Democratic colleagues in supporting this important legislation.\n  Women have carried America's families through this pandemic, but it \nmay take years for women to recover from the economic and career \nsetbacks they have suffered. By passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, we \ncan take an important step toward helping women and their families \nfully recover from this pandemic and economic crisis.\n  I am disappointed that Republican opposition has previously prevented \nthe Senate from passing this bill. I hope that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle can agree it is time to pass this commonsense \nmeasure that will help put more money in the pockets of women and their \nfamilies across the country.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, you know, it has been more than half a \ncentury since the Equal Pay Act became law, and 12 years since \nPresident Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, but women in \nthe United States still, on average, earn only 82 cents on the dollar \ncompared to their male counterparts, and the wage gap is far greater \nfor women of color because, even though the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly \nLedbetter Act were critical steps forward, there is clearly a lot more \nwe have got to do.\n  Right now, an employer can brush aside reports of pay discrimination \nby saying things like, ``Well, he was a better negotiator'' or ``They \nwork in different buildings.'' I mean, what does that have to do with \nit?\n  And too often, a woman's history of being paid less means she gets \npaid less in the future because her past salary can be used to \ndetermine her future salary, regardless of what her counterparts are \nmaking or her new responsibilities, and that has real consequences for \nwomen and their families.\n  Today, 4 out of 10 mothers with children under the age of 18 are \ntheir family's primary or sole breadwinners. As families rely more on \nwomen's wages to make ends meet, the gender pay gap has an even greater \nimpact on children.\n  For example, over the course of just 1 year, the wage gap for Latino \nwomen averages almost $30,000 less compared to what a White man earns. \nWe are talking about women losing out on hundreds of thousands of \ndollars over the course of their working lives, and that is money that \ncould go to pay the bills, put food on the table, buy a house, start a \nbusiness, save for retirement, get an education, and so much more.\n  Instead, women struggle with lifelong financial effects, including \nhigher poverty rates as compared to men. Women are being shortchanged, \nplain and simple.\n  And this pandemic, by the way, has made things worse. Millions of \nwomen now, as we know, have left the labor force, and many have fallen \nbehind just as caregiving responsibilities have disproportionately \nfallen on them.\n  According to one study, a woman who was earning about $47,000 a year \nbefore the pandemic, could lose nearly a quarter of a million dollars \nover her lifetime, assuming she is able to return to work this year.\n  The pandemic has set women--and in particular, women of color--back \neven further and made clear just how urgent it is for us to act \nbecause, you know what, if women don't recover from this crisis, our \neconomy will not either, which is why we desperately need to close the \nwage gap.\n  We have got a responsibility to finally make sure women are paid \nfairly for their work so women can build financial security for \nthemselves, for their families, for their communities, and so our \neconomy--so much of which is driven by women, by the way--can fully \nrecover from this crisis.\n  We have been fighting for the Paycheck Fairness Act for quite some \ntime, but for those who need a reminder, here is what it would do \nsimply, very straightforward: It will close the loopholes that allow \npay discrimination to continue and protect workers from retaliation for \ndiscussing their pay; it will limit the use of prior wage history in \nthe hiring process so pay discrimination cannot follow workers from job \nto job; and it will increase transparency and accountability so workers \nknow whether they are being treated fairly and so they have the \nevidence to hold their employers accountable if they are not.\n  These are commonsense steps, and that is why this bill already passed \nthe House with bipartisan support, and it is up to the Senate now to \nget this done because the reality is each and every Senator represents \na State where half of the population earns less than they deserve, and \nthat is ridiculous.\n  It is past time we end this injustice. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in voting to finally put money women have earned fair and square in \ntheir pockets where it belongs and take an essential step toward \nensuring our economy can build back stronger and fairer from COVID-19.\n  There is absolutely nothing controversial about making sure every \nworker gets paid fairly for their work. Women have been waiting long \nenough. They need the Paycheck Fairness Act now more than ever. Let's \nget this done\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Washington \nfor her incredible leadership not only\n\n[[Page S3981]]\n\non this bill but on this issue for pretty close to a decade, and it is \nlong overdue.\n  You know, we have been working in a very bipartisan way on numerous \nsubjects, including the competition bill that just passed, but it \nappears there are real limits to bipartisanship here in the Senate.\n  We are about to vote just to start debate--just to start debate on a \nbill that is very simple--provide equal pay for women. It is a modest \nproposal to address a real problem in our economy.\n  Women with the same jobs and same qualifications as their male \ncolleagues often make less money. It is too hard for too many women to \novercome that pay discrimination. This makes it easier for women to \nachieve pay parity, and like the previous bill, will help unleash \nstrong economic forces to help America go forward because when women \nare not getting the pay they deserve, it impedes our whole economy and \nall of the human resources that we need.\n  Every Senate Democrat is ready to start debate on the Paycheck \nFairness Act, but Senate Republicans seem to be mounting another \npartisan filibuster against this bill.\n  It is ridiculous that Senate Republicans will not even allow the \nSenate to debate a straightforward piece of legislation to help provide \nequal pay for working women in America, just like it was ridiculous for \nthe Republican minority to filibuster bipartisan legislation to create \nan independent Commission on January 6.\n  Americans expect their government to make progress to improve our \ncountry, but Senate Republicans once again seem to be choosing \nobstruction.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT\n\n\tMr. DURBIN.

As families rely more on women's wages to make ends meet, the gender pay gap has an even greater impact on children.\n\tFor example, over the course of just 1 year, the wage gap for Latino women averages almost $30,000 less compared to what a White man earns. We are talking about women losing out on hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of their working lives, and that is money that could go to pay the bills, put food on the table, buy a house, start a business, save for retirement, get an education, and so much more.\n\tInstead, women struggle with lifelong financial effects, including higher poverty rates as compared to men. Women are being shortchanged, plain and simple.\n\tAnd this pandemic, by the way, has made things worse. Millions of women now, as we know, have left the labor force, and many have fallen behind just as caregiving responsibilities have disproportionately fallen on them.\n\tAccording to one study, a woman who was earning about $47,000 a year before the pandemic, could lose nearly a quarter of a million dollars over her lifetime, assuming she is able to return to work this year.\n\tThe pandemic has set women--and in particular, women of color--back even further and made clear just how urgent it is for us to act because, you know what, if women don't recover from this crisis, our economy will not either, which is why we desperately need to close the wage gap.\n\tWe have got a responsibility to finally make sure women are paid fairly for their work so women can build financial security for themselves, for their families, for their communities, and so our economy--so much of which is driven by women, by the way--can fully recover from this crisis.\n\tWe have been fighting for the Paycheck Fairness Act for quite some time, but for those who need a reminder, here is what it would do simply, very straightforward: It will close the loopholes that allow pay discrimination to continue and protect workers from retaliation for discussing their pay; it will limit the use of prior wage history in the hiring process so pay discrimination cannot follow workers from job to job; and it will increase transparency and accountability so workers know whether they are being treated fairly and so they have the evidence to hold their employers accountable if they are not.\n\tThese are commonsense steps, and that is why this bill already passed the House with bipartisan support, and it is up to the Senate now to get this done because the reality is each and every Senator represents a State where half of the population earns less than they deserve, and that is ridiculous.\n\tIt is past time we end this injustice. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to finally put money women have earned fair and square in their pockets where it belongs and take an essential step toward ensuring our economy can build back stronger and fairer from COVID-19.\n\tThere is absolutely nothing controversial about making sure every worker gets paid fairly for their work. Women have been waiting long enough. They need the Paycheck Fairness Act now more than ever. Let's get this done\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\tMr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Washington for her incredible leadership not only on this bill but on this issue for pretty close to a decade, and it is long overdue.\n\tYou know, we have been working in a very bipartisan way on numerous subjects, including the competition bill that just passed, but it appears there are real limits to bipartisanship here in the Senate.\n\tWe are about to vote just to start debate--just to start debate on a bill that is very simple--provide equal pay for women. It is a modest proposal to address a real problem in our economy.\n\tWomen with the same jobs and same qualifications as their male colleagues often make less money. It is too hard for too many women to overcome that pay discrimination. This makes it easier for women to achieve pay parity, and like the previous bill, will help unleash strong economic forces to help America go forward because when women are not getting the pay they deserve, it impedes our whole economy and all of the human resources that we need.\n\tEvery Senate Democrat is ready to start debate on the Paycheck Fairness Act, but Senate Republicans seem to be mounting another partisan filibuster against this bill.\n\tIt is ridiculous that Senate Republicans will not even allow the Senate to debate a straightforward piece of legislation to help provide equal pay for working women in America, just like it was ridiculous for the Republican minority to filibuster bipartisan legislation to create an independent Commission on January 6.\n\tAmericans expect their government to make progress to improve our country, but Senate Republicans once again seem to be choosing obstruction.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Richard J.

They \ndid so even when they weren't provided the proper personal protective \nequipment. They did so even when it meant that they had to quarantine \nfrom their own families. They did so even when it meant extra shifts on \nlittle to no sleep. They did so even when it meant spending each day \nwatching dying patients say their final goodbyes to loved ones over \nZoom.

Madam President, Southeastern Kentucky lost Eula Hall \nthis May, a humanitarian titan who blessed her community with \ngenerosity, tenacity, and dedication. Eula was a self-described \n``hillbilly activist'' whose efforts to improve healthcare in Kentucky \nenhanced the lives of her neighbors and friends. As the founder of the \nMud Creek Clinic, now known as the Eula Hall Health Center, Eula was \ndriven by her selfless spirit to deliver quality care to thousands of \nKentuckians. Today, I recognize Eula Hall as a lifelong champion of \nFloyd County and the entire Southeastern Kentucky region.\n  Eula founded the Mud Creek Clinic in 1973 with a $1,400 donation and \na calling to improve healthcare in her disadvantaged community. She \nserved everyone, regardless of their ability to pay, through a primary \ncare clinic, mental health counselor, pharmacy, and food and clothing \npantry. Even after her clinic burned down in 1982, Eula did not miss a \nday of service, delivering help directly from her own home. She \nredefined healthcare in Southeastern Kentucky from the ground up, \nleaving an indelible impact on the region.\n  Eula was born into extreme poverty, growing up without plumbing or \nelectricity and only receiving an eighth-grade education. In spite of \nthese obstacles, she was driven by a higher calling to serve her \ncommunity.

Madam President, Southeastern Kentucky lost Eula Hall this May, a humanitarian titan who blessed her community with generosity, tenacity, and dedication. Eula was a self-described ``hillbilly activist'' whose efforts to improve healthcare in Kentucky enhanced the lives of her neighbors and friends. As the founder of the Mud Creek Clinic, now known as the Eula Hall Health Center, Eula was driven by her selfless spirit to deliver quality care to thousands of Kentuckians. Today, I recognize Eula Hall as a lifelong champion of Floyd County and the entire Southeastern Kentucky region.\n\tEula founded the Mud Creek Clinic in 1973 with a $1,400 donation and a calling to improve healthcare in her disadvantaged community. She served everyone, regardless of their ability to pay, through a primary care clinic, mental health counselor, pharmacy, and food and clothing pantry. Even after her clinic burned down in 1982, Eula did not miss a day of service, delivering help directly from her own home. She redefined healthcare in Southeastern Kentucky from the ground up, leaving an indelible impact on the region.\n\tEula was born into extreme poverty, growing up without plumbing or electricity and only receiving an eighth-grade education. In spite of these obstacles, she was driven by a higher calling to serve her community. When Eula founded the Mud Creek Clinic, she did so based on a conviction that all Kentuckians, regardless of income, deserved to be cared for by their neighbors. Her work quickly caught the attention of local leaders and physicians, bringing much needed resources to her distressed region.\n\tShe was a local activist from a young age, driven by the struggles and suffering she saw during her childhood.

Her tireless, grassroots efforts have left an enduring legacy of community-based activism in Southeastern Kentucky.\n\tEula's industriousness permeated every aspect of her life, even as she entered old age. Just last year, she was working on a proposal to found a nursing home in her area as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In recognition of her determination and tenacity, Eula received a number of awards, including honorary doctorates from Berea, Midway, and Pikeville colleges in Kentucky and Trinity College in Connecticut. She was also the subject of a landmark book on healthcare in Eastern Kentucky, ``Mud Creek Medicine,'' by Kiran Bhatraju. She led a vibrant family, and is survived by 4 children, 8 grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren, and 5 great-great-grandchildren.\n\tI had the opportunity to speak with Eula just a few weeks before she passed and expressed my deep appreciation for her decades of hard work.

As a doctor, I \nunderstand the importance of balanced nutrition but also companionship \nand care. The hard-working employees and volunteers deliver all three \nby offering tailored meals and home visits.\n  In 1971 Casper resident Mabel Marvel founded the Casper branch of \nMeals on Wheels. Mabel was on a trip to Colorado to visit family when \nshe ran across a similar service. The volunteers for the Colorado \norganization were delivering hot meals to elderly residents from a \nchurch kitchen. Mrs. Marvel realized that Casper did not have such a \nprogram. Soon after, she formed an office in a Salvation Army coat \ncloset and requested that the Natrona County Memorial Hospital, now \nWyoming Medical Center, aid in providing meals. This was the beginning \nof the Natrona County Meals on Wheels Program.\n  When Natrona County Meals on Wheels began initial operations, they \nwere preparing 20 meals a day. By 2001, the number of meals delivered \nincreased to over 500 per day. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the \nneed for home-delivered meals exploded. This Casper-based organization \nrose to the challenge and served clients who were forced to quarantine \nand unable to leave their homes. In Natrona County, they delivered over \n650 meals each Monday through Thursday and an average of 1,550 meals on \nFridays to cover the weekends. Their hard work resulted in senior \ncitizens in Natrona County receiving nearly 207,000 meals in 2020.\n  Serving so many people at once is challenging, especially when many \nof these meals are prepared with special dietary needs in mind. Meals \non Wheels prepares healthy food for community members requiring \nspecific diets including diabetic, celiac, and vegetarian. The \nvolunteers with Meals on Wheels also make home visits to check in with \nmembers of the community who may not have enough social interaction or \nare not as mobile. The giving nature of this organization presents its \nmembers with a balanced meal and quality time spent with others. \nEnsuring the needs of community members allows seniors to preserve \ntheir independence at home.\n  Meals on Wheels continues to find new ways to enrich our community. \nJamie Loveall has been leading the charge as the Executive Director of \nNatrona County Meals on Wheels for more than 17 years. She has written \ngrants, planned community events, and helped prepare meals in order to \nkeep clients fed, staff members engaged, and the community aware. A \nfavorite community event is their Bubbles, Baubles 'n Beans fundraiser. \nIt is a chili and soup tasting experience to raise money for annual \noperating costs.\n  The strength of an organization is determined by the dedication of \nits leadership, staff, and volunteers. The full-time staff are \nresponsible for preparing the meals, managing the financial aspects, \nand writing the delivery routes. In addition to Executive Director \nJamie Loveall, staff members are Katrina Lorenzen, Foundation \nDevelopment Director, Andrea Trout, Route Coordinator/Administrative \nAssistant, Debbie Cardinal, Receptionist/Volunteer Coordinator, Ashley \nWoodward, Client Services Coordinator, Mariah Bokhari, Bookkeeper, and \nShelley Blake, Kitchen Manager.\n  Current board members are Jim Browlee, President, Joe Moss, Vice \nPresident, Vickie Ujvary, Treasurer, Don Smith, Secretary, and members \nWendy Elmer, Bob Thunselle, Ed Chase, Jennifer Deurloo, Peggy Porter, \nKelli Carmichael, Paul Rhodes, CJ Lovato, Dane Grace, and Stacia Hill.\n  The volunteers deliver the meals, partake in home visits, and spend \nquality time with clients. Eighty-five percent of the volunteers with \nthe Natrona County service are seniors themselves, using their time to \nhelp friends and neighbors.

In addition to Executive Director Jamie Loveall, staff members are Katrina Lorenzen, Foundation Development Director, Andrea Trout, Route Coordinator/Administrative Assistant, Debbie Cardinal, Receptionist/Volunteer Coordinator, Ashley Woodward, Client Services Coordinator, Mariah Bokhari, Bookkeeper, and Shelley Blake, Kitchen Manager.\n\tCurrent board members are Jim Browlee, President, Joe Moss, Vice President, Vickie Ujvary, Treasurer, Don Smith, Secretary, and members Wendy Elmer, Bob Thunselle, Ed Chase, Jennifer Deurloo, Peggy Porter, Kelli Carmichael, Paul Rhodes, CJ Lovato, Dane Grace, and Stacia Hill.\n\tThe volunteers deliver the meals, partake in home visits, and spend quality time with clients. Eighty-five percent of the volunteers with the Natrona County service are seniors themselves, using their time to help friends and neighbors. About the volunteers, Jamie Loveall says, ``Without these individuals, our program would not exist.''\n\tIt is my great honor to celebrate the incredible work of this organization. Every day, the staff and volunteers of Natrona County Meals on Wheels work to make our community a better place to live. My wife Bobbi joins me in wishing the Natrona County Meals on Wheels another 50 years of success.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["John Barrasso"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "167 Cong.

Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Clean Water For \nMilitary Families Act.'' This legislation would provide $10 billion for \nthe Department of Defense to conduct investigations and remediate PFAS \ncontamination at and surrounding DOD installations in the U.S. and \nstate-owned National Guard facilities.\n  Dating back to the 1960s, the U.S. Navy began using a firefighting \nfoam called aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) that contains toxic PFAS \nchemicals. The military used AFFF firefighting foam for emergencies, \nfire training exercises, and equipment testing, resulting in large \ndischarges of PFAS contamination in groundwater and other environments.\n  For decades, DOD continued using AFFF firefighting foam despite \nmounting evidence of detrimental health concerns, and even after \nleading manufacturers voluntarily phased out production of PFOS and \nPFOA, the two most widespread and studied PFAS compounds.\n  In recent years, Congress has passed legislation requiring DOD to \nphase out the use of AFFF firefighting foams. While this is a vital \nstep toward ensuring DOD adopts PFAS-free alternatives going forward, \nit does not address DOD's legacy pollution.\n  To clean up the legacy pollution at contaminated military sites \nacross the country, this legislation authorizes a one-time, $10 billion \ninvestment for PFAS investigations and cleanup. We owe it to military \ncommunities to ensure that they can drink clean water and live \npollution-free.\n  There are hundreds of contaminated military sites across the country \nthat jeopardize the health, safety, and well-being of military \ncommunities who have suffered from exposure to PFAS pollution and toxic \ndrinking water.\n  In California alone, there are 62 military facilities with a known or \nsuspected PFAS release.\n  Since the discovery of PFAS at these installations, there has been \nlittle to no progress on the bases with the highest PFAS detections. A \n$10 billion investment would accelerate DOD's existing cleanup efforts \nand cover all types of PFAS chemicals. Absent this legislation, it \ncould take decades for DOD to clean up toxic PFAS. We must act now to \nmove beyond studying the problem and toward a comprehensive cleanup \neffort to protect service-members, veterans, and military communities.\n  I thank my co-lead, Senator Gillibrand for her tireless leadership \nfighting PFAS contamination at DOD sites.

Madam President, in my opening speech about the \nrightwing scheme to capture the Court, the Supreme Court, I described \nthe secret strategy memo that Lewis Powell wrote on the eve of his \nappointment to the Court about how to deploy corporate political power.\n  As a Justice of the Supreme Court, Powell had the chance to prove to \nthe corporate world his secret memo's theory of what could be achieved \nby ``exploiting judicial action''--his phrase--particularly with, as he \ncalled it, ``an activist-minded Supreme Court.''\n  Second, Powell had the chance on the Court to start laying the legal \ngroundwork for precisely the sort of corporate political activity that \nhis secret memo had recommended to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and \nPowell did both.\n  The first case that allowed Powell to implement recommendations from \nhis secret report came in 1976, in a case about the Federal Election \nCampaign Act. The case was Buckley v. Valeo, and the decision was a \nbeast--138 pages, with another 83 pages of dissent and concurrence \ncobbled together by the Court with what one observer called \n``extraordinary speed.'' Five Justices in that case, including Powell, \nwere described as First Amendment hawks who were wary of any portion of \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act that could inhibit free speech and \nassociation.\n  Now, you have to understand that free speech and association were \nbuzz words for corporate political activity precisely of the sort \nchampioned in Powell's secret chamber memo. Free speech meant corporate \nAmerica having the right to be heard, even to, as the secret report \nsaid, ``equal time.'' Freedom of association provided corporations the \n``organization,'' ``careful long-range planning and implementation,'' \nand well-financed ``joint effort''--all those quotes--that Powell had \nrecommended be done in his report ``through united action and national \norganizations.''\n  The Court's decision in Valeo did two noncontroversial things. It \naccepted that campaign contributions could be limited because unlimited \ncampaign contributions could give rise to corruption or at least the \nappearance of corruption. Unlimited donations to candidates would even \n``undermine representative democracy,'' the Court said. No big deal. \nThe Court also decided that candidates may spend as much of their own \nmoney as they want on their own campaigns. It considered unlimited \nspending on one's own campaign protected by the First Amendment, as \nthere was little danger of corruption from spending one's own campaign \nmoney on oneself.\n  So both of those holdings are unremarkable. What was remarkable was \nwhere Powell and his hawks took the Court when other interests, like \ncorporate interests, wanted to spend money on a candidate. Corporate \npolitical spending per se was not at issue in the case, but spending by \nspecial interests is precisely the kind of political influence which \nPowell had recommended in his secret report to the chamber.\n  Powell and his hawks said special interest political spending, so \nlong as it was not in the form of a campaign contribution, was \nprotected by the same principle that protected a candidate spending his \nown money on his own campaign.\n  Powell asserted that limiting these supposedly ``independent'' \nspecial interest expenditures ```perpetrates (the) grossest \ninfringement' on First Amendment rights.'' He did acknowledge the \ninterest in ```purity' of elections,'' but he used skeptical quotation \nmarks around the word ``purity,'' just like he had used skeptical \nquotation marks in his report around the word ``environment.'' But \nPowell dismissed those purity concerns as likely ``illusory,'' to use \nhis word.\n  Powell's Bench memo for the case critiqued the election law's \n``attempt to lower barriers to political competition to increase the \nrange of voter choice.'' It read: ``[T]he attempt to open access for \nthe many necessarily involves limiting the power of the few to exercise \nrights of speech and association protected by the Constitution.''\n  This interest in protecting the ``power of the few'' aligns exactly \nwith Powell's secret chamber memo about corporate power and aligns with \nPowell's own notes, which have more of his disparaging quotation marks \nquestioning some of the briefs filed in the Valeo case that ``identify \none of the `evils' as the power of `the wealthy few' (undefined but \nobviously unworthy people) to influence elections unduly.'' In tone and \nimport, that comes right out of Powell's secret chamber report, which \ncounted on the power of the corporate few.\n  Powell's Richmond history, his corporate law practice, his social \nposition, his boardroom experience, and his anxiety about upheaval all \nalign with a corporate worldview that society's decisions should be \nmade by the sort of people in corporate boardrooms, so the power of \nthose ``few'' had to be protected, to battle against what his report \ncalled the ``broad attack'' both on the ``American free enterprise \nsystem'' and the ``American political system of democracy under the \nrule of law.'' Particularly important it was to protect that power \nwhen, as he had written to the chamber, the trouble is ``deep'' and the \n``hour is late.''\n  To accommodate that corporate perspective, the Court had to reach \njudgments about politics. It showed itself helpless. The amateurish \npolitical outlook of the Court in Valeo stood out in the late-added \nfootnote 52, which, in the interest of drawing clear lines--\n``vagueness'' being a stated concern of the Justices--exempted from \ndisclosure political advertisements that did not expressly advocate for \nthe election or defeat of a candidate using magic words like ``vote \nfor,'' ``vote against,'' ``elect,'' or ``defeat.''\n  In the Court's amateur opinion, a hostile bombardment of TV \nadvertising challenging a candidate's morals, decency, or integrity, or \nattacking the candidate's alignment with the community's values, and \ndropped on the candidate in the heat of election season with the \nintention of defeating the candidate, was not deemed advocacy in the \nelection--unless it used those magic words. The idiocy of that premise \nis obvious to anyone in politics.\n  The Court's amateurish folly about political spending extended to \npresuming that spending by a powerful interest for a candidate would \ncreate no risk of corruption; that the spending and the resulting \ninfluence could be kept separate and independent. That is idiotic in \nreal life.\n  When a powerful political interest starts signaling that it will \nspend enormous sums to support candidates, guess what--candidates will \nfind a way to take advantage, perhaps by attracting the spending to \ntheir own side by the positions they take or perhaps by avoiding taking \npositions that would send the spending to their opponent's side. The \nCourt presumed that some etiquette would separate interest from \ncandidate, but that was folly. It is blindingly naive to think that \npolitics would produce no workarounds, that no coordination or \nsignaling or intermediaries would violate whatever etiquette of \nindependence the Court had in mind.\n  As we know, information travels fast in politics, never mind the \netiquette. Drop a rock in a stream, and the stream flows around it. Put \neager candidates and enormous interested spenders together, and trouble \nwill follow, as it has. Look no further than the corruption of American \npolitics on climate change by the fossil fuel industry. Again, this was \nidiocy from amateurs.\n  But the Valeo folly accomplished one thing: It opened the lane for \nunlimited special interest spending to come into elections to support \nor oppose candidates, just as Powell's secret memo had recommended.\n  The next opportunity for Powell came 2 years later, and this, time it \ninvolved not just the type of political activity corporations would \nlikely undertake but corporations directly.\n  Massachusetts had banned corporate campaign contributions from \nstatewide political referenda. A Massachusetts bank, the First National \nBank of Boston, objected and sued. Frank Bellotti was then the \nCommonwealth's attorney general and defendant.\n\n  First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti wound its way up to the \nSupreme Court. Here, the question was the very right of corporations to \ninfluence popular elections--in this case, a\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\nreferendum election. In a 5-to-4 decision, Powell wrote for the \nRepublican-appointed majority that corporations had a constitutional \nright to engage in that political activity.\n  This outcome can't be found in the Constitution, which provides no \npolitical role whatsoever to corporations, but this outcome aligned \nprecisely with the recommendations of Powell's secret report to the \nchamber. Indeed, it was the heart of his pitch to the chamber. His \nentire secret plan for corporate political power would fall apart if \nStates could bar corporate influence from elections, even referendum \nelections. Powell had urged in his secret report that corporate \ninterests not have ``the slightest hesitation to press vigorously in \nall political arenas'' and that corporations should show no \n``reluctance to penalize politically those who oppose [them].'' \nCorporations could never ``press vigorously'' or ``penalize \npolitically'' if they could be kept out of elections, and so Bellotti \nwas decided.\n  Paired with Valeo, the Bellotti case established that corporations \nhad a constitutional right to engage in elections--at least referendum \nelections--with as much money as they wanted, or at least as much money \nas they could raise, so long as the election spending was not in the \nform of campaign contributions.\n  Ultimately, this laid the framework for the infamous Citizens United \ndecision, another bare, 5-to-4 Republican majority that gave in this \ncase corporate interests a full constitutional right to unlimited \npolitical spending and, as a practical matter, to unlimited anonymous \npolitical spending.\n  How, in Bellotti, did they get around a Constitution that provides \ncorporations no political rights? The trick used was to focus on the \nmessage, not the messenger--completely overlook that it was a \ncorporation, not a person. The Court said that corporate political \nspending was actually speech, that influencing a popular referendum was \nthe ``type of speech'' at the heart of representative democracy, and \nthat the public had a right to hear it. The fact that corporations are \nnot people and, indeed, that they have advantages over real people in \nelectioneering and, indeed, that they might even come to dominate \npopular democracy because of those advantages was overlooked by \ndirecting attention to the speech, not the speaker.\n  If the type of speech was relevant to the public debate, Powell said, \nit doesn't matter whether a corporation or a person says it--except \nevery piece of this is wrong. Money is not speech. Corporations are not \npeople. And looking at the message, not the messenger, would allow any \nentity's message into our politics, even foreign ones. Then add in \nanonymity, and the problem goes toxic, as we now see in our country \ntoday. ``We the People'' becomes ``We the Hidden Anything With Money.''\n  The last case for Powell was Federal Election Commission v. \nMassachusetts Citizens for Life in 1986. Here, the question was whether \nan advocacy group of precisely the kind Powell had in mind in the \nchamber memo was forbidden to spend its corporate treasury funds in a \nFederal election.\n  Now, the situation was that Congress had blocked corporations from \nusing their treasury funds in Federal elections. They had to raise \nmoney from voluntary donations; hence the corporate PACs that we have \nseen that had to raise and spend their own money. The Court accepted \nthat corporate treasuries might give corporate voices ``an unfair \nadvantage in the political marketplace'' given their vast corporate \nwealth and resources. But in the case before it, the Court decided that \nnonprofits were different. They were designed for advocacy, and they \ndidn't have the same sort of treasury funds as business corporations.\n  Again, remember the Powell memo. Powell didn't recommend that \ncorporations undertake their political work directly. He had pressed \nfor ``organization,'' for ``joint effort.'' He had urged corporate \nAmerica to pursue ``the political power available only through united \naction and national organizations.'' And guess what. The U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce, the national organization to which Powell had delivered \nhis secret recommendations, was a nonprofit corporation.\n  In his years on the Court, Lewis Powell made good on the secret \nrecommendations that he had made to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 5 \nmonths before joining the Court. He showed that ``an activist-minded \nSupreme Court''--his words--could be that ``important instrument for \nsocial, economic and political change''--his words--that he had \nproposed. He opened a lane for unlimited money into politics, enabling \nwhat his secret report had called ``the scale of financing available \nonly through joint effort.'' He bulldozed aside bars on corporate \nspending and politics so corporations could deploy, just as his report \nhad urged, ``whatever degree of pressure--publicly and privately--may \nbe necessary.'' And he allowed advocacy organizations to spend their \ntreasuries in politics, opening the way for the ``organization,'' \n``joint effort,'' and ``united action'' he had called for in his report \nthrough ``national organizations.''\n  All the key pieces were in place to unleash the corporate influence \nmachine that he had recommended to the chamber, influence that \ndominates much of American politics today, influence that controls much \nof what we do in the Senate Chamber today, and in which, of all things, \nthe chamber, which was his client for the secret report, is today the \napex predator of corporate influence, red in tooth and claw.\n  Everything was aligned for what Powell had recommended: corporate \n``political power,'' ``assiduously cultivated,'' ``used aggressively \nand with determination,'' with ``no hesitation to attack,'' ``not the \nslightest hesitation to press vigorously in all political arenas,'' and \nno ``reluctance to penalize politically those who oppose.''\n  It is a dark achievement, but it is quite an achievement. And, \ninterestingly, Powell's official biography frames out his judicial \ncareer without mentioning his role as the early orchestrator of \ncorporate political influence in American politics. It is actually \nlikely his most significant and lasting legacy.\n  To be continued.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And he allowed advocacy organizations to spend their treasuries in politics, opening the way for the ``organization,'' ``joint effort,'' and ``united action'' he had called for in his report through ``national organizations.''\n\tAll the key pieces were in place to unleash the corporate influence machine that he had recommended to the chamber, influence that dominates much of American politics today, influence that controls much of what we do in the Senate Chamber today, and in which, of all things, the chamber, which was his client for the secret report, is today the apex predator of corporate influence, red in tooth and claw.\n\tEverything was aligned for what Powell had recommended: corporate ``political power,'' ``assiduously cultivated,'' ``used aggressively and with determination,'' with ``no hesitation to attack,'' ``not the slightest hesitation to press vigorously in all political arenas,'' and no ``reluctance to penalize politically those who oppose.''\n\tIt is a dark achievement, but it is quite an achievement. And, interestingly, Powell's official biography frames out his judicial career without mentioning his role as the early orchestrator of corporate political influence in American politics. It is actually likely his most significant and lasting legacy.\n\tTo be continued.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.
