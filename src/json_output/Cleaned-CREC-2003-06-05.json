The breeze heightens to \n     a gust and in the furious waves, the flag lets out a crack \n     like a whip. The crack resounds through the air reminding all \n     who hear it of the flag's presence. But what does that flag \n     mean? It means one thing: freedom. In America we pride \n     ourselves on our institutions of checks and balances, all \n     created with the purpose of maintaining freedom. But with \n     freedom comes responsibility and obligations, but what is \n     freedom's obligation?\n       This complex question is answered rather simply. Freedom's \n     obligation is to protect principle over property, to guard \n     ideas over oil, to defend the helpless, not the helpful. This \n     is freedom's obligation.\n       For thousands of years people have been fighting over the \n     lines on maps or the resources in a region, but America is \n     more than that. Freedom demands of us to overlook our petty, \n     selfish needs to satisfy the calling of a higher government: \n     The government of humanity. Freedom is not about money, \n     capitalism, oil, or land. It is about ideas, people, \n     happiness, and liberty.\n       In the past twenty years a massive amount of criticism has \n     risen against the United States for the wars it has \n     participated in. Many claim our participation has been based \n     solely on money rather than morals. Other critics claim that \n     we simply make up moral justifications for fighting wars that \n     we are really only interested in for monetary or political \n     gain. Take for example the Kosovo War and the Gulf War. Both \n     Yugoslavia and Kuwait were strategic oil suppliers. On the \n     other hand, the United States gave detailed moral \n     justifications for its involvement. Perhaps it is time that \n     critics examine the fact that if you fight for any moral \n     cause, you will most likely help your own, and the world \n     economy, because any economy operates better and more \n     effectively when it is not under the iron hand of a \n     repressive regime.\n       But freedom's obligation is not just to one country, our \n     own United States, but to all forms of democracy around the \n     world. Many critics suggest that the United States is too \n     much of a policeman in the world, but how could one assume \n     so? What is America about? It is about freedom for all of \n     mankind and justice for everyone. When someone is ten feet \n     outside of our borders, do they become any less human? No. \n     Then do they deserve any less protection than we would give \n     another human life within our borders? Freedom's obligation \n     is not merely to protect any specific people's freedom, but \n     to help people to understand that any group's cry for freedom \n     is paramount to a regime's sovereignty.\n       A sad example, Taiwan is in a constant state of protest \n     over democratization, but China, a repressive Communist \n     relic, refuses to let them break away. Should the people of \n     the United States simply sit back and take the money of the \n     Chinese Government while ignoring the wails for freedom \n     sounded by the people of Taiwan?\n       Freedom is not about Gross Domestic Product, the \n     Stockmarket, or Armies. It is about people, principles, and \n     morality. Freedom gives great benefits, but it also demands \n     great sacrifice. The crack of the flag is not just there to \n     remind us that we are Americans. It is there to remind us \n     that we are a free people! A regime demands no sacrifice \n     because it does what it wants at the expense of the helpless. \n     Freedom, however, demands that we give up something of \n     ourselves so that others, anywhere in the world, can share at \n     least a fraction of what we have here. That is what brave \n     American forces have been fighting for.\n       The Bible, the Quran, the Torah, and the Book of Buddhist \n     Principles all suggest that you give something of yourself, \n     whether it be your time or your money, to help someone else. \n     They all stress the personal and moral rewards of sacrifice. \n     But there is another document that preaches the benefits of \n     sacrifice: the Constitution, because wherever freedom \n     resides, sacrifice must follow, because freedom is love and \n     love is sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "MR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a wonderful human \nbeing and a magnificent activist symbolized by North Miami community \nleader Ted Ravelo, a Filipino-American. On Saturday, June 7, 2003, at \nthe Design Center of the Americas (DCOTA) in Broward County, he will be \nhonored by the Philippine American Federation of South Florida, Inc. at \na gala event celebrating the 105th Philippine Independence Day \nfestivities.\n  Mr. Ravelo came to the North Miami community some 15 years ago. He \nwas the Director of the Southern Apparel Exhibitors at the Miami \nMerchandise Mart, after which he directed the Southeastern Apparel \nExhibitors in Atlanta, Georgia. The citation for this gala event \ndefines ``. . . his loyal service to the community of North Miami and \nthe Filipino-American community he has helped with utmost care and \nconcern.'' Above all, however, this pioneering leader is more saliently \ncharacterized by his deep faith in the God he serves through countless \nFilipino immigrants in search of a warm friendship and timely advice. \nBeing a dutiful husband to his wife, Ma. Teresa Padua-Ravelo, and a \nloving father to his two teenaged children, Jamie and Jo Anne, he has \ntaken upon himself the awesome responsibility of providing the same \nbrand of love and affection to many more Filipino-American families who \nsearch for guidance and direction in the ways and processes of how \ngovernment and its various agencies function.\n  Indeed, Mr. Ravelo represents the best and the noblest of our \ncommunity in his unceasing involvement with the socio-cultural well-\nbeing of his fellow immigrants in a manner that uplifted their own \nself-esteem and dignity. He continues to demonstrate a remarkable \nwisdom and warm friendship in serving his North Miami community, and \nstill manages to enlighten his fellow citizens on the agenda of \nconscientious public service and good governance impacting our duties \nand responsibilities toward the less fortunate.\n  I am indeed a beneficiary of the brand of genuine advocacy he \ndemonstrates both by way of word and example. I have learned from him \nthe many struggles that immigrants throughout my district have had to \nconfront on a daily basis, conscious of the fact that the will to \nsucceed and be aware of the many nuances of public service undergird \nthe civic responsibilities of a community leader and must characterize \nhis advocacy role toward those who could least fend for themselves.\n  Continuing his mission to represent his fellow citizens and \nimmigrants, Mr. Ted Ravelo was named to the North Miami Community \nRelations Board from 1997 thru 1998 and served as President of the \nFilipino Community Association of South Florida, Inc. Indeed, his quest \nfor making a little bit of difference in the lives of people has always \nbeen his genuine way of changing the kind of world to which he was \ngiven to serve.\n  Named as the Activist of the Year by the North Miami Mayor's Economic \nTask Force in 1997, he has held the presidency of the Central North \nMiami Homeowners Association and vice-presidency of the North Miami \nMayor's Economic Task Force, and has likewise held memberships on the \nMiami-Dade County Asian-American Advisory Board, Greater North Miami \nChamber of Commerce and Asian-American Federation of Florida.\n  His involvement with the above organizations motivated his desire to \nrun for the Mayor's seat of North Miami during the 1999 mayoral \nelections. Though he eventually lost his race, he ran a strong and \ncredible campaign by focusing on the crucial issues impacting the well-\nbeing and equality of opportunity for his fellow citizens.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my concerns about the \neffect that Diabetes is having on the Latino Community.\n  Right now, 16 million people in the United States are suffering with \nType 2 Diabetes. About 3 million of them are Latinos. Due to diet and \ngenetics, Latinos are twice as likely as the rest of the population to \ncontract Type 2 Diabetes. I am horrified by the statistic that one in \nten Latinos will contract Diabetes at some point in life, but I am even \nmore horrified by the fact that most often the disease is preventable.\n  Both of my parents died from complications related to Diabetes. As \nthe parents of 15 children, I believe that they didn't have the time or \nthe resources to adequately care for themselves. With all of those \nmouths to feed, I believe that they were too busy trying to simply put \nfood on the table to worry about proper nutrition. While that is \nundoubtedly noble, stories like this must change. My parents, because \nthey did not have the proper care, suffered loss of vision, \namputations, and eventually death.\n  We must make sure that Latino families are educated about prevention \nand have the resources to combat the disease. Prevention is key to \nfighting this disease but we cannot ignore the fact that eleven million \nLatinos still lack health insurance. How can a person get tested for \nDiabetes when they are uninsured? How can a person seek out a doctor \nwhen they can't even pay for the visit? This is something Congress must \nfight to change.\n  If we want to combat Diabetes, we must focus on prevention, \neducation, and cultural changes. No one is saying that as a culture we \ncan't enjoy our frijoles and tortillas. We simply must learn and teach \nour children, that moderation is the best approach.\n  We must educate our communities. We must spread the word about \nprevention. And we must help the uninsured. If we do not make these \nnecessary changes, we won't have to worry about one in ten Latinos \nhaving Diabetes, we will have to worry about one in five.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "DIABETES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             HON.

Prevention is key to fighting this disease but we cannot ignore the fact that eleven million Latinos still lack health insurance. How can a person get tested for Diabetes when they are uninsured? How can a person seek out a doctor when they can't even pay for the visit? This is something Congress must fight to change.\n\tIf we want to combat Diabetes, we must focus on prevention, education, and cultural changes. No one is saying that as a culture we can't enjoy our frijoles and tortillas. We simply must learn and teach our children, that moderation is the best approach.\n\tWe must educate our communities. We must spread the word about prevention. And we must help the uninsured. If we do not make these necessary changes, we won't have to worry about one in ten Latinos having Diabetes, we will have to worry about one in five.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Joe Baca"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support \nof S. 222, The Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2003. \nThis legislation puts to rest long-standing water rights disputes \nbetween water users in the Little Colorado River basin in Arizona. More \nimportantly, this legislation would also provide the Zuni tribe with \nthe financial resources to acquire water rights in the Little Colorado \nRiver basin and to restore the riparian environment that existed \npreviously at Zuni Heaven Reservation.\n  Recently, a delegation of Zuni tribal leaders and members visited my \noffice here in Washington. They told me that Zuni Heaven, a riparian \narea along the Little Colorado River, is central to the Zuni religious \nand cultural traditions and is the place where Zuni deities and \nancestors have resided from time immemorial. This sacred riparian area \nis the home of the Kachina, one of the highest religious orders in Zuni \nculture, and was in historical times, a very lush riparian area with \nwillow, cottonwood, cattails, turtles, and waterfowl.\n  Ever since the 1877 Presidential order diminished the Zuni cultural \nhomelands and established the current Zuni Reservation in New Mexico, \nthe Zuni people have maintained the practice of making a pilgrimage to \nZuni Heaven. Every four years, Zunis from western New Mexico trek over \n50 miles to Zuni Heaven, located in northeast Arizona, to perform \nreligious ceremonies during the summer solstice period. This pilgrimage \nis very important because it helps sustain and rejuvenate Zunis' \ncultural and religious traditions.\n  The Zuni Water Rights Settlement will help the Zuni people restore \ntheir sacred Zuni Heaven to the way it was as described in ancient \ntraditional historical accounts. Furthermore, it will help them develop \nwetlands for water plants, birds and other animals so important and \nnecessary in carrying on the Zuni Kachina religion.\n  Considering the above, I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me \ntoday and support this very important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ZUNI INDIAN TRIBE WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               speech of\n\n                             HON.

Mr. Speaker, the privately funded and privately constituted \n``Continuity of Government Commission'' has recently proposed that, for \nthe first time in our Nation's history, we should allow the appointment \nof members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Not only does this \nproposal fail to comport with the intention of the founders of this \nnation, but, even worse, it advocates a solution that has been \nrepeatedly rejected by this body.\n  The report of this so-called ``Commission'' makes clear that while \nthe Senate has, from time to time, voted to pass constitutional \namendments allowing for the appointment of House members, this body has \nalways jealously guarded its status as ``the people's House'' by \nfailing to pass such amendments. A brief history review may be in order \nat this point. First, our Nation has been under attack from foreign \npowers in the past, such as in its nascent years when the British were \nconstantly ``coming.'' In our own century, we faced an attack on Pearl \nHarbor as well as the very real threat of nuclear annihilation. Now, \nbecause we have learned that our Capitol was a potential target in a \nterror plot, there is an outcry from some corners regarding our \nvulnerability.

Mr. Speaker, the privately funded and privately constituted ``Continuity of Government Commission'' has recently proposed that, for the first time in our Nation's history, we should allow the appointment of members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Not only does this proposal fail to comport with the intention of the founders of this nation, but, even worse, it advocates a solution that has been repeatedly rejected by this body.\n\tThe report of this so-called ``Commission'' makes clear that while the Senate has, from time to time, voted to pass constitutional amendments allowing for the appointment of House members, this body has always jealously guarded its status as ``the people's House'' by failing to pass such amendments. A brief history review may be in order at this point. First, our Nation has been under attack from foreign powers in the past, such as in its nascent years when the British were constantly ``coming.'' In our own century, we faced an attack on Pearl Harbor as well as the very real threat of nuclear annihilation. Now, because we have learned that our Capitol was a potential target in a terror plot, there is an outcry from some corners regarding our vulnerability. Our government leaders are no more vulnerable today to mass extinction than they were 20 years ago. Our top-flight military makes us, in many ways, less vulnerable to attack and the assassination of our leaders than we were 200 years ago.\n\tEven if we were to sustain such a devastating attack, the nightmare scenario painted in the first report of the ``commission'' is not only far-fetched, but also admits of a plethora of potential solutions already existent in our current constitutional structure. Though the report endeavors to cast doubt on the legitimacy of those structures, it is unsuccessful. Moreover, what could be more offensive to our republican form of government and of more questionable legitimacy, than to have a slew of un-elected ``representatives'' outvote elected people on the floor of our U.S. House?\n\tLet's face it: we can scare people and doom-say anytime we wish, but it would only be in the case of a nearly complete annihilation that our government would fail to function. In such an instance there is no ``system'' that will preserve our government. On the other hand, if we surrender the right to elect people to the U.S. House of Representatives, under any circumstances, we will get on a slippery slope away from the few remaining vestiges and most precious principles of the government left to us by our founders.\n\tIn the event that this ``proposal'' gets more serious and is given long-term attention, I will place in the record more detailed statements defending the notion of an all-elected House of Representatives, and explaining the fallacies and illogic found in this report. For now Mr. Speaker, I simply wish to go on record as among those who would fight to the last to preserve the principle of a House of Representatives consisting entirely of members elected by the people.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Ron Paul"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

I first met Doug and worked with him when I \nserved on the San Diego City Council. I immediately noticed his \nenthusiasm and his seemingly unlimited energy on behalf of the San \nYsidro community where he lived. Because of his work, he was known as \nthe unofficial ``Mayor of San Ysidro''.\n  He moved to California in 1936 and served in the U.S. Navy, in North \nAfrica and the Philippines, from 1942 to 1946. He met and married Jean \nAlexis Wadleigh in 1949, and they lived in the Inland Empire until \ntheir move to San Ysidro in 1974.\n  He was involved in many roles in the activities and organizations of \nSan Ysidro. He served as President, Executive Director, and Information \nCenter Manager of the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce and was \ninstrumental in keeping the Chamber growing in membership. He organized \nand managed a Chamber Visitor's Information Center for several years, \ngiving tourist information to thousands of visitors every month. It was \nthrough his efforts that the San Ysidro Chamber was designated the \nofficial Certificate of Origin supplier for the importation of goods by \nMexican businesses--a vital part of the Chamber today. He took the lead \nin obtaining the first-ever fireworks in San Ysidro by developing plans \nfor the Chamber to sponsor the first two years of exciting 4th of July \ndisplays and continuing to organize these yearly festivities.\n  Doug was Chair of the San Ysidro Redevelopment Project Area \nCommittee, Vice President of the San Ysidro Senior Center, Chair and \nVice Chair of the Southern Area Committee, Board Member of the South \nBay YMCA, and Vice President of the San Ysidro Senior Center. He made \npossible communication cable at the Senior Center, soliciting a free \ndonation from Cox Cable.\n  He was Treasurer of the San Ysidro Little League and was a member of \nSenior San Ysidrans. At the Sister of Nazareth, San Diego Mission, he \nwas House Father for nine years.\n  As a member of the Park and Recreation Council, Doug represented the \nSan Ysidro Recreation Council, supported their Annual Christmas events, \nacquired a big screen TV by soliciting donations, and raised funds for \nthe La Mirada School Joint Use Turf Project. He played a significant \nrole in opening the building at Larsen Sports Field, Cesar Chavez \nCommunity Center. He worked in obtaining Beyer Undeveloped Park.\n  He further obtained funding for the Coral Gate Neighborhood Park and \nthe Larsen Field Parking Lot expansion, security lights and ball field \nrenovation. All in all, he raised tens of thousands of dollars for \nprojects and special events in San Ysidro. He worked to get donations \nfor the Annual Food Drive.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House \nConcurrent Resolution 177 commending the men and women of our Armed \nForces, our leaders and our allies for the courage and dedication \ndisplayed during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and \nOperation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. Since that fateful day in September \n2001 we have been a Nation at war. In one of the few instances in our \nhistory when our homeland was directly attacked, our President \nresponded decisively by declaring a global war on terrorism.\n  That September night while the world watch in horror, the President \ndirected the full power and might of the United States to bring the \nterrorists to justice and asked for our friends and allies to join us \nin the war against terrorists. Over 70 nations responded to his call to \narms and one, the Republic of Bulgaria, has stood with us since that \nfateful day, sharing in the dangers and the determination to fight the \nglobal war on terrorism.\n  Since September 11, 2001 the Republic of Bulgaria has acted firmly \nand convincingly as a friend and a de facto ally of the United States. \nIn the world councils, Bulgaria has supported the NATO decisions to \nhelp patrol our skies after the September 11, 2001, and backed the \nEuropean Union's Plan of Action in support of the United States. As an \nimportant non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, \nthe Republic of Bulgaria has contributed constructively to all of the \nresolutions to bring the terrorist networks to justice. With Bulgaria's \nhelp, UN Resolutions 1386 and 1390 to bring pressure on the Al Qaeda \nand Taliban networks were quickly passed, thereby cutting off any \nmaterial aid to the Taliban regime that was providing safe haven for \nOsama Bin Laden's terrorists and their training camps.\n  But the Republic of Bulgaria has done more than just support us in \ninternational councils. It has come to our assistance both at home and \nin the theaters of war. Within days of our warning to the Taliban \nregime in Afghanistan, Bulgaria granted our air forces blanket \noverflight rights for any United States aircraft participating in \nOperation Enduring Freedom. As the tempo of air operations increased, \nBulgaria expanded its support to provide a base for our aircraft at \nSarafovo. To assist other NATO nations which were providing troops to \nOperations in Afghanistan, Bulgaria volunteered a security company to \nthe peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. And Bulgaria came to \nour direct assistance in Operation Enduring Freedom by providing a \nDecontamination Company to the International Security and Assistance \nForce (ISAF) in Afghanistan. That force has been in place \nconstructively working with U.S. and other allied forces since January \n2002.\n  When the issue of Iraqi arose Bulgaria again stood with us both at \nthe United Nations and at the battle front. Bulgaria took an active \npart in the passage of United Nations Resolution 1441 and has remained \ncommitted to the disarming of Iraq.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House Concurrent Resolution 177 commending the men and women of our Armed Forces, our leaders and our allies for the courage and dedication displayed during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. Since that fateful day in September 2001 we have been a Nation at war. In one of the few instances in our history when our homeland was directly attacked, our President responded decisively by declaring a global war on terrorism.\n\tThat September night while the world watch in horror, the President directed the full power and might of the United States to bring the terrorists to justice and asked for our friends and allies to join us in the war against terrorists. Over 70 nations responded to his call to arms and one, the Republic of Bulgaria, has stood with us since that fateful day, sharing in the dangers and the determination to fight the global war on terrorism.\n\tSince September 11, 2001 the Republic of Bulgaria has acted firmly and convincingly as a friend and a de facto ally of the United States. In the world councils, Bulgaria has supported the NATO decisions to help patrol our skies after the September 11, 2001, and backed the European Union's Plan of Action in support of the United States. As an important non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the Republic of Bulgaria has contributed constructively to all of the resolutions to bring the terrorist networks to justice. With Bulgaria's help, UN Resolutions 1386 and 1390 to bring pressure on the Al Qaeda and Taliban networks were quickly passed, thereby cutting off any material aid to the Taliban regime that was providing safe haven for Osama Bin Laden's terrorists and their training camps.\n\tBut the Republic of Bulgaria has done more than just support us in international councils. It has come to our assistance both at home and in the theaters of war. Within days of our warning to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, Bulgaria granted our air forces blanket overflight rights for any United States aircraft participating in Operation Enduring Freedom. As the tempo of air operations increased, Bulgaria expanded its support to provide a base for our aircraft at Sarafovo. To assist other NATO nations which were providing troops to Operations in Afghanistan, Bulgaria volunteered a security company to the peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. And Bulgaria came to our direct assistance in Operation Enduring Freedom by providing a Decontamination Company to the International Security and Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. That force has been in place constructively working with U.S. and other allied forces since January 2002.\n\tWhen the issue of Iraqi arose Bulgaria again stood with us both at the United Nations and at the battle front. Bulgaria took an active part in the passage of United Nations Resolution 1441 and has remained committed to the disarming of Iraq. When it became clear that Iraq had no intention of abiding by the United Nations Constraints, Bulgaria acted quickly to once again provide unfettered overflight, temporary basing and transit rights over its territory. Once again U.S. air forces soon found themselves a friendly base at Sarafovo. When the moment of decision arrived, Bulgaria stood steadfast with our determined President and sent a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Company to join our forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom and help protect them against Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.\n\tI wish to point out that the Republic of Bulgaria has conducted itself as a staunch and committed ally to the United States and its support should not go unnoticed by this great deliberative body. So I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing that the Republic of Bulgaria is one of the handful of nations that we are here today commending for having stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us in these two campaigns in the global war on terrorists.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Joe Wilson"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Mark Wetzel, a hitting coach from Omaha, Nebraska, travels to \nWestern Colorado several times a year to work with the baseball team at \nDelta High School. He has done so for the past four years, and the \nresults have been impressive. The Delta Panthers have raised the team \nbatting average to .424, ranking in the top five in Colorado. Five \nplayers are hitting above .500, and confidence is high across the \nlineup.\n  Although Mark has played an important role in the team's success, he \nhasn't played the game since the age of 14. Disease forced him to quit \nplaying, and for years Mark thought he didn't have anything to offer. \nWhen his son started playing the game, Mark eventually tried to impact \nhis son's performance, and the results were readily apparent.

Players he had never met, \nincluding some minor leaguers, began seeking out Mark for advice. Soon \nhe was trading hitting philosophies with baseball legend Tony Gwynn and \nhitting coaches from the San Diego Padres.\n  What is so unique about Mark as a coach? Players and coaches say he \nhas the ability to see things other coaches miss. One coach says that \nwhile he will concentrate on a problem and not find the cause, Mark \nwill look at the end result and identify what is wrong.\n  Mark's ability to see things other coaches cannot is not the most \nunique thing about him, however. Mark is almost completely blind. The \ndisease that caused him to quit playing baseball as a teenager also \ntook away his vision. Yet he will tell you that losing his sight is the \nbest thing that ever happened to him, because it taught him how to \noutwork others, stay positive, and be tenacious.

During the \nSecond World War, the restaurant was open 24 hours a day, 7 days a \nweek, feeding the shipbuilders and other workers involved in supporting \nthe war effort from home. When Lewiston and Maine had a need, Marois \nwas always there to meet it.\n  Toni started working in the restaurant at the age of thirteen. She \nand her three sisters worked for their grandfather and father all \nthrough the years. In fact, no one knows the restaurant business better \nthan Toni. Throughout the past 65 years she has performed every role, \nfrom starting as a helper, to becoming a server, then cook, and now \nowner and executive. Toni and Marois are an example of downtown \nLewiston at its finest.\n  Along with her remarkable work ethic and business acumen, Toni has \nalso been there for so many people in the community. From baptisms to \nbar mitzvahs, from weddings to anniversaries, from office and \nretirement parties to Christmas parties, and yes for funerals too, Toni \nis always there with wonderful food and hospitality. So many people \nremember fondly the food, the dessert cart, the French and Greek menus, \nthe formal and correct table service, but most of all, the genuine and \ngenerous personality that is Toni Marois Orestis. No one ever went away \nhungry and everyone went away with a smile.\n  Now Toni, at 78 years young, is finally retiring. When asked if she \nwanted to keep working, she said ``Yes, but part time, maybe 35 or 40 \nhours a week''. That is the true mark of dedication; a life lived \npurposefully and well. Mr. Speaker, please join me and the residents of \nLewiston in congratulating Toni Orestis on her retirement and thanking \nher for all she has done for her community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "CELEBRATING A LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENT AND THE LONGEVITY OF A LEWISTON \n                                LANDMARK\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HON.

She and her three sisters worked for their grandfather and father all through the years. In fact, no one knows the restaurant business better than Toni. Throughout the past 65 years she has performed every role, from starting as a helper, to becoming a server, then cook, and now owner and executive. Toni and Marois are an example of downtown Lewiston at its finest.\n\tAlong with her remarkable work ethic and business acumen, Toni has also been there for so many people in the community. From baptisms to bar mitzvahs, from weddings to anniversaries, from office and retirement parties to Christmas parties, and yes for funerals too, Toni is always there with wonderful food and hospitality. So many people remember fondly the food, the dessert cart, the French and Greek menus, the formal and correct table service, but most of all, the genuine and generous personality that is Toni Marois Orestis. No one ever went away hungry and everyone went away with a smile.\n\tNow Toni, at 78 years young, is finally retiring. When asked if she wanted to keep working, she said ``Yes, but part time, maybe 35 or 40 hours a week''. That is the true mark of dedication; a life lived purposefully and well. Mr. Speaker, please join me and the residents of Lewiston in congratulating Toni Orestis on her retirement and thanking her for all she has done for her community.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Michael H.

This bill effectuates a November 2002 referendum \nwhere D.C. voters overwhelmingly (82%) approved a locally elected D.A.\n  This important legislation is designed to put the District of \nColumbia on par with every other local jurisdiction in the country by \nallowing D.C. residents to elect an independent District Attorney to \nprosecute local criminal and civil matters now handled by the U.S. \nAttorney, a federal official. Instead the new District Attorney would \nbecome the city's chief legal officer.\n  There is no issue of greater importance to our citizens and no issue \non which residents have less say here than the prosecution of local \ncrimes. A U.S. Attorney has no business in the local criminal affairs \nof local jurisdictions. No other citizens in the United States are \ntreated so unfairly on an issue of such major importance. This bill \nwould simply make the D.A. accountable to the people who elect him or \nher as elsewhere in the country.\n  In addition to issues of democracy and self government, such as \ncongressional voting rights and legislative and budget autonomy that we \nare entitled to as American citizens, district residents are determined \nto make every effort to achieve each and every other element of home \nrule.

Suzanne Newlin, a \nteacher at Montrose High School in Montrose, Colorado, is the recipient \nof this year's high school teacher of the year award from the National \nAssociation for Sport and Physical Education. Suzanne is an innovative \nteacher with an uncanny ability to motivate her students, and I am \nhonored to recognize her commitment and dedication to education today.\n  Suzanne has made it her life's work to get her students hooked on \nphysical activities that they can enjoy throughout their lives. Most \nkids won't take part in team sports as adults, so she introduces them \nto other activities such as bicycling, rock climbing and power walking. \nSuzanne not only participates with her students, but she teaches them \nhow to get the most out of their workouts and individualize the \nsessions by including heart-rate monitors. Suzanne does teach \ntraditional team sports as well, though she does so by personally \ndemonstrating skills and techniques to make the experience more \nmeaningful.\n  Mr. Speaker, Suzanne's positive spirit, creativity and innovation \nmake her a true asset to the students of Montrose High School, and it \nis my pleasure to recognize her efforts here today.

Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to stand and pay tribute to an outstanding educator from my district. Suzanne Newlin, a teacher at Montrose High School in Montrose, Colorado, is the recipient of this year's high school teacher of the year award from the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. Suzanne is an innovative teacher with an uncanny ability to motivate her students, and I am honored to recognize her commitment and dedication to education today.\n\tSuzanne has made it her life's work to get her students hooked on physical activities that they can enjoy throughout their lives. Most kids won't take part in team sports as adults, so she introduces them to other activities such as bicycling, rock climbing and power walking. Suzanne not only participates with her students, but she teaches them how to get the most out of their workouts and individualize the sessions by including heart-rate monitors. Suzanne does teach traditional team sports as well, though she does so by personally demonstrating skills and techniques to make the experience more meaningful.\n\tMr. Speaker, Suzanne's positive spirit, creativity and innovation make her a true asset to the students of Montrose High School, and it is my pleasure to recognize her efforts here today. She not only touches the lives of her students, but she gives them the tools to succeed later in life. That is a precious gift, and it is a great honor to speak of her inspirational accomplishments before this body.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Scott McInnis"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

The health of our democracy depends on a full and \nopen airing of ideas and opinions. Monday's action by the Federal \nCommunications Commission will limit the range of voices and opinions \nAmericans will hear in the marketplace of ideas. With marginal media \ncoverage and little solicited public participation, the FCC's vote to \nrelax media ownership rules has made possible the further concentration \nof the print and broadcast media in the hands of only a small number of \npowerful corporations.\n  The FCC's action will only deepen existing concerns about an industry \nplagued by accusations of homogeneity and fears that the news and views \nAmericans hear is dominated and controlled by a few powerful voices. \nYears ago, Congress debated the rules that regulate the cable industry. \nOne of the strongest arguments in support of cable at that time was \nthat the medium would increase the opportunity for a diversity of \nvoices in an arena where only a few corporations controlled America's \naccess to information. Yesterday, the FCC said its decision to allow \ngreater media concentration was motivated largely by the dearth of \nchoices offered by the cable industry today. They argue that the \ncurrent rules are outdated and discourage competition. But they ignore \nthe fact that the lofty aspirations set years ago for the cable \nindustry have fallen short of the mark. Today an alarmingly small \nnumber of corporations like General Electric, AOL Time Warner, Viacom \nand Disney control not only the conduits through which information \nflows to the public, but increasingly, the program content as well. The \nFCC's decision will only continue this trend.\n  This is a dangerous road we are on. As media concentration has grown \nover the years, we have watched as more and more voices have been \npushed from the public stage. Not only minority voices and alternative \nviewpoints, but increasingly even local community voices are silenced \nas corporate executives adjust program schedules to maximize their \nbottom lines.\n  Despite the best efforts of the FCC and those in the media who stand \nto gain the most financially, the public has been able to make its \nopposition to this change known. Members of Congress have received \nthousands of calls from angry constituents who, already concerned about \nthe lack of choice, fear that the FCC's decision will mean a further \nerosion of choice.

DECISION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HON.

The health of our democracy depends on a full and open airing of ideas and opinions. Monday's action by the Federal Communications Commission will limit the range of voices and opinions Americans will hear in the marketplace of ideas. With marginal media coverage and little solicited public participation, the FCC's vote to relax media ownership rules has made possible the further concentration of the print and broadcast media in the hands of only a small number of powerful corporations.\n\tThe FCC's action will only deepen existing concerns about an industry plagued by accusations of homogeneity and fears that the news and views Americans hear is dominated and controlled by a few powerful voices. Years ago, Congress debated the rules that regulate the cable industry. One of the strongest arguments in support of cable at that time was that the medium would increase the opportunity for a diversity of voices in an arena where only a few corporations controlled America's access to information. Yesterday, the FCC said its decision to allow greater media concentration was motivated largely by the dearth of choices offered by the cable industry today. They argue that the current rules are outdated and discourage competition. But they ignore the fact that the lofty aspirations set years ago for the cable industry have fallen short of the mark. Today an alarmingly small number of corporations like General Electric, AOL Time Warner, Viacom and Disney control not only the conduits through which information flows to the public, but increasingly, the program content as well. The FCC's decision will only continue this trend.\n\tThis is a dangerous road we are on. As media concentration has grown over the years, we have watched as more and more voices have been pushed from the public stage. Not only minority voices and alternative viewpoints, but increasingly even local community voices are silenced as corporate executives adjust program schedules to maximize their bottom lines.\n\tDespite the best efforts of the FCC and those in the media who stand to gain the most financially, the public has been able to make its opposition to this change known. Members of Congress have received thousands of calls from angry constituents who, already concerned about the lack of choice, fear that the FCC's decision will mean a further erosion of choice. The day before the FCC was to deliver its decision, they had to shut down their public email box because it overflowed with hundreds of thousands of complaints from ordinary citizens who recognized the gathering threat. Ted Turner and Barry Diller wrote editorials opposing the FCC's plan and groups across the political spectrum from the NRA to now joined the chorus of voices condemning the decision.\n[[Page E1143]]\n\n\tIt now falls to the Congress to serve the public interest and work to reverse this effort to dumb down the American media. The public interest is not served by a cookie-cutter approach to important policy issues. At stake is a loss of competition, local community perspectives and diversity. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reverse the most troubling aspects of the FCC decision.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Chris Van Hollen"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work and \nachievements of John Arger, a dear, close friend of mine who has \nchallenged the thinking of literally thousands of students in his \nMarinette High School government and social studies classes since 1974.\n  John retired June 2, after 29 years of inspired teaching at Marinette \nHigh, which is just a stone's throw across the Menominee River in \nWisconsin from my 1st Congressional District of Michigan. We don't use \npassports to cross the river, and John has made many important \ncontributions to the two communities of Marinette, WI, and Menominee, \nMI, over his many years of teaching and involvement in local politics.\n  I have seen John in action when I visited his classes at Marinette \nHigh, and can testify from experience that he made the subjects of \ngovernment and social studies come alive for his students. A favorite \ntradition for his students was a surreptitious after-midnight visit to \nthe Arger yard at election time. The Argers would wake up to find one \nof every single candidate's yard signs displayed on their front lawn--\ntestimony to how well the students learned the value of becoming \ninformed about local, State and national issues.\n  One of John's special pleasures as a teacher was being able to re-\nconnect with students he taught as freshmen when they came back to him \nin senior government classes. He loved seeing how they had grown \nintellectually and become adult in their concepts of community and the \nworld. Returning students who have graduated and left their hometown \noften seek him out on return visits from the ``bigger world'' that he \nhas helped them to understand, and he cherishes these one-on-one \nexchanges.\n  John grew up in Marquette, MI, where his mother Rose still lives. He \nattended Marquette High School and graduated from Northern Michigan \nUniversity, NMU, in Marquette in 1970. He then earned his teaching \ncertificate at NMU. In later years, he went on to earn two master's \ndegrees, one in political science and a second in guidance and \ncounseling.\n  In 1994, John was honored as an outstanding alumnus when NMU \npresented him its Alumni Service Award. The award recognized his work \nin support of higher education, his service on the NMU Alumni Board and \nhis tireless efforts as a regional NMU alumni coordinator.\n  I have heard rumors that when John was in high school and college, he \nwas a Goldwater Republican. John started to adjust this misguided but \nmost likely well-intentioned position as soon as he began teaching. One \nmorning--I imagine the sun was shining and bluebirds were singing--he \nwoke up to the realization that the Republican party was not the party \nof the average American. He has been an unabashed liberal ever since.\n  However, in his early years as a teacher, he also prided himself on \nthe fact that none of his students could tell what his political \npreferences were, even after a year spent discussing government and how \nit works.\n  John has contributed countless hours to the life of his community, \nthrough public service and in political campaigns at several levels. He \nand his wife Janice have lived in Menominee since their marriage in \n1984, when he finally coaxed Jan away from her teaching career in West \nBend to Menominee after years of dating.\n  Jan herself is a great asset not just to their happy and long-lived \nmarriage, but to the Menominee community. She has been a special-\neducation teacher with the Menominee Intermediate School System since \njoining John in Menominee. She received her master's degree from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin-River Falls and specializes in speech \npathology.\n  On Saturday, June 7, along with many other friends and colleagues of \nJohn's, I will be in Menominee to celebrate John's achievements and \nwish him well. Although his dad Nick passed away when John was still a \nyoung man, I know that Nick will be there in spirit, alongside Rose, \nJan and a roomful of friends, to lift a glass of retsina with us as we \nsay ``Opa'' to John in his retirement.\n  Mr. Speaker, John Arger is the kind of American who inspires our work \nhere in this House. I ask you and my House colleagues to join me in \ngiving him our heartiest congratulations and best wishes for a full and \nhappy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "TRIBUTE TO JOHN N.

Mr. Speaker, I stand before this body of Congress today \nto praise a man who has volunteered his time to help solve the mystery \nbehind the unfortunate explosion of the space shuttle Columbia. This \nevent was a tragic moment in our nation's history, but I am proud to \nknow that our country and its citizens are making every effort to \nensure the future safety of our brave astronauts.

Mr. Speaker, the United States Tobacco Company has \nrequested that it be allowed to market certain dangerous and addictive \nproducts as less harmful than cigarettes. UST would like to market \nthese products immediately without regulation by a health agency.\n  I recently obtained UST documents that speak to the clear need for \neffective and comprehensive regulation prior to any health claims for \nsmokeless tobacco. Because it is in the public's interest to review the \ncontent of these documents, I am inserting them into the public record, \nalong with a ``dear colleague'' letter I recently circulated, the UST \nresponse, and a letter I sent yesterday to House Committee on Energy \nand Commerce Chairman Billy Tauzin on this matter.\n\n                                                   April 28, 2003.\n\n       Should Smokeless Tobacco Be Marketed as ``Reduced Risk''?\n\n       Dear Colleague: In recent weeks, the United States \n     Smokeless Tobacco Company, Incorporated (UST), the country's \n     largest manufacturer of smokeless tobacco products, has begun \n     to lobby Congress for permission to tell potential customers \n     that using smokeless tobacco is safer than smoking \n     cigarettes. The request follows a prior petition to the \n     Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which UST has now withdrawn, \n     in which UST proposed telling consumers: ``Many researchers \n     in the public health community have expressed the opinion \n     that the use of smokeless tobacco involves significantly less \n     risk of adverse health effects than smoking cigarettes.''\n       It would be a serious mistake for Congress to endorse \n     ``reduced risk'' claims proposed by UST outside of effective \n     regulation of tobacco products. Attached are two documents \n     from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids on (1) smokeless \n     tobacco and (2) UST's request to Congress. I would draw your \n     attention to several key points:\n       ``Reduced risk'' claims need to be scrutinized carefully. \n     If new claims that smokeless tobacco is safer than cigarettes \n     cause fewer smokers to quit tobacco altogether, or if these \n     claims encourage non-tobacco users--especially young people--\n     to begin using smokeless tobacco products, any theoretical \n     benefit to those switching from cigarettes to smokeless \n     tobacco products may be undermined. That's why the Institute \n     of Medicine and other experts who favor risk reduction \n     strategies, including several tobacco control advocates cited \n     by UST, actually believe that such claims should be made only \n     with regulatory oversight. A regulatory system would allow \n     close monitoring of health claims and assessment of the true \n     impact on death and disease rates.\n       The Swedish model does necessarily not apply to the United \n     States. UST points to Sweden as a country with relatively \n     high levels of smokeless tobacco use and relatively low \n     levels of cigarette smoking. Yet Sweden's situation is \n     considerably different. First, Swedish smokeless tobacco is a \n     different product from the one that UST makes. Second, Sweden \n     also has tight restrictions on tobacco products, including \n     high taxes and a marketing ban. Third, Sweden does not allow \n     health claims to be made for smokeless tobacco products.\n       UST does not have a responsible track record. The U.S. \n     Surgeon General, the National Cancer Institute, and other \n     major scientific and public health agencies have concluded \n     that smokeless tobacco poses significant health risks, causes \n     oral cancer and other noncancerous oral conditions, and can \n     lead to nicotine addiction. UST, however, has recently \n     asserted that ``smokeless tobacco has not been shown to be a \n     cause of any human disease.'' The company also has a long \n     history of marketing to children, including flouting \n     restrictions on marketing to minors and the addition of \n     cherry, mint, and other flavorings that increase their \n     products' appeal to youth. This record indicates the need for \n     close regulatory oversight of any health claims made by the \n     company.\n       With cigarette smoking responsible for more than 400,000 \n     deaths in the United States each year, there is reason to \n     consider nonconventional strategies to save lives. However, \n     these strategies should be based upon science and carefully \n     monitored in a regulatory scheme to assure that they do not \n     cause more harm than good.\n       If you would like more information, please do not hestitate \n     to contact Josh Sharfstein on the minority staff of the \n     Government Reform Committee (202) 225-5420.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Henry A.

It is not a safe substitute for \n     smoking cigarettes. It can cause cancer and a number of non-\n     cancerous oral conditions and can lead to nicotine addiction \n     and dependence.''\n       ``The scientific evidence is strong that the use of snuff \n     can cause cancer in humans. The evidence for causality is \n     strongest for cancer of the oral cavity, wherein cancer may \n     occur several times more frequently in snuff dippers compared \n     to non-tobacco users. The excess risk of cancer of the cheek \n     and gum may reach nearly fifty-fold among long-term snuff \n     users.''\n       U.S. National Cancer Institute:\n       ``The bioassay data strongly support the epidemiological \n     observation that ST is carcinogenic to humans. Twenty-eight \n     carcinogens have been identified in chewing tobacco and \n     snuff. The high concentrations of N-nitrosamines in ST, and \n     especially the high levels of TSNA, are of great concern.''\n       ``The evidence that NNK and NNN play a role in human oral \n     cancer induced by snuff is strong. Both compounds are present \n     in significant amounts in snuff and in the saliva of snuff \n     dippers. They are metabolically activated in snuff dippers to \n     intermediates that bind to hemoglobin. They cause oral tumors \n     in rats and are metabolically activated by rat and human oral \n     tissue. Although there are many questions about the \n     mechanisms by which snuff causes oral tumors in rats and \n     humans, there is no doubt that the presence of NNK and NNN in \n     snuff is an unacceptable risk to people who choose to use \n     these products.''\n       U.S. National Toxicology Program:\n       ``The oral use of smokeless tobacco is known to be a human \n     carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity \n     from studies in humans which indicate a causal relationship \n     between exposure to smokeless tobacco and human cancer.''\n       ``Smokeless tobacco has been determined to cause cancers of \n     the oral cavity. Cancers of the oral cavity have been \n     associated with the use of chewing tobacco as well as snuff \n     which are the two main forms of smokeless tobacco used in the \n     Untied States.''\n       World Health Organization:\n       ``There is conclusive evidence that certain smokeless \n     tobacco products increase risk of oral cancer, specifically .  \n     .  . smokeless tobacco in the United States.''\n\n\n             marketing smokeless (``spit'') tobacco to kids\n\n       The smokeless tobacco companies have a long history of \n     creating new products that appeal to kids and marketing them \n     aggressively to children. Their efforts have created a whole \n     new market for spit tobacco--in kids.\n\n\n         a shift from older to younger smokeless tobacco users\n\n       Since 1970, smokeless tobacco has gone from a product used \n     primarily by older men to one used predominantly by young men \n     and boys. In 1970, males 65 and older were almost six times, \n     as likely as those ages 18-24 to use smokeless tobacco \n     regularly (12.7 percent vs. 2.2 percent. By 1991, however, \n     young males were 50 percent more likely than the oldest ones \n     to be regular users. (8.4 percent vs. 5.6 percent. This \n     pattern holds especially true for moist snuff, the most \n     popular type of smokeless tobacco. From 1970 to 1991 the \n     regular use of moist snuff by 18-24 year old males increased \n     almost ten-fold, from less than one percent to 6.2 percent. \n     Conversely, use among males 65 and older decreased by almost \n     half, from 4 to 2.2 percent. Among all high school seniors \n     who have ever used smokeless tobacco, almost three-fourths \n     began by the ninth grades.\n       Despite some recent declines in youth smokeless tobacco \n     use, 14.8 percent of all boys in U.S. high schools--and 1.9 \n     percent of high-school girls--currently use smokeless tobacco \n     products. In some states, smokeless tobacco use among high \n     school males is particularly high, including Montana (25.2 \n     percent), Wyoming (28.6 percent), West Virginia (33.0 \n     percent), and Arkansas (24.9 percent).\n       UST (the parent company of the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco \n     Company) is the biggest smokeless tobacco company in the \n     Untied States. It controls about 40 percent of the total U.S. \n     smokeless tobacco market, including 75 percent of the moist \n     snuff tobacco\n\n[[Page E1146]]\n\n     market, which is both the largest segment of the smokeless \n     tobacco market and the only segment that has recently grown.\n\n\n                        strategies to hook kids\n\n       According to internal company documents, UST developed a \n     strategy some time ago for hooking new smokeless tobacco \n     users, which means kids. As one document states: ``New users \n     of smokeless tobacco--attracted to the product for a variety \n     of reasons--are most likely to begin with products that are \n     milder tasting, more flavored, and/or easier to control in \n     the mouth. After a period of time there is a natural \n     progression of product switching to brands that are more \n     full-bodied, less flavored, have more concentrated `tobacco \n     taste' than the entry brand.''\n       Following this strategy, in 1983-84, UST introduced Skoal \n     Bandits and Skoal Long Cut, designed to ``graduate'' new \n     users from beginner strength, to stronger, more potent \n     products. A 1985 internal UST newsletter indicates the \n     company's desire to appeal to youth: ``Skoal Bandits is the \n     introductory product, and then we look towards establishing a \n     normal graduation process.'' In 1993, cherry flavoring was \n     added to UST's Skoal Long Cut, another starter product. A \n     former UST sales representative revealed that ``Cherry Skoal \n     is for somebody who likes the taste of candy, if you know \n     what I'm saying.''\n       Smokeless tobacco products have been marketed to youth \n     through a number of channels, including sports events like \n     auto racing and rodeos that are widely attended by kids. \n     Although the state tobacco settlement agreements have limited \n     UST's ability to continue to do brand-name sponsorships of \n     events and teams, UST continues to be a promotional sponsor \n     of both professional motorsports and rodeo and bull riding. \n     In motorsports, UST sponsors are Skoal Racing funny car team \n     on the National Hot Rod Association circuit. In rodeo and \n     bull riding, UST supports the Rodeo Cowboys Association, the \n     Professional Bull Riders, Inc., and the National \n     Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. As the general manager of \n     the College Finals said, ``U.S. Tobacco is the oldest and \n     best friend college rodeo ever had.''\n       Continuing its efforts to lure and maintain young users, in \n     February 1999, UST ran a full-color advertising insert for \n     its Rooster brand smokeless tobacco in the Daily Aztec, the \n     college paper at San Diego State University. The ad offered a \n     sweepstakes for an all expenses paid trip to the Playboy \n     mansion and, in direct violation of California law, included \n     a $1.00 coupon. State enforcement efforts related to the ad \n     forced UST to pay a fine of $150,000 and also pay for a \n     parallel ad insert opposing smokeless tobacco use.\n       From 1985 to 1999 (the most recent year with available \n     data), the total marketing expenditures of the top-five \n     smokeless tobacco companies in the United States (Conwood \n     Company, National Tobacco Company, Swedish Match North \n     America, Inc., Swisher International, and United States \n     Tobacco Company) have more than doubled, as have their sales \n     revenues. In 1999, these smokeless tobacco companies spent \n     more than $170 million to advertise and market their deadly \n     products. Some of these funds pay for smokeless tobacco ads \n     in magazines with high youth readership, such as Sports \n     Illustrated and Rolling Stone. In fact, despite the \n     restrictions placed on youth advertising by the Smokeless \n     Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (STMSA), UST has \n     continued to heavily advertise in youth-oriented magazines. \n     For the period 1997-2001, UST's expenditures in youth \n     magazines increased from $3.6 million to $9.4 million, a 161% \n     increase.\n       In August 2001, UST announced plans to market a brand new \n     smokeless tobacco product called Revel. UST is marketing the \n     new product as a way to consume tobacco in places \n     or situations when smoking is not allowed or is not \n     socially acceptable. Public health organizations and \n     others are concerned that this new product may lure even \n     more kids into smokeless tobacco use and addiction--both \n     because of its novelty and the misconception that it is a \n     safe form of tobacco use, and because it can be consumed \n     much less conspicuously than either cigarettes or existing \n     smokeless tobacco products at home, in school, and in \n     other locations. There is also a concern that some current \n     cigarette smokers who might ultimately quit because of the \n     social stigma associated with smoking, the inconvenience \n     caused by smoking restrictions at work and elsewhere, or a \n     desire to protect their family and friends from secondhand \n     smoke will switch to Revel or other smokeless products, \n     instead.\n       These public health risks are significant, especially since \n     the Star tobacco company has also begun selling a smokeless \n     product, known as Ariva, and has sold Brown & Williamson (the \n     third largest U.S. cigarette company) the right to market \n     Star's new product under B&W's own brand name.\n\n\n           Health Risks Associated With Smokeless Tobacco Use\n\n       Smokeless tobacco use can lead to oral cancer, gum disease, \n     and nicotine addiction; and it increases the risk of \n     cardiovascular disease, including heart attack. More \n     specifically:\n       Smokeless tobacco causes leukoplakia, a disease of the \n     mouth characterized by white patches and oral lesions on the \n     cheeks, gums, and/or tongue. Leukoplakia, which can lead to \n     oral cancer, occurs in more than half of all users in the \n     first three years of use. Studies have found that 60 to 78 \n     percent of smokeless tobacco users have oral lesions.\n       Constant exposure to tobacco juice causes cancer of the \n     esophagus, pharynx, larynx, stomach and pancreas. Smokeless \n     tobacco users are up to 50 times more likely to get oral \n     cancer than non-users. These cancers can form within five \n     years of regular use.\n       Smokeless tobacco contains nitrosamines, proven \n     carcinogens, as well as 30 metals and a radioactive compound \n     called polonium-210. A study by the American Health \n     Foundation for the State of Massachusetts found that the \n     level of cancer causing tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) \n     in U.S. oral snuff brands were significantly higher than \n     comparable Swedish Match brands. These data suggest that it \n     is possible for smokeless tobacco companies to produce oral \n     snuff with significantly lower TSNA levels.\n       This same study found that the two leading U.S. snuff \n     brands, Copenhagen and Skoal, had large increases in TSNA \n     levels when placed on a shelf at room temperature over a six-\n     month time period. The TSNA levels increased 20 percent in \n     Skoal and by 137 percent in Copenhagen, while no significant \n     changes were observed in Swedish match brands.\n       Chewing tobacco has been linked to dental caries. A study \n     by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention found chewing tobacco users \n     were four times more likely than non-users to have decayed \n     dental root surfaces. Smokeless tobacco also causes gum \n     disease (gingivitis), which can lead to bone and tooth loss.\n       A number of researchers and at least one U.S. smokeless \n     tobacco company (UST) who point to the experience of Sweden \n     and their use of a smokeless product called ``snus'', as a \n     prime example of why smokeless tobacco is not harmful and \n     should be promoted as a harm reduction and/or smoking \n     cessation aid. However, upon closer examination the snus \n     experience in Sweden is completely irrelevant in the context \n     of the United States for a number of reasons. First, snus is \n     a different product from American smokeless products (even \n     the products sold by the North American division of Swedish \n     Match) in that Swedish snus is highly regulated and \n     manufactured according to strict standards. The makers of \n     Swedish snus (Swedish Match) are not allowed to make health \n     claims, and they are forbidden from even marketing the \n     product at all. In the United States, we have a situation \n     where all tobacco products (including smokeless products) are \n     exempt from product regulation and that have been marketed \n     irresponsibly to kids for decades. In addition, there is also \n     disagreement among the researchers as to whether snus has, in \n     fact, played a role in reducing smoking in Sweden.\n\n\n             Industry Denials of Harms of Smokeless Tobacco\n\n       Despite all the evidence of the harms of smokeless tobacco, \n     in April 1999, a spokesperson for UST, quoted in the \n     Providence Journal, claimed that it has not been \n     ``scientifically established'' that smokeless tobacco is ``a \n     cause of oral cancer.'' The Rhode Island Attorney General \n     subsequently filed a legal action against U.S. Tobacco for \n     violating the multistate settlement agreement's provisions \n     prohibiting false statements about the health effects of \n     tobacco products. As a result, UST was required to formally \n     acknowledge that the Surgeon General and other public health \n     authorities have concluded that smokeless tobacco is \n     addictive and can cause oral cancer and to pay $15,000 to the \n     Attorney General's office for efforts to prevent Rhode Island \n     youths from using tobacco.\n       On February 5, 2002, in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade \n     Commission seeking an advisory opinion to make statements in \n     its advertising that smokeless tobacco products are safe \n     alternatives to cigarettes, UST concluded that, ``. . . it is \n     USSTC's position that smokeless tobacco has not been shown to \n     be a cause of any human disease [emphasis added].''\n\n\n            Smokeless Tobacco A ``Gateway'' To Other Drugs?\n\n       High school students who use smokeless tobacco 20 to 30 \n     days per month are nearly four times more likely to currently \n     use marijuana than nonusers, almost three times more likely \n     to ever use cocaine, and nearly three times more likely to \n     ever use inhalants to get high. In addition, heavy users of \n     smokeless tobacco are almost 16 times more likely than \n     nonusers are to currently consume alcohol, as well.\n       A recent study in the American Journal of Preventive \n     Medicine found that ``snuff use may be a gateway form of \n     nicotine dosing among males in the United States that may \n     lead to subsequent cigarette smoking.'' Further, the study \n     found that ``the prevalence of smoking was substantially \n     higher among men who had quit using snuff than among those \n     who had never used snuff, suggesting that more than 40 \n     percent of men who had been snuff users continued or \n     initiated smoking.\n\n\n                         Types of Spit Tobacco\n\n       Oral (moist) snuff is a finely cut, processed tobacco, \n     which the user places between the check and gum, that \n     releases nicotine which, in turn, is absorbed by the \n     membranes of the mouth.\n       Looseleaf chewing tobacco is stripped and processed cigar-\n     type tobacco leaves that are loosely packed to form small \n     strips. It is often sold in a foil-lined pouch and usually \n     treated with sugar or licorice.\n       Plug chewing tobacco consists of small, oblong blocks of \n     semi-soft chewing tobacco\n\n[[Page E1147]]\n\n     that often contain sweeteners and other flavoring agents.\n       Nasal snuff is a fine tobacco powder that is sniffed into \n     the nostrils. Flavorings may be added during fermentation, \n     and perfumes may be added after grinding.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      USSTC Spit Tobacco Products\n\n       Split Tobacco Is Harmful: The Surgeon General, the National \n     Cancer Institute and numerous other scientific bodies have \n     determined that there is conclusive evidence that the use of \n     the spit tobacco products sold in the United States, also \n     known as smokeless tobacco, increases the risk of serious \n     disease, including oral cancer. This conclusion is as true \n     today as when Congress mandated health warnings on all spit \n     tobacco products in 1986. This is not surprising because 28 \n     cancer-causing chemicals have been found in these products. \n     Spit tobacco is not a safe alternative to smoking. Despite \n     this and a 1999 agreement with the Rhode Island Attorney \n     General by U.S. Tobacco Company (the parent company of U.S. \n     Smokeless Tobacco Company or USSTC) not to make statements \n     ``to any news media . . . to the effect that any of its \n     tobacco products do not cause or have not been proven to \n     cause adverse health consequences . . .'' USSTC claimed in a \n     2002 letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ``smokeless \n     tobacco has not been shown to be a cause of any human \n     disease.''\n       Spit Tobacco and Its Marketing Should Be Regulated by a \n     Science-Based, Health Agency: USSTC wants government approval \n     for it to market its products as less hazardous than \n     cigarettes without any additional control over its marketing \n     or its products. Unless the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA) is first given meaningful authority over spit tobacco \n     products, including the authority to oversee the content, \n     manufacture, sale, and marketing of spit tobacco, this \n     request will only increase the harm caused by tobacco. Why is \n     this so? Absent such regulation, marketing by USSTC of its \n     products as less hazardous is likely to result in the \n     following:\n       It will attract new young users to use spit tobacco by \n     communicating that it does not pose a serious risk. This is \n     precisely what happened twenty years ago when USSTC used \n     similar messages as part of a marketing campaign that led to \n     an explosive growth in youth spit tobacco use; and\n       It may discourage some smokers from quitting by misleading \n     them to believe that smokeless tobacco products offer a safe \n     alternative to quitting.\n       In addition, in the absence of FDA regulation there are no \n     manufacturing standards governing these products or their \n     relative safety. This is especially important because tests \n     have shown extremely wide variations in levels of toxins in \n     spit tobacco products across brands in the United States \n     as well as across the same brands over their shelf life.\n       USSTC Markets Its Products To Youth: USSTC has a long \n     history of marketing its products to youth through the \n     development of starter products (pouches, long cut, etc.), \n     the addition of flavorings (cherry, mint), and the strategy \n     of graduating users from entry products to stronger ones. In \n     fact, it is the company most responsible for turning spit \n     tobacco from a product used primarily by old men and women to \n     one used by young people. Despite the restrictions placed on \n     youth advertising by the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement \n     Agreement, the U.S. Tobacco Company (UST) has continued to \n     heavily advertise in youth-oriented magazines. For the period \n     1997-2001, UST's expenditures in youth magazines increased \n     from $3.6 million to $9.4 million, a 161% increase. Without \n     regulation of the way its harm reduction claims are marketed, \n     there is absolutely no reason to believe that their marketing \n     will lead to anything other than an overall greater use of \n     tobacco products, with the attendant harm on public health.\n       Comparing USSTC Products to Swedish Snus Is Like comparing \n     Apples To Ants: USSTC likes to compare its efforts to those \n     of Snus in Sweden and to claim that its products can be an \n     effective harm reduction strategy. The differences in the \n     Swedish and U.S. products and the differences in the Swedish \n     and U.S. regulatory environments render this comparison \n     ludicrous. Any gains that might have been achieved by Snus in \n     Sweden have been accomplished with a product that is many \n     times lower in cancer-causing nitrosamines and other toxic \n     substances than the USSTC products sold in the US. Sweden \n     also carefully regulates spit tobacco products and their \n     marketing. To prevent marketing claims from making these \n     products more attractive to non-users, Sweden prohibits ANY \n     advertising of the product and prohibits the kinds of claims \n     USSTC wants to make here. There is every reason to believe \n     that operating in an unregulated environment, a company such \n     as USSTC, with its long history of employing every possible \n     marketing avenue to attract youth, would only use health \n     claims to further expand its market, especially among youth.\n       USSTC Should Support FDA Regulation of Tobacco As The \n     Solution: If USSTC is serious about reducing the harm caused \n     by tobacco, and about assuring that the marketing of its \n     products as less hazardous contributes to improvement in \n     public health, it would support the effective regulation of \n     tobacco products by the FDA as outlined by the major public \n     health groups. Less hazardous, nicotine-replacement therapies \n     are regulated by the FDA. Why should the manufacturers of \n     spit tobacco products, attempting to make similar health \n     claims, be treated any differently? Only regulation of spit \n     tobacco products by a qualified, science-based agency like \n     the FDA can assure that health claims for spit tobacco are \n     accurate, appropriate and protect public health.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    US. Smokeless Tobacco Co.,\n\n                                      Greenwich, CT, May 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Henry A. Waxman,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Government Reform, \n         House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Waxman: I read with interest your ``Dear \n     Colleague'' letter dated April 28, 2003, regarding smokeless \n     tobacco in the context of tobacco harm reduction and the \n     attached documents from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, \n     portions of which are referenced in your letter. There \n     appears to be widespread agreement in the public health \n     community regarding your observation that ``with cigarette \n     smoking responsible for more than 400,000 deaths in the \n     United States each year, there is reason to consider \n     nonconventional strategies to save lives.'' As you are aware, \n     one such ``nonconventional strategy'' increasingly discussed \n     in the public health community is that cigarette smokers who \n     do not quit and do not use medicinal nicotine products should \n     switch completely to smokeless tobacco products.\n       The debate regarding tobacco harm reduction and the role of \n     smokeless tobacco products as part of that effort is at a \n     crossroads. U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (``USSTC'') has \n     been actively and constructively engaged in discussing the \n     merits of that issue. Unfortunately, the Campaign of Tobacco-\n     Free Kids does not seem interested in discussing the merits \n     of communicating to adult cigarette smokers that smokeless \n     tobacco is a significantly reduced risk alternative to \n     cigarette smoking. Rather, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \n     disseminates documents of the type attached to your letter \n     that have little relevance to the issue at hand, but contain \n     numerous statements that are inaccurate or misleading. \n     Several of those statements relating directly to USSTC \n     require a response.\n       The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids' central allegation is \n     that USSTC has engaged in ``strategies to hook kids'' on \n     smokeless tobacco products. In particular, the Campaign for \n     Tobacco-Free Kids alleges that USSTC (i) employed a \n     ``graduation strategy'' for hooking new smokeless tobacco \n     users, which means kids,'' (ii) added cherry flavoring to \n     Skoal Long Cut in 1993 in order to appeal to underage youth \n     (iii) ``marketed to youth through a number of channels \n     including sports events like auto racing and rodeos that are \n     widely attended by kids,'' and (iv) places ``smokeless \n     tobacco ads in magazines with high youth readership, such as \n     Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone.\n       The allegation that USSTC engages in ``strategies to hook \n     kids'' could not be further from the truth. USSTC has made \n     clear its commitment to market its smokeless tobacco products \n     only to adults. For example, USSTC is the only smokeless \n     tobacco company to enter into the Smokeless Tobacco Master \n     Settlement Agreement (``STMSA'') with the Attorneys General \n     of 45 states and various territories. As a result, USSTC is \n     supporting programs to reduce youth usage of tobacco, and has \n     agreed to limitations on its advertising and marketing \n     efforts that might be attractive, in the view of the \n     Attorneys General, to underage potential consumers of \n     smokeless tobacco, even though USSTC's competitors have \n     agreed to no such restrictions.\n       ``Graduation Strategy'' Allegations: USSTC does not employ \n     any marketing strategy based upon a theory that consumers can \n     be enticed to begin using ``beginner strength'' smokeless \n     tobacco products, and subsequently be caused to ``graduate'' \n     to smokeless tobacco products that are ``stronger'' or ``more \n     potent.'' Any suggestion that USSTC's line of products is \n     developed based upon ``graduating'' levels of ``strength'' or \n     ``potency'' is not true. Smokeless tobacco consumers remain \n     loyal to a single brand or switch among a variety of brands \n     according to their preference for flavor, cut of tobacco, \n     form and packaging. Moreover, there is no set pattern of \n     brand switching among smokeless tobacco consumers. They do \n     not conform to any so-called ``graduation strategy.''\n       Company documents from the early 1980s reflect that there \n     were discussions among some at the Company about a \n     ``graduation process,'' ``hypothesis'' or ``theory.'' While \n     the term ``graduation process'' apparently meant different \n     things to different people, the theory seems to have been an \n     attempt by some to provide a shorthand explanation for \n     consumer behavior in switching between brands of smokeless \n     tobacco, including between the Company's own brands. The term \n     ``graduation process'' as used in the early 1980s: (i) did \n     not relate to marketing to youth, (ii) did not drive the \n     Company's marketing strategies, and (iii) is contradicted by \n     consumer behavior in the marketplace.\n       Cherry Flavoring: The suggestion that cherry flavored Skoal \n     Long Cut was designed to appeal to underage youth is \n     baseless. Cherry flavored tobacco products have been on the \n     market since 1910. Since then, there have been dozens of \n     brands of cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe and other smoking \n     tobacco products with cherry flavor marketed to adults. The \n     use of cherry flavor tobacco products is not surprising. Many \n     products marketed for adults, such as Maalox, Alka-Seltzer \n     and\n\n[[Page E1148]]\n\n     Tums, are available in cherry flavor because of its appeal to \n     those adults.\n       Sponsorship of Professional Motorsports and Rodeos: As \n     noted above, an underlying purpose of the STMSA contains a \n     comprehensive array of restrictions that substantially limit \n     the Company's activities with respect to marketing its \n     smokeless tobacco products. Among other restrictions USSTC \n     has agreed that it will not engage in brand name sponsorships \n     of concerts, events in which youth comprise a significant \n     portion of the audience, events in which youth are paid \n     participants or contestants, football, soccer, basketball and \n     hockey. USSTC's sponsorship of professional motorsports and \n     rodeos is part of the Company's efforts to promote its \n     products to adult consumers and is wholly appropriate under \n     the terms of the STMSA.\n       Magazine Ads: As the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is \n     fully aware, USSTC does not currently advertise in Sports \n     Illustrated or Rolling Stone. On June 7, 2002, USSTC \n     announced that in order to leave no doubt that its marketing \n     program is oriented to adults and adults only, it would \n     suspend advertising in a small number of magazines while it \n     reviewed concerns regarding possible youth readership, even \n     though the overwhelming majority of readers of those \n     magazines were adults. The magazines involved were Sports \n     Illustrated, Hot Rod, Motor Trend and sporting News. USSTC \n     stopped advertising in Rolling Stone in 2001.\n       USSTC appreciates your interest in this important public \n     health issue, and looks forward to continuing its \n     participation in the debate regarding tobacco harm reduction \n     and the potential role of smokeless tobacco.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard H. Verheij.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Government Reform,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of \n         Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: You may have recently received a copy of \n     a May 23, 2003, letter from U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company \n     (UST) in connection with today's hearings on ``reduced risk'' \n     tobacco products. As you consider this letter, you should \n     know that it is deceptive on important issues.\n       The UST letter was written in response to a ``Dear \n     Colleague'' letter that I wrote on April 28, 2003. My Dear \n     Colleague made two major points: (1) that public health \n     authorities have concluded that ``reduced risk'' claims for \n     tobacco products should be made only in the context of strict \n     regulatory oversight and (2) that the need for regulatory \n     oversight of such claims is underscored by UST's history of \n     untrustworthy marketing. The Dear Colleague attached two fact \n     sheets from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. The fact \n     sheets detailed UST's use of a ``graduation strategy'' to \n     hook young users on low-nicotine products and then \n     ``graduate'' them to higher-nicotine products. They also \n     described the company's strategy of appealing to children \n     through the use of cherry flavoring in its ``starter'' \n     products.\n       In its May 23 response, UST dismisses the allegation that \n     the company ``has engaged in strategies to hook kids'' as \n     ``inaccurate or misleading.'' UST claims that it does not and \n     has never used a ``graduation strategy,'' certainly not one \n     related to marketing to youth. UST also rejects as \n     ``baseless'' the suggestion that its cherry-flavored products \n     were designed to appeal to children.\n       Since receiving UST's May 23 letter, I have obtained copies \n     of internal company documents that validate the points made \n     in my Dear Colleague and conflict with the assertions in \n     UST's letter. These documents show that the company planned a \n     ``graduation strategy'' starting with ``young'' consumers, \n     that the company has long known that flavoring in smokeless \n     tobacco products appeals to young smokeless tobacco users, \n     and that UST deliberately adds flavoring to ``starter \n     products.'' The documents also indicate that UST marketed its \n     products to children as young as 13 or 14. Copies of these \n     previously undisclosed documents are enclosed with this \n     letter.\n       These documents and UST's response are relevant to the \n     Committee's consideration of UST's request for permission to \n     market smokeless tobacco as safer than cigarettes. While UST \n     may say that it would never abuse authority to make ``reduced \n     risk'' claims, the company's past practices--and its recent \n     correspondence denying these practices--call the company's \n     veracity seriously into question.\n\n\n                       UST's Graduation Strategy\n\n       UST states that it never employed a ``graduation strategy'' \n     in marketing its tobacco products and that any documents from \n     officials at the company discussing the strategy merely \n     reflected a ``hypothesis,'' ``did not relate to marketing to \n     youth,'' and ``did not drive the Company's marketing \n     strategies.''\n       This claim is difficult to believe in light of the \n     documents that I have obtained. The documents show \n     definitively that a graduation strategy aimed at youth was in \n     fact the company's goal and that implementing this strategy \n     was the objective of the highest-ranking officials in the \n     company. In particular, a 1980 memo from the Senior Vice \n     President for Marketing and Sales to the Chairman of the \n     Board and President of UST sets forth two of the company's \n     marketing ``objectives'' as follows:\n       Introduce an easy-to-use, ``starter'' product; and\n       Provide new users with an easy graduation process.\n       That this graduation process is aimed at young customers is \n     expressly stated later in the document. A chart labeled \n     ``Marketing Action/Staging,'' which includes specific dates \n     for implementation of each action as early as two months from \n     the date of the memo, reads as follows:\n\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Brand/segment                          Objective\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBall'n Chew Wintergreen Plastic Can.......

Marching up this \n     continuum are the company's smokeless products, with the \n     lightest products at the bottom and the strongest products at \n     the top.\n\n\n              Use of Flavored Products to Appeal to Youth\n\n       UST claims that cherry flavoring is common in adult \n     products like Maalox and Tums and therefore that there is no \n     basis to believe that the company used sweet flavors to \n     appeal to children. But the company had clear understanding \n     that favors appeal to young users and not to adults. In the \n     document quoted above, the Senior Vice President for \n     Marketing and Sales states the following ``assumptions'':\n       ASSUMPTIONS:\n       Younger and lighter users prefer a favor, not a natural.\n       Older and heavier users prefer real tobacco taste and \n     strength.\n       Happy Days [a lighter product] can be a better brand and \n     better ``graduator'' with a change in favor.\n\n\n                      UST's Marketing to Children\n\n       Another document indicates that the UST's sales force \n     marketed to children as young as 13 or 14. A memo from a \n     regional sales manager to UST's National Sales Manager \n     describes the effect of a competing product on sales of UST \n     products. The memo states that retailers report that Hawken, \n     a product from a UST competitor: ``is being used by young \n     kids and young adults. The age of the kids is from 9 years \n     old and up. I believe this to be true because outlets \n     located close to schools (all grades) are definitely the \n     heavier Hawken outlets we visited. . . . Also, the people \n     who knew about mouth tobaccos felt the sweet taste was a \n     definite factor with the kids.''\n       This memo goes on to say that Hawken ``has reached kids \n     four or five years earlier than we have contacted them in the \n     past.'' Because the memo is describing a product being used \n     by 9-year-olds, the clear indication is that UST was \n     marketing to kids of 13 or 14 years.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       As we consider UST's desire to market its products as safer \n     than cigarettes, we must keep in mind both the company's \n     marketing history and its continuing deceptions. Essentially, \n     UST is asking Congress to trust that the company will make \n     responsible claims about its products. But it is hard to see \n     how such trust is warranted given the company's track record. \n     Certainly, the company should not be permitted to make \n     ``reduced risk'' claims about its products without strict \n     regulatory oversight.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Henry A. Waxman,\n                                          Ranking Minority Member.\n       Enclosures (2).\n\n\n               u.s. tobacco intra-company correspondence\n\n                                                  January 4, 1980.\n     From: Barry J. Nova, Sr., Vice President Marketing and Sales.\n     To: Louis P. Bantle, Chairman of the Board and President.\n     Subject: ``Moist'' Development.\n\n       U.S. Tobacco has ``made'' the market in moist smokeless \n     tobacco; a segment that remains in the early stages of growth \n     on a product life cycle graph. We must continue to ``lead'' \n     the category in order to:\n       Enlarge our consumer base;\n       Preempt probable competition; and\n       Maintain corporate growth and profit.\n       A recent document from Peter directed itself to ``product \n     leadership''; to the methods of ascertaining the right \n     products in the right positions to meet potential user needs. \n     While some of the choices and recommendations might be \n     questioned, it is not the intent of the writer to mark down a \n     good beginning. Rather, in conjunction with those carboned \n     above it is the purpose of this memorandum to further define \n     marketing action needed to meet the following objectives:\n       Introduce an easy-to-use, ``starter'' product;\n       Provide new users with an easy graduation process;\n       Develop better packaging; and\n       Maintain a simplicity in the product line.\n\n                        Easy graduation process\n\n       There are two ``leaders'' extant in today's marketplace: \n     Skoal, with a wintergreen flavor; and Copenhagen, with a more \n     natural tobacco taste. While Skoal is the biggest\n\n[[Page E1149]]\n\n     seller, reasonable percentage growth is still apparent in the \n     Copenhagen brand; and both continue to outpace Happy Days \n     (mint)--where about 20% of current poundage is samples--on a \n     poundage growth basis.\n       In addition, two other ``natural'' brands continue to show \n     strength with very limited promotional support--W B Cut and \n     Key.\n       Simply, then, we should concentrate on the two proven areas \n     of acceptability--Wintergreen and Natural; and build \n     vertically in these two flavors, permitting the consumer to \n     ``move-up'' or strengthen his pleasure in a taste that he is \n     used to and comfortable with. Even our new loose leaf chew \n     would fit comfortably in the pattern.\n       And while we do feel that mint/spearmint is an acceptable \n     American flavoring in food and gums, it has not yet been \n     completely proven as a tobacco additive; and a triple flavor \n     track rather than a vertical duality would be too complex \n     now.\n\n                        Simplified product line\n\n       We cannot, and should not, attempt to be ``all things to \n     all people'' now. After all, it must be remembered that we \n     are just beginning to tap the market's potential, and that \n     the brands we sell, in most cases, seem to meet a need or a \n     want. To proliferate many new products/line extensions might \n     very well cause:\n       Confusion among potential new users as to where to begin \n     and with what.\n       Confusion among current users regarding what to move to; \n     possibly creating no new business, just a transfer of \n     business intra-line.\n       Problems in media promotion: difficulty in creating strong, \n     separate positioning statements; lack of frequency to explain \n     all various elements.\n       Trade dismay and lack of support. Moist has been \n     ``welcomed'' by the trade, but for the next four to five \n     years we will not be at the point where we can demand two to \n     three times the warehouse or retail shelf space that we now \n     enjoy. To try to put out a myriad of products is to run the \n     severe risk of alienating a carefully built trade rapport \n     based on good sales from consumer demand, as well as inviting \n     an ever-increasing damaged goods problem.\n\n         ``Easy-to-use'' starter product development and intro\n\n       This must be our priority niche at present, for obvious \n     reasons:\n       Expansion demands a continually enlarging new user base.\n       ``Floating'' and saliva build-up are still negatives to the \n     ``beginner''.\n       Most readily available entry segment for competition on \n     both a product development basis and ratio of pay-back to \n     investment. (And who is to say that a so-called ``starter'' \n     product cannot carve-out, in part, its own on-going user \n     base.)\n       Happy Days, because of some difficulty in use and apparent \n     ill-defined flavor, may not be the best effort we can make \n     for ``starters''. It can be improved, and then perhaps, could \n     be positioned as part of the ``regular'' line.\n       Good Luck, a technological advance in packaging rather than \n     a break through in taste, is selling reasonably well in most \n     test areas; but requires better flavor and a final, true \n     evaluation before capital is expended on additional \n     machinery.\n       Our new, shag cut, ``balling'' smokeless brand (whether it \n     is truly ``balled'' or just flattened between the fingers) is \n     the one that ``gut'' feelings tell us can be the most \n     successful entry. It is easy to use. Saliva build-up is \n     minimal. It takes flavoring well. Raw materials are \n     available. Production methods have been proven. A machine to \n     pack both it and W B Cut could be ready by the fourth quarter \n     of '80. However, only thorough testing of the concept will \n     prove its validity.\n\n                            Better packaging\n\n       The general view is that the plastic can would be a \n     positive packaging step:\n       Lower manufacturing costs;\n       Decreases freight costs;\n       Easier to open;\n       Stands-up better in the wearing;\n       Adaptable to holding lesser amounts of tobacco; and\n       May keep product fresher, longer.\n       A small amount of research done in our overseas market, \n     coupled with some results from Hawken testing in Jonesboro \n     indicate good consumer acceptance for the plastic container. \n     And it is understood that both Happy Days and Skoal can be \n     packed this way now, without any loss in product quality.\n       However, we can visualize the possibility of some problems \n     that might occur:\n       Consumer perception that change in package means a change \n     in formula and flavor. Panel testing can prove or disprove \n     this.\n       Keeping the product fresher, longer could negate the \n     ``built-in obsolescence'' in the present container, thereby \n     lessening poundage. Still, good users might just use more \n     because it is fresher. The answer might be gotten through \n     focus groups.\n       Finally, one important facet of plastic packaging--its \n     adaptability--needs further commentary regarding how \n     important it could become in creating new users and meeting \n     competitive pressure.\n\n                        Supposition and strategy\n\n       New users ``pinch'' less often and will use less tobacco \n     per ``dip'': Build up bottom of plastic can--without changing \n     height and circumference--in order to pack a ``full'' lower \n     weight in a ``starter'' product; i.e. .6 ounces.\n       Pricing can be a determinant to trial; and may well be used \n     as a competitive advantage: Lower price on ``starter'' brands \n     to increase trial, lower sampling costs, and preempt \n     competitive, ``low ball'' pricing. for example:\n       Present can price: UST, 42 cents; Jobber, 52 cents; Retail, \n     65 cents (packing half as much tobacco may save 20% or more \n     while maintaining margins).\n       ``Reduced'' can price: UST, 33 cents; Jobber, 41 cents; \n     Retail, 50 cents.\n       Possible result: More new users, happy with a ``fair' entry \n     price, unconcerned with lesser amounts of product, who can be \n     graduated to one of our ``regular'' products at a ``regular'' \n     price (and may want to ``move'' there faster since 1.2 ounces \n     at 65 cents is a better ``deal'') . . . and competitors who \n     probably will have to cut their own margins to find a price \n     point entry meaningfully below ours.\n       The foregoing discussions point the way to the \n     recommendations included on the Product Development and \n     Positioning Chart that follows; after which a Marketing \n     Action Staging form indicates the H&D, research and market \n     testing required to prove their viability.\n\n          Product development and positioning vertical duality\n\n       Assumptions:\n       Younger and lighter users prefer a flavor, not a \n     ``natural''.\n       Older and heavier users prefer real tobacco taste and \n     strength.\n       Skoal is our largest selling and fastest growing product \n     (and best known); all ``starter'' products should acquaint \n     people with its taste.\n       Copehagen is our second largest selling product and its \n     growth could improve with a lead-in from a ``natural'' line \n     extension, whose name and blend have proven themselves.\n       Happy Days can be a better brand and a better ``graduator'' \n     with a change in flavor.\n       The ``top of the line''--W B--may yet be our fastest \n     growing product and deserves a place in both ``verticals''.\n\n                                                                    MARKETING ACTION\n                                                                        [Staging]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Manufacture/develop\n           Brand/Segment                    Objective                period              Reserch period       Test market/period      Roll-out/period\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBall'n Chew Wintergreen/Plastic Can  Introduce easy-to-use,  Blend and flavor--2/    Taste test with new    4 Markets: 2 control   By region, with\n                                      ``starter'' product,    80; Hand pack for       Happy Days user        w/media; 2 reduced     promotional support,\n                                      to increase consumer    research--3/80; Hand    panel, vs. Good Luck   price and weight w/    during 1981.\n                                      base especially among   pack for test           and Hawken.

E. Cameron, Regional Sales Manager.\n     TO: Mr. R. R. Marconi, National Sales Manager.\n     Re: Hawken review.\n\n       Tuesday and Wednesday was spent in the tri-city area \n     (Briston, Tennessee; Bristol, Virginia; and Johnson City, \n     Tennessee) in an attempt to further evaluate Conwood's new \n     item ``Hawken''. I spent this time working with Mr. C. E. \n     Jordan, division manager. Factual information was hard to \n     come by in some of the areas; however, I will attempt to \n     cover what we found from consumers, retailers, and \n     distributors.\n\n                               Consumers\n\n       We were only able to actually discuss Hawken with two \n     consumers who have used the brand for any length of time. One \n     of these was a convenience store manager (male about 55 years \n     old). This man was supplied with samples on a regular basis \n     for at least four to five weeks. By this time he had \n     developed a taste for Hawken and now believes the flavor and \n     taste last longer than SKOAL, the brand he used before \n     Hawken. The second consumer was a 12 year old male and his \n     mother. He stated, and it was confirmed by his mother, that \n     all other brands of mouth tobacco he had tried to use would \n     make him sick. This included SKOAL, HAPPY DAYS MINT, and \n     several brands of scrap. He felt the cause with SKOAL and \n     HAPPY DAYS MINT was the brands were too hard to use, he could \n     never keep them together. Scrap produced too much juice and \n     he swallowed too much. He also felt Hawken's flavor lasted \n     longer. A very interesting observation--his mother was \n     delighted he had finally found a mouth tobacco he could use. \n     During my questioning of this lady, it was clearly evident \n     that she believes mouth tobacco is the least harmful of many \n     habits her son could develop; therefore, she openly \n     encourages him to chew. The price made no difference to these \n     two consumers.\n\n                               Retailers\n\n       While contacting most of the retailers we have had on the \n     ``Tracking Program'', we could only find two who definitely \n     believe Hawken is still increasing in sales. All others state \n     the brand has peaked and most report a decline in sales. \n     Every retailer stated that SKOAL definitely was hurt the \n     worst; however, they all state that SKOAL is coming back and \n     is either at, or close to its previous sales level. They all \n     report consumers of all ages are buying Hawken. Also, all \n     type of consumers are using Hawken. These retailers all \n     agree that the majority of Hawken is being used by young \n     kids and young adults. The age of the kids is from 9 years \n     old and up. I believe this to be true because outlets \n     located close to schools (all grades) are definitely the \n     heavier Hawken outlets we visited. Several retailers \n     indicated that price was a factor with the young kids. \n     Also, the people who knew about mouth tobaccos felt the \n     sweet tests was a definite factor with the kids. No \n     retailer expressed any problem with the lower price of \n     Hawken. They all state their mark-up is the same \n     percentage as on SKOAL and other tobaccos.\n\n                              Distributors\n\n       Distributors all state that they did no more on Hawken than \n     any other new item. They all report that the brand has peaked \n     and they are seeing declines. No distributor indicated any \n     promotional activity was planned for Hawken.\n       As you can see, all levels are pointing the same way on \n     Hawken. I believe the brand has hurt SKOAL and HAPPY DAYS \n     MINT as much as it is going to. Figures prove Hawken killed \n     our increase on SKOAL (30 percent); and at this point, we are \n     showing about 9 percent decrease in sales where Hawken is \n     available. At one point, our loss was well over 20 percent. \n     This has turned around and I believe SKOAL will be back to a \n     break-even point within the next few weeks. I feel by the end \n     of the next three-month tracking period, our increase will be \n     back to normal. I am not at all sure our increase won't be \n     greater than ever. It definitely is a fact that Hawken has \n     brought a lot of new consumers into the month tobacco market. \n     I think this brand has reached kids four or five years \n     earlier than we have contacted them in the past. Indications \n     are that some of these new users are moving up to a stronger \n     brand. Also, indications are that some older consumers are \n     moving from Hawken back to the brands they were using before, \n     and some consumers have begun mixing Hawken with SKOAL and \n     Levi Scrap. If these trends continue. Hawken may prove to be \n     a very good starter product for SKOAL.\n       I am convinced we must continue our tracking of Hawken for \n     at least another three months before our questions can be \n     answered. However, all figures indicate Hawken, when \n     introduced in a new market, will kill our increase on SKOAL \n     and, in fact, cause a 10 to 20 percent loss for the first \n     three months.\n       Our field personnel will continue to supply all information \n     possible on Hawken.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "SMOKELESS TOBACCO\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN\n\n                             of california\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003\n\n\tMr. WAXMAN. Mr. Speaker, the United States Tobacco Company has requested that it be allowed to market certain dangerous and addictive products as less harmful than cigarettes. UST would like to market these products immediately without regulation by a health agency.\n\tI recently obtained UST documents that speak to the clear need for effective and comprehensive regulation prior to any health claims for smokeless tobacco. Because it is in the public's interest to review the content of these documents, I am inserting them into the public record, along with a ``dear colleague'' letter I recently circulated, the UST response, and a letter I sent yesterday to House Committee on Energy and Commerce Chairman Billy Tauzin on this matter.\n\n                                                   April 28, 2003.\n\n       Should Smokeless Tobacco Be Marketed as ``Reduced Risk''?\n\n       Dear Colleague: In recent weeks, the United States \n     Smokeless Tobacco Company, Incorporated (UST), the country's \n     largest manufacturer of smokeless tobacco products, has begun \n     to lobby Congress for permission to tell potential customers \n     that using smokeless tobacco is safer than smoking \n     cigarettes. The request follows a prior petition to the \n     Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which UST has now withdrawn, \n     in which UST proposed telling consumers: ``Many researchers \n     in the public health community have expressed the opinion \n     that the use of smokeless tobacco involves significantly less \n     risk of adverse health effects than smoking cigarettes.''\n       It would be a serious mistake for Congress to endorse \n     ``reduced risk'' claims proposed by UST outside of effective \n     regulation of tobacco products. Attached are two documents \n     from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids on (1) smokeless \n     tobacco and (2) UST's request to Congress. I would draw your \n     attention to several key points:\n       ``Reduced risk'' claims need to be scrutinized carefully. \n     If new claims that smokeless tobacco is safer than cigarettes \n     cause fewer smokers to quit tobacco altogether, or if these \n     claims encourage non-tobacco users--especially young people--\n     to begin using smokeless tobacco products, any theoretical \n     benefit to those switching from cigarettes to smokeless \n     tobacco products may be undermined. That's why the Institute \n     of Medicine and other experts who favor risk reduction \n     strategies, including several tobacco control advocates cited \n     by UST, actually believe that such claims should be made only \n     with regulatory oversight. A regulatory system would allow \n     close monitoring of health claims and assessment of the true \n     impact on death and disease rates.\n       The Swedish model does necessarily not apply to the United \n     States. UST points to Sweden as a country with relatively \n     high levels of smokeless tobacco use and relatively low \n     levels of cigarette smoking. Yet Sweden's situation is \n     considerably different. First, Swedish smokeless tobacco is a \n     different product from the one that UST makes. Second, Sweden \n     also has tight restrictions on tobacco products, including \n     high taxes and a marketing ban. Third, Sweden does not allow \n     health claims to be made for smokeless tobacco products.\n       UST does not have a responsible track record. The U.S. \n     Surgeon General, the National Cancer Institute, and other \n     major scientific and public health agencies have concluded \n     that smokeless tobacco poses significant health risks, causes \n     oral cancer and other noncancerous oral conditions, and can \n     lead to nicotine addiction. UST, however, has recently \n     asserted that ``smokeless tobacco has not been shown to be a \n     cause of any human disease.'' The company also has a long \n     history of marketing to children, including flouting \n     restrictions on marketing to minors and the addition of \n     cherry, mint, and other flavorings that increase their \n     products' appeal to youth. This record indicates the need for \n     close regulatory oversight of any health claims made by the \n     company.\n       With cigarette smoking responsible for more than 400,000 \n     deaths in the United States each year, there is reason to \n     consider nonconventional strategies to save lives. However, \n     these strategies should be based upon science and carefully \n     monitored in a regulatory scheme to assure that they do not \n     cause more harm than good.\n       If you would like more information, please do not hestitate \n     to contact Josh Sharfstein on the minority staff of the \n     Government Reform Committee (202) 225-5420.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Henry A.

It is not a safe substitute for \n     smoking cigarettes. It can cause cancer and a number of non-\n     cancerous oral conditions and can lead to nicotine addiction \n     and dependence.''\n       ``The scientific evidence is strong that the use of snuff \n     can cause cancer in humans. The evidence for causality is \n     strongest for cancer of the oral cavity, wherein cancer may \n     occur several times more frequently in snuff dippers compared \n     to non-tobacco users. The excess risk of cancer of the cheek \n     and gum may reach nearly fifty-fold among long-term snuff \n     users.''\n       U.S. National Cancer Institute:\n       ``The bioassay data strongly support the epidemiological \n     observation that ST is carcinogenic to humans. Twenty-eight \n     carcinogens have been identified in chewing tobacco and \n     snuff. The high concentrations of N-nitrosamines in ST, and \n     especially the high levels of TSNA, are of great concern.''\n       ``The evidence that NNK and NNN play a role in human oral \n     cancer induced by snuff is strong. Both compounds are present \n     in significant amounts in snuff and in the saliva of snuff \n     dippers. They are metabolically activated in snuff dippers to \n     intermediates that bind to hemoglobin. They cause oral tumors \n     in rats and are metabolically activated by rat and human oral \n     tissue. Although there are many questions about the \n     mechanisms by which snuff causes oral tumors in rats and \n     humans, there is no doubt that the presence of NNK and NNN in \n     snuff is an unacceptable risk to people who choose to use \n     these products.''\n       U.S. National Toxicology Program:\n       ``The oral use of smokeless tobacco is known to be a human \n     carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity \n     from studies in humans which indicate a causal relationship \n     between exposure to smokeless tobacco and human cancer.''\n       ``Smokeless tobacco has been determined to cause cancers of \n     the oral cavity. Cancers of the oral cavity have been \n     associated with the use of chewing tobacco as well as snuff \n     which are the two main forms of smokeless tobacco used in the \n     Untied States.''\n       World Health Organization:\n       ``There is conclusive evidence that certain smokeless \n     tobacco products increase risk of oral cancer, specifically .  \n     .  . smokeless tobacco in the United States.''\n\n\n             marketing smokeless (``spit'') tobacco to kids\n\n       The smokeless tobacco companies have a long history of \n     creating new products that appeal to kids and marketing them \n     aggressively to children. Their efforts have created a whole \n     new market for spit tobacco--in kids.\n\n\n         a shift from older to younger smokeless tobacco users\n\n       Since 1970, smokeless tobacco has gone from a product used \n     primarily by older men to one used predominantly by young men \n     and boys. In 1970, males 65 and older were almost six times, \n     as likely as those ages 18-24 to use smokeless tobacco \n     regularly (12.7 percent vs. 2.2 percent. By 1991, however, \n     young males were 50 percent more likely than the oldest ones \n     to be regular users. (8.4 percent vs. 5.6 percent. This \n     pattern holds especially true for moist snuff, the most \n     popular type of smokeless tobacco. From 1970 to 1991 the \n     regular use of moist snuff by 18-24 year old males increased \n     almost ten-fold, from less than one percent to 6.2 percent. \n     Conversely, use among males 65 and older decreased by almost \n     half, from 4 to 2.2 percent. Among all high school seniors \n     who have ever used smokeless tobacco, almost three-fourths \n     began by the ninth grades.\n       Despite some recent declines in youth smokeless tobacco \n     use, 14.8 percent of all boys in U.S. high schools--and 1.9 \n     percent of high-school girls--currently use smokeless tobacco \n     products. In some states, smokeless tobacco use among high \n     school males is particularly high, including Montana (25.2 \n     percent), Wyoming (28.6 percent), West Virginia (33.0 \n     percent), and Arkansas (24.9 percent).\n       UST (the parent company of the U.S. Smokeless Tobacco \n     Company) is the biggest smokeless tobacco company in the \n     Untied States. It controls about 40 percent of the total U.S. \n     smokeless tobacco market, including 75 percent of the moist \n     snuff tobacco\n[[Page E1146]]\n\n     market, which is both the largest segment of the smokeless \n     tobacco market and the only segment that has recently grown.\n\n\n                        strategies to hook kids\n\n       According to internal company documents, UST developed a \n     strategy some time ago for hooking new smokeless tobacco \n     users, which means kids. As one document states: ``New users \n     of smokeless tobacco--attracted to the product for a variety \n     of reasons--are most likely to begin with products that are \n     milder tasting, more flavored, and/or easier to control in \n     the mouth. After a period of time there is a natural \n     progression of product switching to brands that are more \n     full-bodied, less flavored, have more concentrated `tobacco \n     taste' than the entry brand.''\n       Following this strategy, in 1983-84, UST introduced Skoal \n     Bandits and Skoal Long Cut, designed to ``graduate'' new \n     users from beginner strength, to stronger, more potent \n     products. A 1985 internal UST newsletter indicates the \n     company's desire to appeal to youth: ``Skoal Bandits is the \n     introductory product, and then we look towards establishing a \n     normal graduation process.'' In 1993, cherry flavoring was \n     added to UST's Skoal Long Cut, another starter product. A \n     former UST sales representative revealed that ``Cherry Skoal \n     is for somebody who likes the taste of candy, if you know \n     what I'm saying.''\n       Smokeless tobacco products have been marketed to youth \n     through a number of channels, including sports events like \n     auto racing and rodeos that are widely attended by kids. \n     Although the state tobacco settlement agreements have limited \n     UST's ability to continue to do brand-name sponsorships of \n     events and teams, UST continues to be a promotional sponsor \n     of both professional motorsports and rodeo and bull riding. \n     In motorsports, UST sponsors are Skoal Racing funny car team \n     on the National Hot Rod Association circuit. In rodeo and \n     bull riding, UST supports the Rodeo Cowboys Association, the \n     Professional Bull Riders, Inc., and the National \n     Intercollegiate Rodeo Association. As the general manager of \n     the College Finals said, ``U.S. Tobacco is the oldest and \n     best friend college rodeo ever had.''\n       Continuing its efforts to lure and maintain young users, in \n     February 1999, UST ran a full-color advertising insert for \n     its Rooster brand smokeless tobacco in the Daily Aztec, the \n     college paper at San Diego State University. The ad offered a \n     sweepstakes for an all expenses paid trip to the Playboy \n     mansion and, in direct violation of California law, included \n     a $1.00 coupon. State enforcement efforts related to the ad \n     forced UST to pay a fine of $150,000 and also pay for a \n     parallel ad insert opposing smokeless tobacco use.\n       From 1985 to 1999 (the most recent year with available \n     data), the total marketing expenditures of the top-five \n     smokeless tobacco companies in the United States (Conwood \n     Company, National Tobacco Company, Swedish Match North \n     America, Inc., Swisher International, and United States \n     Tobacco Company) have more than doubled, as have their sales \n     revenues. In 1999, these smokeless tobacco companies spent \n     more than $170 million to advertise and market their deadly \n     products. Some of these funds pay for smokeless tobacco ads \n     in magazines with high youth readership, such as Sports \n     Illustrated and Rolling Stone. In fact, despite the \n     restrictions placed on youth advertising by the Smokeless \n     Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (STMSA), UST has \n     continued to heavily advertise in youth-oriented magazines. \n     For the period 1997-2001, UST's expenditures in youth \n     magazines increased from $3.6 million to $9.4 million, a 161% \n     increase.\n       In August 2001, UST announced plans to market a brand new \n     smokeless tobacco product called Revel. UST is marketing the \n     new product as a way to consume tobacco in places \n     or situations when smoking is not allowed or is not \n     socially acceptable. Public health organizations and \n     others are concerned that this new product may lure even \n     more kids into smokeless tobacco use and addiction--both \n     because of its novelty and the misconception that it is a \n     safe form of tobacco use, and because it can be consumed \n     much less conspicuously than either cigarettes or existing \n     smokeless tobacco products at home, in school, and in \n     other locations. There is also a concern that some current \n     cigarette smokers who might ultimately quit because of the \n     social stigma associated with smoking, the inconvenience \n     caused by smoking restrictions at work and elsewhere, or a \n     desire to protect their family and friends from secondhand \n     smoke will switch to Revel or other smokeless products, \n     instead.\n       These public health risks are significant, especially since \n     the Star tobacco company has also begun selling a smokeless \n     product, known as Ariva, and has sold Brown & Williamson (the \n     third largest U.S. cigarette company) the right to market \n     Star's new product under B&W's own brand name.\n\n\n           Health Risks Associated With Smokeless Tobacco Use\n\n       Smokeless tobacco use can lead to oral cancer, gum disease, \n     and nicotine addiction; and it increases the risk of \n     cardiovascular disease, including heart attack. More \n     specifically:\n       Smokeless tobacco causes leukoplakia, a disease of the \n     mouth characterized by white patches and oral lesions on the \n     cheeks, gums, and/or tongue. Leukoplakia, which can lead to \n     oral cancer, occurs in more than half of all users in the \n     first three years of use. Studies have found that 60 to 78 \n     percent of smokeless tobacco users have oral lesions.\n       Constant exposure to tobacco juice causes cancer of the \n     esophagus, pharynx, larynx, stomach and pancreas. Smokeless \n     tobacco users are up to 50 times more likely to get oral \n     cancer than non-users. These cancers can form within five \n     years of regular use.\n       Smokeless tobacco contains nitrosamines, proven \n     carcinogens, as well as 30 metals and a radioactive compound \n     called polonium-210. A study by the American Health \n     Foundation for the State of Massachusetts found that the \n     level of cancer causing tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) \n     in U.S. oral snuff brands were significantly higher than \n     comparable Swedish Match brands. These data suggest that it \n     is possible for smokeless tobacco companies to produce oral \n     snuff with significantly lower TSNA levels.\n       This same study found that the two leading U.S. snuff \n     brands, Copenhagen and Skoal, had large increases in TSNA \n     levels when placed on a shelf at room temperature over a six-\n     month time period. The TSNA levels increased 20 percent in \n     Skoal and by 137 percent in Copenhagen, while no significant \n     changes were observed in Swedish match brands.\n       Chewing tobacco has been linked to dental caries. A study \n     by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention found chewing tobacco users \n     were four times more likely than non-users to have decayed \n     dental root surfaces. Smokeless tobacco also causes gum \n     disease (gingivitis), which can lead to bone and tooth loss.\n       A number of researchers and at least one U.S. smokeless \n     tobacco company (UST) who point to the experience of Sweden \n     and their use of a smokeless product called ``snus'', as a \n     prime example of why smokeless tobacco is not harmful and \n     should be promoted as a harm reduction and/or smoking \n     cessation aid. However, upon closer examination the snus \n     experience in Sweden is completely irrelevant in the context \n     of the United States for a number of reasons. First, snus is \n     a different product from American smokeless products (even \n     the products sold by the North American division of Swedish \n     Match) in that Swedish snus is highly regulated and \n     manufactured according to strict standards. The makers of \n     Swedish snus (Swedish Match) are not allowed to make health \n     claims, and they are forbidden from even marketing the \n     product at all. In the United States, we have a situation \n     where all tobacco products (including smokeless products) are \n     exempt from product regulation and that have been marketed \n     irresponsibly to kids for decades. In addition, there is also \n     disagreement among the researchers as to whether snus has, in \n     fact, played a role in reducing smoking in Sweden.\n\n\n             Industry Denials of Harms of Smokeless Tobacco\n\n       Despite all the evidence of the harms of smokeless tobacco, \n     in April 1999, a spokesperson for UST, quoted in the \n     Providence Journal, claimed that it has not been \n     ``scientifically established'' that smokeless tobacco is ``a \n     cause of oral cancer.'' The Rhode Island Attorney General \n     subsequently filed a legal action against U.S. Tobacco for \n     violating the multistate settlement agreement's provisions \n     prohibiting false statements about the health effects of \n     tobacco products. As a result, UST was required to formally \n     acknowledge that the Surgeon General and other public health \n     authorities have concluded that smokeless tobacco is \n     addictive and can cause oral cancer and to pay $15,000 to the \n     Attorney General's office for efforts to prevent Rhode Island \n     youths from using tobacco.\n       On February 5, 2002, in a letter to the U.S. Federal Trade \n     Commission seeking an advisory opinion to make statements in \n     its advertising that smokeless tobacco products are safe \n     alternatives to cigarettes, UST concluded that, ``. . . it is \n     USSTC's position that smokeless tobacco has not been shown to \n     be a cause of any human disease [emphasis added].''\n\n\n            Smokeless Tobacco A ``Gateway'' To Other Drugs?\n\n       High school students who use smokeless tobacco 20 to 30 \n     days per month are nearly four times more likely to currently \n     use marijuana than nonusers, almost three times more likely \n     to ever use cocaine, and nearly three times more likely to \n     ever use inhalants to get high. In addition, heavy users of \n     smokeless tobacco are almost 16 times more likely than \n     nonusers are to currently consume alcohol, as well.\n       A recent study in the American Journal of Preventive \n     Medicine found that ``snuff use may be a gateway form of \n     nicotine dosing among males in the United States that may \n     lead to subsequent cigarette smoking.'' Further, the study \n     found that ``the prevalence of smoking was substantially \n     higher among men who had quit using snuff than among those \n     who had never used snuff, suggesting that more than 40 \n     percent of men who had been snuff users continued or \n     initiated smoking.\n\n\n                         Types of Spit Tobacco\n\n       Oral (moist) snuff is a finely cut, processed tobacco, \n     which the user places between the check and gum, that \n     releases nicotine which, in turn, is absorbed by the \n     membranes of the mouth.\n       Looseleaf chewing tobacco is stripped and processed cigar-\n     type tobacco leaves that are loosely packed to form small \n     strips. It is often sold in a foil-lined pouch and usually \n     treated with sugar or licorice.\n       Plug chewing tobacco consists of small, oblong blocks of \n     semi-soft chewing tobacco\n[[Page E1147]]\n\n     that often contain sweeteners and other flavoring agents.\n       Nasal snuff is a fine tobacco powder that is sniffed into \n     the nostrils. Flavorings may be added during fermentation, \n     and perfumes may be added after grinding.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      USSTC Spit Tobacco Products\n\n       Split Tobacco Is Harmful: The Surgeon General, the National \n     Cancer Institute and numerous other scientific bodies have \n     determined that there is conclusive evidence that the use of \n     the spit tobacco products sold in the United States, also \n     known as smokeless tobacco, increases the risk of serious \n     disease, including oral cancer. This conclusion is as true \n     today as when Congress mandated health warnings on all spit \n     tobacco products in 1986. This is not surprising because 28 \n     cancer-causing chemicals have been found in these products. \n     Spit tobacco is not a safe alternative to smoking. Despite \n     this and a 1999 agreement with the Rhode Island Attorney \n     General by U.S. Tobacco Company (the parent company of U.S. \n     Smokeless Tobacco Company or USSTC) not to make statements \n     ``to any news media . . . to the effect that any of its \n     tobacco products do not cause or have not been proven to \n     cause adverse health consequences . . .'' USSTC claimed in a \n     2002 letter to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ``smokeless \n     tobacco has not been shown to be a cause of any human \n     disease.''\n       Spit Tobacco and Its Marketing Should Be Regulated by a \n     Science-Based, Health Agency: USSTC wants government approval \n     for it to market its products as less hazardous than \n     cigarettes without any additional control over its marketing \n     or its products. Unless the U.S. Food and Drug Administration \n     (FDA) is first given meaningful authority over spit tobacco \n     products, including the authority to oversee the content, \n     manufacture, sale, and marketing of spit tobacco, this \n     request will only increase the harm caused by tobacco. Why is \n     this so? Absent such regulation, marketing by USSTC of its \n     products as less hazardous is likely to result in the \n     following:\n       It will attract new young users to use spit tobacco by \n     communicating that it does not pose a serious risk. This is \n     precisely what happened twenty years ago when USSTC used \n     similar messages as part of a marketing campaign that led to \n     an explosive growth in youth spit tobacco use; and\n       It may discourage some smokers from quitting by misleading \n     them to believe that smokeless tobacco products offer a safe \n     alternative to quitting.\n       In addition, in the absence of FDA regulation there are no \n     manufacturing standards governing these products or their \n     relative safety. This is especially important because tests \n     have shown extremely wide variations in levels of toxins in \n     spit tobacco products across brands in the United States \n     as well as across the same brands over their shelf life.\n       USSTC Markets Its Products To Youth: USSTC has a long \n     history of marketing its products to youth through the \n     development of starter products (pouches, long cut, etc.), \n     the addition of flavorings (cherry, mint), and the strategy \n     of graduating users from entry products to stronger ones. In \n     fact, it is the company most responsible for turning spit \n     tobacco from a product used primarily by old men and women to \n     one used by young people. Despite the restrictions placed on \n     youth advertising by the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement \n     Agreement, the U.S. Tobacco Company (UST) has continued to \n     heavily advertise in youth-oriented magazines. For the period \n     1997-2001, UST's expenditures in youth magazines increased \n     from $3.6 million to $9.4 million, a 161% increase. Without \n     regulation of the way its harm reduction claims are marketed, \n     there is absolutely no reason to believe that their marketing \n     will lead to anything other than an overall greater use of \n     tobacco products, with the attendant harm on public health.\n       Comparing USSTC Products to Swedish Snus Is Like comparing \n     Apples To Ants: USSTC likes to compare its efforts to those \n     of Snus in Sweden and to claim that its products can be an \n     effective harm reduction strategy. The differences in the \n     Swedish and U.S. products and the differences in the Swedish \n     and U.S. regulatory environments render this comparison \n     ludicrous. Any gains that might have been achieved by Snus in \n     Sweden have been accomplished with a product that is many \n     times lower in cancer-causing nitrosamines and other toxic \n     substances than the USSTC products sold in the US. Sweden \n     also carefully regulates spit tobacco products and their \n     marketing. To prevent marketing claims from making these \n     products more attractive to non-users, Sweden prohibits ANY \n     advertising of the product and prohibits the kinds of claims \n     USSTC wants to make here. There is every reason to believe \n     that operating in an unregulated environment, a company such \n     as USSTC, with its long history of employing every possible \n     marketing avenue to attract youth, would only use health \n     claims to further expand its market, especially among youth.\n       USSTC Should Support FDA Regulation of Tobacco As The \n     Solution: If USSTC is serious about reducing the harm caused \n     by tobacco, and about assuring that the marketing of its \n     products as less hazardous contributes to improvement in \n     public health, it would support the effective regulation of \n     tobacco products by the FDA as outlined by the major public \n     health groups. Less hazardous, nicotine-replacement therapies \n     are regulated by the FDA. Why should the manufacturers of \n     spit tobacco products, attempting to make similar health \n     claims, be treated any differently? Only regulation of spit \n     tobacco products by a qualified, science-based agency like \n     the FDA can assure that health claims for spit tobacco are \n     accurate, appropriate and protect public health.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    US. Smokeless Tobacco Co.,\n\n                                      Greenwich, CT, May 23, 2003.\n     Hon. Henry A. Waxman,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Government Reform, \n         House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Waxman: I read with interest your ``Dear \n     Colleague'' letter dated April 28, 2003, regarding smokeless \n     tobacco in the context of tobacco harm reduction and the \n     attached documents from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, \n     portions of which are referenced in your letter. There \n     appears to be widespread agreement in the public health \n     community regarding your observation that ``with cigarette \n     smoking responsible for more than 400,000 deaths in the \n     United States each year, there is reason to consider \n     nonconventional strategies to save lives.'' As you are aware, \n     one such ``nonconventional strategy'' increasingly discussed \n     in the public health community is that cigarette smokers who \n     do not quit and do not use medicinal nicotine products should \n     switch completely to smokeless tobacco products.\n       The debate regarding tobacco harm reduction and the role of \n     smokeless tobacco products as part of that effort is at a \n     crossroads. U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (``USSTC'') has \n     been actively and constructively engaged in discussing the \n     merits of that issue. Unfortunately, the Campaign of Tobacco-\n     Free Kids does not seem interested in discussing the merits \n     of communicating to adult cigarette smokers that smokeless \n     tobacco is a significantly reduced risk alternative to \n     cigarette smoking. Rather, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \n     disseminates documents of the type attached to your letter \n     that have little relevance to the issue at hand, but contain \n     numerous statements that are inaccurate or misleading. \n     Several of those statements relating directly to USSTC \n     require a response.\n       The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids' central allegation is \n     that USSTC has engaged in ``strategies to hook kids'' on \n     smokeless tobacco products. In particular, the Campaign for \n     Tobacco-Free Kids alleges that USSTC (i) employed a \n     ``graduation strategy'' for hooking new smokeless tobacco \n     users, which means kids,'' (ii) added cherry flavoring to \n     Skoal Long Cut in 1993 in order to appeal to underage youth \n     (iii) ``marketed to youth through a number of channels \n     including sports events like auto racing and rodeos that are \n     widely attended by kids,'' and (iv) places ``smokeless \n     tobacco ads in magazines with high youth readership, such as \n     Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone.\n       The allegation that USSTC engages in ``strategies to hook \n     kids'' could not be further from the truth. USSTC has made \n     clear its commitment to market its smokeless tobacco products \n     only to adults. For example, USSTC is the only smokeless \n     tobacco company to enter into the Smokeless Tobacco Master \n     Settlement Agreement (``STMSA'') with the Attorneys General \n     of 45 states and various territories. As a result, USSTC is \n     supporting programs to reduce youth usage of tobacco, and has \n     agreed to limitations on its advertising and marketing \n     efforts that might be attractive, in the view of the \n     Attorneys General, to underage potential consumers of \n     smokeless tobacco, even though USSTC's competitors have \n     agreed to no such restrictions.\n       ``Graduation Strategy'' Allegations: USSTC does not employ \n     any marketing strategy based upon a theory that consumers can \n     be enticed to begin using ``beginner strength'' smokeless \n     tobacco products, and subsequently be caused to ``graduate'' \n     to smokeless tobacco products that are ``stronger'' or ``more \n     potent.'' Any suggestion that USSTC's line of products is \n     developed based upon ``graduating'' levels of ``strength'' or \n     ``potency'' is not true. Smokeless tobacco consumers remain \n     loyal to a single brand or switch among a variety of brands \n     according to their preference for flavor, cut of tobacco, \n     form and packaging. Moreover, there is no set pattern of \n     brand switching among smokeless tobacco consumers. They do \n     not conform to any so-called ``graduation strategy.''\n       Company documents from the early 1980s reflect that there \n     were discussions among some at the Company about a \n     ``graduation process,'' ``hypothesis'' or ``theory.'' While \n     the term ``graduation process'' apparently meant different \n     things to different people, the theory seems to have been an \n     attempt by some to provide a shorthand explanation for \n     consumer behavior in switching between brands of smokeless \n     tobacco, including between the Company's own brands. The term \n     ``graduation process'' as used in the early 1980s: (i) did \n     not relate to marketing to youth, (ii) did not drive the \n     Company's marketing strategies, and (iii) is contradicted by \n     consumer behavior in the marketplace.\n       Cherry Flavoring: The suggestion that cherry flavored Skoal \n     Long Cut was designed to appeal to underage youth is \n     baseless. Cherry flavored tobacco products have been on the \n     market since 1910. Since then, there have been dozens of \n     brands of cigars, chewing tobacco, pipe and other smoking \n     tobacco products with cherry flavor marketed to adults. The \n     use of cherry flavor tobacco products is not surprising. Many \n     products marketed for adults, such as Maalox, Alka-Seltzer \n     and\n[[Page E1148]]\n\n     Tums, are available in cherry flavor because of its appeal to \n     those adults.\n       Sponsorship of Professional Motorsports and Rodeos: As \n     noted above, an underlying purpose of the STMSA contains a \n     comprehensive array of restrictions that substantially limit \n     the Company's activities with respect to marketing its \n     smokeless tobacco products. Among other restrictions USSTC \n     has agreed that it will not engage in brand name sponsorships \n     of concerts, events in which youth comprise a significant \n     portion of the audience, events in which youth are paid \n     participants or contestants, football, soccer, basketball and \n     hockey. USSTC's sponsorship of professional motorsports and \n     rodeos is part of the Company's efforts to promote its \n     products to adult consumers and is wholly appropriate under \n     the terms of the STMSA.\n       Magazine Ads: As the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids is \n     fully aware, USSTC does not currently advertise in Sports \n     Illustrated or Rolling Stone. On June 7, 2002, USSTC \n     announced that in order to leave no doubt that its marketing \n     program is oriented to adults and adults only, it would \n     suspend advertising in a small number of magazines while it \n     reviewed concerns regarding possible youth readership, even \n     though the overwhelming majority of readers of those \n     magazines were adults. The magazines involved were Sports \n     Illustrated, Hot Rod, Motor Trend and sporting News. USSTC \n     stopped advertising in Rolling Stone in 2001.\n       USSTC appreciates your interest in this important public \n     health issue, and looks forward to continuing its \n     participation in the debate regarding tobacco harm reduction \n     and the potential role of smokeless tobacco.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard H. Verheij.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Government Reform,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of \n         Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: You may have recently received a copy of \n     a May 23, 2003, letter from U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company \n     (UST) in connection with today's hearings on ``reduced risk'' \n     tobacco products. As you consider this letter, you should \n     know that it is deceptive on important issues.\n       The UST letter was written in response to a ``Dear \n     Colleague'' letter that I wrote on April 28, 2003. My Dear \n     Colleague made two major points: (1) that public health \n     authorities have concluded that ``reduced risk'' claims for \n     tobacco products should be made only in the context of strict \n     regulatory oversight and (2) that the need for regulatory \n     oversight of such claims is underscored by UST's history of \n     untrustworthy marketing. The Dear Colleague attached two fact \n     sheets from the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. The fact \n     sheets detailed UST's use of a ``graduation strategy'' to \n     hook young users on low-nicotine products and then \n     ``graduate'' them to higher-nicotine products. They also \n     described the company's strategy of appealing to children \n     through the use of cherry flavoring in its ``starter'' \n     products.\n       In its May 23 response, UST dismisses the allegation that \n     the company ``has engaged in strategies to hook kids'' as \n     ``inaccurate or misleading.'' UST claims that it does not and \n     has never used a ``graduation strategy,'' certainly not one \n     related to marketing to youth. UST also rejects as \n     ``baseless'' the suggestion that its cherry-flavored products \n     were designed to appeal to children.\n       Since receiving UST's May 23 letter, I have obtained copies \n     of internal company documents that validate the points made \n     in my Dear Colleague and conflict with the assertions in \n     UST's letter. These documents show that the company planned a \n     ``graduation strategy'' starting with ``young'' consumers, \n     that the company has long known that flavoring in smokeless \n     tobacco products appeals to young smokeless tobacco users, \n     and that UST deliberately adds flavoring to ``starter \n     products.'' The documents also indicate that UST marketed its \n     products to children as young as 13 or 14. Copies of these \n     previously undisclosed documents are enclosed with this \n     letter.\n       These documents and UST's response are relevant to the \n     Committee's consideration of UST's request for permission to \n     market smokeless tobacco as safer than cigarettes. While UST \n     may say that it would never abuse authority to make ``reduced \n     risk'' claims, the company's past practices--and its recent \n     correspondence denying these practices--call the company's \n     veracity seriously into question.\n\n\n                       UST's Graduation Strategy\n\n       UST states that it never employed a ``graduation strategy'' \n     in marketing its tobacco products and that any documents from \n     officials at the company discussing the strategy merely \n     reflected a ``hypothesis,'' ``did not relate to marketing to \n     youth,'' and ``did not drive the Company's marketing \n     strategies.''\n       This claim is difficult to believe in light of the \n     documents that I have obtained. The documents show \n     definitively that a graduation strategy aimed at youth was in \n     fact the company's goal and that implementing this strategy \n     was the objective of the highest-ranking officials in the \n     company. In particular, a 1980 memo from the Senior Vice \n     President for Marketing and Sales to the Chairman of the \n     Board and President of UST sets forth two of the company's \n     marketing ``objectives'' as follows:\n       Introduce an easy-to-use, ``starter'' product; and\n       Provide new users with an easy graduation process.\n       That this graduation process is aimed at young customers is \n     expressly stated later in the document. A chart labeled \n     ``Marketing Action/Staging,'' which includes specific dates \n     for implementation of each action as early as two months from \n     the date of the memo, reads as follows:\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n               Brand/segment                          Objective------------------------------------------------------------------------Ball'n Chew Wintergreen Plastic Can.......

Marching up this \n     continuum are the company's smokeless products, with the \n     lightest products at the bottom and the strongest products at \n     the top.\n\n\n              Use of Flavored Products to Appeal to Youth\n\n       UST claims that cherry flavoring is common in adult \n     products like Maalox and Tums and therefore that there is no \n     basis to believe that the company used sweet flavors to \n     appeal to children. But the company had clear understanding \n     that favors appeal to young users and not to adults. In the \n     document quoted above, the Senior Vice President for \n     Marketing and Sales states the following ``assumptions'':\n       ASSUMPTIONS:\n       Younger and lighter users prefer a favor, not a natural.\n       Older and heavier users prefer real tobacco taste and \n     strength.\n       Happy Days [a lighter product] can be a better brand and \n     better ``graduator'' with a change in favor.\n\n\n                      UST's Marketing to Children\n\n       Another document indicates that the UST's sales force \n     marketed to children as young as 13 or 14. A memo from a \n     regional sales manager to UST's National Sales Manager \n     describes the effect of a competing product on sales of UST \n     products. The memo states that retailers report that Hawken, \n     a product from a UST competitor: ``is being used by young \n     kids and young adults. The age of the kids is from 9 years \n     old and up. I believe this to be true because outlets \n     located close to schools (all grades) are definitely the \n     heavier Hawken outlets we visited. . . . Also, the people \n     who knew about mouth tobaccos felt the sweet taste was a \n     definite factor with the kids.''\n       This memo goes on to say that Hawken ``has reached kids \n     four or five years earlier than we have contacted them in the \n     past.'' Because the memo is describing a product being used \n     by 9-year-olds, the clear indication is that UST was \n     marketing to kids of 13 or 14 years.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       As we consider UST's desire to market its products as safer \n     than cigarettes, we must keep in mind both the company's \n     marketing history and its continuing deceptions. Essentially, \n     UST is asking Congress to trust that the company will make \n     responsible claims about its products. But it is hard to see \n     how such trust is warranted given the company's track record. \n     Certainly, the company should not be permitted to make \n     ``reduced risk'' claims about its products without strict \n     regulatory oversight.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Henry A.

Nova, Sr., Vice President Marketing and Sales.\n     To: Louis P. Bantle, Chairman of the Board and President.\n     Subject: ``Moist'' Development.\n\n       U.S. Tobacco has ``made'' the market in moist smokeless \n     tobacco; a segment that remains in the early stages of growth \n     on a product life cycle graph. We must continue to ``lead'' \n     the category in order to:\n       Enlarge our consumer base;\n       Preempt probable competition; and\n       Maintain corporate growth and profit.\n       A recent document from Peter directed itself to ``product \n     leadership''; to the methods of ascertaining the right \n     products in the right positions to meet potential user needs. \n     While some of the choices and recommendations might be \n     questioned, it is not the intent of the writer to mark down a \n     good beginning. Rather, in conjunction with those carboned \n     above it is the purpose of this memorandum to further define \n     marketing action needed to meet the following objectives:\n       Introduce an easy-to-use, ``starter'' product;\n       Provide new users with an easy graduation process;\n       Develop better packaging; and\n       Maintain a simplicity in the product line.\n\n                        Easy graduation process\n\n       There are two ``leaders'' extant in today's marketplace: \n     Skoal, with a wintergreen flavor; and Copenhagen, with a more \n     natural tobacco taste. While Skoal is the biggest\n[[Page E1149]]\n\n     seller, reasonable percentage growth is still apparent in the \n     Copenhagen brand; and both continue to outpace Happy Days \n     (mint)--where about 20% of current poundage is samples--on a \n     poundage growth basis.\n       In addition, two other ``natural'' brands continue to show \n     strength with very limited promotional support--W B Cut and \n     Key.\n       Simply, then, we should concentrate on the two proven areas \n     of acceptability--Wintergreen and Natural; and build \n     vertically in these two flavors, permitting the consumer to \n     ``move-up'' or strengthen his pleasure in a taste that he is \n     used to and comfortable with. Even our new loose leaf chew \n     would fit comfortably in the pattern.\n       And while we do feel that mint/spearmint is an acceptable \n     American flavoring in food and gums, it has not yet been \n     completely proven as a tobacco additive; and a triple flavor \n     track rather than a vertical duality would be too complex \n     now.\n\n                        Simplified product line\n\n       We cannot, and should not, attempt to be ``all things to \n     all people'' now. After all, it must be remembered that we \n     are just beginning to tap the market's potential, and that \n     the brands we sell, in most cases, seem to meet a need or a \n     want. To proliferate many new products/line extensions might \n     very well cause:\n       Confusion among potential new users as to where to begin \n     and with what.\n       Confusion among current users regarding what to move to; \n     possibly creating no new business, just a transfer of \n     business intra-line.\n       Problems in media promotion: difficulty in creating strong, \n     separate positioning statements; lack of frequency to explain \n     all various elements.\n       Trade dismay and lack of support. Moist has been \n     ``welcomed'' by the trade, but for the next four to five \n     years we will not be at the point where we can demand two to \n     three times the warehouse or retail shelf space that we now \n     enjoy. To try to put out a myriad of products is to run the \n     severe risk of alienating a carefully built trade rapport \n     based on good sales from consumer demand, as well as inviting \n     an ever-increasing damaged goods problem.\n\n         ``Easy-to-use'' starter product development and intro\n\n       This must be our priority niche at present, for obvious \n     reasons:\n       Expansion demands a continually enlarging new user base.\n       ``Floating'' and saliva build-up are still negatives to the \n     ``beginner''.\n       Most readily available entry segment for competition on \n     both a product development basis and ratio of pay-back to \n     investment. (And who is to say that a so-called ``starter'' \n     product cannot carve-out, in part, its own on-going user \n     base.)\n       Happy Days, because of some difficulty in use and apparent \n     ill-defined flavor, may not be the best effort we can make \n     for ``starters''. It can be improved, and then perhaps, could \n     be positioned as part of the ``regular'' line.\n       Good Luck, a technological advance in packaging rather than \n     a break through in taste, is selling reasonably well in most \n     test areas; but requires better flavor and a final, true \n     evaluation before capital is expended on additional \n     machinery.\n       Our new, shag cut, ``balling'' smokeless brand (whether it \n     is truly ``balled'' or just flattened between the fingers) is \n     the one that ``gut'' feelings tell us can be the most \n     successful entry. It is easy to use. Saliva build-up is \n     minimal. It takes flavoring well. Raw materials are \n     available. Production methods have been proven. A machine to \n     pack both it and W B Cut could be ready by the fourth quarter \n     of '80. However, only thorough testing of the concept will \n     prove its validity.\n\n                            Better packaging\n\n       The general view is that the plastic can would be a \n     positive packaging step:\n       Lower manufacturing costs;\n       Decreases freight costs;\n       Easier to open;\n       Stands-up better in the wearing;\n       Adaptable to holding lesser amounts of tobacco; and\n       May keep product fresher, longer.\n       A small amount of research done in our overseas market, \n     coupled with some results from Hawken testing in Jonesboro \n     indicate good consumer acceptance for the plastic container. \n     And it is understood that both Happy Days and Skoal can be \n     packed this way now, without any loss in product quality.\n       However, we can visualize the possibility of some problems \n     that might occur:\n       Consumer perception that change in package means a change \n     in formula and flavor. Panel testing can prove or disprove \n     this.\n       Keeping the product fresher, longer could negate the \n     ``built-in obsolescence'' in the present container, thereby \n     lessening poundage. Still, good users might just use more \n     because it is fresher. The answer might be gotten through \n     focus groups.\n       Finally, one important facet of plastic packaging--its \n     adaptability--needs further commentary regarding how \n     important it could become in creating new users and meeting \n     competitive pressure.\n\n                        Supposition and strategy\n\n       New users ``pinch'' less often and will use less tobacco \n     per ``dip'': Build up bottom of plastic can--without changing \n     height and circumference--in order to pack a ``full'' lower \n     weight in a ``starter'' product; i.e. .6 ounces.\n       Pricing can be a determinant to trial; and may well be used \n     as a competitive advantage: Lower price on ``starter'' brands \n     to increase trial, lower sampling costs, and preempt \n     competitive, ``low ball'' pricing. for example:\n       Present can price: UST, 42 cents; Jobber, 52 cents; Retail, \n     65 cents (packing half as much tobacco may save 20% or more \n     while maintaining margins).\n       ``Reduced'' can price: UST, 33 cents; Jobber, 41 cents; \n     Retail, 50 cents.\n       Possible result: More new users, happy with a ``fair' entry \n     price, unconcerned with lesser amounts of product, who can be \n     graduated to one of our ``regular'' products at a ``regular'' \n     price (and may want to ``move'' there faster since 1.2 ounces \n     at 65 cents is a better ``deal'') . . . and competitors who \n     probably will have to cut their own margins to find a price \n     point entry meaningfully below ours.\n       The foregoing discussions point the way to the \n     recommendations included on the Product Development and \n     Positioning Chart that follows; after which a Marketing \n     Action Staging form indicates the H&D, research and market \n     testing required to prove their viability.\n\n          Product development and positioning vertical duality\n\n       Assumptions:\n       Younger and lighter users prefer a flavor, not a \n     ``natural''.\n       Older and heavier users prefer real tobacco taste and \n     strength.\n       Skoal is our largest selling and fastest growing product \n     (and best known); all ``starter'' products should acquaint \n     people with its taste.\n       Copehagen is our second largest selling product and its \n     growth could improve with a lead-in from a ``natural'' line \n     extension, whose name and blend have proven themselves.\n       Happy Days can be a better brand and a better ``graduator'' \n     with a change in flavor.\n       The ``top of the line''--W B--may yet be our fastest \n     growing product and deserves a place in both ``verticals''.\n\n                                                                    MARKETING ACTION\n                                                                        [Staging]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Manufacture/develop\n           Brand/Segment                    Objective                period              Reserch period       Test market/period      Roll-out/period--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ball'n Chew Wintergreen/Plastic Can  Introduce easy-to-use,  Blend and flavor--2/    Taste test with new    4 Markets: 2 control   By region, with\n                                      ``starter'' product,    80; Hand pack for       Happy Days user        w/media; 2 reduced     promotional support,\n                                      to increase consumer    research--3/80; Hand    panel, vs. Good Luck   price and weight w/    during 1981.\n                                      base especially among   pack for test           and Hawken.

E. Cameron, Regional Sales Manager.\n     TO: Mr. R. R. Marconi, National Sales Manager.\n     Re: Hawken review.\n\n       Tuesday and Wednesday was spent in the tri-city area \n     (Briston, Tennessee; Bristol, Virginia; and Johnson City, \n     Tennessee) in an attempt to further evaluate Conwood's new \n     item ``Hawken''. I spent this time working with Mr. C. E. \n     Jordan, division manager. Factual information was hard to \n     come by in some of the areas; however, I will attempt to \n     cover what we found from consumers, retailers, and \n     distributors.\n\n                               Consumers\n\n       We were only able to actually discuss Hawken with two \n     consumers who have used the brand for any length of time. One \n     of these was a convenience store manager (male about 55 years \n     old). This man was supplied with samples on a regular basis \n     for at least four to five weeks. By this time he had \n     developed a taste for Hawken and now believes the flavor and \n     taste last longer than SKOAL, the brand he used before \n     Hawken. The second consumer was a 12 year old male and his \n     mother. He stated, and it was confirmed by his mother, that \n     all other brands of mouth tobacco he had tried to use would \n     make him sick. This included SKOAL, HAPPY DAYS MINT, and \n     several brands of scrap. He felt the cause with SKOAL and \n     HAPPY DAYS MINT was the brands were too hard to use, he could \n     never keep them together. Scrap produced too much juice and \n     he swallowed too much. He also felt Hawken's flavor lasted \n     longer. A very interesting observation--his mother was \n     delighted he had finally found a mouth tobacco he could use. \n     During my questioning of this lady, it was clearly evident \n     that she believes mouth tobacco is the least harmful of many \n     habits her son could develop; therefore, she openly \n     encourages him to chew. The price made no difference to these \n     two consumers.\n\n                               Retailers\n\n       While contacting most of the retailers we have had on the \n     ``Tracking Program'', we could only find two who definitely \n     believe Hawken is still increasing in sales. All others state \n     the brand has peaked and most report a decline in sales. \n     Every retailer stated that SKOAL definitely was hurt the \n     worst; however, they all state that SKOAL is coming back and \n     is either at, or close to its previous sales level. They all \n     report consumers of all ages are buying Hawken. Also, all \n     type of consumers are using Hawken. These retailers all \n     agree that the majority of Hawken is being used by young \n     kids and young adults. The age of the kids is from 9 years \n     old and up. I believe this to be true because outlets \n     located close to schools (all grades) are definitely the \n     heavier Hawken outlets we visited. Several retailers \n     indicated that price was a factor with the young kids. \n     Also, the people who knew about mouth tobaccos felt the \n     sweet tests was a definite factor with the kids. No \n     retailer expressed any problem with the lower price of \n     Hawken. They all state their mark-up is the same \n     percentage as on SKOAL and other tobaccos.\n\n                              Distributors\n\n       Distributors all state that they did no more on Hawken than \n     any other new item. They all report that the brand has peaked \n     and they are seeing declines. No distributor indicated any \n     promotional activity was planned for Hawken.\n       As you can see, all levels are pointing the same way on \n     Hawken. I believe the brand has hurt SKOAL and HAPPY DAYS \n     MINT as much as it is going to. Figures prove Hawken killed \n     our increase on SKOAL (30 percent); and at this point, we are \n     showing about 9 percent decrease in sales where Hawken is \n     available. At one point, our loss was well over 20 percent. \n     This has turned around and I believe SKOAL will be back to a \n     break-even point within the next few weeks. I feel by the end \n     of the next three-month tracking period, our increase will be \n     back to normal. I am not at all sure our increase won't be \n     greater than ever. It definitely is a fact that Hawken has \n     brought a lot of new consumers into the month tobacco market. \n     I think this brand has reached kids four or five years \n     earlier than we have contacted them in the past. Indications \n     are that some of these new users are moving up to a stronger \n     brand. Also, indications are that some older consumers are \n     moving from Hawken back to the brands they were using before, \n     and some consumers have begun mixing Hawken with SKOAL and \n     Levi Scrap. If these trends continue. Hawken may prove to be \n     a very good starter product for SKOAL.\n       I am convinced we must continue our tracking of Hawken for \n     at least another three months before our questions can be \n     answered. However, all figures indicate Hawken, when \n     introduced in a new market, will kill our increase on SKOAL \n     and, in fact, cause a 10 to 20 percent loss for the first \n     three months.\n       Our field personnel will continue to supply all information \n     possible on Hawken.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Henry A.

Proudly married to his wife Barbara and the father of four wonderful children, Bert, Tracy, Stuart, and Scott, he has been blessed with three grandchildren, Brady, Breanna, and Jacob.\n\tSince 1975 Herb has been at the service of the Gulf Breeze United Methodist congregation, he has overseen the growth of the parish, from 500 members to over 4,000 members, and has personally had a direct influence on the tremendous increase in worship attendance, from 100 people to nearly 2,000 people.\n\tIn addition to his duties at Gulf Breeze United Methodist, Herb has served his Annual Conference, Alabama-West Florida, as Chairperson of The Board of Ordained Ministry and as President of the Council on Finance and Administration. He has been a delegate to the 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000 Jurisdictional Conferences and the 1992, 1996, and 2000 General Conferences. He has served as a member of the Board of Trustees of Birmingham-Southern College and from 1992 to 2000 he was a member of the General Board of Discipleship of The United Methodist Church. Currently, he serves as Chair of the Committee on Plan of Organization and Rules of Order of the Southeastern Jurisdictional Conference.\n\tThe author of two books, ``We Can All Be Winners'' and ``Today is the Only Day'', Herb has previously been President of the Gulf Breeze Rotary Club and was a charter member of the Board of Gulf Breeze Hospital, a role he continues to serve in today.\n\tMr. Speaker, I would like to offer my sincere and heartfelt congratulations to my good friend Dr. Herb Sadler on his new position with the Alabama-West Florida Conference of The United Methodist Church. Herb was recently named one of the top 11 leaders in Northwest Florida by Climate Magazine and I can think of no person that is more deserving of such an honor. We will be sad to see his him leave, but wish him all the best in his new journey. Mr. Speaker, on this such occasion, we honor one of America's greatest citizens.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Jeff Miller"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th \nanniversary of the Village of Lyndonville, New York. This congressional \nrecognition will be presented later this month when village officials \nand citizens gather together to celebrate this historic event.\n  The Village of Lyndonville is a small town that has evolved with the \ntimes, but whose residents have never lost touch with their roots. Its \nhistory resembles that of many of the small towns on which our nation \nwas built. In the 1820s, the area began to grow after the construction \nof a corduroy road, which was built of logs laid side by side \ntransversely. This road is now Route 63--Lyndonville's Main Street. The \nlocale began to prosper after several merchants built businesses on \nMain Street in 1836. Settlers also found the area attractive due to the \npossibilities offered by Johnson's Creek, which runs through the \nvillage. Named for the British Indian agent, Sir William Johnson, \nJohnson's Creek was harnessed by early settlers as a power source. \nEarly settlers built the first flouring mills using the creek, \nincluding S. W. Mudgett, Samuel Tappan, and Richard Barry, among \nothers.\n  The village was originally called Lyndon--in honor of Lyndon, \nVermont, the home of many of its original settlers. Lyndon's name was \neventually changed to Lyndonville in order to distinguish the village \nfrom nearby Linden, New York. One hundred years ago, the Village of \nLyndonville was officially incorporated in Orleans County, on the shore \nof Lake Ontario.\n  The village sits on one square mile of beautiful, fertile Western New \nYork land. The surrounding area is home to many of New York's famous \napple orchards, as well as the lush, rolling vistas created by the \nretreating glaciers ages ago. Nestled against Lake Ontario, Lyndonville \nis blessed with the rich soil and pastoral serenity that Americans \nconsider the ideal of our countryside, evocative of Mayberry and \nGrover's Corners.\n  With a population of 950, Lyndonville is a close-knit community where \neveryone is a neighbor. Most people know each other, and even if you \nare not well acquainted, faces smile with recognition and greetings are \nexchanged with warmth. Friendly inquiries are made when there has been \nan experience with pain--or joy. Anytime a neighbor is suffering from \nill health or some loss, the community is there to help, to lighten the \nburden, and to express its loving concern. Beyond the village's long \nand distinguished history, Lyndonville is simply a place residents are \nproud to raise a family.\n  Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of the Village of Lyndonville's 100th \nbirthday, I unite with its residents to celebrate their accomplishments \nand contributions to Orleans County, our state, and our nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VILLAGE OF LYNDONVILLE, NEW YORK\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of \nH.R. 760, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.\n  Partial-birth abortion is an inhumane procedure which is never \nnecessary to preserve the health of the mother. Indeed, this procedure \nposes serious health risks to the mother, and it is unnecessarily \nbrutal to the baby. I have heard from numerous physicians that there \nare other safe methods for terminating a pregnancy when the life of the \nmother is in danger, and the American Medical Association has stated \nthat partial-birth abortion is not an accepted medical practice.\n  H.R. 760 addresses the constitutional issues raised by the Supreme \nCourt decision in Stenberg v. Carhart. It does so by using a more \nprecise definition of the gruesome partial-birth procedure, clearly \ndistinguishing between this and other forms of abortion. Furthermore, \nH.R. 760 provides extensive congressional findings which show that a \npartial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to preserve the \nhealth of a woman.\n  The House has passed this legislation in previous Congresses, yet a \nfinal vote did not take place in the Senate or in conference. The \nSenate recently passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. We now have \na historic opportunity to pass this legislation and send it to the \nWhite House for the President's approval. I strongly support enactment \nof a ban on partial-birth abortion, and I urge my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of H.R. 760.\n\n[[Page E1153]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 2003\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               speech of\n\n                             HON.

Mr. Speaker, I risk today to express my deepest concerns \nabout the ongoing political problems in Burma and the recent arrest of \nopposition leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi. I am deeply troubled by the \nmilitary regime's stifling of political life. This equals a brutal, \nunacceptable situation lacking democratic essentials. Obviously, the \nmilitary junta tries to block and prevent democratic change for which \nnobel peace prize laureate Suu Kyi's life and work stand for.\n  With the detention of Suu Kyi and nineteen members of her National \nLeague for Democracy party last Friday, the political tensions are on \nthe rise again. The NLD headquarters and universities were also closed. \nIt is common practice for the junta to crash NLD meetings by sending \nbullies to intimidate pro-democracy advocates. Only last year Suu Kyi \nwas released from custody while at the same time the junta arrested \nmany NLD party members. The military regime allowed her to travel \nfreely throughout the country and organize her party but during her \nlast two trips she met harassment and obstruction. This clearly \nindicates that hope for democratic reform, which was stirred by Suu \nKyi's release, has suffered a major setback. The illegitimate \ngovernment further promised to engage in a dialogue with the NLD, \nsupervised by the United Nations. Sadly, the talks failed to make \nsignificant progress.\n  Deficits are not only visible in the political arena but also in the \nsocial and economic field. Long-term economic mismanagement under \nauthoritarian rule created severe economic and social ills. Due to the \ngovernment's human rights' abuses and the unfriendly business \nenvironment, international companies have left the country. Inflation \nis rampant, probably as high as fifty percent. The social sector is in \ndire straits with every third child suffering from malnutrition. Yet 40 \npercent of the budget is spent for defense.\n  The problems in Burma are grave and wide-reaching. There's a \ndemocratic movement that deserves and needs our support, there's a \nmilitary regime that needs to realize that its only way out of Burma's \ncrisis is to fully respect democracy and human rights. This regime must \naccept the results of the 1990 election which were won by Aung Sang Suu \nSyi. To achieve these goals, I have cosponsored the ``Burmese Freedom \nand Democracy Act of 2003,'' which--amongst other provisions--prohibits \nimports from Burma in order to press the regime to adapt full-fledged \ndemocratic reforms and supports democracy activists within Burma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "POLITICAL TENSIONS IN BURMA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill \nthat will restore equity in the taxation of political campaign \ncommittees.\n  Currently, the tax code treats income in federal political campaign \ncommittees the same as corporate income. This allows candidates for \ncongressional office to pay campaign taxes on a graduated rate scale, \noffering us significant tax benefits.\n  Specifically, we pay a 15 percent tax rate on the first $50,000 of \nincome in our campaign accounts. Income in our accounts between $50,001 \nand $75,000 is taxed at 25 percent, and income between $75,001 and $10 \nmillion is taxed at 34 percent. Only when our campaign accounts boast \nover $10 million are we subjected to a 35 percent tax rate.\n  Mr. Speaker, each of us in this chamber can attest to the \nridiculously high amount of money that we must raise in order to run a \nformidable campaign for Congress. However, I doubt that many of us \nactually reach that $10 million threshold and pay a 35 percent tax rate \non the money in our campaign accounts.\n  Unfortunately, our colleagues in state legislatures across the \ncountry aren't as fortunate. As Texas State Senator Jon Lindsay pointed \nout to us in the Texas Delegation, every dollar in his campaign account \nis taxed at a flat 35 percent rate. In fact, only candidates for \nCongress are able to enjoy this graduated tax schedule.\n  To correct this inequity in our tax code, I am introducing \nlegislation today to amend the Internal Revenue Code and mandate that \nstate political campaign committees are taxed in the same manner as our \nfederal campaign committees.\n  Joining me in this effort to ensure that the tax code treats our \nstate legislators fairly is the entire Democratic wing of the Texas \ndelegation: Representative Chris Bell, Representative Lloyd Doggett, \nRepresentative Chet Edwards, Representative Martin Frost, \nRepresentative Charles Gonzalez, Representative Ralph Hall, \nRepresentative Ruben Hinojosa, Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, \nRepresentative Eddie Bernice Johnson, Representative Nick Lampson, \nRepresentative Solomon P.

Res. 4 simply returns to \nCongress the authority that it possessed for over 200 years to prohibit \nthe physical desecration of the flag of the United States.\n  This past week, I visited North Korea, where freedom is nowhere and \ndemocratic thought is oppressed. Our American flag is the most revered \nand beloved symbol of our Nation, representing all that is American and \nreminding the world of our love of our freedom and democracy. The flag \nis a bedrock of our principles and values as a country, leading our men \nand women into conflicts around the globe and draping the caskets of \nthose same individuals when they return home after giving the ultimate \nsacrifice in defense of such values.

It is this object and all that it represents that Americans \nhold so dear.\n  House Joint Resolution 4 will nullify two erroneous Supreme Court \ndecisions, restoring the original interpretation to the First Amendment \nthat had persisted for over two centuries since the birth of our \ncountry. When considering the powers of our respective branches of \ngovernment in effecting the will of the American people, we should be \nreminded of the words of Abraham Lincoln in his first inaugural address \nin 1861, ``If the policy of the government upon vital questions \naffecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of \nthe Supreme Court, the people will have ceased to be their own \nrulers.''\n  I commend my colleagues for recognizing the wishes of the American \npeople and restoring the original interpretation and understanding of \nthe First Amendment and the Bill of Rights to the Constitution by \nsupporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AUTHORIZING CONGRESS TO PROHIBIT PHYSICAL \n              DESECRATION OF THE FLAG OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               speech of\n\n                            HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. and Mrs. \nDonald Wallace of Florence, AL. For 23 years, they have provided \noutstanding service to the American Legion--Mr. Wallace as adjutant and \nMrs. Wallace as his assistant.\n  Mr. Wallace began serving the American Legion as an assistant to the \nformer adjutant and will be retiring later this month. As adjutant, Mr. \nWallace was charged with maintaining both the records and activities of \nthe group of over 1,000; however, he did not limit himself to those \ntasks. Mr. Wallace helped rebuild\n\n[[Page E1156]]\n\nthe American Legion's reputation as both a veteran's advocacy and \ncommunity service organization. Under Wallace's leadership, the post \nreceived state and national attention as a leader in supporting the \nBoys State Program, a program which teaches lessons of patriotism and \ncivics to high school juniors. He also worked with the American Legion \nBaseball program and oratorical contests that offered scholarships to \nlocal participants.\n  Although Mr. Wallace does not like taking credit for the success of \nthe group, many veterans and families in the Shoals will tell you that \nwithout him the Legion would not be what it is today. Wallace simply \nbelieves that his work at the American Legion is just the continuation \nof work begun by an earlier generation, the original Legionnaires who \nestablished the post in 1919 and the World War I veterans who built \ntheir current hall in 1939. As adjutant, Wallace helped maintain this \nbuilding that has been their home for 64 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to pay tribute to Mr. Wallace's wife of 60 \nyears, Mrs. Ellen Wallace. As his assistant at the Legion, Mrs. Wallace \nfiled paperwork and served with the Ladies Auxiliary during the chicken \nstews and other activities. Mr. Wallace credits her with making him the \nman he is today.\n  Despite the irregular hours, low pay, and lack of prestige, both Mr. \nand Mrs. Wallace enjoyed helping many people during their time of \nservice with the American Legion. They have dedicated themselves to \ntheir community, and on behalf of the people of north Alabama I thank \nthem for their service and congratulate them on a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "TRIBUTE TO MR.

Mr. Wallace helped rebuild\n[[Page E1156]]\nthe American Legion's reputation as both a veteran's advocacy and community service organization. Under Wallace's leadership, the post received state and national attention as a leader in supporting the Boys State Program, a program which teaches lessons of patriotism and civics to high school juniors. He also worked with the American Legion Baseball program and oratorical contests that offered scholarships to local participants.\n\tAlthough Mr. Wallace does not like taking credit for the success of the group, many veterans and families in the Shoals will tell you that without him the Legion would not be what it is today. Wallace simply believes that his work at the American Legion is just the continuation of work begun by an earlier generation, the original Legionnaires who established the post in 1919 and the World War I veterans who built their current hall in 1939. As adjutant, Wallace helped maintain this building that has been their home for 64 years.\n\tMr. Speaker, I also want to pay tribute to Mr. Wallace's wife of 60 years, Mrs. Ellen Wallace. As his assistant at the Legion, Mrs. Wallace filed paperwork and served with the Ladies Auxiliary during the chicken stews and other activities. Mr. Wallace credits her with making him the man he is today.\n\tDespite the irregular hours, low pay, and lack of prestige, both Mr. and Mrs. Wallace enjoyed helping many people during their time of service with the American Legion. They have dedicated themselves to their community, and on behalf of the people of north Alabama I thank them for their service and congratulate them on a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Robert E.

Mr. Speaker, today, I am introducing a bill with my \nfriend, the chairman of the Veterans Affairs Health Subcommittee, Rob \nSimmons. This bill will authorize several desperately needed major \nmedical construction projects in Chicago, IL; San Diego, CA; Las Vegas, \nNV; and West Haven, CT. I urge all of my colleagues to support this \nbill to jump start the stalled major medical construction endeavor in \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  My bill would honor the commitment the Department of Veterans Affairs \nmade to build a new bed tower at the West Side division of VA Chicago. \nWhile Secretary Anthony Principi has decided to move forward with the \nclosure of inpatient services at the Lakeside division, he has not \nasked for an appropriation for the new construction project at West \nSide. Instead, the funding for this project--$98.5 million--is supposed \nto come from an enhanced use lease agreement whose value some experts \nclaim has been greatly overestimated. I am not willing to make such a \ngamble on veterans' access to a functional medical center in the \nChicago area.\n  The West Side facility is a 50-year old facility ill-suited to \nrespond to the demands of a modern health care delivery system, even \nwithout the additional workload anticipated from the integration with \nLakeside scheduled for early August. VA Chicago is working to \naccommodate its inpatients in a facility that has inadequate intensive \ncare units, inpatient units, and surgical suites. Once the new facility \nis operational, the existing facility will also have to undergo \nsignificant renovations to improve the emergency department, laboratory \nand radiological services, and food and nutritional areas.\n  Because of the importance and the urgency of this project, my \nlegislation would prohibit VA Chicago from disposing, in any manner, of \nthe Lakeside division without first entering into a contract for the \nconstruction of the new bed tower promised to Chicago area veterans.\n  The bill would also fund a project to replace the existing ambulatory \ncare center in Las Vegas, NV. As my good friend, Shelley Berkley often \nreminds the Committee, Las Vegas has the fastest growing populations in \nthe country and its veteran enrollees are not expected to peak until \n2012. Veterans' use of services is expected to remain higher than it is \ncurrently throughout the 20-year timeframe studied for VA's Capital \nAssets Realignment for Enhanced Services project.\n  Unfortunately, in constructing a new ambulatory care clinic there in \n1997, VA seems to have fallen prey to a contractor whose work was \nseriously substandard. An independent assessment by John A. Martin and \nAssociates yielded an opinion that the clinic was ``unsafe for \ncontinued occupancy.'' Because of the contractor's repeated failure to \naddress serious structural deficiencies in the building, VA is now \nforced to abandon it. As an interim measure, VA is sending its patients \nto 10 different ambulatory care clinics around the city. This \ninefficient delivery system is forcing VA to add 80 full-time employees \nwith significant new operational costs. My bill would request $97.3 \nmillion to build a new centralized facility that would also include \nspace for a new regional office for the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration.\n  In FY 2002, VA listed seismic corrections at the San Diego VA Medical \nCenter as one of its highest construction priorities. Later, I am told, \ncost considerations--not any change in the assessment of need--yielded \na lower priority for the project. I am still convinced that there is a \ngreat risk to VA patients and staff at the site and my bill would \nauthorize $48.6 million to address the needs at the facility.\n  West Haven VA Medical Center is in serious need of major renovations \nto its inpatient wards and research facilities. For many years, the \ninpatient ward renovations have been a high priority for VA \nconstruction, but resources have not allowed the project to move \nforward. I am requesting $50 million for this project and to renovate \nthe research facilities.\n  Finally, Charlotte, NC, is home to one of the largest populations in \nthe country without a significant VA health care system presence. The \nproject requested in this bill would allow VA to greatly expand its \ncurrent workload in a clinic in the downtown area and enroll veterans \nwho are now unable to receive care. I have included $3 million for the \ncost of the lease.\n  All of these projects merit our immediate attention and approval by \nall Members. I urge your favorable consideration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO AUTHORIZE CERTAIN MAJOR MEDICAL FACILITY \n            PROJECTS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            HON.

Mr. Speaker, with yesterday's passage of H. Con.

Our magnificent men and women in uniform serve as the \ngreatest ambassadors of what is good and right in our world. They are \nthe bearers of the tremendous might, the indomitable spirit, and the \nboundless compassion of our nation and the freedom loving people \neverywhere.\n\n[[Page E1157]]\n\n  Our forces are, as they always have been throughout our history, \nAmericans first, citizen soldiers, and great patriots. They have come \nfrom ordinary walks of life rising to do extraordinary things that \nshape our world and leave us forever awestruck. I again want to extend \nour collective and sincere thanks to all our members who serve, and I \nalso want to recognize a particular group of truly unsung yet most \ndeserving heroes--our U.S. Merchant Mariners.\n  Once again, our country has turned to its mariners to take the fight \nto the enemy, to project our force half a world away, to secure the \nprecious freedom that now spreads to an Iraqi people free to choose \ntheir own destiny, to raise their families as they choose, and to renew \nthe glories of one of the world's greatest civilizations. Our \nliberating force was decisive and it moved on the brawn, ingenuity, and \ndedication of our merchant marine. Not in 12 years have we moved such a \nforce by sea, and we have done it better, against greater challenge \nthan ever before.\n  We recently saw a line of ships spread from our east coast through \nthe Straights of Gibraltar, through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, and \ninto the Gulf of Oman--a ``steel bridge'' of resolve. A bridge as \nstrong as those mariners who crew our enormous ships and who go on in \nharms way to deliver our force anyplace, anytime they are called.\n  Since the beginning of the War on Terrorism, over 6,800 U.S. merchant \nmariners and civil servant mariners have served and provided support to \nour global military operations. Currently serving on 211 vessels, our \nU.S. mariners face many of the same hazards confronting our uniformed \nmilitary as they regularly transit and operate within potential \ntargeted areas of chemical and biological weapons, waterborne mines, \nand terrorist activities. Truly, our country's merchant mariners have \nanswered the call selflessly and brilliantly.\n  Our mariners activated and crewed 40 vessels of our ready reserve \nforce, essential to the early movement of ammunition, tanks, aircraft, \nand military vehicles. These U.S. mariners crewed our vital \nprepositioned ships and our fast response surge sealift vessels, \nproviding time-critical warfighting equipment and supplies to the \nbattlefield. Over 4,000 civil servant mariners manned and supported the \ncontinuous worldwide operations of our ships supporting U.S. naval and \ncoalition forces at sea. Around the clock, every day, across the globe, \nour mariners make it happen.\n  At this crucial time in history, our U.S. mariners stepped forward \nwith skill, bravery, and an unrivaled legacy of service. They made all \nthe difference. Our nation continues to rely on these warriors, and \ntheir impact is profound. Long after the fighting stops, our mariners \nwill still be on the watch, returning the troops, sustaining the force, \nand providing for the needy as we renew a proud but shattered land.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of our Congress and a grateful Nation, it is \nmy humble honor to say thank you to all our U.S. Merchant Mariners.

This day is an opportunity for \narea residents to remember a great hero and reflect on General \nBradley's role in preserving the freedoms we hold dear.\n  As such, I wish to enter the following article, ``Who Is Omar Bradley \nand Why Should I Care?'' into the Congressional Record. Written by \nMoberly resident Sam Richardson, this item appeared in the Sunday, May \n11, 2003 edition of the Moberly Monitor-Index. I believe the points it \nmakes are a fitting tribute to General Bradley.\n\n               Who Is Omar Bradley and Why Should I Care?\n\n       Here's a good topic to toss around over your dinner \n     tonight:\n       ``Who is Omar Bradley and why should I care?''\n       It's a fair question around these parts, what with the \n     annual General Omar Nelson Bradley Luncheon, Lecture and \n     Symposium coming up Monday, May 12, at the Municipal \n     Auditorium in Moberly.\n       ``What did old Omar Bradley do to cause a whole lot of \n     people to come to his hometown 22 years after he died?''\n       Another more than fair question.\n       The stock answer is that he is Missouri's most famous \n     military figure, a member of the Missouri Hall of Fame, a guy \n     with a 34-cent stamp with his picture on it, the fellow \n     captured in bronze in the soaring statue in Rothwell Park, \n     the ``Bradley'' who is the namesake for the Bradley Fighting \n     Vehicle so prominent in last month's Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n       Moberly public schools, St. Pius X School, Moberly Area \n     Community College, the University of Missouri, Truman State \n     University and other educational institutions in Bradley's \n     home state may teach young Missourians why Omar Bradley is \n     important to them. And, indeed, he is important to them.\n       Of course, young and old alike should know Bradley went \n     from Moberly High School to the U.S. Military Academy at West \n     Point and eventually commanded the largest American fighting \n     force ever assembled, was our nation's last five-star \n     general officer and first Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff.\n       At the 2002 Bradley Symposium, LTC Jay Carafano, then \n     editor at the National Defense University at Fort McNair in \n     Washington, D.C., told the audience one of the key reasons \n     Bradley was not high on the public awareness screen was \n     because of his low profile on the silver screen. Hollywood's \n     big films about World War II didn't have much of a role for \n     Bradley. LTC Carafano noted Bradley was on screen in \n     ``Patton,'' ``The Longest Day'' and ``Saving Private Ryan'' \n     only briefly, hardly a leading character.\n       At this year's Bradley Symposium, two of the Truman \n     Presidential Library's leading historians will make the point \n     that Bradley was a pillar of leadership in his time.\n       Tom Heuertz, associate education coordinator, and Ray \n     Geselbracht, education and academic outreach coordinator, at \n     the great Independence museum will try to explain how highly \n     Bradley was esteemed by President Harry S. Truman. ``Truman \n     saw him as one of the world's greatest generals ever, in the \n     same class with Hannibal and Napoleon,'' Heuertz said \n     yesterday.\n       Because of the positions he held, Bradley clearly was a \n     favorite of at least three Presidents: Franklin Roosevelt, \n     Truman and Dwight Eisenhower.\n       On a recent edition of ``The Newshour with Jim Lehrer,'' \n     Lucian Truscott IV, a noted military history author, \n     reflecting on American generals' leadership in Operation \n     Iraqi Freedom, suggested the U.S. Central Command's Gen. \n     Tommy Franks and others were nowhere near the class of \n     ``great generals like Patton, Bradley and Eisenhower.''\n       Monday, Colonel Jon H. Moilanen, dean of students and \n     administration at the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff \n     College in Leavenworth, Kansas, will describe how Bradley's \n     military expertise still molds the careers of young officers \n     who serve throughout the world today.\n       This is pretty heady stuff for a chap from our town. In a \n     story about Bradley Day in The Washington Times recently, \n     Moberly was referred to as ``quaint'' and ``picturesque.''\n       For his part, Bradley was, indeed, quiet, modest and \n     unselfish, along with very smart, a natural leader and an \n     exceptional athlete. The kind of man you'd expect to come \n     from a quaint and picturesque town like ours.\n       In the 1915 West Point class yearbook, it is reported \n     Bradley was a sergeant, first sergeant and lieutenant; he was \n     a sharpshooter; he was a member of the football team and \n     track squad; and, perhaps most importantly to him at the \n     time, he was the star of the Army baseball team all four \n     years he was there.\n       The yearbook says, ``His greatest passion is baseball, \n     football and F Company. In baseball, many an opposing player \n     has trifled once with Brad's throwing arm, but never twice. \n     And a batting average of .383 is never to be sneezed at.''\n       ``His most prominent characteristic is 'getting there,' and \n     if he keeps up the clip he's started, some of us will some \n     day be bragging to our grandchildren that, 'sure, General \n     Bradley was a classmate of mine,''' the yearbook says of our \n     favorite son.\n       And, in the style of the day, the yearbook assigned each \n     cadet a motto. Bradley's: ``True merit is like a river, the \n     deeper it is, the less noise it makes,'' attributed to \n     Anonymous.\n       How true that turned out.\n       Although his classmate Eisenhower became Supreme Allied \n     Commander in World War II, and then President, Bradley was \n     the first in his class to become a brigadier general.\n       One reporter wrote in May 1944, ``Endowed with the mind of \n     a mathematician and the body of an athlete, General Bradley \n     is essentially American in ancestry, training and experience; \n     he is slow spoken but sharp witted; he is polite and at times \n     even diffident, but immensely certain of his own skill--the \n     type of soldier who for 168 years has sustained the \n     republic.''\n       And finally, this former captain of the Moberly High School \n     baseball team, a boy worthy of his own shotgun at age 13, a \n     young man who graduated 44th in a class of 164 at West Point, \n     would tell a reporter about dinner at his humble home in \n     Randolph County:\n       ``We'd sit down at the supper table, my mother, my dad and \n     I, and we'd talk things over. That's where I learned a lot \n     about love of country and right from wrong.''\n       From a dinner table in Randolph County to the greatness of \n     the world, that was the man who will be remembered Monday at \n     the 2003 General Omar Bradley Luncheon, Lecture and \n     Symposium.\n\n[[Page E1158]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "OMAR BRADLEY DAY\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HON.

Mr. Speaker, we live in the most prosperous nation in \nthe history of the world.\n  We have refrigeration systems to prevent food from spoiling.\n  We have pasteurization to prevent bacteria from poisoning our food.\n  And we have ways to fortify our foods with vitamins and nutrients to \nmake the food we eat healthier.\n  Yet, with all these advances, people still go hungry in America.\n  The fact is, Mr. Speaker, hunger is a political problem. But I \nbelieve it's a problem we can solve.\n  Thirty-seven years ago, Senator Bobby Kennedy traveled throughout \nAmerica, and saw first-hand the hunger ravaging the most vulnerable in \nour Nation. As a result, we made a national commitment to do something \nabout it.\n  Congress, under the leadership of Senators George McGovern and Bob \nDole, and with the support of President Nixon, created the school \nbreakfast program, WIC, the elderly nutrition program, and the food \nstamp program.\n  Since then, we have made great strides. But we have a lot of work \nleft to do. Indeed, many Americans don't realize that hunger still \nexists in their communities.\n  There are 33 million hungry people in the United States--11 million \nof them are children. In my district in Massachusetts, I talk to food \nbank directors who have noticed a sharp increase in the number of \nfamilies who need help.\n  The food bank that serves my home town, the Worcester County Food \nBank, helped feed over 80,000 people in 2001. Of the 3.7 million pounds \nof food, almost 38 percent went to kids under the age of 18.

The \npeople at America's Second Harvest and Bread for the World are already \nworking around the country to fight hunger. The Food Research and \nAction Center and the Congressional Hunger Center are tireless \nadvocates on behalf of the hungry. And the dedicated people who run the \nfood banks in this country see first-hand the need for a reinvigorated \neffort to end hunger.\n  Mr. Speaker, we live in the most prosperous nation in the history of \nthe world. We have the resources to put an end to hunger once and for \nall. What we need--all we need--is the political will to do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "WE CAN END HUNGER IN AMERICA\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         HON.

Mr. Speaker, we live in the most prosperous nation in the history of the world.\n\tWe have refrigeration systems to prevent food from spoiling.\n\tWe have pasteurization to prevent bacteria from poisoning our food.\n\tAnd we have ways to fortify our foods with vitamins and nutrients to make the food we eat healthier.\n\tYet, with all these advances, people still go hungry in America.\n\tThe fact is, Mr. Speaker, hunger is a political problem. But I believe it's a problem we can solve.\n\tThirty-seven years ago, Senator Bobby Kennedy traveled throughout America, and saw first-hand the hunger ravaging the most vulnerable in our Nation. As a result, we made a national commitment to do something about it.\n\tCongress, under the leadership of Senators George McGovern and Bob Dole, and with the support of President Nixon, created the school breakfast program, WIC, the elderly nutrition program, and the food stamp program.\n\tSince then, we have made great strides. But we have a lot of work left to do. Indeed, many Americans don't realize that hunger still exists in their communities.\n\tThere are 33 million hungry people in the United States--11 million of them are children. In my district in Massachusetts, I talk to food bank directors who have noticed a sharp increase in the number of families who need help.\n\tThe food bank that serves my home town, the Worcester County Food Bank, helped feed over 80,000 people in 2001. Of the 3.7 million pounds of food, almost 38 percent went to kids under the age of 18. The food bank, run by Jean McMurray, donates food to more than 260 local shelters, food pantries, senior centers, and after school programs.\n\tThe Worcester County Food Bank is doing great work, and the people who work there do their best to provide for every single person who needs help. Unfortunately, it's not enough.\n\tThat is why I am proud to stand with my colleague Congressman Frank Wolf in introducing a resolution to recognize June 5 as a National Hunger Awareness Day.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute \nto one of my constituents, Jesse M. Harrison of Rocky Hill, \nConnecticut. Mr. Harrison is a veteran of the Second World War, and I \nrecently had the privilege of presenting him with the Distinguished \nFlying Cross, which he earned nearly 60 years ago during his service as \nan Air Force pilot, but never received.\n  Mr. Harrison, now 82, served in the Air Force from March 20, 1943 to \nJanuary 8, 1946. He piloted an aircraft on D-Day, June 6, 1944 at about \n1:00 am carrying 17 paratroopers from the allied base in England to \ntheir ``drop zone'' behind German lines in Ste. Mare Eglise, France, \nonly miles from the Normandy beaches. Two of the three planes in Mr. \nHarrison's group went down in flames under heavy German fire, however \nFirst Lieutenant Harrison, then 24, dropped his aircraft down to tree \ntop level and took complicated evasive actions to avoid German fire. \nAfter overshooting the drop zone because of the German fire, he \nreturned to the drop zone and the paratroopers dropped and hit their \nmark. When he returned to base in England, his aircraft had 67 holes in \nit from German gunfire.\n  On September 19, 1944, Mr. Harrison was again the pilot of a plane \nflying over the Netherlands towing a glider with 10 American soldiers \nand a jeep on board to their drop zone near German lines. His plane \ncame under heavy enemy fire and his crew bailed out after the plane \ncaught fire and began losing altitude. Were Harrison to bail out as \nwell, the troops on the glider he was towing would likely have had to \nlet go early, resulting in their death or capture. Mr. Harrison alone \ncontinued to guide the glider with his burning aircraft to their drop \nzone. After dropping the glider at their mark, Mr. Harrison had to walk \nthrough a wall of flame to reach his exit door--with the plane only 300 \nfeet from the ground and falling--to jump. He was assisted by two Dutch \npriests who found him. Mr. Harrison suffered 2nd and 3rd degree burns \nfrom his waist to his face and spent 15 months recovering, receiving \nnumerous skin grafts.\n  It was a privilege for me to be able to present him with his well-\ndeserved medal on behalf of an eternally grateful Nation with all his \nfamily and friends present at Rocky Hill Town Hall on Wednesday, May \n28, 2003. Mr. Harrison is one of the thousands of real life heroes \nwhose story must be told again and again so that each new generation of \nAmericans will know that heroes do indeed walk among us, and that we \nmust never forget the service and sacrifice our veterans gave for this \nNation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me today in thanking and \nhonoring Jesse Harrison for his service to the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "HONORING JESSE M.

To address this situation, \ntoday I am introducing the Transit in Parks Act (TRIP).\n  Recognizing the growing problems many of America's `crown jewels' are \nexperiencing as a\n\n[[Page E1161]]\n\nresult of high visitation levels, Congress in the last major federal \nhighway and transit reauthorization law known as TEA 21 required the \nSecretaries of Transportation and Interior to undertake a study of \nalternative transportation needs in National Parks.

However, it identified a number of \nbarriers to implementing successful transit systems in National Parks, \nincluding the lack of a dedicated funding source.\n  The TRIP bill carries out the study findings by establishing a \nTransit in Parks Program to be administered by the Secretary of \nTransportation (Federal Transit Administration) and the Secretary of \nthe Interior (National Park Service). The program would generally \nfollow existing law requirements for mass transportation as it relates \nto the planning and development of transit facilities and would create \na transit counterpart to the Federal Highway Administration's Parkways \nand Park Roads program. The legislation proposes a $90 million annual \nallocation for the Transit in Parks Program from the Mass Transit \nAccount of the Highway Trust Fund.\n  It should be noted that the National Park Service is currently using \non average $11 million of its $165 million annual Parkways and Park \nRoads allocation for alternative transportation. This amount is \ninsufficient to meet the alternative transportation needs for units of \nthe National Park System identified by the TEA 21 study of \napproximately $90 million a year.

Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Mentally Ill \nOffender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act, the companion to a bill \nintroduced in the Senate today by Senator DeWine.\n  According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16 percent of \nadults incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness. In \naddition, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nreports that over 20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system \nhave serious mental health problems, and many more have co-occurring \nmental health and substance abuse disorders.\n  These statistics, however, cannot adequately describe how devastating \nthe combination of untreated mental illness and the criminal justice \nsystem can be for both an individual and the system. Today I had the \npleasure to meet Tom Lane. Tom, a 43-year-old man who lives in Fort \nLauderdale, Florida, now works for the National Alliance of the \nMentally Ill (NAMI) as the Director of the Office of Consumer Affairs. \nHowever, just a few years ago in July 1997, Tom was suffering from \nsevere depression. He was a cabinetmaker who had sustained a head \ninjury from a construction accident that caused him to have seizures \nand prevented him from working. When he called a suicide hotline, \npolice were dispatched. The officers put him in jail, where he did not \nreceive treatment for depression and was not allowed to take his anti-\nseizure medication. When he started suffering two seizures a day, he \nwas hospitalized. Upon his release from the hospital he still did not \nreceive any treatment or recommendation of treatment for his mental \nillness and for days he slept in the bushes outside the hospital. \nFortunately, Tom was eventually able to contact his family from a pay \nphone and they came to his rescue. Once he began receiving treatment, \nTom was able to get back on his feet. Today he is a highly functioning, \nhighly effective professional advocate for people with mental illness.\n  Tom's story illustrates how easy it is for a person with mentally \nillness to become entangled with the criminal justice system. Untreated \nmental illness often leads to behaviors that attract the attention of \npolice officers. If a person with mentally illness does not receive \ntreatment, his or her condition almost definitely will worsen when they \nare in custody. Generally, the criminal justice system is not equipped \nto identify and ensure people with mentally illness find appropriate \ntreatment programs, either through diversion into community treatment \nor within a jail or prison. The bill I am introducing seeks to make \nsure people like Tom Lane don't fall through the cracks. It encourages \ncollaboration between the mental health treatment and the criminal \njustice systems. This collaboration is essential for ensuring mentally \nill offenders are given the treatment they need.\n  The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003 \nis phase two of an effort that started in the 106th Congress, when \nSenator DeWine and I successfully passed America's Law Enforcement and \nMental Health Project (P.L. 106-515). This bill created a Department of \nJustice grant program assisting State and local governments with the \nestablishment of mental health courts. Mental health courts--which are \nmodeled on drug courts--provide specialized dockets in non-adversarial \nsettings to bring mental health professionals, social workers, public \ndefenders and prosecutors together to divert mentally ill offenders \ninto a treatment plan. The goals of a mental health court are to expand \naccess to mental health treatment, improve the community's response to \nmentally ill offenders, and reduce recidivism among the mentally ill \npopulation. I am pleased that this program has been incredibly popular.\n\n  The Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003 \nwill build on America's Law Enforcement and Mental Health Project by \nproviding additional resources for communities that wish to create \nmental health courts. The new bill represents a significant commitment \nto addressing the needs of both the criminal justice system and the \nmentally ill offender population. The bill will create a grants program \nfor communities that will provide resources for diversion programs \nacross the spectrum of the criminal justice community, including \nprebooking diversion programs like those that have been so successful \nin Los Angeles, California and Memphis, Tennessee. Communities will be \nable to design programs that provide mental health treatment in jails \nand in prisons. And finally, grants will be available for transitional \nor aftercare programs that seek to ensure offenders are provided \nappropriate treatment and care when they transition from jail or prison \nback into the community when they have completed their sentences.\n  The bill is intended to give communities much flexibility to design \nand operate the programs they identify as most appropriate for meeting \ntheir needs, and grant funds will be able to be used for planning, \nestablishing a structure, and funding treatment. All successful grant \napplicants will be required to demonstrate collaboration between the \ncriminal justice and mental health treatment agencies in a community. \nToo often, mentally ill offenders fall through the cracks because the \nrelevant systems in a community do not work together. This lack of \ncollaboration is detrimental to both the mentally ill offender as well \nas the stability of the criminal justice system. Therefore, criminal \njustice and mental health treatment agencies will be required to apply \ntogether for the grants established by the bill, compelling the \ncollaboration that is needed to get those who are mentally ill and \ncoming in contact with the criminal justice system the mental health \nand substance abuse treatment they need. In addition, the bill requires \nthat grant applicants ensure mentally ill offenders are connected to \neducation, job training and placement, and housing programs.\n  In addition, the bill calls for an Interagency Task Force to be \nestablished at the Federal level. Task Force members will include: the \nAttorney General; the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Labor, \nEducation, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban Development; and the \nCommissioner of Social Security. The Task Force will be charged with \nidentifying ways that Federal departments can respond collaboratively \nto the needs of mentally ill adults and juveniles.\n  I strongly believe that encouraging collaboration at the Federal, \nState, and local levels of government is essential to ensuring that \npeople with mental illness are able to access the mental health \ntreatment and other support programs they need.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill and \nmake our communities safer for all.\n\n[[Page E1162]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "THE MENTALLY ILL OFFENDER TREATMENT AND CRIME REDUCTION ACT OF 2003\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today in strong support \nof the recent actions taken by the Illinois state legislature regarding \nthe Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), a proposed amendment to the \nConstitution which would unequivocally guarantee equal gender rights \nunder the law. As many of my colleagues are certainly aware, the \nIllinois State Assembly recently voted on and passed the ERA, clearing \nthe way for their counterparts in the Senate to consider this crucial \nlegislation at the conclusion of their current recess. If Illinois' \nState Senate agrees to ratify the ERA, then only two more state \nratifications will be necessary for this long overdue amendment to be \nadded to our Constitution.\n  Some people have argued that the addition of an ERA amendment to the \nConstitution would simply be a change in semantics and nothing more. I \nstrongly disagree. Presently, on average, women receive only 76 percent \nof the pay that men receive for comparable full time positions. \nInequities such as these are inexcusable; they are disastrously \ndamaging not just to women, but also to their families. Through the \nratification of an Equal Rights Amendment, women would have an expanded \nlegal basis to call for equal compensation for equal work.\n  Although the Equal Rights Amendment may have faded from the public \nspotlight at times, the movement to include women in the Constitution \nnever died, and it is growing vigorously once again. Women had to wait \nuntil 1920 to be granted the right to vote under the Constitution. \nWhile this was certainly a monumental development, it has not produced \nfull gender equality. The 14th Amendment, granting ``equal protection \nof the laws,'' did not, and still does not, fully protect women from \ndamaging gender discrimination. Only an Equal Rights Amendment would \nensure the Constitutionally guaranteed full equality that women \ndeserve.\n  The ERA was originally passed by Congress in 1972, along with a \nseven-year time limit for ratification. In 1979, Congress extended the \ntime limit for three more years, leaving the deadline at 1982. Within a \ndecade of the initial 1972 passage, the amendment had been ratified by \n35 states, three short of the necessary 38.

ROBERT E. ANDREWS\n\n                             of new jersey\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                         Thursday, June 5, 2003\n\n\tMr. ANDREWS. Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today in strong support of the recent actions taken by the Illinois state legislature regarding the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), a proposed amendment to the Constitution which would unequivocally guarantee equal gender rights under the law. As many of my colleagues are certainly aware, the Illinois State Assembly recently voted on and passed the ERA, clearing the way for their counterparts in the Senate to consider this crucial legislation at the conclusion of their current recess. If Illinois' State Senate agrees to ratify the ERA, then only two more state ratifications will be necessary for this long overdue amendment to be added to our Constitution.\n\tSome people have argued that the addition of an ERA amendment to the Constitution would simply be a change in semantics and nothing more. I strongly disagree. Presently, on average, women receive only 76 percent of the pay that men receive for comparable full time positions. Inequities such as these are inexcusable; they are disastrously damaging not just to women, but also to their families. Through the ratification of an Equal Rights Amendment, women would have an expanded legal basis to call for equal compensation for equal work.\n\tAlthough the Equal Rights Amendment may have faded from the public spotlight at times, the movement to include women in the Constitution never died, and it is growing vigorously once again. Women had to wait until 1920 to be granted the right to vote under the Constitution. While this was certainly a monumental development, it has not produced full gender equality. The 14th Amendment, granting ``equal protection of the laws,'' did not, and still does not, fully protect women from damaging gender discrimination. Only an Equal Rights Amendment would ensure the Constitutionally guaranteed full equality that women deserve.\n\tThe ERA was originally passed by Congress in 1972, along with a seven-year time limit for ratification. In 1979, Congress extended the time limit for three more years, leaving the deadline at 1982. Within a decade of the initial 1972 passage, the amendment had been ratified by 35 states, three short of the necessary 38. For many years after that, the ERA was, for technical reasons, generally considered ``dead.'' However, legal analyses indicate that with just three more state ratifications, the ERA may in fact meet the requirements to be added to the Constitution. As has been verified by several legal experts, the fact that the time limit appears in the proposing clause rather than the text of the legislation leaves this deadline open to adjustment. When Congress chose to extend the deadline in 1979, a precedent was set; subsequent sessions of Congress may adjust time limits placed in proposing clauses by their predecessors. These adjustments may include extensions of time, reductions, or elimination of the deadline altogether.\n\n\tIt is therefore possible for current or future sessions of Congress to eliminate the deadline originally placed on ratification of the ERA, thus allowing the amendment to be added to the Constitution once it is ratified by three more states. This ``three state strategy'' is a very real possibility, and I have introduced legislation into the House of Representatives, H. Res. 38, to ensure that action will be immediately considered by Congress once three more state legislatures ratify the ERA.\n\tPut simply, it is time for the Constitution to be amended to include an amendment which ensures gender equality for all Americans.

Having the ERA in the Constitution will simply recognize what the American people already want--equal justice under the law.\n\tMany leaders both here in Congress and in state legislatures are advocating for the ``three state strategy,'' as well as a renewal of the ERA by Congress through a second passage of the amendment. I feel that anyone who is serious about guaranteeing equal rights to women should be supportive of both of these approaches. It does not matter how the ERA is eventually made part of the Constitution, as long as guaranteed gender equality rights are the end result.\n\tAs the Equal Rights Amendment reads, ``Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.''

This legislation would be an \nimportant step in increasing child care quality for all children.\n  High-quality child care can play an important role in healthy child \ndevelopment and school-readiness. Just as it is the parents who matters \nat home, it is the teachers who matter in child care. One of the most \ncritical components of quality child care is a stable and qualified \nteaching staff. Children learning from more highly educated teachers \nperform better on tests of verbal and match achievement. Yet, child \ncare staff--who have the responsibility of helping guide children's \ndevelopment--are among the lowest paid workers in America. In 2000, the \naverage hourly wage for a child care provider was $8.16, which is \napproximately $16,980 annually. Moreover, most providers do not receive \nhealth insurance or paid leave and the annual turnover rate is about 30 \npercent. Academic and government studies conclude that low pay is one \nof the leading causes of poor quality child care. Low wages keeps \nqualified providers from remaining in the field and deters new \nproviders from entering the field. A 2001 report by the Center for \nChild Care Workforce and the University of California Berkeley found \nthat centers are losing qualified staff because of low wages and are \nforced to hire less qualified replacements. The study also found that \nnot only are wages extremely low, but they are not keeping pace with \ncost of living increases. States report centers are closing or turning \naway children because they cannot properly staff their programs.\n  FOCUS directly addresses the problems low pay creates by providing \nstipends to qualified child care staff based on the level of education. \nThis legislation would be a mechanism to assist States increase the pay \nof child care workers and to improve the overall quality of child care. \nThe bill would supplement wages by a minimum of $1000 per year for \nproviders with child development associate credentials and a minimum of \n$3000 per year for providers with B.A.'s in the area of child \ndevelopment. These stipends will help attract new qualified workers to \nthe field and increase the retention and skill level of current \nworkers. FOCUS also would provide funds for scholarships so that we can \ncontinue to increase the qualifications of the child care workforce.\n  Research on early childhood and brain development clearly \ndemonstrates that the experiences children have early in life have a \ndecisive, long-lasting impact on their later development and learning. \nWe cannot expect children to transition to kindergarten and succeed in \nschool if we do not take the necessary steps to provide quality care in \nthe years prior to school entry.

Mr. Speaker, I am most pleased to introduce the Native \nAmerican Languages Act Amendments of 2003, with Representatives Neil \nAbercrombie and Don Young as original cosponsors.\n  This vital legislation will authorize the Secretary of Education to \nprovide grants to or enter into contracts with Native American language \neducational organizations, Native American language colleges, Indian \ntribal governments, organizations that demonstrate the potential to \nbecome Native American language educational organizations, or consortia \nof such\n\n[[Page E1163]]\n\nentities, to establish Native American language ``nests'' for students \nunder the age of 7 and their families. It will also authorize grants \nfor these entities to operate, expand, and increase the number of \nNative American language survival schools throughout the country for \nNative American children and Native American language-speaking \nchildren. Finally, the bill will authorize the establishment of three \ndemonstration projects that will provide assistance to Native American \nlanguage survival schools and Native American language nests.\n  Today's measure is a companion to S. 575, which was introduced by the \nsenior member of Hawaii's delegation, Senator Daniel Inouye, and is \ncosponsored by Senators Daniel Akaka, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and Tom \nDaschle. A hearing was held by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on \nMay 15, 2003, at which there was broad-based support from native \nlanguage speakers, educators, and supporters from across the country, \nincluding Hawaii, Alaska, California, New Mexico, Montana, Oklahoma, \nMinnesota, and Virginia.\n  This proposal forwards current federal self-determination policies \ntoward native peoples, which support the promotion of economic and \nsocial self-sufficiency, as well as the preservation and revitalization \nof native culture, languages, art, history, religion, and values. Since \nlanguage is a significant factor in the perpetuation of native \ncultures, the federal government enacted the Native American Languages \nAct of 1990 urging federal support for Native American languages, and \nthe Native American Languages Act Amendments of 1992 establishing a \ngrant program at the Administration for Native Americans to fund the \npreservation of Native American languages. My bill continues this \ncommitment by our federal government to ensure the survival of these \nunique cultures and languages.\n  In my home state, I am proud that the people of Hawaii and the State \nof Hawaii have strongly supported the revitalization of Hawaiian \nculture, art, and language. In 1978, for example, the State of Hawaii \nwrote into its constitution a specific declaration that Hawaiian is one \nof our two official languages, along with English.\n  There is also support for Hawaiian language programs in both our \npublic and private schools. At the forefront of these efforts have been \nsupporters of Aha Punana Leo, a Hawaiian language immersion program \nwhich has endeavored to include both students and parents in an \nexciting and innovative way to revitalize Hawaiian language and \nculture. Ms. Namaka Rawlins, Director of Aha Punana Leo, and her \nhusband, Dr. William (Pila) Wilson, have been pivotal in these efforts. \nThe lessons of family and community involvement in the preservation of \nthe Hawaiian language that they and other have proven are and can be \nused by other native communities and cultures across the country.\n  While the Aha Punana Leo program initially started with pre-school \nstudents, Hawaiian language survival schools were also established to \nallow for students to graduate from high school. Over 2,000 students \nare currently enrolled in Hawaiian language nests and survival schools. \nA Hawaiian language center--Hale Kuamoo--was eventually established at \nthe University of Hawaii at Hilo with the collaboration of Aha Punana \nLeo as well as a Native College--Ka Haka Ula O Keelikolani College. \nBoth programs have been crucial in providing training to teachers in \nHawaiian language, college courses in Hawaiian, and graduate education \nin Hawaiian language and culture.\n  The revitalization of the Hawaiian language in my state has been \ninstrumental in the preservation of Hawaiian culture, which is \nimportant to all of us who call Hawaii home.

In \nrecognition of these accomplishments, the National Wrestling Coaches \nAssociation bestowed on him the honor of ``Coach of the Year''.\n  In addition to his service to Huntington High School and New York \nState, Coach Giani has served as an international ambassador for \nwrestling. Having organized cultural exchange programs in both the \nSoviet Union and Poland, he has provided disadvantaged youth with the \nopportunity to learn wrestling from one of the sport's best coaches.\n  Beyond his service as a coach and international teacher, Mr. Giani \nhad an equally impressive career as a wrestler.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Coach Lou Giani of Huntington High School on his induction into the U.S. National Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\tCoach Giani is among the most successful wrestling coaches in New York State history, having compiled 388 victories in 34 seasons. This past season Coach Giani and his Huntington High School team won the New York State team title--a remarkable eighth title for Coach Giani. In addition to the team accolades, Huntington High School also had three individual wrestlers win State Championships, increasing the career total of Coach Giani to a record 22 individual state champions. In recognition of these accomplishments, the National Wrestling Coaches Association bestowed on him the honor of ``Coach of the Year''.\n\tIn addition to his service to Huntington High School and New York State, Coach Giani has served as an international ambassador for wrestling. Having organized cultural exchange programs in both the Soviet Union and Poland, he has provided disadvantaged youth with the opportunity to learn wrestling from one of the sport's best coaches.\n\tBeyond his service as a coach and international teacher, Mr. Giani had an equally impressive career as a wrestler. Having not begun to wrestle until his junior year of high school, Mr. Giani went on to win ten New York Athletic Club titles, a gold medal at the 1959 Pan American Games and was given the honor of representing the United States on the 1960 Olympic Freestyle team.\n\tI commend Coach Lou Giani for his dedication to the sport as well as his service to the students of Huntington High School and I congratulate him on his induction into the U.S. National Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Steve Israel"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to discuss the state \nof Health Care in America. Mr. Speaker, we have a health care crisis in \nAmerica and in particular, we have a crisis in the African-American \ncommunity with regard to disparities in treatment and access to care.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Black Caucus has made Universal Health \nCare the centerpiece of our agenda. The Congressional Black Caucus \nbelieves that everyone in America should have some basic level of \nhealth care coverage.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, as in the past, being Black in America is a \nmedically dangerous condition. Being Black and poor can be deadly. That \nis a national tragedy that the Congressional Black Caucus is determined \nto end.\n  In 1998, President Clinton committed this Nation to eliminating \nracially based health disparities by the year 2010. As a result of this \ninitiative, in the report entitled ``Unequal Treatment: Confronting \nRacial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care'' issued March 2002, the \nIOM research team concludes that: Americans of color tend to receive \nlower-quality health care than do Caucasians and that African-Americans \nreceive inferior medical care--compared to the majority population--\neven when the patients' incomes and insurance plans are the same. These \ndisparities contribute to higher death rates from heart disease, \ncancer, diabetes, HIV/AIDS and other life-endangering conditions.\n  The Report found that African-American Medicare patients were almost \n4 times less likely than their Caucasian counterparts to receive needed \ncoronary bypass surgery.\n  Black seniors were nearly 2 times less likely to receive treatment \nfor prostate cancer.\n  Older Black Americans were 3.6 times more likely to have lower limbs \namputated as a result of diabetes.\n  Mr. Speaker, access to health care is becoming a critical issue for \nBlack and Hispanic-Americans.\n  Overall, more than 40 percent of nonelderly African-Americans (12.5 \nmillion) and more than 50 percent of nonelderly Hispanic-Americans \n(18.5 million) had no health insurance in 2001-2002.\n  Minority children face obstacles in getting the health care they \nneed. In 2001, there were 9.2 million uninsured children, the majority \nof them were minorities: 36 percent were Hispanic and 18 percent were \nBlack.\n  Four-and-a-half million Black children now receive their health \ncoverage through Medicaid or SCHIP (the Federal health program for \nchildren), and 4.7 million Hispanic children get healthcare through \nMedicaid or SCHIP.\n  That is why Medicaid, which provides health care coverage to low-\nincome Americans, is critical to minorities.\n  The most recent data show that 9.8 million Blacks and 6.4 million \nHispanics need Medicaid to get access to health care.\n  Mr. Speaker, despite these disparities the Bush budget continues to \nshortchange healthcare. To pay for the tax cuts for the wealthiest 5 \npercent, the Republican leadership under-funds numerous health programs \nincluding the Ryan White program, eliminates the Community Access \nProgram, cuts the Veterans Health programs and the SCHIP program.\n\n  Despite these disparities the Republicans cut funding for Medicaid \ncoverage for children, low-income seniors, people in nursing homes, and \nthe disabled. And the Bush administration wants to block grant \nMedicaid--cut the funding by $3.2 billion over 10 years and give the\n\n[[Page E1164]]\n\nmoney to the States to let the States spend it on other competing \npriorities.\n  This will basically dismantle Medicaid's guarantee of access to \nhealthcare for low-income individuals.\n  Mr. Speaker, this sort of policymaking does not make sense in the \n``land of plenty.'' I can only quote my good friend Jocelyn Elders who \nstated, ``We, in our society believe that every criminal has a right to \na lawyer. But yet we are one of only two countries, the United States \nand South Africa, who does not believe that every sick person should \nhave a right to a doctor.''\n  Mr. Speaker, every American is entitled to access to quality \nhealthcare. That's why I cosponsored Congressman John Conyers' bill to \nprovide health insurance to every resident of the United States.\n  Our bill, the United States National Health Insurance Act, H.R. 676, \nwould provide all individuals residing within the United States with \ninsurance covering primary care, and preventative health services, \nprescription drug coverage, emergency care, and mental health services.\n  In essence, it would expand Medicare to cover all Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I realize that this is going to be a long hard fight. \nBut I am convinced that the time for a ``single-payer'' system has \ncome.\n  If we can spend hundreds of billions of dollars in an effort to \nprotect the American people from foreign attack, we can raise and spend \nthe money that it will take to protect the American people from dying \nbefore their time from accident or disease on our soil. If we can give \nuniversal health coverage to those on foreign soil, we can also do it \nfor our own citizens.\n  It's time to make health care a civil right for all Americans, my \nfriends. That is the hard lesson that Americans of color learned from \nour experience with this Nation's health care system.\n  And that is the same hard lesson that many, many other Americans are \nlearning today. We speak truth to power, when we declare that \ndiscrimination and racial disparities continue to plague our system of \nhealth care.\n  Increasing the number of qualified minority physicians and other \nhealth care professionals--and assuring that they are adequately \ncompensated for their work--are core prerequisites to transforming that \nequation.\n  That is the truth--but it is not the whole truth. It also is true \nthat: Most poor children in America are not Black; Most sick children \nin America are not Black; And most Americans who cannot afford health \ninsurance are not Black.\n  Mr. Speaker, these American children are our children, whatever may \nbe the color of their skin. We must never allow the virus of racial \ndivision to infect our vision of what it means to be human beings.\n  Lastly Mr. Speaker, I implore my Republican colleagues to correct the \ninjustice in the recently passed tax bill that denies millions of poor \nfamilies, those making between $10,000 and $26,000 the Child Tax credit \nof $400 they so desperately need.\n  We should not shift the tax burdens from the wealthy to the working \npoor. These families need our help--we should give it to them. Restore \nfairness to the tax bill--tax cuts to the wealthy should not out \nmillions of families.\n  Lastly, I thank my friend Danny Davis for leading this floor effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG MINORITIES\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               speech of\n\n                        HON.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support of \nlegislation to expand the child tax credit to working families left out \nof the tax bill that the President recently signed.\n  Last week, the President signed a $350 billion tax cut plan, a \npackage of large tax cuts that are weighted heavily toward America's \nwealthiest families, and that will do little to spur economic growth or \nreduce the Nation's jobless rates. These additional cuts are likely to \nfurther burden the economy's future with growing budget deficits and \ndebt--spending the Social Security Trust Fund surplus and threatening \nessential programs such as Medicare.\n  The most disturbing aspect of this legislative effort was the \nMajority's last-minute exclusion of a provision that would help nearly \n12 million children and their families to get the child tax credit. In \ntheir persistent efforts to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, the \nMajority stripped this important provision from the final bill in order \nto make room for a dividend tax cut and other measures benefiting only \nthose wealthiest taxpayers.\n  For some time now, the Administration has maintained that all \nAmericans deserve a tax break. However, this new law did not honor that \npromise, and the President should not have signed legislation that \ndenies a promised child tax credit to the millions of families that \nneed it the most and are the most likely to spend it.\n  These families with children, earning between $10,500 and $26,625, \nare already working hard to make ends meet. Our immediate priority in \nCongress should now be to pass legislation that will correct this last-\nminute injustice and provide these moderate-income families with the \nrelief they deserve. Therefore, I support the legislation introduced by \nHouse Democratic leaders to accomplish this goal and benefit almost 3 \nmillion children in my home State of California.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Murtha and I rise today to \npay tribute to General Eric Shinseki, an outstanding soldier and \nAmerican who is retiring as the 34th Chief of Staff of the Army after \nmore than 38 years of distinguished service to his country. He is an \nexceptional leader with a clear sense of purpose, conviction, and \nconscience of service to his nation.\n  General Shinseki has served as Chief of Staff in one of the most \ndynamic and challenging periods in the storied 228-year history of the \nUnited States Army. Under his leadership, the Army began a \n``transformation'' from a force focused on a defined threat that won \nthe Cold War to a more flexible force that is capable of meeting the \nnew and varied threats of the 21st century. At the same time General \nShinseki was managing this historic level of change, he ensured the \nArmy maintained the highest levels of combat readiness that were \ndemonstrated so successfully during operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  General Shinseki received his commission from the United States \nMilitary Academy in 1965. He served two combat tours in the Republic of \nVietnam with the 9th and 25th Infantry Divisions, first as an artillery \nforward observer and later as Commander of Troop A, 3rd Squadron, 5th \nCavalry. During both he was seriously wounded.\n  Since Vietnam, General Shinseki has served in a variety of command \nand staff assignments in the Continental United States and overseas. He \nserved in Hawaii at Schofield Barracks with Headquarters, United States \nArmy Hawaii, and at Ft. Shafter with Headquarters, United States Army \nPacific. He also taught at the United States Military Academy's \nDepartment of English. During duty with the 3rd Armored Cavalry \nRegiment at Ft. Bliss, Texas, he served as Regimental Adjutant and \nExecutive Officer with the 1st Squadron.\n  Ric spent over ten years in Europe, which included assignments as \nCommander, 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry; Commander, 2nd Brigade; Assistant \nChief of Staff G3; and Assistant Division Commander, all with the 3rd \nInfantry Division (Mechanized).\n  From 1994 to July 1995, he commanded the 1st Cavalry Division at Ft. \nHood, Texas and in July 1996, he was promoted to Lieutenant General and \nbecame the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the \nDepartment of the Army.\n  He was selected for the rank of General in June 1997 and assumed \nduties as Commanding General, United States Army Europe and Commander, \nNATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In November 1998 he \nassumed duties as Vice Chief of Staff of the Army.\n  In addition to receiving a Bachelor of Science Degree from the United \nStates Military Academy, he also holds a Master of Arts Degree in \nEnglish Literature from Duke University. General Shinseki's military \neducation includes the Armor Officer Advanced Course, the United States \nArmy Command and General Staff College, and the National War College.\n  His awards include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the \nDistinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit (with Oak Leaf \nClusters), the Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' device (with 2 Oak Leaf \nClusters), as well the Purple Heart (with Oak Leaf Cluster). He has \nalso been awarded the Parachutist Badge, the Ranger Tab, the Office of \nthe Secretary of Defense Identification Badge, Joint Chief of Staff \nIdentification Badge, and Army Staff Identification Badge.\n  History will look very favorably on the accomplishments of General \nShinseki. It is easy to talk about concepts such as ``transformation'', \nbut it takes a visionary leader to implement them. There are countless \ndecisions that he has had to make that might very\n\n[[Page E1165]]\n\nwell mean the difference between success and failure on current and \nfuture battlefields.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Murtha and I rise today to pay tribute to General Eric Shinseki, an outstanding soldier and American who is retiring as the 34th Chief of Staff of the Army after more than 38 years of distinguished service to his country. He is an exceptional leader with a clear sense of purpose, conviction, and conscience of service to his nation.\n\tGeneral Shinseki has served as Chief of Staff in one of the most dynamic and challenging periods in the storied 228-year history of the United States Army. Under his leadership, the Army began a ``transformation'' from a force focused on a defined threat that won the Cold War to a more flexible force that is capable of meeting the new and varied threats of the 21st century. At the same time General Shinseki was managing this historic level of change, he ensured the Army maintained the highest levels of combat readiness that were demonstrated so successfully during operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\tGeneral Shinseki received his commission from the United States Military Academy in 1965. He served two combat tours in the Republic of Vietnam with the 9th and 25th Infantry Divisions, first as an artillery forward observer and later as Commander of Troop A, 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry. During both he was seriously wounded.\n\tSince Vietnam, General Shinseki has served in a variety of command and staff assignments in the Continental United States and overseas. He served in Hawaii at Schofield Barracks with Headquarters, United States Army Hawaii, and at Ft. Shafter with Headquarters, United States Army Pacific. He also taught at the United States Military Academy's Department of English. During duty with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment at Ft. Bliss, Texas, he served as Regimental Adjutant and Executive Officer with the 1st Squadron.\n\tRic spent over ten years in Europe, which included assignments as Commander, 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry; Commander, 2nd Brigade; Assistant Chief of Staff G3; and Assistant Division Commander, all with the 3rd Infantry Division (Mechanized).\n\tFrom 1994 to July 1995, he commanded the 1st Cavalry Division at Ft. Hood, Texas and in July 1996, he was promoted to Lieutenant General and became the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the Department of the Army.\n\tHe was selected for the rank of General in June 1997 and assumed duties as Commanding General, United States Army Europe and Commander, NATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In November 1998 he assumed duties as Vice Chief of Staff of the Army.\n\tIn addition to receiving a Bachelor of Science Degree from the United States Military Academy, he also holds a Master of Arts Degree in English Literature from Duke University. General Shinseki's military education includes the Armor Officer Advanced Course, the United States Army Command and General Staff College, and the National War College.\n\tHis awards include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit (with Oak Leaf Clusters), the Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' device (with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters), as well the Purple Heart (with Oak Leaf Cluster). He has also been awarded the Parachutist Badge, the Ranger Tab, the Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge, Joint Chief of Staff Identification Badge, and Army Staff Identification Badge.\n\tHistory will look very favorably on the accomplishments of General Shinseki. It is easy to talk about concepts such as ``transformation'', but it takes a visionary leader to implement them. There are countless decisions that he has had to make that might very\n[[Page E1165]]\nwell mean the difference between success and failure on current and future battlefields. General Shinseki successfully met every challenge during his tenure as Chief of Staff with professionalism, commitment, and perseverance.\n\tTo Ric and his wife Patti, God speed and enjoy a well-deserved retirement.\n\tThe United States Army will miss you and so will we.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Jerry Lewis"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a bill that would \nprovide the Filipino veterans of World War II who now live in the \nUnited States health care benefits on the same basis as if they were \nveterans of the U.S. armed services.\n  This legislation would require the Secretary of Veteran Affairs, \nwithin the limits of the Department's facilities, to provide hospital, \nnursing home and medical care services to certain Filipino World War II \nveterans of the Philippines Commonwealth Army and former Philippines \nNew Scouts who legally reside in the United States, in the same manner \nas their American veteran peers.\n  The substance of this bill was included in the Veterans Health Care \nand Procurement Improvement Act of 2002 that passed the House last \nyear, but failed to clear the other Body. I thank the President for his \nleadership and acknowledgement of the importance of addressing the \nhealth care issues of the Filipino veterans by recently requesting the \nintroduction and prompt consideration of similar legislation this \nCongress. I also acknowledge the advocacy of my colleague from \nCalifornia, Mr. Filner, who for years has kept this issue before the \nHouse as a matter of equity and recognition for an important allied \nforce during a time of great peril for this Nation.\n  Currently, Commonwealth Army veterans residing in the U.S. are only \neligible for VA health care services for treatment of service-connected \ndisabilities and for non service-connected disabilities if they are in \nreceipt of certain compensation. My bill would remove these barriers to \ntreatment of veterans of World War II who are of Filipino descent by \neliminating the receipt-of-compensation requirement for Commonwealth \nArmy veterans and extending to new Philippine Scouts the same \neligibility for medical care and services as Commonwealth Army \nveterans. Commonwealth Army veterans and new Philippine Scouts would be \nsubject to the same eligibility and means test requirements as their \nAmerican counterparts.\n  The military forces of the Commonwealth of the Philippines were \ncalled into the United States Armed Forces during World War II by \nPresident Roosevelt's Executive Order. Under the Command of General \nMacArthur, the Filipino soldiers served side-by-side with forces from \nthe United States and exhibited great courage at the battles of Battan \nand Corregidor. The participation of the Filipino forces delayed and \ndisrupted the initial Japanese effort to control the Western Pacific \nand was vital to giving the U.S. time to prepare the forces necessary \nto defeat Japan.\n  When the United States granted independence to the Philippines, \nCongress passed the Rescission Act of 1946, reducing or eliminating \nmany of the veterans' benefits for which Filipino veterans had been \neligible, based on service in the Commonwealth Army. The \nreclassification of their service to the United States during World War \nII by the Rescissions Act unfortunately left many Filipino veterans \nresiding in the United States without eligibility for VA health care.\n  It is due time that these Filipino veterans are given the health care \nbenefits they have been waiting more than 50 years to receive. I urge \nall my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this bill, one that \nrecognizes our Nation's moral obligation to extend VA health care \nservices to the approximately 14,000 Filipino veterans who are in their \nsenior years here in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "HEALTH CARE BENEFITS FOR FILIPINO VETERANS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            HON.

It was 1993, soon after \n     he entered the television home-shopping business, that he \n     started extolling the convenience of ``buying underwear in \n     your underwear.''\n       When the real electronic commerce wave arrived on personal \n     computers instead of television, Diller regrouped and started \n     buying Internet ventures. Yet except for his failed $18 \n     billion bid to buy the Lycos Web portal in 1999, Diller has \n     remained largely known as an entertainment and media \n     executive, and his online escapades have attracted little \n     attention.\n       Until now. The digerati are finally taking notice of \n     Diller's online empire since his conglomerate, USA \n     Interactive (USAI), announced a recent string of takeovers \n     that are transforming it into one of the Internet's \n     superpowers. Diller's moves are part of a consolidation wave \n     gaining speed in the high-tech sector, where start-ups are \n     still struggling to overcome depressed stock prices and an \n     oversupply of goods and services.\n       ``We want to be the largest and most profitable e-commerce \n     company utilizing multiple brands,'' Diller, chief executive \n     of USAI, declared in an interview this week. (Diller is a \n     director of The Washington Post Co.)\n       Diller's recent acquisitions appear to reflect a shift \n     toward more direct forms of commerce online, where new \n     commercial matchmakers that could bypass traditional forms of \n     advertising are catching on.\n       First, a look at Diller's march across the Web: Since early \n     last year, USA Interactive has announced it will acquire \n     LendingTree Inc., which pairs home buyers with lenders and \n     real estate agents online; travel agent Expedia Inc., which \n     lets consumers make travel reservations online; British \n     UDate.com, an online personals site; the outstanding shares \n     of Hotels.com, an online provider of discount lodging \n     bookings; and the remaining shares of Ticketmaster, the \n     electronic ticketing agency in which USAI first took a 50 \n     percent stake back in 1997.\n       Also in the past year, Diller's company snapped up a string \n     of offline travel-related companies, including the \n     Entertainment discount-coupon book, the vacation exchange \n     network Interval International and Britain's TV Travel Group. \n     USAI already owned various ``back office'' services, thanks \n     to acquisitions made a few years ago. In 1999, for example, \n     it bought one of the world's biggest customer call-center \n     operations, Precision Response Corp., which also conducts \n     e-mail marketing campaigns and database services. And, of \n     course, USAI still owns the Home Shopping Network.\n       As a result of its takeovers, USA Interactive appears \n     poised to take in more than $6 billion in revenue this year--\n     more than Amazon.com, eBay, Yahoo or any other Internet firm \n     except America Online.\n       Diller said that his Internet binge is not over. He intends \n     to buy more Net gems and hinted that LendingTree points in \n     the direction he is headed. (Think financial services.) Some \n     analysts worry that the LendingTree deal, a stock swap valued \n     at roughly $700 million, may be inflated because the home \n     refinancing wave caused a temporary spurt in its business. \n     But Diller discounts such talk. ``We couldn't care less what \n     happens in the very, very, very near term,'' he told analysts \n     when he announced the deal last month. ``What we care about \n     is that we've bought the right business in the right \n     category.''\n       Still, his company seems to garner more dollars than \n     respect, perhaps because it resembles a giant Internet puzzle \n     with the pieces not yet snapped into place. That may explain \n     why Diller said this week he is flirting with changing the \n     name of his company again. USAI has gone by at least five \n     names in the past, none too memorable. The latest moniker \n     makeover came last year when it sold off its cable TV \n     channels and replaced ``Networks'' in ``USA Networks'' with \n     ``Interactive'' to focus more on electronic commerce.\n       Diller said the company's current mission is to act as a \n     ``middleman'' between supply and demand in interactive \n     commerce, making it more like eBay than retailer Amazon.com. \n     Like eBay, USAI's companies typically take commissions for \n     matching buyers and sellers. They hold little or no \n     inventory, which lowers their costs and potentially boosts \n     profit margins.\n       EBay mostly auctions used goods but is aggressively \n     courting sellers of new merchandise as part of its avowed bid \n     to become ``the world's marketplace.'' While analysts think \n     this could make it a head-to-head competitor with USAI, \n     Diller doesn't see it that way. He said he doubts eBay will \n     succeed in becoming the world's marketplace: ``They are not \n     going to make the transition in every category to a fixed-\n     price model,'' he predicted, ``and will be predominantly \n     based in peer-to-peer auctions.''\n       Time will tell how much advantage can be gained from \n     lumping together different Internet entities or ``multiple \n     brands'' online. But for starters, there should be savings \n     from no longer having to run five separate public accounting \n     operations for LendingTree, Expedia, Hotels.com, Ticketmaster \n     and USA Interactive, all of which have been trading under \n     separate stock symbols. After buying a controlling stake in \n     Expedia from Microsoft Corp. last\n\n[[Page E1166]]\n\n     summer, USAI declared its intention to buy the outstanding \n     shares of its key subsidiaries. Expedia and Hotels.com \n     resisted briefly but yielded this spring.\n       Soon USAI will introduce loyalty incentive programs for \n     people using its various e-commerce services. Diller said the \n     first incarnation, perhaps points-based rewards, will debut \n     later this year or early next. He added that he has no plans \n     to create an overarching Internet network with a ``single \n     sign-on'' for users of USAI sites, such as AOL attempted with \n     its Web properties and Time Warner did with its original \n     magazine sites at the ill-fated Pathfinder.com.\n       ``We do not believe in unnatural synergies, and we don't \n     have one totalitarian brand,'' Diller said. ``We only want to \n     make relationships where natural law dictates they make \n     sense.''\n       AOL and Time Warner, of course, hyped ``synergies'' among \n     their many brands when the two companies merged three years \n     ago. Diller said the big lesson he learned from watching that \n     merger flop was not to shortchange his Internet products but \n     to keep improving them. ``They took care of everything but \n     the product itself and paid a terrible price for it,'' Diller \n     said of AOL.\n       But USAI will exploit natural connections, he added, such \n     as cross-linking among its Web sites and pursuing other \n     cross-marketing opportunities. For instance, Evite.com, a \n     free invitation service owned by USAI, already rotates banner \n     ads on its online personals site, Match.com, and the \n     Entertainment book. You can imagine its Citysearch's online \n     city guides linking prominently to LendingTree's real estate \n     service, or Hotels.com offering local event tickets from \n     Ticketmaster when people book rooms.\n       Whatever Diller winds up calling his many-headed Internet \n     beast, it's a good bet it will grow up to be one of the \n     surviving giants of the dot-corn jungle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "THE BINGE ISN'T OVER FOR DILLER\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HON.

The latest moniker \n     makeover came last year when it sold off its cable TV \n     channels and replaced ``Networks'' in ``USA Networks'' with \n     ``Interactive'' to focus more on electronic commerce.\n       Diller said the company's current mission is to act as a \n     ``middleman'' between supply and demand in interactive \n     commerce, making it more like eBay than retailer Amazon.com. \n     Like eBay, USAI's companies typically take commissions for \n     matching buyers and sellers. They hold little or no \n     inventory, which lowers their costs and potentially boosts \n     profit margins.\n       EBay mostly auctions used goods but is aggressively \n     courting sellers of new merchandise as part of its avowed bid \n     to become ``the world's marketplace.'' While analysts think \n     this could make it a head-to-head competitor with USAI, \n     Diller doesn't see it that way. He said he doubts eBay will \n     succeed in becoming the world's marketplace: ``They are not \n     going to make the transition in every category to a fixed-\n     price model,'' he predicted, ``and will be predominantly \n     based in peer-to-peer auctions.''\n       Time will tell how much advantage can be gained from \n     lumping together different Internet entities or ``multiple \n     brands'' online. But for starters, there should be savings \n     from no longer having to run five separate public accounting \n     operations for LendingTree, Expedia, Hotels.com, Ticketmaster \n     and USA Interactive, all of which have been trading under \n     separate stock symbols. After buying a controlling stake in \n     Expedia from Microsoft Corp. last\n[[Page E1166]]\n\n     summer, USAI declared its intention to buy the outstanding \n     shares of its key subsidiaries. Expedia and Hotels.com \n     resisted briefly but yielded this spring.\n       Soon USAI will introduce loyalty incentive programs for \n     people using its various e-commerce services. Diller said the \n     first incarnation, perhaps points-based rewards, will debut \n     later this year or early next. He added that he has no plans \n     to create an overarching Internet network with a ``single \n     sign-on'' for users of USAI sites, such as AOL attempted with \n     its Web properties and Time Warner did with its original \n     magazine sites at the ill-fated Pathfinder.com.\n       ``We do not believe in unnatural synergies, and we don't \n     have one totalitarian brand,'' Diller said. ``We only want to \n     make relationships where natural law dictates they make \n     sense.''\n       AOL and Time Warner, of course, hyped ``synergies'' among \n     their many brands when the two companies merged three years \n     ago. Diller said the big lesson he learned from watching that \n     merger flop was not to shortchange his Internet products but \n     to keep improving them. ``They took care of everything but \n     the product itself and paid a terrible price for it,'' Diller \n     said of AOL.\n       But USAI will exploit natural connections, he added, such \n     as cross-linking among its Web sites and pursuing other \n     cross-marketing opportunities. For instance, Evite.com, a \n     free invitation service owned by USAI, already rotates banner \n     ads on its online personals site, Match.com, and the \n     Entertainment book. You can imagine its Citysearch's online \n     city guides linking prominently to LendingTree's real estate \n     service, or Hotels.com offering local event tickets from \n     Ticketmaster when people book rooms.\n       Whatever Diller winds up calling his many-headed Internet \n     beast, it's a good bet it will grow up to be one of the \n     surviving giants of the dot-corn jungle.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Edolphus Towns"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. Stark and I rise today to honor Shiloh \nBaptist Church of Hayward, California and its pastor, Reverend Jesse L. \nDavis, Sr. on the 35th Anniversary of its founding.\n  On September 5, 1968, a small group of Christians met at the home of \nEmmett & Bernice Mason to organize a church. The Reverend Jesse L. \nDavis accepted the charge and was installed as Pastor of Shiloh Baptist \nChurch by Adolph Kelly, Pastor of Macedonian Baptist Church in \nMilpitas, California.\n  Shiloh Baptist's first facility was shared with Indian Baptist Church \non Arthur Street in Oakland. In its second year, Shiloh Baptist bought \nthat building as well as the one adjacent. Additionally, an Assistant \nPastor was ordained and appointed, the Reverend Porter Clewis. The old \nbuilding was demolished in 1976 and a new one was dedicated in June of \n1978, along with the Jesse L. Davis Educational building. The \ncongregation outgrew its facility once more, and moved to its present \nlocation in Hayward in October, 1992.\n  Shiloh Baptist has been honored by the Southern Baptist Convention of \nCalifornia. Also, the Mass Choir has received the ``Church Choir of the \nYear Award'' at the 24th Annual Gospel Academy Awards. Sister Doria \nCummins-Lewis was awarded ``Director of the Year.''\n  Among the ministries Shiloh Baptist has organized are Angel Tree \n(part of Prison Ministry), Street Witnessing, Feeding Program, Tutorial \nProgram, Singles Ministry, Sisters of Excellence Women's Ministry, \nAlpha & Omega Drama and Dance Troupe. Together they have changed the \nlives of many people for the better.\n  Since its inception, Shiloh Baptist's rise has mirrored that of its \nleader, Reverend, Jesse L. Davis, Sr. Reverend Davis was born in \nLouisiana in 1937 and will celebrate his 66th birthday on June 11. He \nattained an Associate of Arts Degree at Merritt College before \ngraduating the Bay Cities Bible Institute, both in Oakland. He later \nattended the Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary in Mill Valley \nand had an honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree conferred upon him by the \nUniversity of Biblical Studies at Burbank, California.\n  In addition to his guidance of Shiloh Baptist for the past 35 years, \nJesse has been a Lay Evangelism School Teacher with the Southern \nBaptist General Convention of California, Vice-President and past \nPresident of the Baptist Pastor's and Minister's Conference of Oakland, \nDirector of Christian Education for the Mt. Zion District Association, \nand Treasurer for the California Baptist State Convention.\n  Finally as we honor Shiloh Baptist Church and the esteemed Reverend \nDr. Jesse L.

I look forward to future Memorial Day Brat Fests and the service that they provide for the community.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Tammy Baldwin"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Last week, President Bush \nsigned a new law that would provide tax cuts of $93,500 to the 200,000 \ntaxpayers making over $1 million. Fifty three percent of all taxpayers \nwould get less than $100 under the GOP law. Here is another example of \nthe Administration choosing the wealthiest over America's working \nfamilies.\n  What is even more egregious is that the Administration chose not to \nprovide or increase the child tax credit to working families making \nbetween $10,500 to $26,625 per year. Mr. Speaker, Republicans in the \nSenate dropped a provision, added by Senator Lincoln, that would have \nhelped nearly 12 million children and their families get a tax credit. \nOut of that 12 million, a staggering 8 million receive no child tax \ncredit under the GOP law.\n  Mr. Speaker, their plan in no way, shape or form protects the \nchildren that need it the most. Instead, their plan deliberately \nexcludes these children. In actuality, the Republican plan should be \ncalled the ``Plan to Leave Children Behind.''\n  This is why I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2286, the Rangel-\nDavis-DeLauro bill. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill. This is \na great start to repairing the damage inflicted by the Administration's \nreckless and negligent tax package. H.R. 2286 would restore the child \ntax credit to families making minimum wage by providing greater tax \nrelief to working families. Nineteen million children and their \nfamilies will benefit from this bill. In fact, over 2 million children \nin my home state of Texas would benefit under Rangel plan.\n  In addition to the child tax credit, H.R. 2286 would create more \njobs. The provisions in this bill are key elements of the House Jobs \nand Economic Growth package and will create more than 1 million jobs \nwithout adding one penny to the deficit.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that today I am \nreintroducing the Inclusive Home Design Act. I want to thank my \ncolleagues Barbara Lee and Louise Slaughter for joining me today as \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation. I hope that all of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us. I also want to \nthank my friend Marca Bristow of Access Living for her dedication and \noutstanding leadership. Finally, I want to offer my gratitude to all of \nthe architects and community leaders who worked with me to craft this \nlegislation. The Inclusive Home Design Act will greatly increase the \nnumber of homes that are accessible to people with disabilities. It is \nsupported by the Paralyzed Veterans of America and countless other \nnational and local disabilities rights organizations.\n  The Inclusive Home Design Act requires all newly-built single family \nhomes receiving federal funds to meet three specific standards: an \naccessible route, or ``zero step,'' into the home, \"32\" clearance \ndoorways on the main level, and one wheel chair accessible bathroom. \nThese nationally mandated standards for homes built with federal \ndollars will close a major loophole in our current housing laws.\n  Under current law, 95 percent of federally supported homes do not \nhave to meet any accessibility standard. This creates unnecessary \nbarriers for disabled veterans and other people with mobility \nimpairments. It defies logic to build new homes that block people out \nwhen it's so easy and cheap to build new homes that let people in. Many \nstates and localities have already incorporated visitability standards. \nThis list includes Naperville, Bollingbrook, and Champagne, Illinois, \nAtlanta, Vermont, Texas, Kansas, Arizona and others. Also the United \nKingdom passed a law in March 1998 mandating that every new home become \naccessible. A federal law will build on the momentum that has already \nbeen created here and abroad.\n  The proposed legislation is based on the concept of Visitability, an \naffordable, sustainable and inclusive design approach for integrating \nbasic accessibility features into all newly built homes and housing. \nArchitects and builders will have latitude in how they comply with the \nact. For example, the zero step entrance can be placed at the front, \nside, or back of the home. The accessible route can even go through an \nattached garage.\n  When homes are accessible, it benefits not only today's disability \ncommunity, but also all of us who are friends and family members of \npeople with disabilities. Often, the prohibitive cost of making an \nexisting home accessible deprives seniors of their independence and \npushes them into nursing homes. It generally costs thousands of dollars \nfor a homeowner to retrofit their home. However, on average experts \nestimate that it only costs $300 to $400 to add visitability features \ninto a new home. In addition, the zero step entrance requirements can \nbe waived if the terrain makes compliance impractical.\n  By making new homes accessible, we guarantee that many seniors can \nage at home instead of moving into expensive assisted living \nfacilities. This will save taxpayer money and it will help improve the \nquality of life of our senior citizens. As the population becomes \nolder, this will become more important. Fifty-eight percent of people \nover eighty years old suffer from physical impairments. In 2000, there \nwere 30.5 million people between 65-84 years old. This number will grow \nto 47 million by 2020. Today, over 4.3 million individuals are over 85. \nBy 2020, this number is projected to grow to 6.8 million. There is no \nquestion that the Inclusive Home Design Act will enable many of our \nseniors to remain at home.\n  Homes that meet visitability standards are essential for people with \ndisabilities and sensible because 3 out of 10 people will face a \ndisability before they are 67, practical, and cost effective. I am \nlooking forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation, \nthe Inclusive Home Design Act, into law.\n\n[[Page E1169]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "THE INCLUSIVE HOME DESIGN ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       HON.

More recently, when called to free the Iraqi people from the rule of an evil despot, the United States Armed Forces performed among the most daring, well-executed military missions in the history of warfare. In both instances, when detractors claimed that the United States would become mired in untenable situations, our military devised strategies to obtain the stated objectives with minimal casualties or collateral damage and then proceeded to unleash the focused force of America's soldiers to carry out decisively the task of victory.\n\tTragically, as the war on terrorism carries American forces throughout the world to continue the battle for liberty, many of our young men and women will not return. Among them, Lance Corporal David K. Fribley of the United States Marine Corps, originally from Atwood, Indiana, in my district, was killed in the opening days of Operation Iraqi Freedom in an ambush near An Nasiriyah, Iraq. At that time, I rose in the House to pay tribute to this courageous young man, and I would like to express once again the nation's eternal thanks to those like Lance Corporal Fribley who make the greatest of sacrifices for our nation and our freedom.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Mark E.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nright a terrible wrong that has been perpetrated on our schools and our \nchildren in this country.\n  Last Congress, we passed and the President signed into law, the No \nChild Left Behind Act (NCLB). I voted for that bill because the \nAdministration promised historic new investments to facilitate \neducation reforms and dramatically improve educational performance in \nthis country.\n  Unfortunately, that promise has been broken. The Administration has \nrefused to fund its own program and is cutting billions from NCLB. In \nthis year's budget request alone, the Administration is proposing to \nshortchange NCLB by $9.7 billion. Over the first three years of the new \nlaw, the Administration cuts $20 billion from the funds that are needed \nto make NCLB work.\n  Without the promised federal funds, states and mostly localities will \nbe forced to bear the brunt of these tough new requirements. In North \nCarolina and across the country, the state budget and those in our \ncounties, towns and cities are in fiscal crisis. The administration's \neducation cuts to NCLB will cruelly punish our children by withholding \nfunds needed to achieve these tough new requirements. And without the \npromised funding NCLB will become a massive unfunded mandate on our \nlocal governments that could lead to higher property taxes, cuts in \nvital services like police, fire and rescue and roads. Or both.\n  Mr. Speaker, a promise is a promise and a deal is a deal. Because the \nAdministration has demonstrated its unwillingness to live up to its \nside of the bargain and provide necessary funding, Congress should \nrescind its authority to implement the reforms until those funds are \nforthcoming.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that I have been working on for \nseveral months to accomplish just that. My bill, the Fully Fund the \nLeave No Child Behind Act requires the federal government to fully fund \nNCLB or the requirements in the statute are suspended for the year in \nwhich full funds are not provided. My bill specifies Title I and Title \nII of NCLB, which deal with school assessments and teacher training \nrequirements respectively. My bill does not apply to sections of NCLB \non Limited English Proficient Education, 21st Century Schools, public \nschool choice, Impact Aid and other important provisions.\n  Let me state that I continue to support the goals of NCLB. As the \nformer Superintendent of North Carolina's public schools, I have led \nthe fight for standards based education reform in the state that is \nwidely recognized as the national leader in that effort. I want to make \nsure NCLB works so that every school in this country is a quality \nlearning environment for our children. This legislation is an effort to \nhold the Administration's feet to the fire to make sure that its record \nmatches its rhetoric.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress must ensure that the federal government honor \nits commitments to our nation's children.

Deteriorating infrastructure and poorly groomed public \nareas have been replaced by better roads, new parks and recreation \nareas, a community pool, the renewal of the U.S. 1 corridor and the \ncontinued efforts of ``Keep Brevard Beautiful'' and the Marine \nResources Council.\n  The All American City competition specifically seeks cities in which \nkey civic projects are community and citizen driven. Palm Bay certainly \nhas an abundance of community driven projects and organizations. These \ninclude the Volunteer Citizen Observer Program started in 1995 and the \nmore than 100 Palm Bay Citizens who dedicate their time who assist the \nPalm Bay police force as volunteers.\n  Next week nearly 100 residents of Florida's 15th district will travel \nhere to Washington, DC to compete for the 54th Annual ``All American \nCity'' Award. City employees, elected officials, activists, pastors, \nschool children and other Palm Bay citizens will have an opportunity to \nshare just a small piece of Palm Bay with the National Civic League.

He is neighbor, friend, and indispensable spiritual leader \nin the community of Echo Park in Los Angeles.

But \nquickly, Reverend Medina and the parishioners of the Cathedral Center \ncame forward and offered families with small children a place to stay \nand a place to eat. Today the parish of Cathedral Center is much \nblessed by the work that has been done by Reverend Medina.

And as increasing numbers, like members of my own Hawaii's famed 100th Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat Team, pass on, we must also remember that one of our basic promises to them is to be buried with their comrades in our great national cemeteries, from Arlington to my own National Cemetery of the Pacific.\n\tBut increasing numbers of States, 17 at last count, have no Federal VA cemetery, or else those cemeteries are now full.

Mr. Speaker, by the direction of the Committee on \nRules, I call up House Resolution 256 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 256\n\n       Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of \n     the bill (H.R. 1474) to facilitate check truncation by \n     authorizing substitute checks, to foster innovation in the \n     check collection system without mandating receipt of checks \n     in electronic form, and to improve the overall efficiency of \n     the Nation's payments system, and for other purposes. The \n     first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points \n     of order against consideration of the bill are waived. \n     General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not \n     exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the \n     chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Financial Services. After general debate the bill shall be \n     considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall \n     be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \n     of amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the \n     nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on \n     Financial Services now printed in the bill. Each section of \n     the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall \n     be considered as read. During consideration of the bill for \n     amendment, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole may \n     accord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the \n     Member offering an amendment has caused it to be printed in \n     the portion of the Congressional Record designated for that \n     purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII. Amendments so printed \n     shall be considered as read. At the conclusion of \n     consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall \n     rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as \n     may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote \n     in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the \n     Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature \n     of a substitute. The previous question shall be considered as \n     ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage \n     without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with \n     or without instructions.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Shimkus). The gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSessions) is recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule, House Resolution \n256. This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1474, the Check \nClearing for the 21st Century Act.\n  The Committee on Rules on Tuesday afternoon granted an open rule \nproviding for 1 hour of general debate in the House on the underlying \nbill, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Financial Services. The rule waives \nall points of order against consideration of the bill, and provides one \nmotion to recommit, with or without instructions.\n  I would like to reiterate to the House my satisfaction in the open \nrule granted for consideration of the underlying piece of legislation \nthat we are debating today, which is also known as CHECK-21.\n  CHECK-21 is an important bill, although it may seem a bit confusing \nat first blush for America's banking customers and check writers. The \ngood news is this bill garnered bipartisan support in both the \nCommittee on Financial Services and the Committee on Rules, and I \nanticipate the same result as we move forward towards final passage on \nthe floor today.\n  The legislative work our House of Representatives will complete today \nbuilds on the legislative work that was started back in 1987 to foster \ninnovation in the check collection system. The Expedited Funds \nAvailability Act, which became law back in 1987, directed the Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System to improve our check processing \nsystem.\n  Today we are making logical extensions to the work started in 1987 by \nusing our much-improved electronic transfer technology to make check \nwriting speedier and more reliable for all parties involved.\n  Mr. Speaker, each check that is written and used for payment must \nactually make its way back to the check writer's home bank. That is how \neach bank patron with a checking account gets the check he or she wrote \nmailed back to them so that it can appear in their monthly statement.\n  When we stop to think about it, there is a lot of time, money, and \neffort invested in getting checks back to their home banks. Checks that \nare written in one corner of our country today will be trucked and \nflown to their home bank, wherever they reside, all over the country as \na normal part of American commerce, a great expense of time and money. \nToday, American commerce bears the great expense of time and money \nassociated with shipping checks around the country because it is worth \nit. Checks are an important commercial instrument that help keep our \neconomy moving.\n  Today, as a cosponsor of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, \nI am proud to announce the introduction of a new instrument of commerce \ninto the American economy, the substitute check. The substitute check \nwill provide opportunities to greatly decrease the frantic highway and \nair traffic associated with the gargantuan task of shipping and flying \nbillions of dollars worth of checks around this country every single \nyear.\n  Thanks to electronic imaging, paper checks have the opportunity to be \nconverted into electronic form, transmitted in seconds to the home bank \nacross the country, and printed out at their final destination as \nsubstitute checks.\n\n[[Page H4986]]\n\n  The bill provides all those institutions that see electronic transfer \nof commercial paper as the latest wave in modernizing our economic \nsystem the opportunity to use substitute checks, but does not require \nit. That way we all have a chance to ease into the new potential \nprovided by the creation and introduction of substitute checks into the \nmainstream of commerce.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure customers that the \nsame protections provided today under the Uniform Commercial Code for \npaper checks would also apply to substitute checks. Additionally, \nCHECK-21 provides legal indemnification protection to bank customers \nfor losses arising from the receipt of substitute checks.\n  CHECK-21 is a great bill, Mr. Speaker. I congratulate the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Oxley) of the Committee on Financial Services, the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) of the Committee on Rules, as \nwell as the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), who is the \nsubcommittee chairman that is directing this legislation today, as well \nas all the original cosponsors of this very important bill.\n  Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support both the rule \nand the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider the rule for H.R. 1474, \nthe Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. I urge my colleagues to \nlook at this resolution very closely, to study it, because it is a \nvery, very rare specimen.\n  We all know some of the more famous endangered species, including the \nVirginia big-eared bat, the buff-headed marmoset, and the yellow-footed \nrock wallaby; but just as rare is the House open rule. Do not make any \nsudden moves because we might startle it.\n  So far this year, the House has considered a total of 38 rules. So \nfar, exactly four of them have been open, four for 38. That is a \nbatting average of .105, which would get us kicked off my son's T-ball \nteam.\n  This is what passes for democracy around here, which brings us to the \nrule for H.R. 1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. This \nis an open rule for a noncontroversial bill. The issue for me, Mr. \nSpeaker, is not the rule or the bill, but the fact that this open and \nfair process is almost never used in this body. Whenever an issue is \nthe least bit contentious, whenever there is even a hint of \ndisagreement about a bill, the majority clamps down on its Members, \nchokes debates, and forces a closed rule through this House. It is a \nlousy way to run a legislature, Mr. Speaker.\n  In the meantime, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, also \nknown as CHECK-21, is a bipartisan bill that will modernize the \nNation's check payment system for the 21st century. This legislation \nwill help consumers, businesses, and banks by guaranteeing that check \nprocessing and payment will be quicker, and more importantly, lead to \nmore efficient banking.\n  As many of us remember, the days and weeks following the tragic \nevents of September 11 were filled with confusion in the banking \nindustry. Because many of our planes were grounded, checks were held up \naround the country. Similar delays occurred during the anthrax crisis.\n  With the passage of CHECK-21, Congress and the banking industry will \nharness the innovations of the 21st century so our banking system is \nnot crippled as a result of terrorism, natural disasters, or \ntransportation problems.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  In my district, I proudly represent the largest credit union in New \nEngland, Digital Credit Union.\n  According to Mary Ann Clancy, Senior Vice President and General \nCounsel of the Massachusetts Credit Union League, ``Digital has been \nable to make cleared checks available to members in a more timely, \nsecure and efficient manner ranging from weeks to immediate access. It \nalso helps keep members' information confidential and saves them time \nsearching through piles of checks to balance their checking accounts.''\n  Mr. Speaker, Democrats have no objection to this bill. Check 21 was \nreported unanimously out of the Committee on Financial Services. The \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) and the ranking member, the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), and the members of the committee should \nbe commended for working in a bipartisan way, something the leadership \nof this House cannot seem to do.\n  Which, Mr. Speaker, brings us to the Child Tax Credit. As most people \nknow, during their late-night, back-room negotiations on the tax bill, \nthe Republican leadership deliberately dropped a provision that would \nhave helped nearly 12 million children and their families to get the \nchild tax credit.\n  Their attack on American workers, on those in the middle, on those \ntrying to get into the middle, continues.\n  Governing is about choices, Mr. Speaker. The Republican leadership \nchose to keep the tax breaks for millionaires, and they chose to scrap \nthe help for low-income working families.\n  So at the end of this debate on the rule, I will ask my colleagues to \nvote no on the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, \nI will offer an amendment to provide for the consideration of the \nRangel/Davis/DeLauro bill to help the people the Republicans would \nrather leave behind.\n  In Massachusetts, for example, 225,000 children would benefit from \nthe Democratic bill. Our proposal provides real relief for the people \nwho need it most, not another giveaway for those who need it least. And \nwe actually pay for our tax relief by closing some of the corporate \ntax-shelter scams that some greedy corporations like to use.\n  I am not sure if any of my Republican colleagues remember, but they \nused to think that burdening our children and grandchildren with huge \ndebt was a bad thing.\n  I know my Republican colleagues would rather not talk about this. I \nknow they would have been happier if their secret agreements would have \nremained secret. But I will put them on notice. We are going to keep on \ndiscussing this issue until you do the right thing. We are going to be \nhere today and tomorrow and next week and next month, and we are going \nto fight for the people who deserve a helping hand.\n  The Majority Leader made it quite clear the other day what the \nRepublican priorities are. When asked whether he would consider \ngranting relief to those who had been dropped by the leadership in \ntheir secret negotiations, he said, ``There are a lot of other things \nthat are more important.''\n  If anyone on the other side of the aisle could name one, I would love \nto hear it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The Committee on Rules meets on a regular basis throughout the week, \ntaking important pieces of legislation, hearing debate. It is not \nunusual for us to be in the Committee on Rules not only at odd hours of \nthe day and night but also to hear hours of testimony from Members of \nCongress who have important legislation that they wish to bring \nforward; and I would like to be one member of that committee that \nstands up and says that I believe that the leadership of the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Dreier), our chairman, and his balance and wisdom \nand his dedication to a fair process is something that I believe sets \nthis Committee on Rules up for success every single day. This bill that \nis on the floor is yet another example of that success that the \nchairman and this committee achieve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Bachus), the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nFinancial Institutions and Consumer Credit.\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) \nand the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), along with the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson) introduced this legislation; and the \ntitle of this legislation, I think, basically describes what this is \nall about. It is the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. That is \nwhat we are doing.\n  We are replacing what the Chamber of Commerce has described as an \nantiquated method of presenting and returning checks.\n  It is amazing to me that we had not taken this step 10 or 15 or 20 \nyears ago.\n\n[[Page H4987]]\n\nBut I do want to commend the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart), \nand I want to commend the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford). I want \nto commend a bipartisan group of Members who come together to push this \nlegislation and bring it out on the floor today.\n  This is a model for bipartisanship. There are 33 co-sponsors, \nDemocrats, Republicans. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), \nthe ranking member, and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), both made \nthis a priority.\n  We have an amendment that was introduced by the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Watt) which is included on page 11 in section 3, \nparagraph E. Part of that language clarifies that nothing in this act \nshall diminish in any way and everything in this act shall preserve all \nconsumer protections. In fact, we have added consumer protections in \nthis act.\n  But let me be very brief and say what this does in a nutshell. \nAmericans write 42.5 billion checks a year; and about three-fourths of \nthose checks have to move physically from the bank where they were \ndeposited to the bank where the original maker was, many of them all \nthe way across the country. Most of them travel by air, but a good many \nof them travel by truck. When they do, they burn oil, making us more \noil dependent. This bill as much as anything will help lessen our \nreliance on foreign oil.\n  And a lot of people have probably not thought about this, but it is \ngood news for those who travel by air because it will lessen the \ncongestion at our airports. In fact, it is amazing that most Americans \ndo not realize that literally every day tens of thousands of aircraft \ntake to the sky taking back these original checks.\n  Now, what we are changing today is not something we have not been \ndoing. What the system will go to is actually the system the credit \nunions in this country have used for over 20 years. So this is nothing \nnew. The credit unions have been using this process. In fact, some of \nour larger banks by agreement have been doing this process for years \nwithout any problems.\n  The Federal Reserve has urged for several years that we go to this \nsystem. It is good for our economy. Not only will it lessen our \ndependence on foreign oil, not only will it relieve congestion on our \nhighways and airports, but it will also make our process of clearing \nchecks more efficient. In a world economy when we compete with European \nnations which are already doing this, we do not need costs and burdens \nto our financial system that they do not have. In fact, we need to have \nthe most efficient system in the world; and, in fact, this legislation \nwill assure that this happens.\n  In conclusion, we will talk about the nuts and bolts of this \nlegislation in the main debate. We will hear from the gentlewoman from \nPennsylvania (Ms. Hart) on this legislation. I want to commend the \nchairman, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), for making this a \npriority. I want to commend the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  In conclusion, I want to commend all the Members of this body for \ncoming together on this important legislation. We built such a \nconsensus piece of legislation that we have the credit unions endorsing \nthis legislation. We have the community banks endorsing this \nlegislation. We have the independent banks endorsing this legislation. \nWe have the largest 100 financial institutions in the country endorsing \nthis legislation. We have the regulators endorsing this legislation. We \nhave the Chamber of Commerce and several consumer groups endorsing this \nlegislation. And I fully expect that the overwhelming vote that this \nlegislation received in the committee will be repeated out here on the \nfloor with a strong bipartisan majority.\n  I would think that anyone that understands this legislation will vote \nin favor of it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cooper).\n  Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, the sort of checks that Americans are \ninterested in hearing about are not the check clearing system \ntechnicality but the checks they receive as a result of their hard work \nor as a result of tax refunds.\n  This July most all Americans with children will be receiving a check \nin their mailbox as a result of the child tax credit that we passed \nsome 2 weeks ago. Except for the parents who are in the military, who \nare in the National Guard who do not make a whole lot of money serving \nour country, and except for the low-income parents who work hard every \nday for minimum wage or a little bit above, they and their children \nwill not be receiving these checks.\n  Why? Six million parents, 12 million of the most deserving people in \nour country, will not be receiving checks because of a deliberate, \nsecret, back-room deal cut by Republican leadership.\n  Now, most of my constituents want bipartisan government. They want \nDemocrats and Republicans to work together for the greater good of this \nNation. And now that our government is under the control of a \nRepublican White House, a Republican Senate, and a Republican House \nleadership, people are asking, what decisions are they making?\n  Well, they are making decisions to leave out 12 million poor \nchildren, 12 million deserving folks who need a future in this country; \nand $400 each would do them a lot of good. It would not only stimulate \nthe economy, it would address the fundamental fairness of that \nlegislation.\n  Now, many of the folks on the right are saying, well, their parents \ndo not pay taxes. They do pay payroll taxes. They pay property taxes. \nThey pay sales taxes. I dare any of the Members to go to these people \nand say they do not pay taxes. These are not welfare recipients. These \nare hard-working people trying to build the American dream, and this \nHouse deliberately left out those parents and their 12 million children \nbecause we did not have room to fit it into a $350 billion tax bill. \nAll we are asking for is 1 percent of that bill, $3.5 billion to be \ndevoted to the needs of 12 million deserving American kids.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I recall, the debate about this tax bill was all \nabout deficits and all about whether the increase of the debt, the \npublic debt limit was going to be achieved. And what happened is that, \nas we deliberated about the bill, any motion to instruct conferees from \nthe other party was about those two issues. It was not about the \nsubstance of the bill as it related to anything that was contained \nwithin or to be talked about by the conferees. But, rather, they were \nfocussed entirely on the debt and the amount of money that would be as \na part of bill.\n  Now we find out that, oh, my gosh, there was a part of this great tax \ncut that they maybe were for even though they were voting against that. \nSo it is very interesting to hear this debate today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just remind the gentleman that, unlike the \nRepublican tax bill, we actually pay for this by closing corporate \nloopholes so we do not add to the debt or deficit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPallone).\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule because \nthe Republican leadership is not allowing us to bring up the Child Tax \nCredit for these lower-income working families.\n  Exactly what my colleague from Massachusetts said is certainly true. \nThis provision which the Republicans eliminated because they did not \nwant to help the working class and working people was financially paid \nfor, and, again, we are trying to get it passed again and it is paid \nfor completely by closing up corporate tax loopholes.\n  The problem is that the Republicans, they just do not want to give it \nto these working families. Already the other side the other body is \nsaying that they want to add a child tax credit for people at a higher \nincome level, or the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) has said that he \nwants to add more tax cuts here for wealthy people and for corporate \ninterests.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  That is the thing that would cause an increase in deficit because \nthey have not paid for it. We are saying, as Democrats, we can pay for \nthis child tax\n\n[[Page H4988]]\n\ncredit for these working families under $26,000-or-so in income \nannually by closing tax corporate tax loopholes; and the Republicans \nare saying, oh, no, we cannot do that because the only way we will \nconsider it is if we give some child tax credit to higher-income people \nor other tax cuts to other wealthy people and millionaires, and we do \nnot care whether we pay for that because we do not have any way to pay \nfor that. That just goes into the deficit.\n  The hypocrisy is unbelievable. My colleagues should simply admit that \nthe Republicans really do not care about the working people at the \nlower-income levels. They are not willing to give them any kind of tax \ncredit. They can pass the bill today in the other body and send it over \nhere or vice versa, and it is fully paid for; but they are not going to \ndo it, and I can tell my colleagues there are about 200,000 people, \nchildren of soldiers in the Armed Forces, that are also being left out \nof this.\n  We did a little analysis and found out that these 12 million children \nthat are left out, a good many of them are children of military \npersonnel. So these guys and their families, they are fighting over in \nIraq or they are stationed somewhere in the world and defending the \ncountry, and they cannot get a lousy child tax credit. It is \noutrageous.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This debate has gone very quickly away from the subject that we had \nat hand, but I would like to remind my colleagues that tax cuts do \nwork. They get money back to people who are able to utilize them, just \nlike the families that are being talked about here.\n  The fact of the matter is that this fabulous jobs and growth package \nthat was signed by the President last week has already begun to work in \nthe marketplace. It is seen as a catalyst now for people to want to \ncome and invest more money, not only in this country but also for \ncorporations to have an opportunity to begin employing people, an \nopportunity for the American people to see the opportunity for them to \nhave jobs and more money back in their pockets; and it is amazing how \nthe debate over all these years and even from just about 10 days ago, \nMay 22, when every single tax cut was bad and every single thing that \nwe would do to take money away from our precious government was seen as \na threat to national security, and yet, today, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are talking about a tax cut that would be \nnecessary to help out the American people again.\n  That is why we will stay after this. That is why the Republican Party \nwill continue to not only believe in tax cuts that are great for people \nbut an opportunity to give more money back to people who have earned \nthat money and to help out families and children. This is why we have \nhad as part of the bill the marriage penalty because we do not believe \nthat one spouse that works even part-time should be taxed at the \nhighest rate of the household income.\n  We are proud of what we are doing, and we are going to keep doing it; \nand so I am pleased to hear my colleagues talk about the need for tax \ncuts for all Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just respond to the gentleman that I cannot believe he finally met \na tax cut he did not like. Unfortunately, what we are talking about \nhere is trying to help people, low-income workers and their children; \nand because of the Republicans' late-night maneuver, these people are \nbeing denied the tax cut that he says that they are very much dedicated \nto.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Frank).\n  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, the majority party spokesman \nfor the Committee on Rules was somewhat inaccurate in describing our \nposition. The effort that we are engaged in to provide some financial \nrelief to some of the poorest and hardest-working people in this \ncountry and their children would not cost the government revenues \nanymore. It would be balanced.\n  We find, unlike him, a number of unfairnesses in the Tax Code; and I \nwas struck by, in his conversation, the complete absence of any defense \nof the decision to deny this benefit to these people.\n  I came down here today as the ranking member of the Committee on \nFinancial Services to talk about check truncation, but I would agree \nwith my colleagues that fairness truncation is a far more important \nissue; and that is what we are talking about.\n  The gentleman who spoke said this is a Republican Party and he is \nproud of it. I think there is too good of appreciation in the country \ntoday of the real differences that exist between the parties. \nPartisanship is not always a bad thing. There is a legitimate aspect in \na democratic society to recognizing differences. The gentleman from \nTexas is proud that they passed a tax bill that excluded the poorest \nworking people in America.\n  He said he was proud of it, and I think we are proud on our side to \nbe appalled by it. We are proud on our side to say that we can, without \nfurther draining our ability to pay for important public needs, provide \nhelp to these lower-income people; and as I said, it is a matter of \nfairness truncation.\n  By the way, one of the misarguments that is used to defend stiffing \nthe poorest people in this country when the wealthiest are doing very \nwell is, well, they do not pay taxes. Do people in this Chamber really \nnot notice something called the Social Security payroll tax? In fact, \nanybody who works pays Social Security payroll taxes. Deductions are \nmade, and in fact, the people who are making $25,000, $30,000, $20,000, \nthey are paying a very large percentage of their income in those taxes.\n  I hope that we will soon do the noncontroversial bill that allows \nbanks to truncate checks, and I hope we will then undo the Republican \ndecision to truncate fairness and equity even further than it is and \nuse some of the resources that we were able to use for a very large \noverall tax cut and spend a very few dollars on the poorest people in \nthis country, including children.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This rule that is before us about check clearing is really something \nthat I think that consumers and the banking community are going to find \nof interest, and I am sorry that the debate is not on this \nmodernization of the system.\n  What we are going to do with this wonderful bill that we have before \nus today is to, once again, prove that an agenda that can move forward \nproblems that are facing the American public, costs that are in its \nway, inefficiencies in our banking system which is what this bill is \nabout, we are going to solve, be another part of the solution today; \nand I am very, very proud of not only the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania \n(Ms. Hart), a bright young Member that we have, and the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Ferguson) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) \nfor bringing this bill, these ideas forward. But I think it shows that, \nas we talk about and move forward in this great body, the important \naspects of that make a difference in America, just like tax cuts; that \nthe American people will see that this House of Representatives not \nonly works, it provides tax relief.\n  It provides things in our banking system that will keep modernizing \nAmerica. It will make sure that we are prepared for the future, and as \nwe go past this bill into other areas, whether it be appropriations or \nworking with intelligence or matters of national security, that this \nHouse of Representatives every time brings forth a full debate, not \nonly on the issues but makes sure that time is allocated for even the \nminority party to stand up and to talk about their frustrations.\n  I think what we are doing today with this bill makes sense. I think \nthe American people see that this House of Representatives and this \nadministration intends to move forward in a proactive, positive way \nthat all Americans can have not only confidence in their government but \nalso confidence in the free market enterprise system that we are so \nproud of that produces jobs and keeps our economy going.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Frank).\n\n[[Page H4989]]\n\n  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentleman \nfrom Texas in the discretion he showed in continuing to avoid defending \nthis outrageous decision to stiff the poor people.\n  As to the check truncation bill, I appreciate his discussion of the \nwork. As the ranking member, let me say I appreciate we have an open \nrule here. We do have an inverse relationship here. Well, we have two.\n  One, the poorer a person is, the less fairly they are going to be \ntreated in the tax bill. Secondly, the less important the legislation, \nthe more open-handed the Committee on Rules will be in letting us \ndiscuss it.\n  I am glad that we are bringing this bill forward. I was the ranking \nmember when it was put forward, but I have to tell my colleagues I am \nglad that it is going to pass; but it probably will not make it into my \nnext biography. I do not expect being remembered as the coauthor of the \ncheck truncation bill will be part of my legacy. So I thank the \ngentleman for his concern.\n  The reason we are not debating it is very simple. There is nothing \nleft to say. The banks are going to use the different kinds of paper. \nPeople will be able to get a record of their checks. That is the end of \nit.\n  I understand why the gentleman would rather talk about something else \nthan being unfair to poor people. Unfortunately, there is not enough \nsubstance here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This Republican House has since 1997 made sure that we reduce taxes \non people all across the board; and under this new tax cut that we are \ntalking about, a single mother with two children earning $20,000 will \nreceive over $2,000 in payment from the government with no tax \nliability, no tax liability and $2,000 back. So we really do care about \npeople. We have reduced the tax burden on the American public and will \nkeep doing that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania \n(Ms. Hart).\n  (Ms. HART asked and was given permission to revise and extend her \nremarks.)\n  Ms. HART. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the \ntime.\n  I am sitting through this debate because I am here to talk about the \ncheck truncation legislation which we are going to debate shortly. \nHowever, my life experience and history of working as a State senator \nin Pennsylvania and chairing the Committee on Taxation compels me to \nrise regarding some of the comments made by the other side.\n  I believe that the general public knows what a tax credit is. \nHowever, it is clear to me that the other side of the aisle does not. \nOne must pay taxes, income taxes, in order to receive a tax credit; and \nin fact, in our tax bill that we passed and fortunately was signed last \nweek, there is an increase in the child tax credit. The general public \nhas asked us for that, and it has been provided.\n  Those hard-working parents who have been paying income taxes do \nreceive credit, as the gentleman stated, and additional moneys for the \nraising of their children. Claims have been made that that is not the \ncase, but that is just not true. A tax credit is only paid to those who \npay income taxes, and that is exactly what we do.\n  Also regarding that issue, it is very important for us to note also \nthat since I have joined this body about 2\\1/2\\ years ago, the \nRepublican majority has consistently exempted people who are very low \nincome from paying income taxes. It is important to note that because \nthat is clearly something also that those on the other side of the \naisle either are not aware of or have ignored.\n  Our goal has been to encourage families to keep working, even though \nthey may just recently have left the welfare rolls, even though they \nmay have had a difficulty with a layoff and have taken maybe a more \nentry-level-related job. Our goal is to make sure that those who work \nand work hard to support their families have a lower burden. The goal \nis to encourage them to keep working and be promoted and make more \nmoney and eventually become taxpayers.\n  Once they become income tax payers, they then will qualify for things \nlike tax credits because, like I said earlier, one must pay an income \ntax in order to earn a tax credit. That is the way it works.\n  I would also like to note a couple of other things, and I represent a \ndistrict that is very diverse economically and, unfortunately, has seen \nmore unemployment in the last couple of months. Folks I talk to tell me \nthis, they are very pleased that we have made a very good effort to \nextend the unemployment which is very important for those who respect \nworking and are not receiving an income.\n  Our Republican majority has done that several times. We have extended \nunemployment twice now. We intend to keep watching the economy, try to \nmake it move forward as we have done with this tax bill, which will \nhelp employers hire more people and reduce the unemployment rolls. \nWhile those good people are still unemployed, we are trying to make \nsure that they have enough money, and it is extended in our \nunemployment extension so they continue to support their families until \nthey can find that job.\n  Finally, I just need to note that the partisan rancor in this body is \ngetting a bit silly. It is disappointing to me as a person who has come \nto Washington with a lot of positive ideas. I am going to continue to \nwork with those who want to work with us and not create kind of their \nown version of what passed into law. I am going to continue to work for \na positive economy, for growth, for opportunity and for more employment \nbecause I know people across the United States need it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would say to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania that our side of the \naisle would be more than happy to work with her side of the aisle. \nUnfortunately, we are always shut out of the process; and I would also \nsay to the gentleman from Texas who earlier referred to this Republican \nHouse, this is the people's House, something that those on his side of \nthe aisle seem to have forgotten by leaving millions of working \nfamilies and children out in the cold.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. \nKaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. McGovern) for yielding me this time, and I rise against the rule \non this check-cashing bill. And the reason I rise against the rule is \nbecause we are not afforded the opportunity in this House to bring up \nH.R. 2286, the Rangel-DeLauro bill, that would allow us to include all \nof America's working families in the relief for child tax credits.\n  Who is left out? Who is left out are people who earn between $10,500 \na year and $26,600 a year who have children. The bill that passed last \nweek left them out. The gentleman from Texas is wrong. Democrats did \nnot even know what was in that bill. The ranking member on our sides of \nthe aisle had to find the room the conference committee was being held \nin. No Democrat read that bill, and we know the Republicans cut a deal.\n  My Republican colleagues left out working families who live at the \nbottom of this economy, and they have 19 million children, not a single \none of whom are going to get the extra $400 refund, where those checks \nare going to be cashed out of this government when they are sent out \nthis summer. Not a one. They left out 6 million families, 19 million \nchildren.\n  The Republicans refuse to see them, but we see them. We really \nbelieve in not leaving any child behind. But now, Vice President \nCheney, what does he get? He gets $93,700. Republicans are leaving 19 \nmillion children twisting in the wind, but that is par for the course. \nOne of their favorite sports is golf. They leave a lot of people out \nthere in the sand traps. But the defining difference between Democrats \nand Republicans is we include everybody. Everybody.\n  We think some people got too much out of your bill. Vice President \nCheney does not need that money. He will just go out and buy another \nyacht. But who do we see this bill leaves out? The bill leaves out moms \nwho work at McDonald's. They will not get any refund from the child tax \ncredit refund. It leaves out the janitors that clean the\n\n[[Page H4990]]\n\nWorld Trade Towers who have children. They do not get anything either. \nAnd the Republicans' bill leaves out our privates and specialists in \nthe Army, Navy, and Air Force who are at the bottom of the pay scale in \nour Armed Forces. They will not get the child tax credit refund either.\n  These folks pay taxes. They not only pay Social Security and Medicare \ntaxes, they pay property taxes, the Federal gas tax, and the cigarette \ntax. They do not have anybody giving them taxes back. They do not have \nlobbyists coming in to lobby on their behalf, who are the winners in \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a right to include all families. We ought to \nvote down this rule and demand that the leadership bring up H.R. 2286 \nto include all of America's children and families.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Prior to 2001, the child tax credit was $500 for an eligible child. \nThe child tax credit was not refundable for most families. However, for \nfamilies with three or more eligible children the credit was \nrefundable, to the extent the family had payroll liability that was not \noffset by the earned income tax credit.\n  What we have attempted to do, and what was signed into law on May 28, \naccelerates and increases the child credit. Certainly one has to \nqualify, but the child credit will increase from $600 per child to \n$1,000 per child in 2003 and 2004, and in 2005 the credit will revert \nback to its 2001 act-in phase. That means that what we have done is to \nmove forward very quickly an acceleration, because I believe, and my \nparty believes, and this bill believes that it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  The bottom line is that due to political constraints there was not as \nmuch money. So what we did is we moved forward from $600 to $1,000, but \nit is only good for 2 tax years. We have a lot of work to do, Mr. \nSpeaker; but I am ready to do that work. I think this body is ready to \ndo that work, and we intend to get it done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto ask my colleagues to review an editorial from The Washington Post \nentitled, ``Children Left Behind,'' and also today's New York Times \neditorial entitled, ``The Poor Held Hostage for Tax Cuts,'' which I now \nsubmit for the Record.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 2, 2003]\n\n                          Children Left Behind\n\n       Even for a debate over taxes, the public discussion taking \n     place right now about child credits in the new tax law is \n     particularly galling, hypocritical and ill-informed. The new \n     law bumps up the credit for each child from $600 to $1,000 \n     (though the benefit phases out for families that earn more \n     than $110,000). This increase, part of the 2001 tax law, was \n     pushed forward to this year under the new law. The 2001 law \n     also allowed some low-income families that don't pay income \n     taxes to benefit from the child tax credit; these families \n     receive money from the government, just as with the Earned \n     Income Tax Credit. Those amounts were set to increase in \n     2005--but that part was not speeded up under the new law. If \n     it had been, it would have cost $3.5 billion, or 1 percent of \n     the supposed cost of the tax bill, and would have helped \n     almost 12 million children whose families make between \n     $10,500 and $26,625.\n       Stiffing these children was not a last-minute oversight or \n     the unfortunate result of an unreasonably tight $350 billion \n     ceiling. ``Adjustments had to be made,'' a spokeswoman for \n     the House Ways and Means Committee said, as if those on her \n     side would have preferred otherwise. In fact, the \n     administration didn't include this provision in its original, \n     $726 billion proposal. The House didn't include it in its \n     $550 billion version. The Senate Finance Committee didn't \n     include it in its original package. Most Republicans wanted \n     relief only for those who pay income tax. As White House \n     spokesman Ari Fleischer framed it, ``Does tax relief go to \n     people who pay income taxes . . . or does it go above and \n     beyond the forgiving of all income taxes, and you actually \n     get a check back from the government for more than you ever \n     owed in income taxes?''\n       But it's not as if these workers pay no federal taxes; they \n     shell out 7.65 percent of their earnings in Social Security \n     and Medicare payroll taxes. More fundamentally, if it makes \n     sense to help families with children, why shouldn't the aid \n     go to those who need it most? If speeding up the tax credit \n     makes sense for some, why not for everyone? If one goal of \n     the tax bill is to pump money into the economy quickly, why \n     not give it to those most apt to spend it? Such relief could \n     be paid for by cutting the rates for those in the top \n     brackets (people with taxable income of more than about \n     $312,000) just a smidgen less. These folks already get the \n     biggest rate reduction of all, from 38.6 percent to 35 \n     percent; merely edging that up to 35.3 percent would have \n     paid for the extra child credits. If anything, the question \n     lawmakers should consider is why those who make less than \n     $10,50 shouldn't be entitled to some credit as well. The \n     theory has been not to subsidize those who choose to work \n     only part time, but in this economy any number of people are \n     working fewer hours because that is all that is available. \n     Some 8 million children live in families who earn below the \n     current threshold.\n       Indeed, the discussion should be broadened to include the \n     question of why the bill, in a similar fashion, speeded up \n     marriage penalty relief for everyone but the bottom tier, \n     those who qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit. This is \n     arguably even more unfair than the failure to accelerate the \n     entire child credit: the backwardness of the social policy--\n     discouraging marriage--is obvious, and the marriage penalty \n     is particularly steep in this category. For example, two \n     single parents, each with one child and each earning $10,000, \n     would receive about $2,500 through the tax credit; if the \n     married, their tax benefits would drop by more than $1,000.\n       Democrats, who somehow never managed to get traction with \n     an argument about the unfairness of the cuts before the bill \n     was passed, are seizing on the new attention to the child \n     credit. Today Sens. Blanche L. Lincoln (D-Ark.) and Olympia \n     J. Snowe (R-Maine) plan to introduce a bill that would \n     accelerate the credit, paid for by curbing corporate tax \n     shelters and imposing some user fees. We're looking forward \n     to the debate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 5, 2003]\n\n                   The Poor Held Hostage for Tax Cuts\n\n       Millions of low-income families were cruelly denied child \n     credits in the administration's latest detaxation victory. \n     Now, with consummate arrogance, Republican leaders in \n     Congress are threatening another irresponsible tax-cut \n     bidding war as the price for repairing the damage. ``There \n     are a lot of other things that are more important than \n     that,'' said Tom Delay, the House Republican majority leader, \n     signaling that revisiting the child-care issue will open the \n     door to even worse deficit-feeding tax-cut plans. Mr. DeLay \n     at least offered unabashed candor instead of the crocodile \n     tears of other Republicans. They are now embarrassed over the \n     furor that low-income families were deleted in the final \n     G.O.P. deal on the tax-cut boon weighted so shamelessly last \n     month to favor the wealthiest Americans.\n       There is a clear and sensible solution to restore the $400 \n     child-credit increase to the working poor in a Senate \n     proposal from Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, and \n     Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine. Their measure, which \n     would cost $3.5 billion and help nearly 12 million children, \n     would be paid for by eliminating some of the tax-shelter \n     abuses that fed the Enron scandal.\n       Republicans are scrambling for political cover now, fearing \n     the wrath of the mythic soccer-mom voting bloc next year. But \n     the rival child-care solution being offered by Senator \n     Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the finance \n     chairman, introduces a whole new scale of irresponsibility to \n     the tax-cut games. This would expand the credit to 6.5 \n     million low-income households, although not to minimum-wage \n     earners of less than $10,500 a year. But at the same time, \n     the upper-bracket limit would be generously, gratuitously \n     raised another $40,000 to benefit families earning up to \n     $189,000, hardly the neediest among us. Plus the credits \n     would be made permanent instead of temporary, as currently \n     enacted.\n       This makes it a $100-billion-plus budget-busting measure \n     lacking the cost offsets of the sane and prudent Lincoln-\n     Stowe approach. The fiction of Republican leaders' promises \n     to contain the deficit damage of their tax cuts is becoming \n     clearer with each wad of debt rolled onto future generations.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Solis).\n  Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to voice my strong \nopposition to this rule. There is a lot of talk about what the recent \ntax cuts would do for our economy and for working families, and I would \nlike to talk a little bit about what they will not do.\n  The $350 billion in tax cuts leaves out working families, in \nparticular, families that make anywhere between $10,000 and $26,000. \nThey will not qualify for a child care tax credit. I ask my colleagues \nto look at this photograph that I have here. This is a working family, \na representation of a family that lives in my district. They make \n$24,000 a year. They will not get a rebate. They have a son that is \nserving in our war, that is serving in our war in Iraq; but he will not \nget any benefit from this tax cut.\n  Let us really talk about working families and what they do for our \neconomy. They do pay Social Security taxes, they do pay sales taxes. In \nfact, they are taxed so much that they are looking to us as \nrepresentatives of this House to do the right thing. One million \nchildren in military families, like these families, will get no tax \nbreak or credit. This is wrong.\n\n[[Page H4991]]\n\n  We know that somehow the Republicans found $90 billion to give to \n200,000 millionaire families. Imagine that. That money will not make it \nto my district because I do not have a single millionaire that lives in \nmy district. We have people that make less than $20,000, so they do not \nget the benefit of that money.\n  Republicans say this is class warfare that we are discussing. Look at \nthe facts. The money does not come home to the districts that send \nmoney here to Washington because our Republican colleagues are sending \nit to their friends. In fact, in California, 31 percent of California \nfamilies will not receive any child tax credit, and that includes 2.4 \nmillion children in California alone. Forty-seven percent of those \nCalifornians will get a total tax credit of less than $100; $100 does \nnot even help to pay rent in my district, where an apartment goes from \n$800 to $1,000.\n  I urge Members to vote ``no'' on the rule. Let us do a child tax \ncredit that is fair for working families.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Bachus).\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, the first time I got up, I talked about the \nsubject at hand, and that was Check-21. But I do want to address what \nthe Democratic Members have talked about, and that is the recently \npassed tax cut.\n  One would not think there would be such an uproar from the other side \nbecause, in fact, the bill we passed exempts 3 million-plus low-income \nworkers from any Federal tax liability. But there is still an uproar. \nIt increases the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000. But there is \nstill an uproar. It actually gives back, and only in Washington could \nyou give back a tax refund above what people pay in, but it actually \ngives back $2,000 more to low-income families with children than they \npaid in; yet there is still an uproar.\n  Why the uproar? Because the other side wants to take tax money, \ntaxpayers' money that was paid in, and pay it back to people who did \nnot pay taxes. In other words, an individual paying in $1,500 ought to \nget back $3,500. Well, let me tell my colleagues that there is only one \nproblem with that, and that is who pays the $2,000? The answer is the \nmiddle class.\n  In Alabama, if my colleagues talk to my constituents and say to them \nthat they are going to pay back $2,000 to people who did not pay taxes, \nwith their tax dollars, because they have children, they are going to \ncall that welfare. And that is exactly what it is. When we pay folks \nbecause they have children, and we pay them back $4,000 just because \nthey have children, not in money they paid in but with someone else's \nmoney, that is welfare.\n  The other side is still upset that we cut welfare several years ago, \nand they want to use this as an opportunity to start a new welfare \nprogram and to fund it out of middle-class taxpayers' pockets.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Wynn).\n  Mr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, yes, there is an uproar; and, yes, we are \nappalled. We are appalled that the children of 12 million working \nfamilies have been excluded from this bill. They are quite content to \ngive $93,000 in tax cuts to the very wealthy millionaires; but we have \n12 million children who have been excluded, 196,000 from my State of \nMaryland. Yes, there is an uproar. There is something fundamentally \nwrong with that.\n  What the Republicans are trying to tell Americans is that these \npeople do not pay taxes. Oh, yes, they do. Number one, they work every \nday. Every one of these families works every day. Number two, they pay \nproperty tax, sales tax, entertainment tax, and they pay all the other \nkinds of taxes. Importantly, many of these people are in the military. \nThey are privates, they are grunts, they are the people who do the \ndirty work to defend our country. Yet our Republican colleagues say it \nis okay to give a millionaire $93,000 in tax cuts, but it is not okay \nto give someone making less than $26,000 a tax break.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do not call that welfare; I call that democracy. We \nare Democrats. Every time we talk about this issue, the Republicans \nwant to say that is class warfare. Yes, that is class warfare. But let \nme talk about that class. It is a class composed of people who work \nevery day and make less than $26,000 a year. They have 12 million \nchildren, and they are not going to get the benefit of tax relief.\n  Republicans want to talk about putting money back into Americans' \npockets. What about the class of Americans that work every day but do \nnot get the benefit of this big $350 billion tax deal? This tax deal \ngives a $90,000 tax cut to millionaires, but they cannot give $1,000 to \na family that works every day and has a child. My colleagues have the \naudacity to come on this floor and say it is welfare. Yes, there is \ngoing to be an uproar. Yes, I am appalled, because it is undemocratic, \nit is unfair, and it is disgraceful.\n  All my Republican colleagues want to do is give more money to the \nvery rich; and when we tell them that people are working and need a tax \nbreak, they cannot see fit to do it, particularly when some of those \npeople are in our military. It is a disgrace. Let us reject the \nRepublican approach.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, can you inform us how much time is left on \nboth sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Sweeney). The gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) has 10 minutes remaining, and the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, it seems as if we have hit a nerve here. \nWe are supposedly talking about a bill that would make it easier to get \nchecks, and the Republicans are clearly embarrassed that there is a \nwhole lot of people, in fact 12 million children, whose families are \nnot going to get checks. They know darn well that that provision that \nwould have sent the check was in the legislation in the Senate, and in \na late-night deal that money was taken out.\n  Here is one of the families. They live in my district. It is Maria, \nthat is the mom, Alma and Elia Narvaez. They are not going to get a \ncheck. They are one of the 6.8 million families that thought they were \ngoing to get one, but they are not. Along with them, as has been \npointed out, there are going to be a million children whose families \nwere going to get checks of people in the military, our young men and \nwomen who went off to serve, the low-level private first class. They \nare not going to get a check.\n  So it is not just an uproar from this side of the aisle; there is an \nuproar going on in the country right now.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  We read about it in the press, and we hear about it from our \nconstituents. So who is getting the money?\n  They are talking about it only goes to taxpayers and ask these people \nif they pay taxes, but who is getting the money?\n  Well, let us look at the Bush cabinet. We are talking about Treasury \nSecretary John Snow. He was the CEO of the CSX Corporation, a \ncorporation that paid no Federal income tax in 2001, 2000, and 1998. Do \nMembers know how much he is going to get in a tax break? He is going to \nget $330,000 a year in dividend capital gains tax cuts. That is more \nthan Maria Narvaez makes in 16 years. That is his tax cut for 1 year, \nwhat she makes in 16 years.\n  Think about it another way, what the Secretary of the Treasury gets, \n$330,000 in 1 year in a tax break, 1,000 families could get a check. \nMembers decide what is fair.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Ford).\n  (Mr. FORD asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, let me preface by saying I rise in support of \nthe rule and rise in strong support of the bill and thank the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nOxley) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) for all of their \nhard work.\n  In light of the conversation that is occurring, there has been a lot \nof back and forth. I rise just to say two things: One, this really \nrepresents the difference in priorities between the two parties. While \none cannot dispute that\n\n[[Page H4992]]\n\nthe bill that passed here a few nights ago in the form of a jobs bill \nor a tax cut bill, whatever Members choose to call it, the President \nhas suggested that his tax bill will produce a million jobs, so I have \ntaken to calling it a jobs creation bill.\n  The reality is the bill cuts taxes for some people but not enough \npeople. The $3.5 billion that was taken out of the bill, tax cuts that \nwere removed from the bill to make room for other tax cuts, my side \ncharacterizes it as tax cuts for wealthy Americans. The other side \ncharacterizes it differently.\n  The reality is $3.5 billion was taken out of the tax cut that would \nhave gone primarily to families who earn under $25,000 a year. It is \nsuggested that up to 12 million children will lose out.\n  The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) is my friend, but I take \nissue with one characterization. This is not a welfare program. These \npeople earning under $25,000, they work. Some may work not only in the \nmilitary but here on this Capitol Hill where we work day in and day \nout. I believe people who work day in and day out deserve a break.\n  Not only do these people need it to help feed their families and pay \ntheir higher energy bills, they will also spend it in ways that will \nhelp rejuvenate this economy.\n  A point was made about the middle class, and I will submit for the \nRecord yesterday's Washington Post piece that shows numerous studies \nindicate that the middle-class tax share is set to rise after the \npassage of the 2001, 2002, and 2003 tax bills. We may not like this, \nbut these are the facts. It reports that people earning between $28,000 \nand $337,000 a year will end up paying a higher share of taxes than any \nother group of Americans after the passage of the 2001, 2002 and 2003 \ntax bills.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that my friends who label this as an effort to \nincrease welfare will take a look at the facts of the tax bills that \nthis Republican House and Republican Senate have passed.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 4, 2003]\n\n                   Middle Class Tax Share Set To Rise\n\n\n                 Studies Say Burden Of Rich to Decline\n\n                 (By Dana Milbank and Jonathan Weisman)\n\n       Three successive tax cuts pushed by President Bush will \n     leave middle-income taxpayers paying a greater share of all \n     federal taxes by the end of the decade, according to new \n     analyses of the Bush administration's tax policies.\n       As critics of the tax cuts in 2001, 2002 and 2003 have \n     noted, the very wealthiest Americans--those earning $337,000 \n     or more per year--will be the greatest beneficiaries of the \n     changes in the nation's tax laws. And, as administration \n     officials have argued, low-income taxpayers will also enjoy a \n     disproportionately lighter tax burden.\n       The result is that a broad swath of lower-middle, middle- \n     and upper-middle-income people, as well as some rich \n     Americans, will carry a greater share of the federal tax \n     burden after the laws passed in the past three years are \n     fully implemented. While taxes are scheduled to decline for \n     all income groups, those earning more than $28,000 but less \n     than $337,000 will end up paying a greater share of the taxes \n     than they did before the changes.\n       The findings, by two groups that have been critical of the \n     Bush administration's tax policies, add a new wrinkle to the \n     increasingly contentious debate over the fairness of Bush's \n     tax policies and which income groups would benefit most.\n       Liberal groups have argued that the Bush administration is \n     penalizing the poor while rewarding the rich. In part to \n     answer those critics, Republicans have targeted the poor with \n     expanded tax refund checks for families with children, a new \n     10 percent tax bracket and a larger earned-income credit for \n     married couples who are poor.\n       The result may be a surprise to both sides: By the end of \n     the decade, the middle class will be picking up a greater \n     share of the government's tab.\n       ``It's hard to get a lot of progressivity at the very \n     top,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, the architect of Bush's most \n     recent tax cut proposal and a former chairman of the White \n     House Council of Economic Advisers. By slashing taxes on \n     dividends, capital gains and inheritances, the cuts ensure \n     that tax burdens will no longer rise consistently with \n     income, as they would with a perfectly ``progressive'' \n     system. ``But,'' Hubbard added, ``we've very much retained \n     progressivity overall because so much money was dumped into \n     the bottom rates.''\n       The two studies focused on separate issues. Citizens for \n     Tax Justice examined the percentage changes in total federal \n     taxes that would be paid by different income groups through \n     2010. The Tax Policy Center, jointly run by the Brookings \n     Institution and the Urban Institute, looked at the share of \n     federal taxes that would remain for the various groups once \n     those changes are fully phased in. But the studies reached \n     similar conclusions.\n       Citizens for Tax Justice found that for the lowest fifth of \n     taxpayers--those earning below $16,000--federal taxes would \n     fall 10 percent between now and 2010, while federal taxes for \n     those in the second quintile--earning between $16,000 to \n     $28,000--would fall 12 percent. At the other end of the \n     scale, the decline for the top 1 percent of taxpayers--those \n     making $337,000 and up--would be 15 percent.\n       In contrast, for taxpayers earning between $45,000 and \n     $337,000, the decline would be 7 percent, less than half the \n     cut reaped by the very wealthy.\n       Citizens for Tax Justice assumed that those provisions in \n     the tax laws scheduled to expire before 2011 would expire as \n     scheduled, although administration officials have said they \n     are determined to make those changes permanent.\n       The Tax Policy Center assumed that all proposed tax cuts \n     would become permanent. It found that the share of federal \n     taxes paid by the top 1 percent of taxpayers would drop to \n     22.8 percent of the total in 2011, from 24.3 percent today, \n     while the share paid by the lowest 40 percent would fall to 2 \n     percent, from 2.2 percent.\n       All others would have a slightly larger proportion of the \n     federal tax burden in 2011 than they do today. For families \n     earning between $22,955 and $80,903, their share of federal \n     taxes would rise from 25.5 percent to 26.1 percent.\n       Both groups included all federal income, payroll, corporate \n     and estate taxes; Citizens for Tax Justice also included \n     excise taxes.\n       Treasury Department officials said the studies are skewed \n     because they include Social Security and Medicare payroll \n     taxes, which the tax cuts did not seek to reduce. Pamela F. \n     Olson, the assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said \n     that if Social Security taxes are included, then Social \n     Security benefits should also be measured. ``Then you would \n     have a very progressive system,'' she said.\n       Instead, Olson pointed to the Treasury's analysis of the \n     impact of successive tax cuts on individual income taxes \n     only. In that analysis, all taxpayers with less than $100,000 \n     in income are shown to be paying a smaller percentage of \n     their income in taxes than they did before Bush took office. \n     Households earning $100,000 or more are now paying 73.3 \n     percent of federal income taxes, up from 70 percent.\n       Figuring out whether tax policy benefits the wealthy or the \n     poor is a hotly disputed subject. Liberals favor a \n     progressive tax system in which households pay higher tax \n     rates and a higher share of their total income as they climb \n     up the income ladder. By that measure, the Bush tax cuts have \n     made the tax code less progressive. By 2011, the poorest \n     taxpayers' after-tax income will have risen only 0.3 percent, \n     according to the Tax Policy Center, while household income \n     for the richest 1 percent of taxpayers will have jumped 8.6 \n     percent.\n       Conservatives say the better measure is which group winds \n     up paying a greater proportion of the tax burden after the \n     tax cut. The rich may get the largest dollar benefit from the \n     tax cuts, but the top 20 percent of household will still be \n     paying 71.5 percent of all federal taxes in 2011.\n       Conservatives and liberals alike agree that Bush's tax \n     policies have shifted more of the tax burden to the middle \n     class. Kevin Hassett, a conservative economist with the \n     American Enterprise Institute, said it ``makes complete \n     sense'' that this would happen as a result of Bush's \n     policies.\n       Changes such as the elimination of the estate tax and the \n     reduction of the stock-dividend tax disproportionately \n     benefit the wealthiest 1 percent, who have the largest amount \n     of assets and capital. Those at the other end of the income \n     spectrum benefit disproportionately from targeted tax cuts \n     such as the child tax credit.\n       With the biggest gains going to the wealthiest and to low-\n     income taxpayers, those in the middle inevitably get a higher \n     tax burden because they don't qualify for the targeted tax \n     breaks that go to the poor or the investment-related tax \n     breaks that go to the wealthy. ``The middle class is \n     predominantly labor income,'' Hassett said.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Watson).\n  Ms. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, it is shameful enough that the Republican \nleadership in Congress has chosen to gamble our children's future on a \nrisky and unsustainable tax scheme such as the one signed into law just \nlast week. But what is even more shameful is that the Republicans sold \nout the very men and women who recently fought for our country in Iraq \nby cutting many of them out of that tax cut.\n  That is right. Only hours before Congress was set to vote on \nPresident Bush's big tax giveaway, Republicans cut out provisions to \nexpand the child tax credit for working families in order to give the \nPresident's wealthy friends a bigger tax cut. The child tax credit \nprovisions Republicans erased would have benefited millions of working \nfamilies, including many families of Americans soldiers, sailors, \nairmen and women just as they return from war.\n\n[[Page H4993]]\n\nThis is outrageous, and my outrage grows when I hear Members of the \nother party's leadership suggesting that this is grounds to write \nanother tax bill for wealthy investors and accuse us of a new welfare \nscheme. How can they in all honesty stand on this floor representing \nthe United States and say that kind of thing?\n  Mr. Speaker, I appeal to Members to fix this problem immediately. \nThis House vote to restore the deleted provisions that would help \nmillions of Americans and their children is one that needs to be taken \nimmediately, so please bring H.R. 2286 to the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hensarling).\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I have been listening with a lot of \ninterest to this debate concerning aspects of the Jobs and Growth Act, \na bill that I was happy to cosponsor. America needs jobs, needs growth, \nbut I think some on the other side of the aisle forget where jobs come \nfrom. Jobs do not come out of this United States Congress. They do not \ncome out of Washington, D.C., or out of the Federal Government. If we \nwant jobs, the people who need tax relief are job creators. Often when \nI listen to some of the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle, it is \nas if these people love jobs, but they hate job creators.\n  Another point, tax relief ought to be for taxpayers. We have a \nwelfare system. I decline those who would take our Tax Code and turn it \ninto a welfare system. We already have a welfare system; and as \nRepublicans have controlled Congress, we have managed to move people \noff welfare and onto work. This is an excellent debate because it shows \nthe clear differences between the two parties. It is as if the other \nside will not be happy until everyone is dependent upon a government \ncheck. We will not be happy until every American has an opportunity to \nhave a paycheck, and that is a clear difference between the two \nparties.\n  So what we need to do once again, if we want to have jobs, we need to \ngive tax relief to job creators. If we want to be fair, we need to give \ntax relief to taxpayers. That is the difference here, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Ford).\n  Mr. FORD. I can sit and listen to a lot of this, and I have a lot of \nfriends on the other side of the aisle. But let us be fair. These \npeople making less than $25,000 a year get up and go to work just like \nyou and I do every single day. They pay a payroll tax which is the \nhighest tax paid by 82 percent of Americans. So the other side of the \naisle can label us not being for tax cuts if you choose, but do not \ncall this a welfare plan. This is a plan designed to help people who go \nto work day in and day out but who earn under $25,000 a year.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to the time \nremaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Sweeney). The gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSessions) has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) has 4\\1/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will allow the minority the opportunity \nto consume their time, and then I will close.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. George Miller).\n  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) who had time remaining would \nnot yield to defend his remarks. He did not have the courage to yield \nto the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) who asked him to do so.\n  Mr. Speaker, as Americans picked up their newspapers this morning, in \nUSA Today they could read about the controversy about Sammy Sosa or the \ntragedy of Martha Stewart. As they thumbed through the newspaper, they \nwould also read something else, they would read that the child tax \ncredit is not available to 250,000 of our veterans. One in five \nchildren in the military will not get the tax credit. Some 750,000 \nveterans, veterans, their children will not get this tax credit.\n  It is a shame. How did this happen? How did 250,000 children of \nactive duty veterans, people fighting for this country, their children \nwill not be eligible for the child tax credit?\n  Let me set the stage. It is late at night. The Republicans are \narguing over tax cuts. Some people want to defend the corporations that \ngo to Bermuda, other Members want to defend millionaires. Vice \npresident Dick Cheney is running between the Republican factions. It is \nall in the record. He is putting out fires. He has to make a decision: \nDo you help these veterans? Do you help these active duty people with \ntheir children, give them the tax credit? Or, Vice President Cheney, if \nhe does that, he will only get $93,000 in tax cuts. If he gives it to \nthe children of hard-working American families earning under $26,000, \nDick Cheney will have to take a reduction. He will only get $88,000.\n  Dick Cheney is now the chief negotiator running between the House and \nthe Senate. He is running between the extreme position of the House, \nRepublicans who say no tax credits for these children, and the Senate \nwhich voted to give tax credits to the children. Dick Cheney does not \nknow what to do. What does he do?\n  He decides he is going to give himself a $93,000 tax cut; and these \nkids, it is tough. But one would have thought, Mr. Speaker, one would \nhave thought that a former Secretary of Defense would have just dropped \noff a little change to the troops, to their families and to their \nchildren, and to the veterans and their families and their children. It \nwould not have cost Dick Cheney much. If he just took care of the \nchildren, he would have still gotten over $90,000 a year in tax cuts. \nHe could not see it.\n\n\n                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair must remind the Member to refrain \nfrom making personally offensive remarks concerning the Vice President.\n  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I am just reporting \nwhat has been reported in the press.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from California yield for \nthat purpose?\n  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Yes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I did not hear the gentleman \nfrom California say anything personally offensive to the Vice \nPresident. I wonder when we are being told that something was \npersonally offensive to the Vice President, what would that be? He may \nbe more thick-skinned than you give him credit for, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California leveled an \ninnuendo of pecuniary gain.\n  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. So the ruling is or the indication is \nthat any suggestion that the Vice President might be interested in \nmaking money would be personally offensive?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, regular order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would need to hear the remark in \ncontext.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) may proceed in \norder.\n  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, the context is this: \nWhen the Vice President went into the room, the children of veterans \nand active duty service people had the tax credit. When he left the \nroom, he had the big tax cut; they had nothing.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will be asking for a no vote on the previous question. \nIf the previous question is defeated, I will offer an amendment to the \nrule.\n  My amendment will provide that immediately after the House passes the \nCheck Clearing for the 21st Century Act, it will take up H.R. 2286, the \nWorking Families Tax Credit Act of 2003. The Rangel Working Families \nTax Credit bill will give immediate help to more working families by \nproviding the child tax credit to an estimated 19 million additional \nchildren. It will also help families of soldiers in combat by\n\n[[Page H4994]]\n\nextending the child tax credit to them, and it will speed up the \nmarriage penalty relief to lower-income working couples.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  It does not increase the deficit, not by one dime. It is entirely \npaid for by closing the shameful corporate loophole that allows \ncorporations to move offshore simply to avoid paying taxes.\n  Let me make very clear that a ``no'' vote on the previous question \nwill not stop the consideration of the Check Clearing for the 21st \nCentury Act. A ``no'' vote will allow the House to vote on both the \ncheck bill and the tax fairness bill. However, a ``yes'' vote on the \nprevious question will prevent the House from voting on this bill and \nthe child tax credit for working families. I urge a ``no'' vote on the \nprevious question.\n  The time to fix this is now. These hard-working taxpayers were left \nbehind, deliberately cut from the tax bill in the middle of the night \nby the Republican leadership. That is wrong. That is also cruel. These \nare taxpayers. These are taxpayers. These are workers. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the right thing. Let us come together in a bipartisan \nway to right a terrible wrong.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Speaker, that the text of the amendment \nand the description of the amendment be printed in the Record \nimmediately before the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Sweeney). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We are having this debate on the rule for Check-21. It quickly went \nto child tax credits.\n  I include for the Record information on this from the Committee on \nWays and Means.\n\n                                EXAMPLES--REFUNDABILITY OF CHILD CREDIT FOR 2003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Pre-2001 Law        2001 Law          2003 Law\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            EXAMPLE 1: MARRIED COUPLE EARNING $30,000 WITH 3 CHILDREN\n \nTax Liability Before Credits:\nEarnings..................................................            30,000            30,000            30,000\nStandard deduction........................................

In other words, \n     individuals are eligible for the credit only to the extent \n     they have income tax liability. A credit is refundable if it \n     is payable to individuals who have no income tax liability. \n     The ``refundable'' amount of the credit is the amount that \n     exceeds the individual's income tax liability.\n       What was the child credit prior to 2001?\n       Prior to 2001, the child credit was $500 per eligible \n     child. The credit was not refundable for most families. \n     However, for families with 3 or more eligible children, the \n     credit was refundable to the extent the family had payroll \n     tax liability that was not offset by the Earned Income Credit \n     (EIC).\n       How was the child credit expanded in 2001?\n       The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2001 significantly expanded the child credit in two important \n     ways:\n       (1) The law gradually increased the credit from $500 to \n     $1,000. The credit was $600 for 2003 and was scheduled to \n     reach $1,000 in 2010.\n       (2) The law made the child credit partially refundable for \n     all families with children--not just those with 3 or more \n     children. The credit is now refundable by an amount equal to \n     10% of the family's earned income in excess of $10,000 \n     (Families with three or more children get the greater of \n     payroll tax liability or 10% of earning income over $10,000). \n     The $10,000 threshold is indexed annually for inflation (it \n     is $10,500 for 2003), and the 10% refundability rate will \n     increase to 15% in 2005.\n       How was the child credit expanded in the Jobs and Growth \n     Law of 2003?\n       The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, \n     which was signed into law on May 28, accelerates the increase \n     in the child credit. The credit will increase from $600 per \n     child to $1,000 per child in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, the \n     credit will revert to its 2001 Act phase-in schedule, and the \n     10% refundability rate will increase to 15%.\n       Who will benefit from the new law?\n       According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 44 million \n     children (27 million families) will benefit from the \n     acceleration of the increase in the child credit. Some of \n     these children will receive larger refundable credits because \n     of the new law.\n       Criticisms from the Very Liberal Center on Budget and \n     Policy Priorities\n       The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), an \n     extremely far left political organization, recently released \n     a ``report'' arguing that 12 million children would receive \n     more benefits if the new law included a provision to \n     accelerate the increase in the refundability rate from 10% to \n     15%. Of this 12 million, 8 million receive no new benefits \n     under the new child credit law and 4 million would receive \n     higher benefits if the refundability were accelerated. \n     However, several factors should be kept in mind.\n       The new tax law includes several provisions that would \n     benefit low-income families. The expansion of the 10% tax \n     bracket and the increase in the standard deduction for \n     married couples are both targeted to low- and middle-income \n     families. Plus, $10 billion in State aid was directed to \n     Medicaid, the health care program for the poor.\n       The new tax law takes an additional 3 million low-income \n     families off the tax rolls entirely.\n       The child credit provision in the new law tax is refundable \n     to the extent of 10% of earned income in excess of $10,500. \n     In 2005, the 10% rate will increase to 15%.\n       Accelerating the increase in the refundability rate from \n     10% to 15% would affect families who pay no income taxes, In \n     fact, these families generally have negative income tax \n     liability because they are already receiving government \n     payments from the Earned Income Credit and the refundable \n     child credit that was enacted in 2001.\n       Expanded refundability was not included in President Bush's \n     $726 billion tax proposal; it was not included in the $50 \n     billion tax proposal that passed the House, and it was not\n\n[[Page H4995]]\n\n     included in Chairman Grassley's mark. Instead, expanded \n     refundability was added during the Senate Committee markup as \n     a member item. With the exception of State aid, the final \n     conference report does not include any narrow items or \n     revenue raisers that were added in the Senate.\n       Expanded refundability would not benefit all children--14 \n     million children would be left out. These children would \n     continue to be left out because their family income is so low \n     (less than $10,500 of earned income) that they pay no income \n     tax and quality for many other anti-poverty programs or these \n     families' incomes are too high (more than $75,000 of Adjusted \n     Gross Income for single parents and $100,000 for married \n     couples with children).\n       The partisan Democrats at the Center on budget and Policy \n     Priorities vehemently opposed any tax cut of any kind during \n     the debate on the growth bill. Now they are arguing that the \n     tax cut wasn't large enough for families who don't pay income \n     taxes in the first place.\n       Congress needs to expeditiously consider a significant \n     expansion of the child tax credit.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the American system which we are all a part of and which \nwe support works. It works because we allow the free enterprise system \nto employ people, to have our economy work; but the tax policy that we \nhave in this country is repressive. Too many people are paying too much \nin taxes and that is why we have had continuing tax relief. But in the \noverall system, if you just look at a book that was called ``The Myth \nof the Rich and Poor in America,'' which was published several years \nago, it talked about 76 percent of those who were considered poor in \nthe eighties became the middle class in the nineties. That was because \nhere in America, we have a system, a system that is fair for people, \nthat if they get up and go to work, as has been suggested that a number \nof people do, they will find in time that they will be a part of the \nAmerican Dream, a system that works. I believe that the tax cut bill of \nthe President's growths and jobs package is the right thing to do. I \nbelieve that our Check-21 bill is another example of the things that \nthis body continues to maintain.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\nPrevious Question for H. Res. 256--Rule on H.R. 1474 Check Clearing for \n                          the 21st Century Act\n\n       At the end of the resolution add the following new section:\n       ``SEC.   . Immediately after disposition of the bill H.R. \n     1474, it shall be in order without intervention of any point \n     of order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2286) the \n     Working Families Tax Credit Act of 2003. The bill shall be \n     considered as read for amendment. The previous question shall \n     be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage without \n     intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally \n     divided and controlled by the Chairman and ranking Minority \n     Member of the Committee on the Ways and Means; and (2) one \n     motion to recommit with or without instructions.''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, by the direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 256 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\tThe Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 256\n\n       Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this \n     resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule \n     XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the \n     Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of \n     the bill (H.R. 1474) to facilitate check truncation by \n     authorizing substitute checks, to foster innovation in the \n     check collection system without mandating receipt of checks \n     in electronic form, and to improve the overall efficiency of \n     the Nation's payments system, and for other purposes. The \n     first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points \n     of order against consideration of the bill are waived. \n     General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not \n     exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the \n     chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Financial Services. After general debate the bill shall be \n     considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. It shall \n     be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \n     of amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the \n     nature of a substitute recommended by the Committee on \n     Financial Services now printed in the bill. Each section of \n     the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall \n     be considered as read. During consideration of the bill for \n     amendment, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole may \n     accord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the \n     Member offering an amendment has caused it to be printed in \n     the portion of the Congressional Record designated for that \n     purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII. Amendments so printed \n     shall be considered as read. At the conclusion of \n     consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall \n     rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as \n     may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote \n     in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the \n     Whole to the bill or to the committee amendment in the nature \n     of a substitute. The previous question shall be considered as \n     ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage \n     without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with \n     or without instructions.\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Shimkus). The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) is recognized for 1 hour.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule, House Resolution 256. This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act.\n\tThe Committee on Rules on Tuesday afternoon granted an open rule providing for 1 hour of general debate in the House on the underlying bill, equally divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial Services. The rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill, and provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions.\n\tI would like to reiterate to the House my satisfaction in the open rule granted for consideration of the underlying piece of legislation that we are debating today, which is also known as CHECK-21.\n\tCHECK-21 is an important bill, although it may seem a bit confusing at first blush for America's banking customers and check writers. The good news is this bill garnered bipartisan support in both the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on Rules, and I anticipate the same result as we move forward towards final passage on the floor today.\n\tThe legislative work our House of Representatives will complete today builds on the legislative work that was started back in 1987 to foster innovation in the check collection system. The Expedited Funds Availability Act, which became law back in 1987, directed the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to improve our check processing system.\n\tToday we are making logical extensions to the work started in 1987 by using our much-improved electronic transfer technology to make check writing speedier and more reliable for all parties involved.\n\tMr. Speaker, each check that is written and used for payment must actually make its way back to the check writer's home bank. That is how each bank patron with a checking account gets the check he or she wrote mailed back to them so that it can appear in their monthly statement.\n\tWhen we stop to think about it, there is a lot of time, money, and effort invested in getting checks back to their home banks. Checks that are written in one corner of our country today will be trucked and flown to their home bank, wherever they reside, all over the country as a normal part of American commerce, a great expense of time and money. Today, American commerce bears the great expense of time and money associated with shipping checks around the country because it is worth it. Checks are an important commercial instrument that help keep our economy moving.\n\tToday, as a cosponsor of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, I am proud to announce the introduction of a new instrument of commerce into the American economy, the substitute check. The substitute check will provide opportunities to greatly decrease the frantic highway and air traffic associated with the gargantuan task of shipping and flying billions of dollars worth of checks around this country every single year.\n\tThanks to electronic imaging, paper checks have the opportunity to be converted into electronic form, transmitted in seconds to the home bank across the country, and printed out at their final destination as substitute checks. \n\tThe bill provides all those institutions that see electronic transfer of commercial paper as the latest wave in modernizing our economic system the opportunity to use substitute checks, but does not require it. That way we all have a chance to ease into the new potential provided by the creation and introduction of substitute checks into the mainstream of commerce.\n\tFinally, Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure customers that the same protections provided today under the Uniform Commercial Code for paper checks would also apply to substitute checks. Additionally, CHECK-21 provides legal indemnification protection to bank customers for losses arising from the receipt of substitute checks.\n\tCHECK-21 is a great bill, Mr. Speaker. I congratulate the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) of the Committee on Financial Services, the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) of the Committee on Rules, as well as the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), who is the subcommittee chairman that is directing this legislation today, as well as all the original cosponsors of this very important bill.\n\tTherefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support both the rule and the underlying legislation.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n\tMr. Speaker, we are here today to consider the rule for H.R. 1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. I urge my colleagues to look at this resolution very closely, to study it, because it is a very, very rare specimen.\n\tWe all know some of the more famous endangered species, including the Virginia big-eared bat, the buff-headed marmoset, and the yellow-footed rock wallaby; but just as rare is the House open rule. Do not make any sudden moves because we might startle it.\n\tSo far this year, the House has considered a total of 38 rules. So far, exactly four of them have been open, four for 38. That is a batting average of .105, which would get us kicked off my son's T-ball team.\n\tThis is what passes for democracy around here, which brings us to the rule for H.R. 1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. This is an open rule for a noncontroversial bill. The issue for me, Mr. Speaker, is not the rule or the bill, but the fact that this open and fair process is almost never used in this body. Whenever an issue is the least bit contentious, whenever there is even a hint of disagreement about a bill, the majority clamps down on its Members, chokes debates, and forces a closed rule through this House. It is a lousy way to run a legislature, Mr. Speaker.\n\tIn the meantime, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, also known as CHECK-21, is a bipartisan bill that will modernize the Nation's check payment system for the 21st century. This legislation will help consumers, businesses, and banks by guaranteeing that check processing and payment will be quicker, and more importantly, lead to more efficient banking.\n\tAs many of us remember, the days and weeks following the tragic events of September 11 were filled with confusion in the banking industry. Because many of our planes were grounded, checks were held up around the country. Similar delays occurred during the anthrax crisis.\n\tWith the passage of CHECK-21, Congress and the banking industry will harness the innovations of the 21st century so our banking system is not crippled as a result of terrorism, natural disasters, or transportation problems.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n\tIn my district, I proudly represent the largest credit union in New England, Digital Credit Union.\n\tAccording to Mary Ann Clancy, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Massachusetts Credit Union League, ``Digital has been able to make cleared checks available to members in a more timely, secure and efficient manner ranging from weeks to immediate access. It also helps keep members' information confidential and saves them time searching through piles of checks to balance their checking accounts.''\n\tMr. Speaker, Democrats have no objection to this bill. Check 21 was reported unanimously out of the Committee on Financial Services. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) and the ranking member, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), and the members of the committee should be commended for working in a bipartisan way, something the leadership of this House cannot seem to do.\n\tWhich, Mr. Speaker, brings us to the Child Tax Credit. As most people know, during their late-night, back-room negotiations on the tax bill, the Republican leadership deliberately dropped a provision that would have helped nearly 12 million children and their families to get the child tax credit.\n\tTheir attack on American workers, on those in the middle, on those trying to get into the middle, continues.\n\tGoverning is about choices, Mr. Speaker. The Republican leadership chose to keep the tax breaks for millionaires, and they chose to scrap the help for low-income working families.\n\tSo at the end of this debate on the rule, I will ask my colleagues to vote no on the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, I will offer an amendment to provide for the consideration of the Rangel/Davis/DeLauro bill to help the people the Republicans would rather leave behind.\n\tIn Massachusetts, for example, 225,000 children would benefit from the Democratic bill. Our proposal provides real relief for the people who need it most, not another giveaway for those who need it least. And we actually pay for our tax relief by closing some of the corporate tax-shelter scams that some greedy corporations like to use.\n\tI am not sure if any of my Republican colleagues remember, but they used to think that burdening our children and grandchildren with huge debt was a bad thing.\n\tI know my Republican colleagues would rather not talk about this. I know they would have been happier if their secret agreements would have remained secret. But I will put them on notice. We are going to keep on discussing this issue until you do the right thing. We are going to be here today and tomorrow and next week and next month, and we are going to fight for the people who deserve a helping hand.\n\tThe Majority Leader made it quite clear the other day what the Republican priorities are. When asked whether he would consider granting relief to those who had been dropped by the leadership in their secret negotiations, he said, ``There are a lot of other things that are more important.''\n\tIf anyone on the other side of the aisle could name one, I would love to hear it.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tThe Committee on Rules meets on a regular basis throughout the week, taking important pieces of legislation, hearing debate. It is not unusual for us to be in the Committee on Rules not only at odd hours of the day and night but also to hear hours of testimony from Members of Congress who have important legislation that they wish to bring forward; and I would like to be one member of that committee that stands up and says that I believe that the leadership of the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), our chairman, and his balance and wisdom and his dedication to a fair process is something that I believe sets this Committee on Rules up for success every single day. This bill that is on the floor is yet another example of that success that the chairman and this committee achieve.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit.\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), along with the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson) introduced this legislation; and the title of this legislation, I think, basically describes what this is all about. It is the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. That is what we are doing.\n\tWe are replacing what the Chamber of Commerce has described as an antiquated method of presenting and returning checks.\n\tIt is amazing to me that we had not taken this step 10 or 15 or 20 years ago. But I do want to commend the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart), and I want to commend the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford). I want to commend a bipartisan group of Members who come together to push this legislation and bring it out on the floor today.\n\tThis is a model for bipartisanship. There are 33 co-sponsors, Democrats, Republicans. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), the ranking member, and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), both made this a priority.\n\tWe have an amendment that was introduced by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) which is included on page 11 in section 3, paragraph E. Part of that language clarifies that nothing in this act shall diminish in any way and everything in this act shall preserve all consumer protections. In fact, we have added consumer protections in this act.\n\tBut let me be very brief and say what this does in a nutshell. Americans write 42.5 billion checks a year; and about three-fourths of those checks have to move physically from the bank where they were deposited to the bank where the original maker was, many of them all the way across the country. Most of them travel by air, but a good many of them travel by truck. When they do, they burn oil, making us more oil dependent. This bill as much as anything will help lessen our reliance on foreign oil.\n\tAnd a lot of people have probably not thought about this, but it is good news for those who travel by air because it will lessen the congestion at our airports. In fact, it is amazing that most Americans do not realize that literally every day tens of thousands of aircraft take to the sky taking back these original checks.\n\tNow, what we are changing today is not something we have not been doing. What the system will go to is actually the system the credit unions in this country have used for over 20 years. So this is nothing new. The credit unions have been using this process. In fact, some of our larger banks by agreement have been doing this process for years without any problems.\n\tThe Federal Reserve has urged for several years that we go to this system. It is good for our economy. Not only will it lessen our dependence on foreign oil, not only will it relieve congestion on our highways and airports, but it will also make our process of clearing checks more efficient. In a world economy when we compete with European nations which are already doing this, we do not need costs and burdens to our financial system that they do not have. In fact, we need to have the most efficient system in the world; and, in fact, this legislation will assure that this happens.\n\tIn conclusion, we will talk about the nuts and bolts of this legislation in the main debate. We will hear from the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) on this legislation. I want to commend the chairman, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), for making this a priority. I want to commend the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) for his leadership on this issue.\n\tIn conclusion, I want to commend all the Members of this body for coming together on this important legislation. We built such a consensus piece of legislation that we have the credit unions endorsing this legislation. We have the community banks endorsing this legislation. We have the independent banks endorsing this legislation. We have the largest 100 financial institutions in the country endorsing this legislation. We have the regulators endorsing this legislation. We have the Chamber of Commerce and several consumer groups endorsing this legislation. And I fully expect that the overwhelming vote that this legislation received in the committee will be repeated out here on the floor with a strong bipartisan majority.\n\tI would think that anyone that understands this legislation will vote in favor of it.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper).\n\tMr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, the sort of checks that Americans are interested in hearing about are not the check clearing system technicality but the checks they receive as a result of their hard work or as a result of tax refunds.\n\tThis July most all Americans with children will be receiving a check in their mailbox as a result of the child tax credit that we passed some 2 weeks ago. Except for the parents who are in the military, who are in the National Guard who do not make a whole lot of money serving our country, and except for the low-income parents who work hard every day for minimum wage or a little bit above, they and their children will not be receiving these checks.\n\tWhy? Six million parents, 12 million of the most deserving people in our country, will not be receiving checks because of a deliberate, secret, back-room deal cut by Republican leadership.\n\tNow, most of my constituents want bipartisan government. They want Democrats and Republicans to work together for the greater good of this Nation. And now that our government is under the control of a Republican White House, a Republican Senate, and a Republican House leadership, people are asking, what decisions are they making?\n\tWell, they are making decisions to leave out 12 million poor children, 12 million deserving folks who need a future in this country; and $400 each would do them a lot of good. It would not only stimulate the economy, it would address the fundamental fairness of that legislation.\n\tNow, many of the folks on the right are saying, well, their parents do not pay taxes. They do pay payroll taxes. They pay property taxes. They pay sales taxes. I dare any of the Members to go to these people and say they do not pay taxes. These are not welfare recipients. These are hard-working people trying to build the American dream, and this House deliberately left out those parents and their 12 million children because we did not have room to fit it into a $350 billion tax bill. All we are asking for is 1 percent of that bill, $3.5 billion to be devoted to the needs of 12 million deserving American kids.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, as I recall, the debate about this tax bill was all about deficits and all about whether the increase of the debt, the public debt limit was going to be achieved. And what happened is that, as we deliberated about the bill, any motion to instruct conferees from the other party was about those two issues. It was not about the substance of the bill as it related to anything that was contained within or to be talked about by the conferees. But, rather, they were focussed entirely on the debt and the amount of money that would be as a part of bill.\n\tNow we find out that, oh, my gosh, there was a part of this great tax cut that they maybe were for even though they were voting against that. So it is very interesting to hear this debate today.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, I would just remind the gentleman that, unlike the Republican tax bill, we actually pay for this by closing corporate loopholes so we do not add to the debt or deficit.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone).\n\tMr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule because the Republican leadership is not allowing us to bring up the Child Tax Credit for these lower-income working families.\n\tExactly what my colleague from Massachusetts said is certainly true. This provision which the Republicans eliminated because they did not want to help the working class and working people was financially paid for, and, again, we are trying to get it passed again and it is paid for completely by closing up corporate tax loopholes.\n\tThe problem is that the Republicans, they just do not want to give it to these working families. Already the other side the other body is saying that they want to add a child tax credit for people at a higher income level, or the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) has said that he wants to add more tax cuts here for wealthy people and for corporate interests.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n\tThat is the thing that would cause an increase in deficit because they have not paid for it. We are saying, as Democrats, we can pay for this child tax credit for these working families under $26,000-or-so in income annually by closing tax corporate tax loopholes; and the Republicans are saying, oh, no, we cannot do that because the only way we will consider it is if we give some child tax credit to higher-income people or other tax cuts to other wealthy people and millionaires, and we do not care whether we pay for that because we do not have any way to pay for that. That just goes into the deficit.\n\tThe hypocrisy is unbelievable. My colleagues should simply admit that the Republicans really do not care about the working people at the lower-income levels. They are not willing to give them any kind of tax credit. They can pass the bill today in the other body and send it over here or vice versa, and it is fully paid for; but they are not going to do it, and I can tell my colleagues there are about 200,000 people, children of soldiers in the Armed Forces, that are also being left out of this.\n\tWe did a little analysis and found out that these 12 million children that are left out, a good many of them are children of military personnel. So these guys and their families, they are fighting over in Iraq or they are stationed somewhere in the world and defending the country, and they cannot get a lousy child tax credit. It is outrageous.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tThis debate has gone very quickly away from the subject that we had at hand, but I would like to remind my colleagues that tax cuts do work. They get money back to people who are able to utilize them, just like the families that are being talked about here.\n\tThe fact of the matter is that this fabulous jobs and growth package that was signed by the President last week has already begun to work in the marketplace. It is seen as a catalyst now for people to want to come and invest more money, not only in this country but also for corporations to have an opportunity to begin employing people, an opportunity for the American people to see the opportunity for them to have jobs and more money back in their pockets; and it is amazing how the debate over all these years and even from just about 10 days ago, May 22, when every single tax cut was bad and every single thing that we would do to take money away from our precious government was seen as a threat to national security, and yet, today, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are talking about a tax cut that would be necessary to help out the American people again.\n\tThat is why we will stay after this. That is why the Republican Party will continue to not only believe in tax cuts that are great for people but an opportunity to give more money back to people who have earned that money and to help out families and children. This is why we have had as part of the bill the marriage penalty because we do not believe that one spouse that works even part-time should be taxed at the highest rate of the household income.\n\tWe are proud of what we are doing, and we are going to keep doing it; and so I am pleased to hear my colleagues talk about the need for tax cuts for all Americans.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tI just respond to the gentleman that I cannot believe he finally met a tax cut he did not like. Unfortunately, what we are talking about here is trying to help people, low-income workers and their children; and because of the Republicans' late-night maneuver, these people are being denied the tax cut that he says that they are very much dedicated to.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank).\n\tMr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, the majority party spokesman for the Committee on Rules was somewhat inaccurate in describing our position. The effort that we are engaged in to provide some financial relief to some of the poorest and hardest-working people in this country and their children would not cost the government revenues anymore. It would be balanced.\n\tWe find, unlike him, a number of unfairnesses in the Tax Code; and I was struck by, in his conversation, the complete absence of any defense of the decision to deny this benefit to these people.\n\tI came down here today as the ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services to talk about check truncation, but I would agree with my colleagues that fairness truncation is a far more important issue; and that is what we are talking about.\n\tThe gentleman who spoke said this is a Republican Party and he is proud of it. I think there is too good of appreciation in the country today of the real differences that exist between the parties. Partisanship is not always a bad thing. There is a legitimate aspect in a democratic society to recognizing differences. The gentleman from Texas is proud that they passed a tax bill that excluded the poorest working people in America.\n\tHe said he was proud of it, and I think we are proud on our side to be appalled by it. We are proud on our side to say that we can, without further draining our ability to pay for important public needs, provide help to these lower-income people; and as I said, it is a matter of fairness truncation.\n\tBy the way, one of the misarguments that is used to defend stiffing the poorest people in this country when the wealthiest are doing very well is, well, they do not pay taxes. Do people in this Chamber really not notice something called the Social Security payroll tax? In fact, anybody who works pays Social Security payroll taxes. Deductions are made, and in fact, the people who are making $25,000, $30,000, $20,000, they are paying a very large percentage of their income in those taxes.\n\tI hope that we will soon do the noncontroversial bill that allows banks to truncate checks, and I hope we will then undo the Republican decision to truncate fairness and equity even further than it is and use some of the resources that we were able to use for a very large overall tax cut and spend a very few dollars on the poorest people in this country, including children.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tThis rule that is before us about check clearing is really something that I think that consumers and the banking community are going to find of interest, and I am sorry that the debate is not on this modernization of the system.\n\tWhat we are going to do with this wonderful bill that we have before us today is to, once again, prove that an agenda that can move forward problems that are facing the American public, costs that are in its way, inefficiencies in our banking system which is what this bill is about, we are going to solve, be another part of the solution today; and I am very, very proud of not only the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart), a bright young Member that we have, and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) for bringing this bill, these ideas forward. But I think it shows that, as we talk about and move forward in this great body, the important aspects of that make a difference in America, just like tax cuts; that the American people will see that this House of Representatives not only works, it provides tax relief.\n\tIt provides things in our banking system that will keep modernizing America. It will make sure that we are prepared for the future, and as we go past this bill into other areas, whether it be appropriations or working with intelligence or matters of national security, that this House of Representatives every time brings forth a full debate, not only on the issues but makes sure that time is allocated for even the minority party to stand up and to talk about their frustrations.\n\tI think what we are doing today with this bill makes sense. I think the American people see that this House of Representatives and this administration intends to move forward in a proactive, positive way that all Americans can have not only confidence in their government but also confidence in the free market enterprise system that we are so proud of that produces jobs and keeps our economy going.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank). \n\tMr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the gentleman from Texas in the discretion he showed in continuing to avoid defending this outrageous decision to stiff the poor people.\n\tAs to the check truncation bill, I appreciate his discussion of the work. As the ranking member, let me say I appreciate we have an open rule here. We do have an inverse relationship here. Well, we have two.\n\tOne, the poorer a person is, the less fairly they are going to be treated in the tax bill. Secondly, the less important the legislation, the more open-handed the Committee on Rules will be in letting us discuss it.\n\tI am glad that we are bringing this bill forward. I was the ranking member when it was put forward, but I have to tell my colleagues I am glad that it is going to pass; but it probably will not make it into my next biography. I do not expect being remembered as the coauthor of the check truncation bill will be part of my legacy. So I thank the gentleman for his concern.\n\tThe reason we are not debating it is very simple. There is nothing left to say. The banks are going to use the different kinds of paper. People will be able to get a record of their checks. That is the end of it.\n\tI understand why the gentleman would rather talk about something else than being unfair to poor people. Unfortunately, there is not enough substance here.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tThis Republican House has since 1997 made sure that we reduce taxes on people all across the board; and under this new tax cut that we are talking about, a single mother with two children earning $20,000 will receive over $2,000 in payment from the government with no tax liability, no tax liability and $2,000 back. So we really do care about people. We have reduced the tax burden on the American public and will keep doing that.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).\n  (Ms. HART asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)\n\tMs. HART. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.\n\tI am sitting through this debate because I am here to talk about the check truncation legislation which we are going to debate shortly. However, my life experience and history of working as a State senator in Pennsylvania and chairing the Committee on Taxation compels me to rise regarding some of the comments made by the other side.\n\tI believe that the general public knows what a tax credit is. However, it is clear to me that the other side of the aisle does not. One must pay taxes, income taxes, in order to receive a tax credit; and in fact, in our tax bill that we passed and fortunately was signed last week, there is an increase in the child tax credit. The general public has asked us for that, and it has been provided.\n\tThose hard-working parents who have been paying income taxes do receive credit, as the gentleman stated, and additional moneys for the raising of their children. Claims have been made that that is not the case, but that is just not true. A tax credit is only paid to those who pay income taxes, and that is exactly what we do.\n\tAlso regarding that issue, it is very important for us to note also that since I have joined this body about 2\\1/2\\ years ago, the Republican majority has consistently exempted people who are very low income from paying income taxes. It is important to note that because that is clearly something also that those on the other side of the aisle either are not aware of or have ignored.\n\tOur goal has been to encourage families to keep working, even though they may just recently have left the welfare rolls, even though they may have had a difficulty with a layoff and have taken maybe a more entry-level-related job. Our goal is to make sure that those who work and work hard to support their families have a lower burden. The goal is to encourage them to keep working and be promoted and make more money and eventually become taxpayers.\n\tOnce they become income tax payers, they then will qualify for things like tax credits because, like I said earlier, one must pay an income tax in order to earn a tax credit. That is the way it works.\n\tI would also like to note a couple of other things, and I represent a district that is very diverse economically and, unfortunately, has seen more unemployment in the last couple of months. Folks I talk to tell me this, they are very pleased that we have made a very good effort to extend the unemployment which is very important for those who respect working and are not receiving an income.\n\tOur Republican majority has done that several times. We have extended unemployment twice now. We intend to keep watching the economy, try to make it move forward as we have done with this tax bill, which will help employers hire more people and reduce the unemployment rolls. While those good people are still unemployed, we are trying to make sure that they have enough money, and it is extended in our unemployment extension so they continue to support their families until they can find that job.\n\tFinally, I just need to note that the partisan rancor in this body is getting a bit silly. It is disappointing to me as a person who has come to Washington with a lot of positive ideas. I am going to continue to work with those who want to work with us and not create kind of their own version of what passed into law. I am going to continue to work for a positive economy, for growth, for opportunity and for more employment because I know people across the United States need it.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tI would say to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania that our side of the aisle would be more than happy to work with her side of the aisle. Unfortunately, we are always shut out of the process; and I would also say to the gentleman from Texas who earlier referred to this Republican House, this is the people's House, something that those on his side of the aisle seem to have forgotten by leaving millions of working families and children out in the cold.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n\tMs. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for yielding me this time, and I rise against the rule on this check-cashing bill. And the reason I rise against the rule is because we are not afforded the opportunity in this House to bring up H.R. 2286, the Rangel-DeLauro bill, that would allow us to include all of America's working families in the relief for child tax credits.\n\tWho is left out? Who is left out are people who earn between $10,500 a year and $26,600 a year who have children. The bill that passed last week left them out. The gentleman from Texas is wrong. Democrats did not even know what was in that bill. The ranking member on our sides of the aisle had to find the room the conference committee was being held in. No Democrat read that bill, and we know the Republicans cut a deal.\n\tMy Republican colleagues left out working families who live at the bottom of this economy, and they have 19 million children, not a single one of whom are going to get the extra $400 refund, where those checks are going to be cashed out of this government when they are sent out this summer. Not a one. They left out 6 million families, 19 million children.\n\tThe Republicans refuse to see them, but we see them. We really believe in not leaving any child behind. But now, Vice President Cheney, what does he get? He gets $93,700. Republicans are leaving 19 million children twisting in the wind, but that is par for the course. One of their favorite sports is golf. They leave a lot of people out there in the sand traps. But the defining difference between Democrats and Republicans is we include everybody. Everybody.\n\tWe think some people got too much out of your bill. Vice President Cheney does not need that money. He will just go out and buy another yacht. But who do we see this bill leaves out? The bill leaves out moms who work at McDonald's. They will not get any refund from the child tax credit refund. It leaves out the janitors that clean the World Trade Towers who have children. They do not get anything either. And the Republicans' bill leaves out our privates and specialists in the Army, Navy, and Air Force who are at the bottom of the pay scale in our Armed Forces. They will not get the child tax credit refund either.\n\tThese folks pay taxes. They not only pay Social Security and Medicare taxes, they pay property taxes, the Federal gas tax, and the cigarette tax. They do not have anybody giving them taxes back. They do not have lobbyists coming in to lobby on their behalf, who are the winners in this bill.\n\tMr. Speaker, we have a right to include all families. We ought to vote down this rule and demand that the leadership bring up H.R. 2286 to include all of America's children and families.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tPrior to 2001, the child tax credit was $500 for an eligible child. The child tax credit was not refundable for most families. However, for families with three or more eligible children the credit was refundable, to the extent the family had payroll liability that was not offset by the earned income tax credit.\n\tWhat we have attempted to do, and what was signed into law on May 28, accelerates and increases the child credit. Certainly one has to qualify, but the child credit will increase from $600 per child to $1,000 per child in 2003 and 2004, and in 2005 the credit will revert back to its 2001 act-in phase. That means that what we have done is to move forward very quickly an acceleration, because I believe, and my party believes, and this bill believes that it is the right thing to do.\n\tThe bottom line is that due to political constraints there was not as much money. So what we did is we moved forward from $600 to $1,000, but it is only good for 2 tax years. We have a lot of work to do, Mr. Speaker; but I am ready to do that work. I think this body is ready to do that work, and we intend to get it done.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to ask my colleagues to review an editorial from The Washington Post entitled, ``Children Left Behind,'' and also today's New York Times editorial entitled, ``The Poor Held Hostage for Tax Cuts,'' which I now submit for the Record.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 2, 2003]\n\n                          Children Left Behind\n\n       Even for a debate over taxes, the public discussion taking \n     place right now about child credits in the new tax law is \n     particularly galling, hypocritical and ill-informed. The new \n     law bumps up the credit for each child from $600 to $1,000 \n     (though the benefit phases out for families that earn more \n     than $110,000). This increase, part of the 2001 tax law, was \n     pushed forward to this year under the new law. The 2001 law \n     also allowed some low-income families that don't pay income \n     taxes to benefit from the child tax credit; these families \n     receive money from the government, just as with the Earned \n     Income Tax Credit. Those amounts were set to increase in \n     2005--but that part was not speeded up under the new law. If \n     it had been, it would have cost $3.5 billion, or 1 percent of \n     the supposed cost of the tax bill, and would have helped \n     almost 12 million children whose families make between \n     $10,500 and $26,625.\n       Stiffing these children was not a last-minute oversight or \n     the unfortunate result of an unreasonably tight $350 billion \n     ceiling. ``Adjustments had to be made,'' a spokeswoman for \n     the House Ways and Means Committee said, as if those on her \n     side would have preferred otherwise. In fact, the \n     administration didn't include this provision in its original, \n     $726 billion proposal. The House didn't include it in its \n     $550 billion version. The Senate Finance Committee didn't \n     include it in its original package. Most Republicans wanted \n     relief only for those who pay income tax. As White House \n     spokesman Ari Fleischer framed it, ``Does tax relief go to \n     people who pay income taxes . . . or does it go above and \n     beyond the forgiving of all income taxes, and you actually \n     get a check back from the government for more than you ever \n     owed in income taxes?''\n       But it's not as if these workers pay no federal taxes; they \n     shell out 7.65 percent of their earnings in Social Security \n     and Medicare payroll taxes. More fundamentally, if it makes \n     sense to help families with children, why shouldn't the aid \n     go to those who need it most? If speeding up the tax credit \n     makes sense for some, why not for everyone? If one goal of \n     the tax bill is to pump money into the economy quickly, why \n     not give it to those most apt to spend it? Such relief could \n     be paid for by cutting the rates for those in the top \n     brackets (people with taxable income of more than about \n     $312,000) just a smidgen less. These folks already get the \n     biggest rate reduction of all, from 38.6 percent to 35 \n     percent; merely edging that up to 35.3 percent would have \n     paid for the extra child credits. If anything, the question \n     lawmakers should consider is why those who make less than \n     $10,50 shouldn't be entitled to some credit as well. The \n     theory has been not to subsidize those who choose to work \n     only part time, but in this economy any number of people are \n     working fewer hours because that is all that is available. \n     Some 8 million children live in families who earn below the \n     current threshold.\n       Indeed, the discussion should be broadened to include the \n     question of why the bill, in a similar fashion, speeded up \n     marriage penalty relief for everyone but the bottom tier, \n     those who qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit. This is \n     arguably even more unfair than the failure to accelerate the \n     entire child credit: the backwardness of the social policy--\n     discouraging marriage--is obvious, and the marriage penalty \n     is particularly steep in this category. For example, two \n     single parents, each with one child and each earning $10,000, \n     would receive about $2,500 through the tax credit; if the \n     married, their tax benefits would drop by more than $1,000.\n       Democrats, who somehow never managed to get traction with \n     an argument about the unfairness of the cuts before the bill \n     was passed, are seizing on the new attention to the child \n     credit. Today Sens. Blanche L. Lincoln (D-Ark.) and Olympia \n     J. Snowe (R-Maine) plan to introduce a bill that would \n     accelerate the credit, paid for by curbing corporate tax \n     shelters and imposing some user fees. We're looking forward \n     to the debate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 5, 2003]\n\n                   The Poor Held Hostage for Tax Cuts\n\n       Millions of low-income families were cruelly denied child \n     credits in the administration's latest detaxation victory. \n     Now, with consummate arrogance, Republican leaders in \n     Congress are threatening another irresponsible tax-cut \n     bidding war as the price for repairing the damage. ``There \n     are a lot of other things that are more important than \n     that,'' said Tom Delay, the House Republican majority leader, \n     signaling that revisiting the child-care issue will open the \n     door to even worse deficit-feeding tax-cut plans. Mr. DeLay \n     at least offered unabashed candor instead of the crocodile \n     tears of other Republicans. They are now embarrassed over the \n     furor that low-income families were deleted in the final \n     G.O.P. deal on the tax-cut boon weighted so shamelessly last \n     month to favor the wealthiest Americans.\n       There is a clear and sensible solution to restore the $400 \n     child-credit increase to the working poor in a Senate \n     proposal from Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, and \n     Olympia Snowe, Republican of Maine. Their measure, which \n     would cost $3.5 billion and help nearly 12 million children, \n     would be paid for by eliminating some of the tax-shelter \n     abuses that fed the Enron scandal.\n       Republicans are scrambling for political cover now, fearing \n     the wrath of the mythic soccer-mom voting bloc next year. But \n     the rival child-care solution being offered by Senator \n     Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the finance \n     chairman, introduces a whole new scale of irresponsibility to \n     the tax-cut games. This would expand the credit to 6.5 \n     million low-income households, although not to minimum-wage \n     earners of less than $10,500 a year. But at the same time, \n     the upper-bracket limit would be generously, gratuitously \n     raised another $40,000 to benefit families earning up to \n     $189,000, hardly the neediest among us. Plus the credits \n     would be made permanent instead of temporary, as currently \n     enacted.\n       This makes it a $100-billion-plus budget-busting measure \n     lacking the cost offsets of the sane and prudent Lincoln-\n     Stowe approach. The fiction of Republican leaders' promises \n     to contain the deficit damage of their tax cuts is becoming \n     clearer with each wad of debt rolled onto future generations.\n\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Solis).\n\tMs. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to voice my strong opposition to this rule. There is a lot of talk about what the recent tax cuts would do for our economy and for working families, and I would like to talk a little bit about what they will not do.\n\tThe $350 billion in tax cuts leaves out working families, in particular, families that make anywhere between $10,000 and $26,000. They will not qualify for a child care tax credit. I ask my colleagues to look at this photograph that I have here. This is a working family, a representation of a family that lives in my district. They make $24,000 a year. They will not get a rebate. They have a son that is serving in our war, that is serving in our war in Iraq; but he will not get any benefit from this tax cut.\n\tLet us really talk about working families and what they do for our economy. They do pay Social Security taxes, they do pay sales taxes. In fact, they are taxed so much that they are looking to us as representatives of this House to do the right thing. One million children in military families, like these families, will get no tax break or credit. This is wrong. \n\tWe know that somehow the Republicans found $90 billion to give to 200,000 millionaire families. Imagine that. That money will not make it to my district because I do not have a single millionaire that lives in my district. We have people that make less than $20,000, so they do not get the benefit of that money.\n\tRepublicans say this is class warfare that we are discussing. Look at the facts. The money does not come home to the districts that send money here to Washington because our Republican colleagues are sending it to their friends. In fact, in California, 31 percent of California families will not receive any child tax credit, and that includes 2.4 million children in California alone. Forty-seven percent of those Californians will get a total tax credit of less than $100; $100 does not even help to pay rent in my district, where an apartment goes from $800 to $1,000.\n\tI urge Members to vote ``no'' on the rule. Let us do a child tax credit that is fair for working families.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus).\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, the first time I got up, I talked about the subject at hand, and that was Check-21. But I do want to address what the Democratic Members have talked about, and that is the recently passed tax cut.\n\tOne would not think there would be such an uproar from the other side because, in fact, the bill we passed exempts 3 million-plus low-income workers from any Federal tax liability. But there is still an uproar. It increases the child tax credit from $600 to $1,000. But there is still an uproar. It actually gives back, and only in Washington could you give back a tax refund above what people pay in, but it actually gives back $2,000 more to low-income families with children than they paid in; yet there is still an uproar.\n\tWhy the uproar? Because the other side wants to take tax money, taxpayers' money that was paid in, and pay it back to people who did not pay taxes. In other words, an individual paying in $1,500 ought to get back $3,500. Well, let me tell my colleagues that there is only one problem with that, and that is who pays the $2,000? The answer is the middle class.\n\tIn Alabama, if my colleagues talk to my constituents and say to them that they are going to pay back $2,000 to people who did not pay taxes, with their tax dollars, because they have children, they are going to call that welfare. And that is exactly what it is. When we pay folks because they have children, and we pay them back $4,000 just because they have children, not in money they paid in but with someone else's money, that is welfare.\n\tThe other side is still upset that we cut welfare several years ago, and they want to use this as an opportunity to start a new welfare program and to fund it out of middle-class taxpayers' pockets.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Wynn).\n\tMr. WYNN. Mr. Speaker, yes, there is an uproar; and, yes, we are appalled. We are appalled that the children of 12 million working families have been excluded from this bill. They are quite content to give $93,000 in tax cuts to the very wealthy millionaires; but we have 12 million children who have been excluded, 196,000 from my State of Maryland. Yes, there is an uproar. There is something fundamentally wrong with that.\n\tWhat the Republicans are trying to tell Americans is that these people do not pay taxes. Oh, yes, they do. Number one, they work every day. Every one of these families works every day. Number two, they pay property tax, sales tax, entertainment tax, and they pay all the other kinds of taxes. Importantly, many of these people are in the military. They are privates, they are grunts, they are the people who do the dirty work to defend our country. Yet our Republican colleagues say it is okay to give a millionaire $93,000 in tax cuts, but it is not okay to give someone making less than $26,000 a tax break.\n\tMr. Speaker, I do not call that welfare; I call that democracy. We are Democrats. Every time we talk about this issue, the Republicans want to say that is class warfare. Yes, that is class warfare. But let me talk about that class. It is a class composed of people who work every day and make less than $26,000 a year. They have 12 million children, and they are not going to get the benefit of tax relief.\n\tRepublicans want to talk about putting money back into Americans' pockets. What about the class of Americans that work every day but do not get the benefit of this big $350 billion tax deal? This tax deal gives a $90,000 tax cut to millionaires, but they cannot give $1,000 to a family that works every day and has a child. My colleagues have the audacity to come on this floor and say it is welfare. Yes, there is going to be an uproar. Yes, I am appalled, because it is undemocratic, it is unfair, and it is disgraceful.\n\tAll my Republican colleagues want to do is give more money to the very rich; and when we tell them that people are working and need a tax break, they cannot see fit to do it, particularly when some of those people are in our military. It is a disgrace. Let us reject the Republican approach.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, can you inform us how much time is left on both sides?\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Sweeney). The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) has 10 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) has 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).\n\tMs. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, it seems as if we have hit a nerve here. We are supposedly talking about a bill that would make it easier to get checks, and the Republicans are clearly embarrassed that there is a whole lot of people, in fact 12 million children, whose families are not going to get checks. They know darn well that that provision that would have sent the check was in the legislation in the Senate, and in a late-night deal that money was taken out.\n\tHere is one of the families. They live in my district. It is Maria, that is the mom, Alma and Elia Narvaez. They are not going to get a check. They are one of the 6.8 million families that thought they were going to get one, but they are not. Along with them, as has been pointed out, there are going to be a million children whose families were going to get checks of people in the military, our young men and women who went off to serve, the low-level private first class. They are not going to get a check.\n\tSo it is not just an uproar from this side of the aisle; there is an uproar going on in the country right now.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n\tWe read about it in the press, and we hear about it from our constituents. So who is getting the money?\n\tThey are talking about it only goes to taxpayers and ask these people if they pay taxes, but who is getting the money?\n\tWell, let us look at the Bush cabinet. We are talking about Treasury Secretary John Snow. He was the CEO of the CSX Corporation, a corporation that paid no Federal income tax in 2001, 2000, and 1998. Do Members know how much he is going to get in a tax break? He is going to get $330,000 a year in dividend capital gains tax cuts. That is more than Maria Narvaez makes in 16 years. That is his tax cut for 1 year, what she makes in 16 years.\n\tThink about it another way, what the Secretary of the Treasury gets, $330,000 in 1 year in a tax break, 1,000 families could get a check. Members decide what is fair.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford).\n  (Mr. FORD asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, let me preface by saying I rise in support of the rule and rise in strong support of the bill and thank the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) for all of their hard work.\n\tIn light of the conversation that is occurring, there has been a lot of back and forth. I rise just to say two things: One, this really represents the difference in priorities between the two parties. While one cannot dispute that the bill that passed here a few nights ago in the form of a jobs bill or a tax cut bill, whatever Members choose to call it, the President has suggested that his tax bill will produce a million jobs, so I have taken to calling it a jobs creation bill.\n\tThe reality is the bill cuts taxes for some people but not enough people. The $3.5 billion that was taken out of the bill, tax cuts that were removed from the bill to make room for other tax cuts, my side characterizes it as tax cuts for wealthy Americans. The other side characterizes it differently.\n\tThe reality is $3.5 billion was taken out of the tax cut that would have gone primarily to families who earn under $25,000 a year. It is suggested that up to 12 million children will lose out.\n\tThe gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) is my friend, but I take issue with one characterization. This is not a welfare program. These people earning under $25,000, they work. Some may work not only in the military but here on this Capitol Hill where we work day in and day out. I believe people who work day in and day out deserve a break.\n\tNot only do these people need it to help feed their families and pay their higher energy bills, they will also spend it in ways that will help rejuvenate this economy.\n\tA point was made about the middle class, and I will submit for the Record yesterday's Washington Post piece that shows numerous studies indicate that the middle-class tax share is set to rise after the passage of the 2001, 2002, and 2003 tax bills. We may not like this, but these are the facts. It reports that people earning between $28,000 and $337,000 a year will end up paying a higher share of taxes than any other group of Americans after the passage of the 2001, 2002 and 2003 tax bills.\n\tMr. Speaker, I hope that my friends who label this as an effort to increase welfare will take a look at the facts of the tax bills that this Republican House and Republican Senate have passed.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 4, 2003]\n\n                   Middle Class Tax Share Set To Rise\n\n\n                 Studies Say Burden Of Rich to Decline\n\n                 (By Dana Milbank and Jonathan Weisman)\n\n       Three successive tax cuts pushed by President Bush will \n     leave middle-income taxpayers paying a greater share of all \n     federal taxes by the end of the decade, according to new \n     analyses of the Bush administration's tax policies.\n       As critics of the tax cuts in 2001, 2002 and 2003 have \n     noted, the very wealthiest Americans--those earning $337,000 \n     or more per year--will be the greatest beneficiaries of the \n     changes in the nation's tax laws. And, as administration \n     officials have argued, low-income taxpayers will also enjoy a \n     disproportionately lighter tax burden.\n       The result is that a broad swath of lower-middle, middle- \n     and upper-middle-income people, as well as some rich \n     Americans, will carry a greater share of the federal tax \n     burden after the laws passed in the past three years are \n     fully implemented. While taxes are scheduled to decline for \n     all income groups, those earning more than $28,000 but less \n     than $337,000 will end up paying a greater share of the taxes \n     than they did before the changes.\n       The findings, by two groups that have been critical of the \n     Bush administration's tax policies, add a new wrinkle to the \n     increasingly contentious debate over the fairness of Bush's \n     tax policies and which income groups would benefit most.\n       Liberal groups have argued that the Bush administration is \n     penalizing the poor while rewarding the rich. In part to \n     answer those critics, Republicans have targeted the poor with \n     expanded tax refund checks for families with children, a new \n     10 percent tax bracket and a larger earned-income credit for \n     married couples who are poor.\n       The result may be a surprise to both sides: By the end of \n     the decade, the middle class will be picking up a greater \n     share of the government's tab.\n       ``It's hard to get a lot of progressivity at the very \n     top,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, the architect of Bush's most \n     recent tax cut proposal and a former chairman of the White \n     House Council of Economic Advisers. By slashing taxes on \n     dividends, capital gains and inheritances, the cuts ensure \n     that tax burdens will no longer rise consistently with \n     income, as they would with a perfectly ``progressive'' \n     system. ``But,'' Hubbard added, ``we've very much retained \n     progressivity overall because so much money was dumped into \n     the bottom rates.''\n       The two studies focused on separate issues. Citizens for \n     Tax Justice examined the percentage changes in total federal \n     taxes that would be paid by different income groups through \n     2010. The Tax Policy Center, jointly run by the Brookings \n     Institution and the Urban Institute, looked at the share of \n     federal taxes that would remain for the various groups once \n     those changes are fully phased in. But the studies reached \n     similar conclusions.\n       Citizens for Tax Justice found that for the lowest fifth of \n     taxpayers--those earning below $16,000--federal taxes would \n     fall 10 percent between now and 2010, while federal taxes for \n     those in the second quintile--earning between $16,000 to \n     $28,000--would fall 12 percent. At the other end of the \n     scale, the decline for the top 1 percent of taxpayers--those \n     making $337,000 and up--would be 15 percent.\n       In contrast, for taxpayers earning between $45,000 and \n     $337,000, the decline would be 7 percent, less than half the \n     cut reaped by the very wealthy.\n       Citizens for Tax Justice assumed that those provisions in \n     the tax laws scheduled to expire before 2011 would expire as \n     scheduled, although administration officials have said they \n     are determined to make those changes permanent.\n       The Tax Policy Center assumed that all proposed tax cuts \n     would become permanent. It found that the share of federal \n     taxes paid by the top 1 percent of taxpayers would drop to \n     22.8 percent of the total in 2011, from 24.3 percent today, \n     while the share paid by the lowest 40 percent would fall to 2 \n     percent, from 2.2 percent.\n       All others would have a slightly larger proportion of the \n     federal tax burden in 2011 than they do today. For families \n     earning between $22,955 and $80,903, their share of federal \n     taxes would rise from 25.5 percent to 26.1 percent.\n       Both groups included all federal income, payroll, corporate \n     and estate taxes; Citizens for Tax Justice also included \n     excise taxes.\n       Treasury Department officials said the studies are skewed \n     because they include Social Security and Medicare payroll \n     taxes, which the tax cuts did not seek to reduce. Pamela F. \n     Olson, the assistant Treasury secretary for tax policy, said \n     that if Social Security taxes are included, then Social \n     Security benefits should also be measured. ``Then you would \n     have a very progressive system,'' she said.\n       Instead, Olson pointed to the Treasury's analysis of the \n     impact of successive tax cuts on individual income taxes \n     only. In that analysis, all taxpayers with less than $100,000 \n     in income are shown to be paying a smaller percentage of \n     their income in taxes than they did before Bush took office. \n     Households earning $100,000 or more are now paying 73.3 \n     percent of federal income taxes, up from 70 percent.\n       Figuring out whether tax policy benefits the wealthy or the \n     poor is a hotly disputed subject. Liberals favor a \n     progressive tax system in which households pay higher tax \n     rates and a higher share of their total income as they climb \n     up the income ladder. By that measure, the Bush tax cuts have \n     made the tax code less progressive. By 2011, the poorest \n     taxpayers' after-tax income will have risen only 0.3 percent, \n     according to the Tax Policy Center, while household income \n     for the richest 1 percent of taxpayers will have jumped 8.6 \n     percent.\n       Conservatives say the better measure is which group winds \n     up paying a greater proportion of the tax burden after the \n     tax cut. The rich may get the largest dollar benefit from the \n     tax cuts, but the top 20 percent of household will still be \n     paying 71.5 percent of all federal taxes in 2011.\n       Conservatives and liberals alike agree that Bush's tax \n     policies have shifted more of the tax burden to the middle \n     class. Kevin Hassett, a conservative economist with the \n     American Enterprise Institute, said it ``makes complete \n     sense'' that this would happen as a result of Bush's \n     policies.\n       Changes such as the elimination of the estate tax and the \n     reduction of the stock-dividend tax disproportionately \n     benefit the wealthiest 1 percent, who have the largest amount \n     of assets and capital. Those at the other end of the income \n     spectrum benefit disproportionately from targeted tax cuts \n     such as the child tax credit.\n       With the biggest gains going to the wealthiest and to low-\n     income taxpayers, those in the middle inevitably get a higher \n     tax burden because they don't qualify for the targeted tax \n     breaks that go to the poor or the investment-related tax \n     breaks that go to the wealthy. ``The middle class is \n     predominantly labor income,'' Hassett said.\n\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Watson).\n\tMs. WATSON. Mr. Speaker, it is shameful enough that the Republican leadership in Congress has chosen to gamble our children's future on a risky and unsustainable tax scheme such as the one signed into law just last week. But what is even more shameful is that the Republicans sold out the very men and women who recently fought for our country in Iraq by cutting many of them out of that tax cut.\n\tThat is right. Only hours before Congress was set to vote on President Bush's big tax giveaway, Republicans cut out provisions to expand the child tax credit for working families in order to give the President's wealthy friends a bigger tax cut. The child tax credit provisions Republicans erased would have benefited millions of working families, including many families of Americans soldiers, sailors, airmen and women just as they return from war. This is outrageous, and my outrage grows when I hear Members of the other party's leadership suggesting that this is grounds to write another tax bill for wealthy investors and accuse us of a new welfare scheme. How can they in all honesty stand on this floor representing the United States and say that kind of thing?\n\tMr. Speaker, I appeal to Members to fix this problem immediately. This House vote to restore the deleted provisions that would help millions of Americans and their children is one that needs to be taken immediately, so please bring H.R. 2286 to the floor.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).\n\tMr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I have been listening with a lot of interest to this debate concerning aspects of the Jobs and Growth Act, a bill that I was happy to cosponsor. America needs jobs, needs growth, but I think some on the other side of the aisle forget where jobs come from. Jobs do not come out of this United States Congress. They do not come out of Washington, D.C., or out of the Federal Government. If we want jobs, the people who need tax relief are job creators. Often when I listen to some of the rhetoric on the other side of the aisle, it is as if these people love jobs, but they hate job creators.\n\tAnother point, tax relief ought to be for taxpayers. We have a welfare system. I decline those who would take our Tax Code and turn it into a welfare system. We already have a welfare system; and as Republicans have controlled Congress, we have managed to move people off welfare and onto work. This is an excellent debate because it shows the clear differences between the two parties. It is as if the other side will not be happy until everyone is dependent upon a government check. We will not be happy until every American has an opportunity to have a paycheck, and that is a clear difference between the two parties.\n\tSo what we need to do once again, if we want to have jobs, we need to give tax relief to job creators. If we want to be fair, we need to give tax relief to taxpayers. That is the difference here, Mr. Speaker.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford).\n\tMr. FORD. I can sit and listen to a lot of this, and I have a lot of friends on the other side of the aisle. But let us be fair. These people making less than $25,000 a year get up and go to work just like you and I do every single day. They pay a payroll tax which is the highest tax paid by 82 percent of Americans. So the other side of the aisle can label us not being for tax cuts if you choose, but do not call this a welfare plan. This is a plan designed to help people who go to work day in and day out but who earn under $25,000 a year.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire as to the time remaining.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Sweeney). The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions) has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) has 4\\1/4\\ minutes remaining.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I will allow the minority the opportunity to consume their time, and then I will close.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller).\n\tMr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) who had time remaining would not yield to defend his remarks. He did not have the courage to yield to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) who asked him to do so.\n\tMr. Speaker, as Americans picked up their newspapers this morning, in USA Today they could read about the controversy about Sammy Sosa or the tragedy of Martha Stewart. As they thumbed through the newspaper, they would also read something else, they would read that the child tax credit is not available to 250,000 of our veterans. One in five children in the military will not get the tax credit. Some 750,000 veterans, veterans, their children will not get this tax credit.\n\tIt is a shame. How did this happen? How did 250,000 children of active duty veterans, people fighting for this country, their children will not be eligible for the child tax credit?\n\tLet me set the stage. It is late at night. The Republicans are arguing over tax cuts. Some people want to defend the corporations that go to Bermuda, other Members want to defend millionaires. Vice president Dick Cheney is running between the Republican factions. It is all in the record. He is putting out fires. He has to make a decision: Do you help these veterans? Do you help these active duty people with their children, give them the tax credit? Or, Vice President Cheney, if he does that, he will only get $93,000 in tax cuts. If he gives it to the children of hard-working American families earning under $26,000, Dick Cheney will have to take a reduction. He will only get $88,000.\n\tDick Cheney is now the chief negotiator running between the House and the Senate. He is running between the extreme position of the House, Republicans who say no tax credits for these children, and the Senate which voted to give tax credits to the children. Dick Cheney does not know what to do. What does he do?\n\tHe decides he is going to give himself a $93,000 tax cut; and these kids, it is tough. But one would have thought, Mr. Speaker, one would have thought that a former Secretary of Defense would have just dropped off a little change to the troops, to their families and to their children, and to the veterans and their families and their children. It would not have cost Dick Cheney much. If he just took care of the children, he would have still gotten over $90,000 a year in tax cuts. He could not see it.\n\n\n                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair must remind the Member to refrain from making personally offensive remarks concerning the Vice President.\n\tMr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I am just reporting what has been reported in the press.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n\tMr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from California yield for that purpose?\n\tMr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Yes.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n\tMr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I did not hear the gentleman from California say anything personally offensive to the Vice President. I wonder when we are being told that something was personally offensive to the Vice President, what would that be? He may be more thick-skinned than you give him credit for, Mr. Speaker.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California leveled an innuendo of pecuniary gain.\n\tMr. FRANK of Massachusetts. So the ruling is or the indication is that any suggestion that the Vice President might be interested in making money would be personally offensive?\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, regular order.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair would need to hear the remark in context.\n\tThe gentleman from California (Mr. George Miller) may proceed in order.\n\tMr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, the context is this: When the Vice President went into the room, the children of veterans and active duty service people had the tax credit. When he left the room, he had the big tax cut; they had nothing.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n\tMr. Speaker, I will be asking for a no vote on the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, I will offer an amendment to the rule.\n\tMy amendment will provide that immediately after the House passes the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act, it will take up H.R. 2286, the Working Families Tax Credit Act of 2003. The Rangel Working Families Tax Credit bill will give immediate help to more working families by providing the child tax credit to an estimated 19 million additional children. It will also help families of soldiers in combat by extending the child tax credit to them, and it will speed up the marriage penalty relief to lower-income working couples.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n\tIt does not increase the deficit, not by one dime. It is entirely paid for by closing the shameful corporate loophole that allows corporations to move offshore simply to avoid paying taxes.\n\tLet me make very clear that a ``no'' vote on the previous question will not stop the consideration of the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. A ``no'' vote will allow the House to vote on both the check bill and the tax fairness bill. However, a ``yes'' vote on the previous question will prevent the House from voting on this bill and the child tax credit for working families. I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question.\n\tThe time to fix this is now. These hard-working taxpayers were left behind, deliberately cut from the tax bill in the middle of the night by the Republican leadership. That is wrong. That is also cruel. These are taxpayers. These are taxpayers. These are workers. I urge my colleagues to do the right thing. Let us come together in a bipartisan way to right a terrible wrong.\n\tI ask unanimous consent, Mr. Speaker, that the text of the amendment and the description of the amendment be printed in the Record immediately before the vote on the previous question.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Sweeney). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tWe are having this debate on the rule for Check-21. It quickly went to child tax credits.\n\tI include for the Record information on this from the Committee on Ways and Means.\n\n                                EXAMPLES--REFUNDABILITY OF CHILD CREDIT FOR 2003----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Pre-2001 Law        2001 Law          2003 Law----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                            EXAMPLE 1: MARRIED COUPLE EARNING $30,000 WITH 3 CHILDREN\n Tax Liability Before Credits:Earnings..................................................            30,000            30,000            30,000Standard deduction........................................

In other words, \n     individuals are eligible for the credit only to the extent \n     they have income tax liability. A credit is refundable if it \n     is payable to individuals who have no income tax liability. \n     The ``refundable'' amount of the credit is the amount that \n     exceeds the individual's income tax liability.\n       What was the child credit prior to 2001?\n       Prior to 2001, the child credit was $500 per eligible \n     child. The credit was not refundable for most families. \n     However, for families with 3 or more eligible children, the \n     credit was refundable to the extent the family had payroll \n     tax liability that was not offset by the Earned Income Credit \n     (EIC).\n       How was the child credit expanded in 2001?\n       The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2001 significantly expanded the child credit in two important \n     ways:\n       (1) The law gradually increased the credit from $500 to \n     $1,000. The credit was $600 for 2003 and was scheduled to \n     reach $1,000 in 2010.\n       (2) The law made the child credit partially refundable for \n     all families with children--not just those with 3 or more \n     children. The credit is now refundable by an amount equal to \n     10% of the family's earned income in excess of $10,000 \n     (Families with three or more children get the greater of \n     payroll tax liability or 10% of earning income over $10,000). \n     The $10,000 threshold is indexed annually for inflation (it \n     is $10,500 for 2003), and the 10% refundability rate will \n     increase to 15% in 2005.\n       How was the child credit expanded in the Jobs and Growth \n     Law of 2003?\n       The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, \n     which was signed into law on May 28, accelerates the increase \n     in the child credit. The credit will increase from $600 per \n     child to $1,000 per child in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, the \n     credit will revert to its 2001 Act phase-in schedule, and the \n     10% refundability rate will increase to 15%.\n       Who will benefit from the new law?\n       According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, 44 million \n     children (27 million families) will benefit from the \n     acceleration of the increase in the child credit. Some of \n     these children will receive larger refundable credits because \n     of the new law.\n       Criticisms from the Very Liberal Center on Budget and \n     Policy Priorities\n       The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP), an \n     extremely far left political organization, recently released \n     a ``report'' arguing that 12 million children would receive \n     more benefits if the new law included a provision to \n     accelerate the increase in the refundability rate from 10% to \n     15%. Of this 12 million, 8 million receive no new benefits \n     under the new child credit law and 4 million would receive \n     higher benefits if the refundability were accelerated. \n     However, several factors should be kept in mind.\n       The new tax law includes several provisions that would \n     benefit low-income families. The expansion of the 10% tax \n     bracket and the increase in the standard deduction for \n     married couples are both targeted to low- and middle-income \n     families. Plus, $10 billion in State aid was directed to \n     Medicaid, the health care program for the poor.\n       The new tax law takes an additional 3 million low-income \n     families off the tax rolls entirely.\n       The child credit provision in the new law tax is refundable \n     to the extent of 10% of earned income in excess of $10,500. \n     In 2005, the 10% rate will increase to 15%.\n       Accelerating the increase in the refundability rate from \n     10% to 15% would affect families who pay no income taxes, In \n     fact, these families generally have negative income tax \n     liability because they are already receiving government \n     payments from the Earned Income Credit and the refundable \n     child credit that was enacted in 2001.\n       Expanded refundability was not included in President Bush's \n     $726 billion tax proposal; it was not included in the $50 \n     billion tax proposal that passed the House, and it was not \n     included in Chairman Grassley's mark. Instead, expanded \n     refundability was added during the Senate Committee markup as \n     a member item. With the exception of State aid, the final \n     conference report does not include any narrow items or \n     revenue raisers that were added in the Senate.\n       Expanded refundability would not benefit all children--14 \n     million children would be left out. These children would \n     continue to be left out because their family income is so low \n     (less than $10,500 of earned income) that they pay no income \n     tax and quality for many other anti-poverty programs or these \n     families' incomes are too high (more than $75,000 of Adjusted \n     Gross Income for single parents and $100,000 for married \n     couples with children).\n       The partisan Democrats at the Center on budget and Policy \n     Priorities vehemently opposed any tax cut of any kind during \n     the debate on the growth bill. Now they are arguing that the \n     tax cut wasn't large enough for families who don't pay income \n     taxes in the first place.\n       Congress needs to expeditiously consider a significant \n     expansion of the child tax credit.\n\n\tMr. Speaker, the American system which we are all a part of and which we support works. It works because we allow the free enterprise system to employ people, to have our economy work; but the tax policy that we have in this country is repressive. Too many people are paying too much in taxes and that is why we have had continuing tax relief. But in the overall system, if you just look at a book that was called ``The Myth of the Rich and Poor in America,'' which was published several years ago, it talked about 76 percent of those who were considered poor in the eighties became the middle class in the nineties. That was because here in America, we have a system, a system that is fair for people, that if they get up and go to work, as has been suggested that a number of people do, they will find in time that they will be a part of the American Dream, a system that works. I believe that the tax cut bill of the President's growths and jobs package is the right thing to do. I believe that our Check-21 bill is another example of the things that this body continues to maintain.\n\tThe material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\nPrevious Question for H. Res. 256--Rule on H.R. 1474 Check Clearing for \n                          the 21st Century Act\n\n       At the end of the resolution add the following new section:\n       ``SEC.   . Immediately after disposition of the bill H.R. \n     1474, it shall be in order without intervention of any point \n     of order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 2286) the \n     Working Families Tax Credit Act of 2003. The bill shall be \n     considered as read for amendment. The previous question shall \n     be considered as ordered on the bill to final passage without \n     intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally \n     divided and controlled by the Chairman and ranking Minority \n     Member of the Committee on the Ways and Means; and (2) one \n     motion to recommit with or without instructions.''\n\n\tMr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question.\n\tThe question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.\n\tMr. McGOVERN.

Pursuant to House Resolution 256 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1474.\n\n                              {time}  1210\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 1474) to facilitate check truncation by authorizing substitute \nchecks, to foster innovation in the check collection system without \nmandating receipt of checks in electronic form, and to improve the \noverall efficiency of the Nation's payments system, and for other \npurposes, with Mr. LaHood in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered as having \nbeen read the first time.\n  Under the rule, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) and the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus).\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).\n  (Ms. HART asked and was given permission to revise and extend her \nremarks.)\n  Ms. HART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1474.\n  A lot of people are not familiar with the legislation. We have been \ncalling it ``check truncation.'' The official title is Check Clearing \nfor the 21st Century Act. Our truncated name is Check 21.\n  This legislation holds the promise of a more efficient check \ncollection system by removing legal barriers to the full utilization of \nnew technologies. It is a win for consumers. It is a win for the \nfinancial services industry. It will empower banks to help prevent \nfraud. It will empower consumers to have more control over their \naccounts and more efficiency in the transfer of their funds.\n  Our current check system's legal framework has not kept up with \ntechnological advances and has constrained the efforts of many banks to \nuse innovations like digital check imaging to improve check processing \nefficiency, providing improved service to customers and substantial \nreductions in transportation and other check processing costs.\n  This digital check imaging looks like a check. It simply is a copy \nthat is transferable digitally, transferable more quickly, than a paper \ncheck. It also can be copied and utilized just like a canceled check.\n  It is important to implement the technological advances made in the \nfield of payment systems so that we provide customers with expedited \naccess to capital, to credit, yet they will be ensured that they are \nprotected from fraud.\n  This legislation permits banks, credit unions and other financial \ninstitutions to truncate checks, just simply not have to transport that \ncanceled check. It allows them to process and clear checks \nelectronically, without moving those paper checks to clearinghouses and \nreturning the original cancelled checks to customers.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  The problem with the current system is that over and over these \nchecks are processed, and it takes a lot of time. It requires physical \ndelivery of the check from the institution of deposit through an \nintermediary, such as clearinghouses or the Federal Reserve Bank, to \nthe bank of the customer who wrote the check before it can be paid. \nEach step of this inefficient process relies on the physical \ntransportation of that check, resulting in billions of checks being \ndriven or flown across the country every day.\n  The problem with this legal framework was highlighted in the days \nfollowing the September 11 attacks when the Nation's planes were \ngrounded, and the flow of checks transported by air came to a complete \nstop. During that time, the Federal Reserve's daily check float grew \nfrom its normal few hundred million dollars to over $47 billion.\n  Under current law, banks, credit unions, and other financial \ninstitutions are unable to truncate checks. They are only able to \ntruncate checks if they have special arrangements with other \ninstitutions that are part of the transaction. There are over 15,000 \nbanks, thrifts, and credit unions, and they are all negotiating \nseparate agreements among themselves, so it is impossible to follow and \nkeep in touch with all of those, even for the most diligent financial \ninstitution.\n  The way this bill would work, a Pennsylvania bank would no longer \nhave to ship a check drawn on a California bank all the way across the \ncountry in order for it to clear, for it to be processed, and for the \nactual payment of the check. This is done by creating a new negotiable \ninstrument called a substitute check.\n  Again, the substitute check would permit banks to truncate the \noriginal check; and it would process the information electronically, \nimmediately, and print and deliver the substitute checks to banks and \nbank customers. So the customer who wishes to retain that record, such \nas a canceled check, would have something that looks just like it.\n  This shows exactly what that substitute check looks like. It looks \nfamiliar, does it not? It is just an identical copy of a canceled \ncheck.\n  This is the legal equivalent of the original check under our \nlegislation. It would include all the information contained on the \noriginal check and the image of the front and back of the original \ncheck, as well as the machine-readable numbers which appear on the \nbottom of the check. And because the substitute check can be processed \njust like an original check, a bank would not need to invest in any new \ntechnology or otherwise change its current check processing operation, \nunless the bank chooses to update its technology.\n  Consumers benefit, and this is the most important part of the \nlegislation. Customers maintain the same protections that they have \nwith this law as they have with their original check. Reducing \nprocessing costs will result in efficiency gains and expedited services \nfor customers. Accessing images of checks will take a fraction of the \ntime that it currently takes to access microfilm or the physical \narchives or the canceled check itself. Customers will no longer have to \nwait for a copy of the check to be obtained from a central processing \nfacility or the microfilm library.\n  Institutions that have already implemented this check imaging \ntechnology offer their customers a wide variety of ways to access these \nimages, including in person at branches as they would today, or through \nthe mail but also over the Internet and in image statements and \nadvanced ATMs. So, for the customer, this is just a wonderful boost.\n  Customers will also benefit from the availability of check imaging to \nhelp combat fraud and the problems associated with bad checks. The \nability to access check images on the Internet helps consumers to \nquickly and conveniently verify their transactions. They can identify \npotential errors. They can detect fraudulent transactions sooner, \nrather than waiting until the end of the month when they receive their \ntraditional statement.\n\n[[Page H4997]]\n\n  Identifying errors and potential fraud as soon as possible helps \neveryone. It helps the banks minimize customer inconvenience and cost. \nIt helps control potential losses. It helps give law enforcement an \nadvantage in tracking down the perpetrators of fraud.\n  Promoting this image technology can help speed processing and \nencourage banks to provide new and improved products and services to \nconsumers. Financial institutions will be able to establish branches or \nATMs in remote locations to further service their customers, provide \nmore cost-effective service, provide customers with later deposit and \ncut-off times, and provide printed copies of checks deposited at ATMs \non ATM receipts. Such changes could result in a check being credited a \nday earlier and interest accruing a day earlier on interest-bearing \naccounts. Obviously, that will make customers quite happy.\n  In conclusion, this is a win-win for everyone. It is a win for the \nindustry, but it is especially a win for consumers. I encourage my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 1474 and significantly increase the \nefficiency of the Nation's check clearing process.\n  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think this is a very good idea. It is efficient. We \nmake sure consumers are fully protected. I agree with just about \neverything everybody else is going to say today.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Weiner).\n  Mr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to \nme, and I thank the sponsors for giving me an opportunity to speak.\n  This is clearly a bill, as the previous speaker outlined, that \nimproves efficiency and hopefully reduces costs to banks. One thing \nthat was not addressed in this legislation, though, is a remaining area \nof patent unfairness to consumers.\n  We all know that a check is essentially an article of faith. It is a \ncontract between two people. From time to time, people write checks \nthat they simply do not have the money to cover. They are penalized. \nThey pay a fine by their bank, anywhere in the neighborhood of $15 to \n$25.\n  But what continues to be the case in this country, in many banks, in \nthe neighborhood of about 85 percent of the big banks and about 75 \npercent of smaller banks, is someone who receives the check, who is \nalready out the amount of money that they were supposed to be given, is \nalso charged a fee, a fine. This is patently unfair. It is \ncounterintuitive; and, frankly, it is indefensible. I think we should \naddress this in this House.\n  Some of the arguments that are raised to defend the idea that the \nperson who gets the check should be fined when someone bounces a check \nsay that there is an added cost to banks when someone bounces a check.\n  This is true. It is estimated that that cost is in the neighborhood \nof 48 to 65 cents, depending on what study we see. It is clear that \nsomeone should be penalized for that. Frankly, we can argue it is too \nhigh, but the person who wrote the check is already getting a $20-some-\nodd-dollar fine.\n  Also, there is a relationship between all banks in the system that \nwhen there is a bounced check, if the credit union has a bounced check \nthat they have to return to CitiBank, there is a relationship there \nthat they exchange a few dimes to make up for that cost.\n  The net of all of this is the banking business makes about $6.1 \nbillion of profits, according to 1999 numbers, just on these \ntransactions. They cover the costs, and then industry-wide they make \nabout $6.1 billion. So the idea that the costs are not getting covered \nis certainly not the case.\n  Secondly, some have argued that we need to have a disincentive for a \nmerchant who is going to get a bad check. We have to incentivize them, \nchecking vigorously to make sure they are getting it from a legitimate \nperson.\n  Well, this is the silliest argument. They already have the greatest \nincentive of all. If they get a bad check, they are out the money or \nthey are out the service or they are out the product that they exchange \nin exchange for that. That is why we all go to our local diners and we \nsee the checks up, notices up, ``we do not accept checks from this \nperson,'' because they definitely do not want to get snookered a second \ntime. So the idea that they should get a $20, a $15 or $10 fine, \nsomehow creates a disincentive is simply not the case.\n  A third argument made is that, well, when we are receiving a check, \nwe should be extra vigilant. We should call up to make sure the person \nhas the money in their account. Well, I have news, because of excellent \nlegislation passed by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) and others, \nwe cannot do that. We cannot receive a check for $100 and call up the \nbank and say, listen, I have account number 1751. Do they have $100 in \ntheir account? They cannot even exchange that information, so there is \nno way you as the person receiving the check can avoid that fee.\n  Some people have said, well, the receiving banks have costs just like \nthe issuing bank has costs. As I mentioned, those costs are already \ncovered.\n  Then, finally, after we cut through all of it, I have found in my one \nexperience with this, and some industry leaders have said, do you know \nwhat, at the end of the day if you make a stink about it, we do not \ncharge. That is not any way to run a railroad.\n  Frankly, this fee, this fine, this penalty is indefensible. It does \nnot penalize someone who does something wrong, it does not \ndisincentivize activity in any way, and it does not encourage any type \nof activity that a person can protect.\n  One of the things we are doing here is making this transaction more \nefficient. The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) said it in the \ndebate on the rule, do we want to improve the efficiency here? That is \nthe rationale. But I think we also have to restore a sense of fairness. \nThis is one open fissure in the law that I look for opportunities to \naddress.\n  Now, I know that we are here under an open rule and I have the \nopportunity, but I would ask the gentleman from Massachusetts if \nperhaps there might be other opportunities to address this inequity.\n  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. WEINER. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The gentleman is right, we are trying in \neverything we have done, and I think we have accomplished that in our \ncommittee so far. The chairman has been very cooperative in promoting \nefficiency while protecting consumers. This bill, as I said, does do \nthat with regard to your ability to get the check if you actually need \nit.\n  The gentleman raises a point that had not previously occurred to me \nthat I think is a good one. I think it ought to be addressed. I would \nbe obviously, as I have told him, very reluctant to do it now without a \nchance to examine it and have some hearings.\n  We do have pending in the process a more comprehensive bill called \nthe Regulatory Relief Bill into which I believe this would fit. The \nbill passed our committee. It is being sequentially referred to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  There are some important issues there, particularly including the \nindustrial loan corporations, where we have given assurances that we \nare going to try and work some compromises out. So I can guarantee to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner), who has raised this very \nimportant issue, that further work remains to be done on regulatory \nrelief. I have spoken to the chairman of both the full committee and \nthe subcommittee, and we agree that this is an issue worthy of \nconsideration.\n  I would say this, whether or not we would all ultimately agree on a \nsolution cannot be predicted. Certainly the gentleman will, I believe, \nhave an opportunity if not to offer it today to offer it later, and I \nhope then to be able to offer it with a good deal more agreement.\n  Mr. OXLEY. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. WEINER. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. OXLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from New York makes an excellent point. \nThis is an issue that needs to be addressed. I think, indeed, the \navenue that the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Franks) mentioned \nwould be\n\n[[Page H4998]]\n\nthe most appropriate, as opposed to this check truncation bill. So I \nappreciate the gentleman's withholding the amendment until we have an \nopportunity to find out where it fits.\n  Indeed, as the regulatory relief bill works its way through the \nprocess, the gentleman would have adequate opportunity to work his \namendment in that particular venue. So I appreciate the gentleman for \nyielding and look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the ranking member \nfor those words. Perhaps in the interim we could also inform some of \nthe small business groups and advocates, who are probably the primary \nvictims of these fees, small businesses who are in good faith accepting \nthese things. The larger businesses, the Wal-Marts of the world, \nprobably say to their banks, we refuse to pay them.\n  But this will be an opportunity. I appreciate the gentleman's \nwillingness to give me another bite at this apple at the appropriate \ntime.\n  Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) be allowed to manage the \nremainder of our time on this bill.\n  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nMassachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Oxley), the chairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. OXLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this important legislation.\n  I want to particularly pay my highest regards and admiration to the \ngentleman from Alabama (Chairman Bachus) for working so well in a \nbipartisan way on this legislation; to our good friend, the gentlewoman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart); my good friend, the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Ford), for being the lead Democrat to sponsor on this \nlegislation; and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson).\n  This is a very important piece of legislation that modernizes the \nsystem. Just think about it. We are in many ways operating in kind of a \nPony Express system today in moving checks around. Admittedly, instead \nof ponies, we do it by airplane.\n  We have found in our hearings, in our deliberations on this \nlegislation, that the 4 days after 9/11/01 were 4 days in which nobody \nwas flying. The checks were piling up. We process 42 billion checks in \nthis economy every year, and the system was badly in need of \nmodernization. I think that 4-day period pointed that out so well.\n  So this is really recognizing the technology that is out there.\n  I had an opportunity to visit NCR headquarters in Dayton, just south \nof my congressional district, last year. I got an eyewitness look at \nthe new technology that is out there that allows this bill to come to \nfruition. It allows us to move a step forward in the check-clearing \nprocess and at the same time making us more efficient as we proceed. \nThat is an amazing effort that can bring about a great deal of change.\n  So I want to encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It \nis long overdue. I again thank the leaders, particularly the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Ford), for their leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) and the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) for his leadership, as well as the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Ferguson), and all my friends on the committee and all my \nfriends on the Democrat side.\n  The rule kind of got heated and spirited over another issue that \nprobably deserves some heat and spirit, but I think this issue here is \none that should enjoy relative ease as we move forward.\n  I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) (for working with the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner) and the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Frank) in addressing what also is an important issue \nin how people's checks are cashed and how they may be penalized for \nsomeone else wronging them.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  That being said, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) has \nwalked through in pretty good detail what this bill seeks to do. In a \nlot of ways, Check 21 is pretty simple in what it does. It just \nmodernizes the Nation's check payment system and tries to keep up with \nall the new technologies in the 21st century.\n  The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) mentioned how many millions \nof dollars can flow across the continents and across the oceans with \nthe click of a mouse and the challenge we faced 2 years ago after the \ntragedies of 9/11 and how this bill really tries to respond. I know \nsome people suggested, my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nSessions), suggested earlier somehow or another this would really help \nto decrease oil costs. I hope we are not overstating the impact of the \nbill, and this will help in our fight against terrorism. Perhaps it \nwill.\n  But one thing can be said, it is pro-consumer. It is pro-business in \na lot of ways, not only pro-business for the banks but pro-business for \nthose institutions who electronically transfer monies and those who \ndepend heavily on checks.\n  My good friend, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), who \ndeserves some thanks also on our side of the aisle for working with the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), in particular raised some \nlegitimate concerns throughout the debate about checks and whether or \nnot these substitute checks that have now been introduced as a legal \nequivalent will somehow or another diminish the rights of those who \nrely on checks heavily, particularly seniors.\n  Perhaps the opposite is true. Not only does this legislation not \naffect arrangements between banks and customers moving forward, but it \nwill probably also allow for a cheaper, more efficient way for checks \nto be used. I say that because banks will actually save money on the \nprocess and will actually be able to provide a greater array of \nservices to all of its customers, particularly those customers who may \nrely more on checks.\n  The year upwards of 60 billion checks will be written in the United \nStates; and although, more and more people are relying on forms of \nelectronic pavements, the Fed makes clear that checks will remain an \nindispensable part of our financial system.\n  Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on about the bill, but I take 30 more \nseconds before yielding to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) \nfor some comments on the bill.\n  We talked about check truncation, and just to be real simple about \nwhat this is, we wanted to find a way to sort of foster innovation \nwithout mandating the receipt of checks in electronic form. It is \nimportant for banks and businesses, consumers to continue to have that \noption of accepting checks in paper form.\n  Essentially, what truncation is is when information on the paper \ncheck is captured off the check and delivered electronically, instead \nof the paper check being presented physically. Through check \ntruncation, paper checks are rendered into zeros and one digital \nsignals which can move through the payment system at digital speeds.\n  Check 21 accomplishes this by establishing this new negotiable \ninstrument, a substitute check which has the same legal status as \noriginal checks. The substitute checks would contain the two-face image \nof the original check. They would include the magnetic code at the \nbottom so that any bank could process them using existing equipment.\n  They would conform to standards for size, paper stock and the like. \nThe substitute checks can then be used by banks and consumers in the \nsame way as original checks.\n  I make one last comment about my friend from North Carolina (Mr. \nWatt). He and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Davis) both contributed \nheavily to this bill ending up as good as it has, largely because of \nconcerns they raised about the language. But for the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Watt) bringing to our attention how there might \nhave been some ambiguity regarding coverage of the Uniform Commercial \nCode as it relates to certain disputes between banks, we might not have \ntightened the language. And but for the work of the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Davis), who will speak in a few minutes, the language \nregarding\n\n[[Page H4999]]\n\nthe recredit provision, which actually is a new protection for \nconsumers, might not have been included.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York \n(Mrs. Maloney).\n  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her \nremarks.)\n  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me \ntime.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Check 21 legislation that will \nmodernize the Nation's check clearing system and benefit our \nconstituents across the country. I thank the ranking member, the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) and the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Ford) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), \nalong with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) and the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Bachus) for their hard work on this bill.\n  This legislation will increase electronic check presentment and lower \nthe cost of check clearing, and it will make it easier for the payments \nsystem to proceed without breakdown in the event of another terrorist \nattack.\n  Today, the technology exists to allow customers to view images of \nchecks on their own home computers so they do not have to wait until \nthe end of the month to get their checks. This legislation complements \nthis technology and will spur more financial institutions to offer \nthese services to consumers.\n  As a practical matter, the ability of a consumer to see an electronic \nimagine of a check will allow them to more easily resolve disputed \nchecks and combat fraud. The legislation also includes important \nconsumer provisions that will allow customers to retrieve and properly \ndebit funds.\n  Check truncation legislation will help prevent another post-9/11 \nsituation where the grounding of the Nation's airplanes prevented \nchecks from being cleared. Currently, checks that are not truncated \nhave to be physically flown to their paying bank. With the planes \ngrounded, massive float built up in the payment system after the terror \nattack and could have threatened a widespread economic interruption had \nflights not resumed.\n  Not only was this a problem after 9/11, but there is a long history \nof inefficiency in the transfer of checks by airplane, especially with \nrespect to check-clearing services provided by the Federal Reserve. I \nhave had a long interest in this issue, and I thank the sponsors of \nthis legislation for including language in the bill that adds check \ntransportation services to the Monetary Control Act.\n  I have had an interest in this issue and I thank the sponsors of the \nlegislation for including language in the bill that adds check \ntransportation services to the Monetary Control Act.\n  This provision will require the Federal Reserve the disclosure of \ncosts related to check transportation and prevent further inefficiency.\n  This legislation is the product of years of work by the Federal \nReserve and the Financial Services Committee. It represents \ncontributions from many Members over the course of countless hearings.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill.\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Ferguson), who is last year's sponsor of the bill and is an \noriginal cosponsor this year.\n  Mr. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here. I certainly \nappreciate the chairman of the subcommittee and the chairman of the \nfull committee for their work on this, and the ranking member of the \nfull committee and the subcommittee and certainly my friend, the \ngentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart), my friend, the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Ford), for their great work in sponsoring this \nlegislation in this Congress.\n  I rise in support of this important legislation. It is common-sense \nlegislation. It has garnered overwhelming support from financial \ninstitutions, from technology companies, from various trade \nassociations, and from the Federal Reserve.\n  The way in which banks currently handle check transfers is totally \noutdated. Currently, banks are required to physically present and \nreturn original paper checks. It is a tedious process that is \ninefficient. It is expensive, and it is rife with potential for fraud. \nAs a result, millions of paper checks are physically transported \nbetween banks every day. The system relies solely on uninterrupted air \nand ground traffic in order to ensure that checks are presented to \npaying banks in a timely manner.\n  When the horrific events of September 11 grounded all air traffic in \nthe United States, hundreds of millions of checks did not move and the \nU.S. payment system was stalled, creating a situation that severely \nthreatened our economic security. That is why the Federal Reserve, \nafter consulting with the banking industry, technology companies, and \nconsumer groups, submitted a proposal to Congress that would reduce the \nneed for physical transportation of checks through increased electronic \ntruncation.\n  Last Congress, I sponsored Check 21, a bill which builds on the \nFederal Reserves proposal and modernizes the Nation's check payments \nsystem by allowing banks to exchange checks electronically. This \nCongress, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the gentlewoman from \nPennsylvania's (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from Tennessee's (Mr. Ford) \nlegislation.\n  Check 21 strengthens our economic security by capitalizing on \nexisting technology to make the collection process faster and more \nefficient while improving customer service, access to funds, and any \nfraud protections. Check 21 is simply a better, more efficient way of \ntransferring checks that takes advantage of the technology that we have \nat hand.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that we were poised to pass this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Davis), a new colleague but one who has already \ndistinguished himself in the Congress.\n  Mr. DAVIS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for \nyielding me time.\n  This is somewhat of a departure from the debate of the morning and \nfrom the debate that we may have this afternoon on some issues, but it \nis something of a welcome departure I suspect for some of us.\n  The way this institution works when it is at its best is we find a \nway to work with the best interests of the business community and we \nfind a way to work with the best interests of the consumer community; \nand if we get some efficiency out of the process, well, all the better.\n  This legislation is a good bill. It is outstanding legislation, and I \nwant to compliment the leadership of this committee. I want to \ncompliment our very able colleague, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania \n(Ms. Hart), as well as my good friend, my very able colleague, the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), as well as a number of members of \nthis committee who have contributed to taking what was a good bill and \ngetting it to the point that it is an excellent piece of legislation.\n  A number of people have extolled the virtues of this bill as far as \nefficiencies are concerned. A number of people have extolled its \nvirtues as far as making a system that has been something of a maze a \nmuch more comprehensible process.\n  I want to dwell for a minute on an act of simplification that this \nbill creates with respect to consumers. Right now, a good many of the \npeople who are watching this or who are part of our districts have had \nthe experience of looking at their bank ledgers and finding out that \nthey have been credited for something that they did not think they \nwrote. A lot of people regularly run into these kinds of very small \nissues with the banking community, and those of us who went to law \nschool can recall the portions of our bar books that summarize the UCC \nand the various protections, and they have been something of an \nimponderable maze.\n  This bill improves that. The expedited recredit provision has a \nnumber of very simple but very important features.\n  The first one is that if it is determined that a bank has falsely \ncredited someone's account, within 1 day of that determination the bank \nmust recredit the account. And there is a very specific window of time \nthat is set to resolve a dispute. If a bank has not determined that a \nclaim is valid within 10 business days, the bank has two options: \neither recrediting the lesser of the amount charged or $25 with \ninterest being recredited and any remaining amount within 45 calendar \ndays. That is an important act of simplification.\n\n[[Page H5000]]\n\n  Another important act is that if there is an invalid claim or notice \nof recredit, the consumer must receive it no later than the day after \nthe bank makes the determination. Why is that maze of words important? \nBecause a lot of banks, Mr. Chairman, have not necessarily had the \nclearest or best guidance from the UCC on what to do in the very simple \ninstance someone comes into a bank and wants to straighten out their \naccount. This bill helps.\n  Another instance, we had a question during the committee process \nabout the substitute check and a number of valid questions were raised \nabout the meaning of the substitute check. In working with our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, we managed to clear up a lot \nof these ambiguities. It is now very clear that someone who may not \nhave a substitute check in hand, that individual can still take \nadvantage of the expedited recredit provisions. That is important in a \nworld where paper sometimes gets lost in the mail.\n  So I will conclude, Mr. Chairman, by saying that this bill reflects \nwhat we can do when we are able to step outside of our partisan boxes \nand what we can do when we bring a little bit of common sense to the \nprocess. Again, I want to thank the leadership of the committee for \nbringing this to place.\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hensarling).\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1474, \nthe Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act.\n  This bill, which modernizes check-clearing transactions, is a win-win \nfor both consumers and financial institutions. Check 21 will result in \nfewer errors in check transactions while providing consumers with more \nchoices.\n  Because of increased on-line access, consumers can now have more \nconfidence when inquiring about the status of their personal checks, \nand they can receive a much quicker response from their bank.\n  Consumers will further benefit by the reduced cost associated with \nmodernization of check clearing, and Check 21 ensures that banks remain \nfully accountable to the consumers they serve.\n  Mr. Chairman, the act will make banking more efficient, reduce \ntransactional cost, provide consumers with more choices, and help our \nfinancial services industry remain preeminent in the world.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) and my \nfriends, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Ford), for their leadership on this important \nlegislation. I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 1474.\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Harris).\n  Ms. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1474, the Check \nClearing for the 21st Century Act.\n  Every day banks assume enormous risks in order to create jobs and \nbuild opportunities. They have infused our economy with its lifeblood \nof capital and credit, while maintaining the health of our global \neconomy's circulatory arteries. Nevertheless, banks still must cope \nwith costly and antiquated laws and regulations that do not accurately \nreflect the realities, demands, and opportunities of today's cyber \neconomy.\n  Under the current law that governs the check-clearing process, banks \nmust physically transport checks to a recipient bank, unless an \nelectronic exchange agreement is in place with that recipient bank.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  This requirement is costly, time-consuming and completely unnecessary \nin light of the safeguards and security available through digital \nimaging and electronic transmission.\n  H.R. 1474 helps us bring our banking system into the 21st century by \ngranting full legal standing to substitute checks which can be digital \nimages of the front and back of the original check that contain all of \nthe information in readable form.\n  This bill modernizes the check collection process enabling banks to \nprovide customers with faster and less expensive service. Moreover, \nH.R. 1474 retains and enhances all of the legal protections against \nfraud and errors that consumers enjoy under the current system while \npreserving the flexibility of recipient banks to process an \nelectronically received check in the same way they would process the \noriginal.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this long overdue \nlegislation which will play a critical role in preserving the health of \nour financial system and revitalizing our economy, and I applaud the \nleadership and the sponsors this bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time. I will \nconsume the shortest period of time as I possibly can, Mr. Chairman.\n  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson), who walked off the \nfloor, deserves a lot of credit for this, and forgive me for not \nmentioning him more, and obviously the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania \n(Ms. Hart), it is her bill this go around; but the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Ferguson) brought my attention to the bill, and I thank him \nfor that.\n  I think all the merits of the bill have been talked about pretty \nextensively and maybe the more we talk we may lose what unanimous \nsupport we have. So I am not going to talk much longer other than to \nthank a few people.\n  I want to thank Roger Ferguson at the Federal Reserve, the vice \nchair. I want to thank Ed Hill and Grant Cole at Bank of America. I \nwant to thank Janelle Duncan with the Consumers Union, as well as the \nConsumer Federation of America and the United States Public Interest \nResearch Group, for all of their hard work. As the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Davis) said, this is one bill that I think in a lot of \nways can be accurately described as pro-business and pro-consumer.\n  I want to thank Brant Imperatore with O'Conner and Hannan, and of \ncourse, the committee staff on both sides, Erika Jeffers, who is a law \nschool classmate, and Ken Swab and Jaime Lizarraga; as well as the \ngentleman from Ohio's (Mr. Oxley) staff, Kevin MacMillan, Deena Ellis, \nJim Clinger, Carter McDowell.\n  There were a number of groups outside of here, the Independent \nCommunity Bankers, America's Community Bankers, Credit Union National \nAssociation and many others, who contributed to making this final \nproduct as good as it is.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, present law requires that checks be returned to the \nbank where they were originally drawn, and that way of doing business \nhas basically been the law and the procedure in this country for over \n100 years. We have technology now that makes something else possible, \nand that is electronic transfer, as opposed to transfer of the paper \ncheck.\n  What we have in our country today is an antiquated process, which is \nalso a tedious process, which each day involves as many as 10 to 12,000 \ncars, trucks and airplanes returning checks when none of this is \nnecessary.\n  The credit unions some 20 years ago went away from this process. They \nhave had zero consumer complaints. The largest banks have made \nagreements between banks, and they have gone away from this process; \nbut today, two-thirds of the checks still are processed in this \noutdated manner.\n  What this House has done in a bipartisan way is take a bill that has \nbeen cosponsored by two of our most able Members, the gentlewoman from \nPennsylvania (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), \nvery aware of this issue, very knowledgeable on the issue, they have \ndrafted this bill. The committee has looked at the bill. We have made \nchanges to protect the consumer, slight changes. The bill as it exists \ntoday has been endorsed by the Federal Reserve, all the regulators, all \nthe financial institutions involved, all the trade groups, consumer \ngroups. It is a model for what this House can do when it puts aside its \ndifferences and works together for the good of the Nation as a whole.\n  This bill is good for customers. This bill is good for consumers. \nThis bill is good for the economy.\n  We have talked about little things such as airport congestion, how \nthis will help address that, congestion on the roadway, our energy \ndependence.\n  I want to commend, in closing, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), \nwho\n\n[[Page H5001]]\n\nhas made this one of his three goals for this year to move this \nlegislation; the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), the ranking \nmember, who identified this as necessary legislation.\n  My colleagues may say, well, this ought to be simple. For 20 years we \ntried to reform our check-clearing process. We have not been able to do \nit until this moment. This House today I think will take a historic \nstep in making us more competitive in the world economy by bringing our \ncheck-clearing system up to a model for the world.\n  Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) and \nthe gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. BACHUS. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, before the gentleman yields back, Jim Worth, \nI forgot to mention him, the legislative counsel. I thank him as well.\n  Mr. BACHUS. That is absolutely true. Our staff worked together very \nclosely and in a very bipartisan spirit.\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. \n1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. I commend \nRepresentatives Melissa Hart and Harold Ford for introducing the \nlegislation and for tenaciously working to ensure the legislation came \nto the House floor today.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Oxley, Chairman Bachus, Ranking Member \nFrank and Ranking Member Sanders for bringing this legislation to the \nfloor today.\n  H.R. 1474 will modernize the nation's check payment system by \nallowing, but not mandating, banks to exchange checks electronically. \nRecognizing that not all banks have the ability to accept electronic \ntransmission of a check, H.R. 1474 authorizes the creation of \nsubstitute checks for payment.\n  This substitute check would be used in place of the original paper \ncheck, and it would be a negotiable instrument. Banks that create an \nelectronic check will be able to create a substitute check and use that \nfor presentment to a bank that has not upgraded its system to accept \nelectronic checks.\n  This legislation capitalizes on existing technology to make the \ncurrent process faster and more efficient, while increasing customer \nservice, improving access to funds and increasing antifraud measures \nthat ensure our economic security. H.R. 1474 will decrease our check \npayment system's financial dependence on physically transporting \nchecks, thus avoiding any types of delays or paralysis in the U.S. \npayment system that might be created by another September 11th \nterrorist attack.\n  I believe that the Committee successfully crafted very difficult and \ncomplicated recredit provisions in the legislation that address the \nconcerns of consumer groups.\n  This legislation is a well-crafted bill that will provide the \nstructure for an efficient financial payments framework to enable \nfinancial institutions to provide better customer service. I encourage \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. OXLEY. Mr. Chairman. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank \nthe gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, for his assistance in bringing this important \nmeasure to the floor. I am inserting for the Record an exchange of \ncorrespondence regarding his committee's jurisdiction over the measure.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Michael Oxley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Oxley: In recognition of the desire to \n     expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1474, the ``Check \n     Clearing for the 21st Century Act,'' the Committee on the \n     Judiciary hereby waives consideration of the bill. Certain \n     provisions of the bill relating to the litigation of claims \n     relating to check clearing fall within the Committee on the \n     Judiciary's Rule X jurisdiction. However, given the need to \n     expedite this legislation, I will not seek a sequential \n     referral based on their inclusion.\n       The Committee on the Judiciary takes this action with the \n     understanding that the Committee's jurisdiction over these \n     provisions is in no way diminished or altered. I would \n     appreciate your including this letter in your committee \n     report on H.R. 1474 and in the Congressional Record during \n     consideration of H.R. 1474 on the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                              Committee on Financial Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.\n     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: Thank you for your letter \n     regarding your Committee's jurisdictional interest in H.R. \n     1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act.\n       I acknowledge your committee's jurisdictional interest in \n     this legislation and appreciate your cooperation in moving \n     the bill to the House floor expeditiously. I agree that your \n     decision to forego further action on the bill will not \n     prejudice the Committee on the Judiciary with respect to its \n     jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation. I \n     will include a copy of your letter and this response in the \n     Committee's report on the bill and the Congressional Record \n     when the legislation is considered by the House.\n       Thank you again for your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael G. Oxley,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the committee amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute printed in the bill shall be considered by sections as an \noriginal bill for the purpose of amendment, and each section is \nconsidered read.\n  During consideration of the bill for amendment, the Chair may accord \npriority in recognition to a Member offering an amendment that he has \nprinted in the designated place in the Congressional Record. Those \namendments will be considered read.\n  The Clerk will designate section 1.\n  The text of section 1 is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Check \n     Clearing for the 21st Century Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) In the Expedited Funds Availability Act, enacted on \n     August 10, 1987, the Congress directed the Board of Governors \n     of the Federal Reserve System to consider establishing \n     regulations requiring Federal reserve banks and depository \n     institutions to provide for check truncation, in order to \n     improve the check processing system.\n       (2) In that same Act, the Congress--\n       (A) provided the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System with full authority to regulate all aspects of the \n     payment system, including the receipt, payment, collection, \n     and clearing of checks, and related functions of the payment \n     system pertaining to checks; and\n       (B) directed that the exercise of such authority by the \n     Board superseded any State law, including the Uniform \n     Commercial Code, as in effect in any State.\n       (3) Check truncation is no less desirable today for both \n     financial service customers and the financial services \n     industry, to reduce costs, improve efficiency in check \n     collections, and expedite funds availability for customers \n     than it was over 15 years ago when Congress first directed \n     the Board to consider establishing such a process.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To facilitate check truncation by authorizing \n     substitute checks.\n       (2) To foster innovation in the check collection system \n     without mandating receipt of checks in electronic form.\n       (3) To improve the overall efficiency of the Nation's \n     payments system.\n\n  The CHAIRMAN. Are there any amendments to section 1?\n\n\n                  amendment no. 1 offered by ms. hart\n\n  Ms. HART. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.\n  The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 1 offered by Ms. Hart:\n       In section 1, insert ``or the `Check 21 Act' '' before the \n     period at the end.\n\n  Ms. HART. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is actually very brief. It is \none line. It is very simple; and it is, as far as I can tell, \ncompletely noncontroversial.\n  The amendment simply adds another name to this legislation to the \ntitle of the bill. It will be, by this amendment, also referred to as \nthe Check 21 Act. Everyone who has been familiar with this bill has \ncommonly referred to it as Check-21, and this amendment simply brings \nclarity to that issue.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Also, I would like to add to the thanks for the cooperation on a \nbipartisan basis for the bill itself as well. I would like to thank the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. \nBachus), the ranking member as well, and also my fellow sponsors, the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) and the gentleman from New Jersey \n(Mr. Ferguson).\n  Everyone's cooperated well and explained this issue; but those who \nhave not been mentioned today, those in the private sector who will be \naffected by this legislation have also been extremely supportive and \nvery cooperative in working out differences that\n\n[[Page H5002]]\n\nthey had during the process of moving this legislation forward, and I \nwish to recognize them as well. When we as the sponsors had asked them \nto sit down and iron some issues out, they did so and they did so very \nefficiently.\n  Mr. Chairman, I simply offer my amendment and ask for its approval, \nvery simply adding the name Check 21 Act.\n  The CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member wish to speak on this amendment?\n  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nPennsylvania (Ms. Hart).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the remainder \nof the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute be printed in \nthe Record and open to amendment at any point.\n  The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nAlabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  The text of the remainder of the committee amendment in the nature of \na substitute is as follows:\n\n     SEC. 2.

and\n       (B) the bank has not provided to the consumer the original \n     check, a substitute check, or a copy of the original check \n     and demonstrates that the substitute check was properly \n     charged to the consumer's account.\n       (2) Timing of recredit.--\n       (A) In general.--The bank shall recredit the consumer's \n     account for the amount described in paragraph (1) no later \n     than the end of the business day following the business day \n     on which the bank determines the consumer's claim is valid.\n       (B) Recredit pending investigation.--If the bank has not \n     yet determined that the consumer's claim is valid before the \n     end of the 10th business day after the business day on which \n     the consumer submitted the claim, the bank shall recredit the \n     consumer's account for--\n       (i) the lesser of the amount of the substitute check that \n     was charged against the consumer account, or $2,500, together \n     with interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, \n     no later than the end of such 10th business day; and\n       (ii) the remaining amount of the substitute check that was \n     charged against the consumer account, if any, together with \n     interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, not \n     later than the 45th calendar day following the business day \n     on which the consumer submits the claim.\n       (d) Availability of Recredit.--\n       (1) Next business day availability.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a bank that provides a recredit to a consumer \n     account under subsection (c) shall make the recredited funds \n     available for withdrawal by the consumer by the start of the \n     next business day after the business day on which the bank \n     recredits the consumer's account under subsection (c).\n       (2) Safeguard exceptions.--A bank may delay availability to \n     a consumer of a recredit provided under subsection \n     (c)(2)(B)(i) until the start of either the business day \n     following the business day on which the bank determines that \n     the consumer's claim is valid or the 45th calendar day \n     following the business day on which the consumer submits a \n     claim for such recredit in accordance with subsection (b), \n     whichever is earlier, in any of the following circumstances:\n       (A) New accounts.--The claim is made during the 30-day \n     period beginning on the business day the consumer account was \n     established.\n       (B) Repeated overdrafts.--Without regard to the charge that \n     is the subject of the claim for which the recredit was made--\n       (i) on 6 or more business days during the 6-month period \n     ending on the date on which the consumer submits the claim, \n     the balance in the consumer account was negative or would \n     have become negative if checks or other charges to the \n     account had been paid; or\n       (ii) on 2 or more business days during such 6-month period, \n     the balance in the consumer account was negative or would \n     have become negative in the amount of $5,000 or more if \n     checks or other charges to the account had been paid.\n       (C) Prevention of fraud losses.--The bank has reasonable \n     cause to believe that the claim is fraudulent, based on facts \n     (other than the fact that the check in question or the \n     consumer is of a particular class) that would cause a well-\n     grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person that \n     the claim is fraudulent.\n       (3) Overdraft fees.--No bank that, in accordance with \n     paragraph (2), delays the availability of a recredit under \n     subsection (c) to any consumer account may impose any \n     overdraft fees with respect to drafts drawn by the consumer \n     on such recredited amount before the end of the 5-day period \n     beginning on the date notice of the delay in the availability \n     of such amount is sent by the bank to the consumer.\n       (e) Reversal of Recredit.--A bank may reverse a recredit to \n     a consumer account if the bank--\n       (1) determines that a substitute check for which the bank \n     recredited a consumer account under subsection (c) was in \n     fact properly charged to the consumer account; and\n       (2) notifies the consumer in accordance with subsection \n     (f)(3).\n       (f) Notice to Consumer.--\n       (1) Notice if consumer claim not valid.--If a bank \n     determines that a substitute check subject to the consumer's \n     claim was in fact properly charged to the consumer's account, \n     the bank shall send to the consumer, no later than the \n     business day following the business day on which the bank \n     makes a determination--\n       (A) the original check or a copy of the original check \n     (including an image or a substitute check) that--\n       (i) accurately represents all of the information on the \n     front and back of the original check (as of the time the \n     original check was truncated); or\n       (ii) is otherwise sufficient to determine whether or not \n     the consumer's claim is valid; and\n       (B) an explanation of the basis for the determination by \n     the bank that the substitute check was properly charged, \n     including copies of any information or documents on which the \n     bank relied in making the determination.\n       (2) Notice of recredit.--If a bank recredits a consumer \n     account under subsection (c), the bank shall send to the \n     consumer, no later than the business day following the \n     business day on which the bank makes the recredit, a notice \n     of--\n       (A) the amount of the recredit; and\n       (B) the date the recredited funds will be available for \n     withdrawal.\n       (3) Notice of reversal of recredit.--In addition to the \n     notice required under paragraph\n\n[[Page H5004]]\n\n     (1), if a bank reverses a recredited amount under subsection \n     (e), the bank shall send to the consumer, no later than the \n     business day following the business day on which the bank \n     reverses the recredit, a notice of--\n       (A) the amount of the reversal; and\n       (B) the date the recredit was reversed.\n       (4) Mode of delivery.--A notice described in this \n     subsection shall be delivered by United States mail or by any \n     other means through which the consumer has agreed to receive \n     account information.\n       (g) Other Claims Not Affected.--Providing a recredit in \n     accordance with this section shall not absolve the bank from \n     liability for a claim made under any other law, such as a \n     claim for wrongful dishonor under the Uniform Commercial \n     Code, or from liability for additional damages under section \n     5 or 9.\n       (h) Clarification Concerning Consumer Possession.--A \n     consumer who was provided a substitute check may make a claim \n     for an expedited recredit under this section with regard to a \n     transaction involving the substitute check whether or not the \n     consumer is in possession of the substitute check.\n       (i) Scope of Application.--This section shall only apply to \n     customers who are consumers.\n\n     SEC. 7. EXPEDITED RECREDIT PROCEDURES FOR BANKS.\n\n       (a) Recredit Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--A bank may make a claim against an \n     indemnifying bank for expedited recredit for which that bank \n     is indemnified if--\n       (A) the claimant bank (or a bank that the claimant bank has \n     indemnified) has received a claim for expedited recredit from \n     a consumer under section 6 with respect to a substitute check \n     or would have been subject to such a claim had the consumer's \n     account been charged;\n       (B) the claimant bank has suffered a resulting loss or is \n     obligated to recredit a consumer account under section 6 with \n     respect to such substitute check; and\n       (C) production of the original check, another substitute \n     check, or a better copy of the original check is necessary to \n     determine the validity of the charge to the customer account \n     or any warranty claim connected with such substitute check.\n       (2) 120-day period.--Any claim under paragraph (1) may be \n     submitted by the claimant bank to an indemnifying bank before \n     the end of the 120-day beginning on the date of the \n     transaction that gave rise to the claim.\n       (b) Procedures for Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--To make a claim under subsection (a) for \n     an expedited recredit relating to a substitute check, the \n     claimant bank shall send to the indemnifying bank--\n       (A) a description of--\n       (i) the claim, including an explanation of why the \n     substitute check cannot be properly charged to the consumer \n     account; or\n       (ii) the warranty claim;\n       (B) a statement that the claimant bank has suffered a loss \n     or is obligated to recredit the consumer's account under \n     section 6, together with an estimate of the amount of the \n     loss or recredit;\n       (C) the reason why production of the original check, \n     another substitute check, or a better copy of the original \n     check is necessary to determine the validity of the charge to \n     the consumer account or the warranty claim; and\n       (D) information sufficient for the indemnifying bank to \n     identify the substitute check and to investigate the claim.\n       (2) Requirements relating to copies of substitute checks.--\n     If the information submitted by a claimant bank pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) in connection with a claim for an expedited \n     recredit includes a copy of any substitute check for which \n     any such claim is made, the claimant bank shall take \n     reasonable steps to ensure that any such copy cannot be--\n       (A) mistaken for the legal equivalent of the check under \n     section 3(b); or\n       (B) sent or handled by any bank, including the indemnifying \n     bank, as a forward collection or returned check.\n       (3) Claim in writing.--An indemnifying bank may, in the \n     bank's discretion, require the claimant bank to submit in \n     writing the information required by paragraph (1), including \n     a copy of the written claim, if any, that the consumer \n     submitted in accordance with section 6(b).\n       (c) Recredit by Indemnifying Bank.--\n       (1) Prompt action required.--No later than 10 business days \n     after the business day on which an indemnifying bank receives \n     a claim under subsection (a) from a claimant bank with \n     respect to a substitute check, the indemnifying bank shall--\n       (A) provide, to the claimant bank, the original check (with \n     respect to such substitute check) or a copy of the original \n     check (including an image or a substitute check) that--\n       (i) accurately represents all of the information on the \n     front and back of the original check (as of the time the \n     original check was truncated); or\n       (ii) is otherwise sufficient to determine the bank's claim \n     is not valid; and\n       (B) recredit the claimant bank for the amount of the claim \n     up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest if \n     applicable; or\n       (C) provide information to the claimant bank as to why the \n     indemnifying bank is not obligated to comply with \n     subparagraph (A) or (B).\n       (2) Recredit does not abrogate other liabilities.--\n     Providing a recredit under this subsection to a claimant bank \n     with respect to a substitute check shall not absolve the \n     indemnifying bank from liability for claims brought under any \n     other law or from additional damages under section 5 or 9 \n     with respect to such check.\n       (3) Refund to indemnifying bank.--If a claimant bank \n     reverses, in accordance with section 6(e), a recredit \n     previously made to a consumer account under section 6(c), or \n     otherwise receives a credit or recredit with regard to such \n     substitute check, the claimant bank shall promptly refund to \n     any indemnifying bank any amount previously advanced by the \n     indemnifying bank in connection with such substitute check.\n       (d) Production of Original Check or a Sufficient Copy \n     Governed by Section 5(d).--If the indemnifying bank provides \n     the claimant bank with the original check or a copy of the \n     original check (including an image or a substitute check) \n     under subsection (c)(1)(A), section 5(d) shall govern any \n     right of the indemnifying bank to any repayment of any funds \n     the indemnifying bank has recredited to the claimant bank \n     pursuant to subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 8. DELAYS IN AN EMERGENCY.\n\n       Delay by a bank beyond the time limits prescribed or \n     permitted by this Act is excused if the delay is caused by \n     interruption of communication or computer facilities, \n     suspension of payments by another bank, war, emergency \n     conditions, failure of equipment, or other circumstances \n     beyond the control of a bank and if the bank uses such \n     diligence as the circumstances require.\n\n     SEC. 9. MEASURE OF DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in section 5, any \n     person who, in connection with a substitute check, breaches \n     any warranty under this Act or fails to comply with any \n     requirement imposed by, or regulation prescribed pursuant to, \n     this Act with respect to any other person shall be liable to \n     such person in an amount equal to the sum of--\n       (A) the lesser of--\n       (i) the amount of the loss suffered by the other person as \n     a result of the breach or failure; or\n       (ii) the amount of the substitute check; and\n       (B) interest and expenses (including costs and reasonable \n     attorney's fees and other expenses of representation) related \n     to the substitute check.\n       (2) Offset of recredits.--The amount of damages any person \n     receives under paragraph (1), if any, shall be reduced by the \n     amount, if any, that the claimant receives and retains as a \n     recredit under section 6 or 7.\n       (b) Comparative Negligence.--If a person incurs damages \n     that resulted in whole or in part from the negligence or \n     failure of that person to act in good faith, then the amount \n     of any liability due to that person under subsection (a) \n     shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of negligence or \n     bad faith attributable to that person.\n\n     SEC. 10.

Pursuant to House Resolution 256 and rule XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 1474.\n\n                              {time}  1210\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n\tAccordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 1474) to facilitate check truncation by authorizing substitute checks, to foster innovation in the check collection system without mandating receipt of checks in electronic form, and to improve the overall efficiency of the Nation's payments system, and for other purposes, with Mr. LaHood in the chair.\n\tThe Clerk read the title of the bill.\n\tThe CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered as having been read the first time.\n\tUnder the rule, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) each will control 30 minutes.\n\tThe Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus).\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).\n  (Ms. HART asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)\n\tMs. HART. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1474.\n\tA lot of people are not familiar with the legislation. We have been calling it ``check truncation.'' The official title is Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. Our truncated name is Check 21.\n\tThis legislation holds the promise of a more efficient check collection system by removing legal barriers to the full utilization of new technologies. It is a win for consumers. It is a win for the financial services industry. It will empower banks to help prevent fraud. It will empower consumers to have more control over their accounts and more efficiency in the transfer of their funds.\n\tOur current check system's legal framework has not kept up with technological advances and has constrained the efforts of many banks to use innovations like digital check imaging to improve check processing efficiency, providing improved service to customers and substantial reductions in transportation and other check processing costs.\n\tThis digital check imaging looks like a check. It simply is a copy that is transferable digitally, transferable more quickly, than a paper check. It also can be copied and utilized just like a canceled check.\n\tIt is important to implement the technological advances made in the field of payment systems so that we provide customers with expedited access to capital, to credit, yet they will be ensured that they are protected from fraud.\n\tThis legislation permits banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to truncate checks, just simply not have to transport that canceled check. It allows them to process and clear checks electronically, without moving those paper checks to clearinghouses and returning the original cancelled checks to customers.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n\tThe problem with the current system is that over and over these checks are processed, and it takes a lot of time. It requires physical delivery of the check from the institution of deposit through an intermediary, such as clearinghouses or the Federal Reserve Bank, to the bank of the customer who wrote the check before it can be paid. Each step of this inefficient process relies on the physical transportation of that check, resulting in billions of checks being driven or flown across the country every day.\n\tThe problem with this legal framework was highlighted in the days following the September 11 attacks when the Nation's planes were grounded, and the flow of checks transported by air came to a complete stop. During that time, the Federal Reserve's daily check float grew from its normal few hundred million dollars to over $47 billion.\n\tUnder current law, banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions are unable to truncate checks. They are only able to truncate checks if they have special arrangements with other institutions that are part of the transaction. There are over 15,000 banks, thrifts, and credit unions, and they are all negotiating separate agreements among themselves, so it is impossible to follow and keep in touch with all of those, even for the most diligent financial institution.\n\tThe way this bill would work, a Pennsylvania bank would no longer have to ship a check drawn on a California bank all the way across the country in order for it to clear, for it to be processed, and for the actual payment of the check. This is done by creating a new negotiable instrument called a substitute check.\n\tAgain, the substitute check would permit banks to truncate the original check; and it would process the information electronically, immediately, and print and deliver the substitute checks to banks and bank customers. So the customer who wishes to retain that record, such as a canceled check, would have something that looks just like it.\n\tThis shows exactly what that substitute check looks like. It looks familiar, does it not? It is just an identical copy of a canceled check.\n\tThis is the legal equivalent of the original check under our legislation. It would include all the information contained on the original check and the image of the front and back of the original check, as well as the machine-readable numbers which appear on the bottom of the check. And because the substitute check can be processed just like an original check, a bank would not need to invest in any new technology or otherwise change its current check processing operation, unless the bank chooses to update its technology.\n\tConsumers benefit, and this is the most important part of the legislation. Customers maintain the same protections that they have with this law as they have with their original check. Reducing processing costs will result in efficiency gains and expedited services for customers. Accessing images of checks will take a fraction of the time that it currently takes to access microfilm or the physical archives or the canceled check itself. Customers will no longer have to wait for a copy of the check to be obtained from a central processing facility or the microfilm library.\n\tInstitutions that have already implemented this check imaging technology offer their customers a wide variety of ways to access these images, including in person at branches as they would today, or through the mail but also over the Internet and in image statements and advanced ATMs. So, for the customer, this is just a wonderful boost.\n\tCustomers will also benefit from the availability of check imaging to help combat fraud and the problems associated with bad checks. The ability to access check images on the Internet helps consumers to quickly and conveniently verify their transactions. They can identify potential errors. They can detect fraudulent transactions sooner, rather than waiting until the end of the month when they receive their traditional statement. \n\tIdentifying errors and potential fraud as soon as possible helps everyone. It helps the banks minimize customer inconvenience and cost. It helps control potential losses. It helps give law enforcement an advantage in tracking down the perpetrators of fraud.\n\tPromoting this image technology can help speed processing and encourage banks to provide new and improved products and services to consumers. Financial institutions will be able to establish branches or ATMs in remote locations to further service their customers, provide more cost-effective service, provide customers with later deposit and cut-off times, and provide printed copies of checks deposited at ATMs on ATM receipts. Such changes could result in a check being credited a day earlier and interest accruing a day earlier on interest-bearing accounts. Obviously, that will make customers quite happy.\n\tIn conclusion, this is a win-win for everyone. It is a win for the industry, but it is especially a win for consumers. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1474 and significantly increase the efficiency of the Nation's check clearing process.\n\tMr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Chairman, I think this is a very good idea. It is efficient. We make sure consumers are fully protected. I agree with just about everything everybody else is going to say today.\n\tMr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner).\n\tMr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me, and I thank the sponsors for giving me an opportunity to speak.\n\tThis is clearly a bill, as the previous speaker outlined, that improves efficiency and hopefully reduces costs to banks. One thing that was not addressed in this legislation, though, is a remaining area of patent unfairness to consumers.\n\tWe all know that a check is essentially an article of faith. It is a contract between two people. From time to time, people write checks that they simply do not have the money to cover. They are penalized. They pay a fine by their bank, anywhere in the neighborhood of $15 to $25.\n\tBut what continues to be the case in this country, in many banks, in the neighborhood of about 85 percent of the big banks and about 75 percent of smaller banks, is someone who receives the check, who is already out the amount of money that they were supposed to be given, is also charged a fee, a fine. This is patently unfair. It is counterintuitive; and, frankly, it is indefensible. I think we should address this in this House.\n\tSome of the arguments that are raised to defend the idea that the person who gets the check should be fined when someone bounces a check say that there is an added cost to banks when someone bounces a check.\n\tThis is true. It is estimated that that cost is in the neighborhood of 48 to 65 cents, depending on what study we see. It is clear that someone should be penalized for that. Frankly, we can argue it is too high, but the person who wrote the check is already getting a $20-some-odd-dollar fine.\n\tAlso, there is a relationship between all banks in the system that when there is a bounced check, if the credit union has a bounced check that they have to return to CitiBank, there is a relationship there that they exchange a few dimes to make up for that cost.\n\tThe net of all of this is the banking business makes about $6.1 billion of profits, according to 1999 numbers, just on these transactions. They cover the costs, and then industry-wide they make about $6.1 billion. So the idea that the costs are not getting covered is certainly not the case.\n\tSecondly, some have argued that we need to have a disincentive for a merchant who is going to get a bad check. We have to incentivize them, checking vigorously to make sure they are getting it from a legitimate person.\n\tWell, this is the silliest argument. They already have the greatest incentive of all. If they get a bad check, they are out the money or they are out the service or they are out the product that they exchange in exchange for that. That is why we all go to our local diners and we see the checks up, notices up, ``we do not accept checks from this person,'' because they definitely do not want to get snookered a second time. So the idea that they should get a $20, a $15 or $10 fine, somehow creates a disincentive is simply not the case.\n\tA third argument made is that, well, when we are receiving a check, we should be extra vigilant. We should call up to make sure the person has the money in their account. Well, I have news, because of excellent legislation passed by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) and others, we cannot do that. We cannot receive a check for $100 and call up the bank and say, listen, I have account number 1751. Do they have $100 in their account? They cannot even exchange that information, so there is no way you as the person receiving the check can avoid that fee.\n\tSome people have said, well, the receiving banks have costs just like the issuing bank has costs. As I mentioned, those costs are already covered.\n\tThen, finally, after we cut through all of it, I have found in my one experience with this, and some industry leaders have said, do you know what, at the end of the day if you make a stink about it, we do not charge. That is not any way to run a railroad.\n\tFrankly, this fee, this fine, this penalty is indefensible. It does not penalize someone who does something wrong, it does not disincentivize activity in any way, and it does not encourage any type of activity that a person can protect.\n\tOne of the things we are doing here is making this transaction more efficient. The gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) said it in the debate on the rule, do we want to improve the efficiency here? That is the rationale. But I think we also have to restore a sense of fairness. This is one open fissure in the law that I look for opportunities to address.\n\tNow, I know that we are here under an open rule and I have the opportunity, but I would ask the gentleman from Massachusetts if perhaps there might be other opportunities to address this inequity.\n\tMr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?\n\tMr. WEINER. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The gentleman is right, we are trying in everything we have done, and I think we have accomplished that in our committee so far. The chairman has been very cooperative in promoting efficiency while protecting consumers. This bill, as I said, does do that with regard to your ability to get the check if you actually need it.\n\tThe gentleman raises a point that had not previously occurred to me that I think is a good one. I think it ought to be addressed. I would be obviously, as I have told him, very reluctant to do it now without a chance to examine it and have some hearings.\n\tWe do have pending in the process a more comprehensive bill called the Regulatory Relief Bill into which I believe this would fit. The bill passed our committee. It is being sequentially referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\tThere are some important issues there, particularly including the industrial loan corporations, where we have given assurances that we are going to try and work some compromises out. So I can guarantee to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner), who has raised this very important issue, that further work remains to be done on regulatory relief. I have spoken to the chairman of both the full committee and the subcommittee, and we agree that this is an issue worthy of consideration.\n\tI would say this, whether or not we would all ultimately agree on a solution cannot be predicted. Certainly the gentleman will, I believe, have an opportunity if not to offer it today to offer it later, and I hope then to be able to offer it with a good deal more agreement.\n\tMr. OXLEY. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?\n\tMr. WEINER. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio.\n\tMr. OXLEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Chairman.\n\tMr. Chairman, the gentleman from New York makes an excellent point. This is an issue that needs to be addressed. I think, indeed, the avenue that the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Franks) mentioned would be the most appropriate, as opposed to this check truncation bill. So I appreciate the gentleman's withholding the amendment until we have an opportunity to find out where it fits.\n\tIndeed, as the regulatory relief bill works its way through the process, the gentleman would have adequate opportunity to work his amendment in that particular venue. So I appreciate the gentleman for yielding and look forward to working with him.\n\tMr. WEINER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for those words. Perhaps in the interim we could also inform some of the small business groups and advocates, who are probably the primary victims of these fees, small businesses who are in good faith accepting these things. The larger businesses, the Wal-Marts of the world, probably say to their banks, we refuse to pay them.\n\tBut this will be an opportunity. I appreciate the gentleman's willingness to give me another bite at this apple at the appropriate time.\n\tMr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) be allowed to manage the remainder of our time on this bill.\n\tThe CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), the chairman of the full committee.\n\tMr. OXLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\tI want to particularly pay my highest regards and admiration to the gentleman from Alabama (Chairman Bachus) for working so well in a bipartisan way on this legislation; to our good friend, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart); my good friend, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), for being the lead Democrat to sponsor on this legislation; and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson).\n\tThis is a very important piece of legislation that modernizes the system. Just think about it. We are in many ways operating in kind of a Pony Express system today in moving checks around. Admittedly, instead of ponies, we do it by airplane.\n\tWe have found in our hearings, in our deliberations on this legislation, that the 4 days after 9/11/01 were 4 days in which nobody was flying. The checks were piling up. We process 42 billion checks in this economy every year, and the system was badly in need of modernization. I think that 4-day period pointed that out so well.\n\tSo this is really recognizing the technology that is out there.\n\tI had an opportunity to visit NCR headquarters in Dayton, just south of my congressional district, last year. I got an eyewitness look at the new technology that is out there that allows this bill to come to fruition. It allows us to move a step forward in the check-clearing process and at the same time making us more efficient as we proceed. That is an amazing effort that can bring about a great deal of change.\n\tSo I want to encourage my colleagues to support this legislation. It is long overdue. I again thank the leaders, particularly the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), for their leadership on this issue.\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) for his leadership, as well as the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson), and all my friends on the committee and all my friends on the Democrat side.\n\tThe rule kind of got heated and spirited over another issue that probably deserves some heat and spirit, but I think this issue here is one that should enjoy relative ease as we move forward.\n\tI thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) (for working with the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) in addressing what also is an important issue in how people's checks are cashed and how they may be penalized for someone else wronging them.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n\tThat being said, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) has walked through in pretty good detail what this bill seeks to do. In a lot of ways, Check 21 is pretty simple in what it does. It just modernizes the Nation's check payment system and tries to keep up with all the new technologies in the 21st century.\n\tThe gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) mentioned how many millions of dollars can flow across the continents and across the oceans with the click of a mouse and the challenge we faced 2 years ago after the tragedies of 9/11 and how this bill really tries to respond. I know some people suggested, my good friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), suggested earlier somehow or another this would really help to decrease oil costs. I hope we are not overstating the impact of the bill, and this will help in our fight against terrorism. Perhaps it will.\n\tBut one thing can be said, it is pro-consumer. It is pro-business in a lot of ways, not only pro-business for the banks but pro-business for those institutions who electronically transfer monies and those who depend heavily on checks.\n\tMy good friend, the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), who deserves some thanks also on our side of the aisle for working with the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), in particular raised some legitimate concerns throughout the debate about checks and whether or not these substitute checks that have now been introduced as a legal equivalent will somehow or another diminish the rights of those who rely on checks heavily, particularly seniors.\n\tPerhaps the opposite is true. Not only does this legislation not affect arrangements between banks and customers moving forward, but it will probably also allow for a cheaper, more efficient way for checks to be used. I say that because banks will actually save money on the process and will actually be able to provide a greater array of services to all of its customers, particularly those customers who may rely more on checks.\n\tThe year upwards of 60 billion checks will be written in the United States; and although, more and more people are relying on forms of electronic pavements, the Fed makes clear that checks will remain an indispensable part of our financial system.\n\tMr. Speaker, I could go on and on about the bill, but I take 30 more seconds before yielding to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney) for some comments on the bill.\n\tWe talked about check truncation, and just to be real simple about what this is, we wanted to find a way to sort of foster innovation without mandating the receipt of checks in electronic form. It is important for banks and businesses, consumers to continue to have that option of accepting checks in paper form.\n\tEssentially, what truncation is is when information on the paper check is captured off the check and delivered electronically, instead of the paper check being presented physically. Through check truncation, paper checks are rendered into zeros and one digital signals which can move through the payment system at digital speeds.\n\tCheck 21 accomplishes this by establishing this new negotiable instrument, a substitute check which has the same legal status as original checks. The substitute checks would contain the two-face image of the original check. They would include the magnetic code at the bottom so that any bank could process them using existing equipment.\n\tThey would conform to standards for size, paper stock and the like. The substitute checks can then be used by banks and consumers in the same way as original checks.\n\tI make one last comment about my friend from North Carolina (Mr. Watt). He and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Davis) both contributed heavily to this bill ending up as good as it has, largely because of concerns they raised about the language. But for the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) bringing to our attention how there might have been some ambiguity regarding coverage of the Uniform Commercial Code as it relates to certain disputes between banks, we might not have tightened the language. And but for the work of the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Davis), who will speak in a few minutes, the language regarding the recredit provision, which actually is a new protection for consumers, might not have been included.\n\tMr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Maloney).\n  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)\n\tMrs. MALONEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.\n\tMr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Check 21 legislation that will modernize the Nation's check clearing system and benefit our constituents across the country. I thank the ranking member, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), along with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley) and the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) for their hard work on this bill.\n\tThis legislation will increase electronic check presentment and lower the cost of check clearing, and it will make it easier for the payments system to proceed without breakdown in the event of another terrorist attack.\n\tToday, the technology exists to allow customers to view images of checks on their own home computers so they do not have to wait until the end of the month to get their checks. This legislation complements this technology and will spur more financial institutions to offer these services to consumers.\n\tAs a practical matter, the ability of a consumer to see an electronic imagine of a check will allow them to more easily resolve disputed checks and combat fraud. The legislation also includes important consumer provisions that will allow customers to retrieve and properly debit funds.\n\tCheck truncation legislation will help prevent another post-9/11 situation where the grounding of the Nation's airplanes prevented checks from being cleared. Currently, checks that are not truncated have to be physically flown to their paying bank. With the planes grounded, massive float built up in the payment system after the terror attack and could have threatened a widespread economic interruption had flights not resumed.\n\tNot only was this a problem after 9/11, but there is a long history of inefficiency in the transfer of checks by airplane, especially with respect to check-clearing services provided by the Federal Reserve. I have had a long interest in this issue, and I thank the sponsors of this legislation for including language in the bill that adds check transportation services to the Monetary Control Act.\n\tI have had an interest in this issue and I thank the sponsors of the legislation for including language in the bill that adds check transportation services to the Monetary Control Act.\n\tThis provision will require the Federal Reserve the disclosure of costs related to check transportation and prevent further inefficiency.\n\tThis legislation is the product of years of work by the Federal Reserve and the Financial Services Committee. It represents contributions from many Members over the course of countless hearings.\n\tI urge my colleagues to support the underlying bill.\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson), who is last year's sponsor of the bill and is an original cosponsor this year.\n\tMr. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to be here. I certainly appreciate the chairman of the subcommittee and the chairman of the full committee for their work on this, and the ranking member of the full committee and the subcommittee and certainly my friend, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart), my friend, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), for their great work in sponsoring this legislation in this Congress.\n\tI rise in support of this important legislation. It is common-sense legislation. It has garnered overwhelming support from financial institutions, from technology companies, from various trade associations, and from the Federal Reserve.\n\tThe way in which banks currently handle check transfers is totally outdated. Currently, banks are required to physically present and return original paper checks. It is a tedious process that is inefficient. It is expensive, and it is rife with potential for fraud. As a result, millions of paper checks are physically transported between banks every day. The system relies solely on uninterrupted air and ground traffic in order to ensure that checks are presented to paying banks in a timely manner.\n\tWhen the horrific events of September 11 grounded all air traffic in the United States, hundreds of millions of checks did not move and the U.S. payment system was stalled, creating a situation that severely threatened our economic security. That is why the Federal Reserve, after consulting with the banking industry, technology companies, and consumer groups, submitted a proposal to Congress that would reduce the need for physical transportation of checks through increased electronic truncation.\n\tLast Congress, I sponsored Check 21, a bill which builds on the Federal Reserves proposal and modernizes the Nation's check payments system by allowing banks to exchange checks electronically. This Congress, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania's (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from Tennessee's (Mr. Ford) legislation.\n\tCheck 21 strengthens our economic security by capitalizing on existing technology to make the collection process faster and more efficient while improving customer service, access to funds, and any fraud protections. Check 21 is simply a better, more efficient way of transferring checks that takes advantage of the technology that we have at hand.\n\tMr. Chairman, I am pleased that we were poised to pass this legislation.\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Davis), a new colleague but one who has already distinguished himself in the Congress.\n\tMr. DAVIS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding me time.\n\tThis is somewhat of a departure from the debate of the morning and from the debate that we may have this afternoon on some issues, but it is something of a welcome departure I suspect for some of us.\n\tThe way this institution works when it is at its best is we find a way to work with the best interests of the business community and we find a way to work with the best interests of the consumer community; and if we get some efficiency out of the process, well, all the better.\n\tThis legislation is a good bill. It is outstanding legislation, and I want to compliment the leadership of this committee. I want to compliment our very able colleague, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart), as well as my good friend, my very able colleague, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), as well as a number of members of this committee who have contributed to taking what was a good bill and getting it to the point that it is an excellent piece of legislation.\n\tA number of people have extolled the virtues of this bill as far as efficiencies are concerned. A number of people have extolled its virtues as far as making a system that has been something of a maze a much more comprehensible process.\n\tI want to dwell for a minute on an act of simplification that this bill creates with respect to consumers. Right now, a good many of the people who are watching this or who are part of our districts have had the experience of looking at their bank ledgers and finding out that they have been credited for something that they did not think they wrote. A lot of people regularly run into these kinds of very small issues with the banking community, and those of us who went to law school can recall the portions of our bar books that summarize the UCC and the various protections, and they have been something of an imponderable maze.\n\tThis bill improves that. The expedited recredit provision has a number of very simple but very important features.\n\tThe first one is that if it is determined that a bank has falsely credited someone's account, within 1 day of that determination the bank must recredit the account. And there is a very specific window of time that is set to resolve a dispute. If a bank has not determined that a claim is valid within 10 business days, the bank has two options: either recrediting the lesser of the amount charged or $25 with interest being recredited and any remaining amount within 45 calendar days. That is an important act of simplification. \n\tAnother important act is that if there is an invalid claim or notice of recredit, the consumer must receive it no later than the day after the bank makes the determination. Why is that maze of words important? Because a lot of banks, Mr. Chairman, have not necessarily had the clearest or best guidance from the UCC on what to do in the very simple instance someone comes into a bank and wants to straighten out their account. This bill helps.\n\tAnother instance, we had a question during the committee process about the substitute check and a number of valid questions were raised about the meaning of the substitute check. In working with our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we managed to clear up a lot of these ambiguities. It is now very clear that someone who may not have a substitute check in hand, that individual can still take advantage of the expedited recredit provisions. That is important in a world where paper sometimes gets lost in the mail.\n\tSo I will conclude, Mr. Chairman, by saying that this bill reflects what we can do when we are able to step outside of our partisan boxes and what we can do when we bring a little bit of common sense to the process. Again, I want to thank the leadership of the committee for bringing this to place.\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling).\n\tMr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act.\n\tThis bill, which modernizes check-clearing transactions, is a win-win for both consumers and financial institutions. Check 21 will result in fewer errors in check transactions while providing consumers with more choices.\n\tBecause of increased on-line access, consumers can now have more confidence when inquiring about the status of their personal checks, and they can receive a much quicker response from their bank.\n\tConsumers will further benefit by the reduced cost associated with modernization of check clearing, and Check 21 ensures that banks remain fully accountable to the consumers they serve.\n\tMr. Chairman, the act will make banking more efficient, reduce transactional cost, provide consumers with more choices, and help our financial services industry remain preeminent in the world.\n\tI want to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus) and my friends, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), for their leadership on this important legislation. I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes on H.R. 1474.\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Harris).\n\tMs. HARRIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act.\n\tEvery day banks assume enormous risks in order to create jobs and build opportunities. They have infused our economy with its lifeblood of capital and credit, while maintaining the health of our global economy's circulatory arteries. Nevertheless, banks still must cope with costly and antiquated laws and regulations that do not accurately reflect the realities, demands, and opportunities of today's cyber economy.\n\tUnder the current law that governs the check-clearing process, banks must physically transport checks to a recipient bank, unless an electronic exchange agreement is in place with that recipient bank.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n\tThis requirement is costly, time-consuming and completely unnecessary in light of the safeguards and security available through digital imaging and electronic transmission.\n\tH.R. 1474 helps us bring our banking system into the 21st century by granting full legal standing to substitute checks which can be digital images of the front and back of the original check that contain all of the information in readable form.\n\tThis bill modernizes the check collection process enabling banks to provide customers with faster and less expensive service. Moreover, H.R. 1474 retains and enhances all of the legal protections against fraud and errors that consumers enjoy under the current system while preserving the flexibility of recipient banks to process an electronically received check in the same way they would process the original.\n\tMr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this long overdue legislation which will play a critical role in preserving the health of our financial system and revitalizing our economy, and I applaud the leadership and the sponsors this bill.\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time. I will consume the shortest period of time as I possibly can, Mr. Chairman.\n\tThe gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson), who walked off the floor, deserves a lot of credit for this, and forgive me for not mentioning him more, and obviously the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart), it is her bill this go around; but the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson) brought my attention to the bill, and I thank him for that.\n\tI think all the merits of the bill have been talked about pretty extensively and maybe the more we talk we may lose what unanimous support we have. So I am not going to talk much longer other than to thank a few people.\n\tI want to thank Roger Ferguson at the Federal Reserve, the vice chair. I want to thank Ed Hill and Grant Cole at Bank of America. I want to thank Janelle Duncan with the Consumers Union, as well as the Consumer Federation of America and the United States Public Interest Research Group, for all of their hard work. As the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Davis) said, this is one bill that I think in a lot of ways can be accurately described as pro-business and pro-consumer.\n\tI want to thank Brant Imperatore with O'Conner and Hannan, and of course, the committee staff on both sides, Erika Jeffers, who is a law school classmate, and Ken Swab and Jaime Lizarraga; as well as the gentleman from Ohio's (Mr. Oxley) staff, Kevin MacMillan, Deena Ellis, Jim Clinger, Carter McDowell.\n\tThere were a number of groups outside of here, the Independent Community Bankers, America's Community Bankers, Credit Union National Association and many others, who contributed to making this final product as good as it is.\n\tI ask my colleagues to support the bill.\n\tMr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as may consume.\n\tMr. Chairman, present law requires that checks be returned to the bank where they were originally drawn, and that way of doing business has basically been the law and the procedure in this country for over 100 years. We have technology now that makes something else possible, and that is electronic transfer, as opposed to transfer of the paper check.\n\tWhat we have in our country today is an antiquated process, which is also a tedious process, which each day involves as many as 10 to 12,000 cars, trucks and airplanes returning checks when none of this is necessary.\n\tThe credit unions some 20 years ago went away from this process. They have had zero consumer complaints. The largest banks have made agreements between banks, and they have gone away from this process; but today, two-thirds of the checks still are processed in this outdated manner.\n\tWhat this House has done in a bipartisan way is take a bill that has been cosponsored by two of our most able Members, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford), very aware of this issue, very knowledgeable on the issue, they have drafted this bill. The committee has looked at the bill. We have made changes to protect the consumer, slight changes. The bill as it exists today has been endorsed by the Federal Reserve, all the regulators, all the financial institutions involved, all the trade groups, consumer groups. It is a model for what this House can do when it puts aside its differences and works together for the good of the Nation as a whole.\n\tThis bill is good for customers. This bill is good for consumers. This bill is good for the economy.\n\tWe have talked about little things such as airport congestion, how this will help address that, congestion on the roadway, our energy dependence.\n\tI want to commend, in closing, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), who has made this one of his three goals for this year to move this legislation; the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Frank), the ranking member, who identified this as necessary legislation.\n\tMy colleagues may say, well, this ought to be simple. For 20 years we tried to reform our check-clearing process. We have not been able to do it until this moment. This House today I think will take a historic step in making us more competitive in the world economy by bringing our check-clearing system up to a model for the world.\n\tMr. Chairman, I commend the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) and the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield?\n\tMr. BACHUS. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Chairman, before the gentleman yields back, Jim Worth, I forgot to mention him, the legislative counsel. I thank him as well.\n\tMr. BACHUS. That is absolutely true. Our staff worked together very closely and in a very bipartisan spirit.\n\tMr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act. I commend Representatives Melissa Hart and Harold Ford for introducing the legislation and for tenaciously working to ensure the legislation came to the House floor today.\n\tI also want to thank Chairman Oxley, Chairman Bachus, Ranking Member Frank and Ranking Member Sanders for bringing this legislation to the floor today.\n\tH.R. 1474 will modernize the nation's check payment system by allowing, but not mandating, banks to exchange checks electronically. Recognizing that not all banks have the ability to accept electronic transmission of a check, H.R. 1474 authorizes the creation of substitute checks for payment.\n\tThis substitute check would be used in place of the original paper check, and it would be a negotiable instrument. Banks that create an electronic check will be able to create a substitute check and use that for presentment to a bank that has not upgraded its system to accept electronic checks.\n\tThis legislation capitalizes on existing technology to make the current process faster and more efficient, while increasing customer service, improving access to funds and increasing antifraud measures that ensure our economic security. H.R. 1474 will decrease our check payment system's financial dependence on physically transporting checks, thus avoiding any types of delays or paralysis in the U.S. payment system that might be created by another September 11th terrorist attack.\n\tI believe that the Committee successfully crafted very difficult and complicated recredit provisions in the legislation that address the concerns of consumer groups.\n\tThis legislation is a well-crafted bill that will provide the structure for an efficient financial payments framework to enable financial institutions to provide better customer service. I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\tMr. OXLEY. Mr. Chairman. I wanted to take this opportunity to thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his assistance in bringing this important measure to the floor. I am inserting for the Record an exchange of correspondence regarding his committee's jurisdiction over the measure.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.\n     Hon. Michael Oxley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Oxley: In recognition of the desire to \n     expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1474, the ``Check \n     Clearing for the 21st Century Act,'' the Committee on the \n     Judiciary hereby waives consideration of the bill. Certain \n     provisions of the bill relating to the litigation of claims \n     relating to check clearing fall within the Committee on the \n     Judiciary's Rule X jurisdiction. However, given the need to \n     expedite this legislation, I will not seek a sequential \n     referral based on their inclusion.\n       The Committee on the Judiciary takes this action with the \n     understanding that the Committee's jurisdiction over these \n     provisions is in no way diminished or altered. I would \n     appreciate your including this letter in your committee \n     report on H.R. 1474 and in the Congressional Record during \n     consideration of H.R. 1474 on the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                              Committee on Financial Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 22, 2003.\n     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: Thank you for your letter \n     regarding your Committee's jurisdictional interest in H.R. \n     1474, the Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act.\n       I acknowledge your committee's jurisdictional interest in \n     this legislation and appreciate your cooperation in moving \n     the bill to the House floor expeditiously. I agree that your \n     decision to forego further action on the bill will not \n     prejudice the Committee on the Judiciary with respect to its \n     jurisdictional prerogatives on this or similar legislation. I \n     will include a copy of your letter and this response in the \n     Committee's report on the bill and the Congressional Record \n     when the legislation is considered by the House.\n       Thank you again for your assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael G. Oxley,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\tThe CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired.\n\tPursuant to the rule, the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute printed in the bill shall be considered by sections as an original bill for the purpose of amendment, and each section is considered read.\n\tDuring consideration of the bill for amendment, the Chair may accord priority in recognition to a Member offering an amendment that he has printed in the designated place in the Congressional Record. Those amendments will be considered read.\n\tThe Clerk will designate section 1.\n\tThe text of section 1 is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Check \n     Clearing for the 21st Century Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) In the Expedited Funds Availability Act, enacted on \n     August 10, 1987, the Congress directed the Board of Governors \n     of the Federal Reserve System to consider establishing \n     regulations requiring Federal reserve banks and depository \n     institutions to provide for check truncation, in order to \n     improve the check processing system.\n       (2) In that same Act, the Congress--\n       (A) provided the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System with full authority to regulate all aspects of the \n     payment system, including the receipt, payment, collection, \n     and clearing of checks, and related functions of the payment \n     system pertaining to checks; and\n       (B) directed that the exercise of such authority by the \n     Board superseded any State law, including the Uniform \n     Commercial Code, as in effect in any State.\n       (3) Check truncation is no less desirable today for both \n     financial service customers and the financial services \n     industry, to reduce costs, improve efficiency in check \n     collections, and expedite funds availability for customers \n     than it was over 15 years ago when Congress first directed \n     the Board to consider establishing such a process.\n       (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To facilitate check truncation by authorizing \n     substitute checks.\n       (2) To foster innovation in the check collection system \n     without mandating receipt of checks in electronic form.\n       (3) To improve the overall efficiency of the Nation's \n     payments system.\n\n\tThe CHAIRMAN. Are there any amendments to section 1?\n\n\n                  amendment no. 1 offered by ms. hart\n\n\tMs. HART. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.\n\tThe CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n\tThe text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 1 offered by Ms. Hart:\n       In section 1, insert ``or the `Check 21 Act' '' before the \n     period at the end.\n\n\tMs. HART. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is actually very brief. It is one line. It is very simple; and it is, as far as I can tell, completely noncontroversial.\n\tThe amendment simply adds another name to this legislation to the title of the bill. It will be, by this amendment, also referred to as the Check 21 Act. Everyone who has been familiar with this bill has commonly referred to it as Check-21, and this amendment simply brings clarity to that issue.\n\tI would urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\tAlso, I would like to add to the thanks for the cooperation on a bipartisan basis for the bill itself as well. I would like to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Oxley), the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), the ranking member as well, and also my fellow sponsors, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Ferguson).\n\tEveryone's cooperated well and explained this issue; but those who have not been mentioned today, those in the private sector who will be affected by this legislation have also been extremely supportive and very cooperative in working out differences that they had during the process of moving this legislation forward, and I wish to recognize them as well. When we as the sponsors had asked them to sit down and iron some issues out, they did so and they did so very efficiently.\n\tMr. Chairman, I simply offer my amendment and ask for its approval, very simply adding the name Check 21 Act.\n\tThe CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member wish to speak on this amendment?\n\tThe question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Hart).\n\tThe amendment was agreed to.\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute be printed in the Record and open to amendment at any point.\n\tThe CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alabama?\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tThe text of the remainder of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows:\n\n     SEC. 2.

or\n       (B) the date the substitute check is made available to the \n     consumer.\n       (3) Extension under extenuating circumstances.--If the \n     consumer's ability to submit the claim within the 30-day \n     period under paragraph (2) is delayed due to extenuating \n     circumstances, including extended travel or the illness of \n     the consumer, the 30-day period shall be extended for a total \n     not to exceed 30 additional days.\n       (b) Procedures for Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--To make a claim for an expedited recredit \n     under subsection (a) with respect to a substitute check, the \n     consumer shall provide to the bank that holds the account of \n     such consumer--\n       (A) a description of the claim, including an explanation \n     of--\n       (i) why the substitute check was not properly charged to \n     the consumer's account; or\n       (ii) the warranty claim with respect to such check;\n       (B) a statement that the consumer suffered a loss and an \n     estimate of the amount of the loss;\n       (C) the reason why production of the original check or a \n     better copy of the original check is necessary to determine \n     the validity of the charge to the consumer's account or the \n     warranty claim; and\n       (D) sufficient information to identify the substitute check \n     and to investigate the claim.\n       (2) Claim in writing.--The bank holding the consumer \n     account that is the subject of a claim by the consumer under \n     subsection (a) may, in the discretion of the bank, require \n     the consumer to submit the information required under \n     paragraph (1) in writing.\n       (c) Recredit to Consumer.--\n       (1) Conditions for recredit.--The bank shall recredit a \n     consumer account in accordance with paragraph (2) for the \n     amount of a substitute check that was charged against the \n     consumer account if--\n       (A) a consumer submits a claim to the bank with respect to \n     that substitute check that meets the requirement of \n     subsection (b); and\n       (B) the bank has not provided to the consumer the original \n     check, a substitute check, or a copy of the original check \n     and demonstrates that the substitute check was properly \n     charged to the consumer's account.\n       (2) Timing of recredit.--\n       (A) In general.--The bank shall recredit the consumer's \n     account for the amount described in paragraph (1) no later \n     than the end of the business day following the business day \n     on which the bank determines the consumer's claim is valid.\n       (B) Recredit pending investigation.--If the bank has not \n     yet determined that the consumer's claim is valid before the \n     end of the 10th business day after the business day on which \n     the consumer submitted the claim, the bank shall recredit the \n     consumer's account for--\n       (i) the lesser of the amount of the substitute check that \n     was charged against the consumer account, or $2,500, together \n     with interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, \n     no later than the end of such 10th business day; and\n       (ii) the remaining amount of the substitute check that was \n     charged against the consumer account, if any, together with \n     interest if the account is an interest-bearing account, not \n     later than the 45th calendar day following the business day \n     on which the consumer submits the claim.\n       (d) Availability of Recredit.--\n       (1) Next business day availability.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (2), a bank that provides a recredit to a consumer \n     account under subsection (c) shall make the recredited funds \n     available for withdrawal by the consumer by the start of the \n     next business day after the business day on which the bank \n     recredits the consumer's account under subsection (c).\n       (2) Safeguard exceptions.--A bank may delay availability to \n     a consumer of a recredit provided under subsection \n     (c)(2)(B)(i) until the start of either the business day \n     following the business day on which the bank determines that \n     the consumer's claim is valid or the 45th calendar day \n     following the business day on which the consumer submits a \n     claim for such recredit in accordance with subsection (b), \n     whichever is earlier, in any of the following circumstances:\n       (A) New accounts.--The claim is made during the 30-day \n     period beginning on the business day the consumer account was \n     established.\n       (B) Repeated overdrafts.--Without regard to the charge that \n     is the subject of the claim for which the recredit was made--\n       (i) on 6 or more business days during the 6-month period \n     ending on the date on which the consumer submits the claim, \n     the balance in the consumer account was negative or would \n     have become negative if checks or other charges to the \n     account had been paid; or\n       (ii) on 2 or more business days during such 6-month period, \n     the balance in the consumer account was negative or would \n     have become negative in the amount of $5,000 or more if \n     checks or other charges to the account had been paid.\n       (C) Prevention of fraud losses.--The bank has reasonable \n     cause to believe that the claim is fraudulent, based on facts \n     (other than the fact that the check in question or the \n     consumer is of a particular class) that would cause a well-\n     grounded belief in the mind of a reasonable person that \n     the claim is fraudulent.\n       (3) Overdraft fees.--No bank that, in accordance with \n     paragraph (2), delays the availability of a recredit under \n     subsection (c) to any consumer account may impose any \n     overdraft fees with respect to drafts drawn by the consumer \n     on such recredited amount before the end of the 5-day period \n     beginning on the date notice of the delay in the availability \n     of such amount is sent by the bank to the consumer.\n       (e) Reversal of Recredit.--A bank may reverse a recredit to \n     a consumer account if the bank--\n       (1) determines that a substitute check for which the bank \n     recredited a consumer account under subsection (c) was in \n     fact properly charged to the consumer account; and\n       (2) notifies the consumer in accordance with subsection \n     (f)(3).\n       (f) Notice to Consumer.--\n       (1) Notice if consumer claim not valid.--If a bank \n     determines that a substitute check subject to the consumer's \n     claim was in fact properly charged to the consumer's account, \n     the bank shall send to the consumer, no later than the \n     business day following the business day on which the bank \n     makes a determination--\n       (A) the original check or a copy of the original check \n     (including an image or a substitute check) that--\n       (i) accurately represents all of the information on the \n     front and back of the original check (as of the time the \n     original check was truncated); or\n       (ii) is otherwise sufficient to determine whether or not \n     the consumer's claim is valid; and\n       (B) an explanation of the basis for the determination by \n     the bank that the substitute check was properly charged, \n     including copies of any information or documents on which the \n     bank relied in making the determination.\n       (2) Notice of recredit.--If a bank recredits a consumer \n     account under subsection (c), the bank shall send to the \n     consumer, no later than the business day following the \n     business day on which the bank makes the recredit, a notice \n     of--\n       (A) the amount of the recredit; and\n       (B) the date the recredited funds will be available for \n     withdrawal.\n       (3) Notice of reversal of recredit.--In addition to the \n     notice required under paragraph \n     (1), if a bank reverses a recredited amount under subsection \n     (e), the bank shall send to the consumer, no later than the \n     business day following the business day on which the bank \n     reverses the recredit, a notice of--\n       (A) the amount of the reversal; and\n       (B) the date the recredit was reversed.\n       (4) Mode of delivery.--A notice described in this \n     subsection shall be delivered by United States mail or by any \n     other means through which the consumer has agreed to receive \n     account information.\n       (g) Other Claims Not Affected.--Providing a recredit in \n     accordance with this section shall not absolve the bank from \n     liability for a claim made under any other law, such as a \n     claim for wrongful dishonor under the Uniform Commercial \n     Code, or from liability for additional damages under section \n     5 or 9.\n       (h) Clarification Concerning Consumer Possession.--A \n     consumer who was provided a substitute check may make a claim \n     for an expedited recredit under this section with regard to a \n     transaction involving the substitute check whether or not the \n     consumer is in possession of the substitute check.\n       (i) Scope of Application.--This section shall only apply to \n     customers who are consumers.\n\n     SEC. 7. EXPEDITED RECREDIT PROCEDURES FOR BANKS.\n\n       (a) Recredit Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--A bank may make a claim against an \n     indemnifying bank for expedited recredit for which that bank \n     is indemnified if--\n       (A) the claimant bank (or a bank that the claimant bank has \n     indemnified) has received a claim for expedited recredit from \n     a consumer under section 6 with respect to a substitute check \n     or would have been subject to such a claim had the consumer's \n     account been charged;\n       (B) the claimant bank has suffered a resulting loss or is \n     obligated to recredit a consumer account under section 6 with \n     respect to such substitute check; and\n       (C) production of the original check, another substitute \n     check, or a better copy of the original check is necessary to \n     determine the validity of the charge to the customer account \n     or any warranty claim connected with such substitute check.\n       (2) 120-day period.--Any claim under paragraph (1) may be \n     submitted by the claimant bank to an indemnifying bank before \n     the end of the 120-day beginning on the date of the \n     transaction that gave rise to the claim.\n       (b) Procedures for Claims.--\n       (1) In general.--To make a claim under subsection (a) for \n     an expedited recredit relating to a substitute check, the \n     claimant bank shall send to the indemnifying bank--\n       (A) a description of--\n       (i) the claim, including an explanation of why the \n     substitute check cannot be properly charged to the consumer \n     account; or\n       (ii) the warranty claim;\n       (B) a statement that the claimant bank has suffered a loss \n     or is obligated to recredit the consumer's account under \n     section 6, together with an estimate of the amount of the \n     loss or recredit;\n       (C) the reason why production of the original check, \n     another substitute check, or a better copy of the original \n     check is necessary to determine the validity of the charge to \n     the consumer account or the warranty claim; and\n       (D) information sufficient for the indemnifying bank to \n     identify the substitute check and to investigate the claim.\n       (2) Requirements relating to copies of substitute checks.--\n     If the information submitted by a claimant bank pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) in connection with a claim for an expedited \n     recredit includes a copy of any substitute check for which \n     any such claim is made, the claimant bank shall take \n     reasonable steps to ensure that any such copy cannot be--\n       (A) mistaken for the legal equivalent of the check under \n     section 3(b); or\n       (B) sent or handled by any bank, including the indemnifying \n     bank, as a forward collection or returned check.\n       (3) Claim in writing.--An indemnifying bank may, in the \n     bank's discretion, require the claimant bank to submit in \n     writing the information required by paragraph (1), including \n     a copy of the written claim, if any, that the consumer \n     submitted in accordance with section 6(b).\n       (c) Recredit by Indemnifying Bank.--\n       (1) Prompt action required.--No later than 10 business days \n     after the business day on which an indemnifying bank receives \n     a claim under subsection (a) from a claimant bank with \n     respect to a substitute check, the indemnifying bank shall--\n       (A) provide, to the claimant bank, the original check (with \n     respect to such substitute check) or a copy of the original \n     check (including an image or a substitute check) that--\n       (i) accurately represents all of the information on the \n     front and back of the original check (as of the time the \n     original check was truncated); or\n       (ii) is otherwise sufficient to determine the bank's claim \n     is not valid; and\n       (B) recredit the claimant bank for the amount of the claim \n     up to the amount of the substitute check, plus interest if \n     applicable; or\n       (C) provide information to the claimant bank as to why the \n     indemnifying bank is not obligated to comply with \n     subparagraph (A) or (B).\n       (2) Recredit does not abrogate other liabilities.--\n     Providing a recredit under this subsection to a claimant bank \n     with respect to a substitute check shall not absolve the \n     indemnifying bank from liability for claims brought under any \n     other law or from additional damages under section 5 or 9 \n     with respect to such check.\n       (3) Refund to indemnifying bank.--If a claimant bank \n     reverses, in accordance with section 6(e), a recredit \n     previously made to a consumer account under section 6(c), or \n     otherwise receives a credit or recredit with regard to such \n     substitute check, the claimant bank shall promptly refund to \n     any indemnifying bank any amount previously advanced by the \n     indemnifying bank in connection with such substitute check.\n       (d) Production of Original Check or a Sufficient Copy \n     Governed by Section 5(d).--If the indemnifying bank provides \n     the claimant bank with the original check or a copy of the \n     original check (including an image or a substitute check) \n     under subsection (c)(1)(A), section 5(d) shall govern any \n     right of the indemnifying bank to any repayment of any funds \n     the indemnifying bank has recredited to the claimant bank \n     pursuant to subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 8. DELAYS IN AN EMERGENCY.\n\n       Delay by a bank beyond the time limits prescribed or \n     permitted by this Act is excused if the delay is caused by \n     interruption of communication or computer facilities, \n     suspension of payments by another bank, war, emergency \n     conditions, failure of equipment, or other circumstances \n     beyond the control of a bank and if the bank uses such \n     diligence as the circumstances require.\n\n     SEC. 9. MEASURE OF DAMAGES.\n\n       (a) Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in section 5, any \n     person who, in connection with a substitute check, breaches \n     any warranty under this Act or fails to comply with any \n     requirement imposed by, or regulation prescribed pursuant to, \n     this Act with respect to any other person shall be liable to \n     such person in an amount equal to the sum of--\n       (A) the lesser of--\n       (i) the amount of the loss suffered by the other person as \n     a result of the breach or failure; or\n       (ii) the amount of the substitute check; and\n       (B) interest and expenses (including costs and reasonable \n     attorney's fees and other expenses of representation) related \n     to the substitute check.\n       (2) Offset of recredits.--The amount of damages any person \n     receives under paragraph (1), if any, shall be reduced by the \n     amount, if any, that the claimant receives and retains as a \n     recredit under section 6 or 7.\n       (b) Comparative Negligence.--If a person incurs damages \n     that resulted in whole or in part from the negligence or \n     failure of that person to act in good faith, then the amount \n     of any liability due to that person under subsection (a) \n     shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of negligence or \n     bad faith attributable to that person.\n\n     SEC. 10. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS AND NOTICE OF CLAIM.\n\n       (a) Actions Under This Act.--\n       (1) In general.--An action to enforce a claim under this \n     Act may be brought in any United States district court, or in \n     any other court of competent jurisdiction, before the end of \n     the 1-year period beginning on the date the cause of action \n     accrues.\n       (2) Accrual.--A cause of action accrues as of the date the \n     injured party first learns, or by which such person \n     reasonably should have learned, of the facts and \n     circumstances giving rise to the cause of action.\n       (b) Discharge of Claims.--Except as provided in subsection \n     (c), unless a person gives notice of a claim to the \n     indemnifying or warranting bank within 30 days after the \n     person has reason to know of the claim and the identity of \n     the indemnifying or warranting bank, the indemnifying or \n     warranting bank is discharged to the extent of any loss \n     caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.\n       (c) Notice of Claim by Consumer.--A timely claim by a \n     consumer under section 6 for expedited recredit constitutes \n     timely notice of a claim by the consumer for purposes of \n     subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 11. CONSUMER AWARENESS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Each bank shall provide, in accordance \n     with subsection (b), a brief notice about substitute checks \n     that describes--\n       (1) the process of check substitution and how the process \n     may be different than the check clearing process with which \n     the consumer may be familiar; and\n       (2) a description of the consumer recredit rights \n     established under section 6 when a consumer believes in good \n     faith that a substitute check was not properly charged to the \n     consumer's account.\n       (b) Distribution.--\n       (1) Existing customers.--With respect to consumers that are \n     customers of a bank on the effective date of this Act, a bank \n     shall provide the notice described in subsection (a) to each \n     such consumer no later than the first regularly scheduled \n     communication with the consumer after the effective date of \n     this Act.\n       (2) New account holders.--A bank shall provide the notice \n     described in subsection (a) to each consumer, other than \n     existing customers referred to in paragraph (1), at the time \n     at which the customer relationship is initiated.\n       (3) Mode of delivery.--A bank may send the notices required \n     by this subsection by United States mail or by any other \n     means through which the consumer has agreed to receive \n     account information.\n       (c) Model Language.--\n       (1) In general.--No later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Board shall publish model forms \n     and clauses that a depository institution may use to describe \n     each of the elements required by subsection (a).\n       (2) Safe harbor.--A bank shall be treated as being in \n     compliance with the requirements of subsection (a) if the \n     bank's substitute check notice uses a model form or clause \n     published by the Board and such model form or clause \n     accurately describes the bank's policies and practices. A \n     bank may delete any information in the model form or clause \n     that is not required by this Act or rearrange the format.\n       (3) Use of model language not required.--This section shall \n     not be construed as requiring any bank to use a model form or \n     clause that the Board prepares under this subsection.\n\n     SEC. 12.

Are there any further amendments?\n\tThe question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended.\n\tThe amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to.\n\tThe CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n\tAccordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Aderholt) having assumed the chair, Mr. LaHood, Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 1474) to facilitate check truncation by authorizing substitute checks, to foster innovation in the check collection system without mandating receipt of checks in electronic form, and to improve the overall efficiency of the Nation's payments system, and for other purposes, pursuant to House Resolution 256, he reported the bill back to the House with an amendment adopted by the Committee of the Whole.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is ordered.\n\tIs a separate vote demanded on the amendment to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute adopted by the Committee of the Whole? If not, the question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n\tThe committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n\tThe bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was read the third time.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill.\n\tThe question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.\n\tMr. BACHUS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore.

Res. 190) to \nestablish a joint committee to review House and Senate rules, joint \nrules, and other matters assuring continuing representation and \ncongressional operations for the American people, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.\n  The text of H. Con. Res. 190 is as follows:\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 190\n\n       Whereas the Government must be able to function during \n     emergencies in a manner that gives confidence and security to \n     the American people; and\n       Whereas the Government must ensure the continuation of \n     congressional operations, including procedures for replacing \n     Members, in the aftermath of a catastrophic attack: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That (a) there is hereby established a joint \n     committee composed of 20 members as follows:\n       (1) 10 Members of the House of Representatives as follows: \n     5 from the majority party to be appointed by the Speaker of \n     the House, including the chairman of the Committee on Rules, \n     who shall serve as co-chairman, and 5 from the minority party \n     to be appointed by the Speaker of the House (after \n     consultation with the Minority Leader); and\n       (2) 10 Members of the Senate as follows: 5 from the \n     majority party, including the chairman of the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration, who shall serve as co-chairman, and \n     5 from the minority party, to be appointed by the Majority \n     Leader of the Senate (after consultation with the Minority \n     Leader).\n\n     A vacancy in the joint committee shall not affect the power \n     of the remaining members to execute the functions of the \n     joint committee, and shall be filled in the same manner as \n     the original selection.\n       (b)(1) The joint committee shall make a full study and \n     review of the procedures which should be adopted by the House \n     of Representatives, the Senate, and the Congress for the \n     purpose of (A) ensuring the continuity and authority of \n     Congress during times of crisis, (B) improving congressional \n     procedures necessary for the enactment of measures affecting \n     homeland security during times of crisis, and (C) enhancing \n     the ability of each chamber to cooperate effectively with the \n     other body on major and consequential issues related to \n     homeland security.\n       (2) No recommendation shall be made by the joint committee \n     except upon the majority vote of the members from each House, \n     respectively.\n       (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, \n     any recommendation with respect to the rules and procedures \n     of one House that only affects matters related solely to that \n     House may only be made and voted on by members of the joint \n     committee from that House and, upon its adoption by a \n     majority of such members, shall be considered to have been \n     adopted by the full committee as a recommendation of the \n     joint committee.\n       (4) The joint committee shall submit to the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and to the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate an interim report not later than January 31, 2004, and \n     a final report not later than May 31, 2004, of the results of \n     such study and review.\n       (c) The joint committee shall cease to exist no later than \n     May 31, 2004.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Pursuant to the order of the \nHouse of Wednesday, June 4, 2003, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nDreier) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) each will control 30 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier).\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to Speaker \nHastert for his leadership on this very important issue of the \ncontinuity of the Congress.\n  H. Con. Res. 190 creates a joint committee of the House and Senate \nfor systematic review of what congressional procedures, coordination, \ndevices and leadership are necessary to handle a time of national \ncrisis. Today, Mr. Speaker, we act to assure the American people that \nthere will be continuing representation and congressional operations in \nthe face of any catastrophe.\n  For a number of months, I have been considering the continuity of \nCongress, homeland security, and what measures we need to have in place \nto make sure that this institution functions in a time of crisis. I am \npleased today to bring before the House a measure which has been \nsponsored by all 13 members of the Committee on Rules, Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. Speaker, only on a few occasions in the past have we acted to \nestablish bicameral, bipartisan panels to review the structure and the \nfunctioning of this institution. The last time we did so was a decade \nago, back in 1993, and I was privileged to be a cochairman of\n\n[[Page H5006]]\n\nwhat was called the 1993 Joint Committee on the Organization of \nCongress.\n  Now, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our \nperception of national priorities clearly has gone through dramatic \nchanges. Congress's initial response to the act of terrorism included \nestablishing the Department of Homeland Security, our Select Committee \non Homeland Security; H. Con. Res. 1, which established the opportunity \nfor the Speaker to have an alternative place and designation for us to \nmeet; the task force that was put into place, led by the ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Rules, the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Frost), and my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox); \nand, obviously, within the Committee on Appropriations, the \nSubcommittee on Homeland Security.\n  Let me take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to praise the work of my friends, \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Cox), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nFrost), and the other Members who contributed to the thinking that went \ninto the continuity of Congress issue as well as the security of this \ninstitution. I also want to extend my congratulations to the Continuity \nof Government Commission on their work. But I do believe, Mr. Speaker, \nthat more needs to be done, and we need to take a close look at all of \nthose things that have been proposed from a wide range of different \nsources.\n  The Presidency has been transferred in critical situations on \nnumerous occasions: war, assassination, and impeachment. But only two \nor three times in our Nation's history have emergencies tested the \nability of the United States Congress to conduct its business under \nextreme circumstances. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Congress should \nundertake a thorough review of House and Senate rules, joint rules, and \nother related matters to ensure the functioning of Congress in the \nevent of any catastrophe.\n  Mr. Speaker, the two Chambers, of course, do have formal and informal \ndevices to bring Representatives and Senators together. We, of course, \nhave conference committees, we have bicameral leadership meetings, but \nthese mechanisms for bicameral organization are typically on an ad hoc \nbasis and they address the legislative and political dynamics of \nquestions that are out there. We have no formal structure in place to \njointly address how we would deal with things in the case of an \nemergency.\n  Passage of H. Con. Res. 190 would inaugurate a special joint \ncommittee study of the ways we can ensure that the structures, \nprocedures and lines of communication between the two Chambers are \neffectively organized and coordinated so that the legislative branch \ncan fulfill its very important constitutional duties during times of \ncrisis. Specifically, the concurrent resolution establishes a committee \nof 20 Members, equally divided by Chamber and party. The Speaker and \nthe Senate majority leader would appoint the cochairman of the joint \ncommittee as well as the other Members after consultation with the \nrespective minority leaders. The joint committee is to issue an interim \nreport by January 31 of 2004 and a final report by May 31 of 2004, \nroughly a year from now.\n  Among the specific topics the joint committee could consider are \ncontinuity of Congress and joint processes and procedures for \nconsideration of homeland security legislation during times of national \ncrisis. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not wedded to any particular issue. If I \nam selected to serve on the joint committee, I want to hear from other \nchairmen and Members about their ideas, including what are we going to \nbe legislating on during a crisis, what do we need to have in place \nprocedurally to deal with this, do we have the proper funding \nmechanisms in place, and how can we address special elections in order \nto assure a quorum.\n  I would like to take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to address the proposals \nof a constitutional amendment that are out there. I want to say that we \nhad an interesting exchange yesterday in the Subcommittee on Technology \nand the House of the Committee on Rules, chaired by the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Linder), in which we discussed this. I know there are some \npeople who have come out strongly in favor of amending the \nConstitution. I am one who is very hesitant to move in the direction of \nan amendment to the Constitution. I will say that while I keep an open \nmind, I have yet to be convinced that that is the right thing to do. \nBut I will listen and, clearly, be open to arguments that are there. I \ndo think it is only fair for me to let it be known that I do have \nstrong feelings about that issue myself.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do believe that it is time for us to step forward and \ntake this action. It has been nearly 2 years since September 11 of \n2001. We have had a lot of input and a lot of recommendations. We just \nhad yesterday the report come forward from this commission. We \nobviously will expend time and energy looking at that. So I think that \nthis, as the greatest deliberative body known to man, is now poised to \ndeliberate over these very, very serious, important questions that are \nover our heads regarding the question of our governance during times of \ncrisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. FROST asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 190 creates a bipartisan and \nbicameral committee to study what new rules, laws, regulations, or \nconstitutional remedies might be needed to assure the continuity of the \nCongress in the event of a catastrophic event. This resolution moves \nforward the discussions that began in the wake of the September 11, \n2001, terrorist attacks on this country. On that day, what had been \nunthinkable happened. On that day, amidst the carnage in New York, at \nthe Pentagon, and in a field in Pennsylvania, the whole notion that \nthis country is immune from terrorist attacks was destroyed in a matter \nof minutes.\n  One of the potential targets of the terrorists that day was this \nbuilding, the seat of our government and the greatest symbol of our \ndemocracy. Had those enemies of democracy succeeded, our representative \ndemocracy might have been thrown into chaos if a large number of \nMembers of the House of Representatives had been killed, injured, or \notherwise incapacitated. The simple fact is that the framers provided \nonly for direct election of House Members, and there is nothing in law \nthat would facilitate speedy replacement of Members of the House in the \neventuality of a catastrophic event.\n  September 11 provided a rude awakening in so many ways, but it is the \nduty of this body to find a remedy for the aftermath of a potential \nattack on this institution. This is a weighty matter, one that goes to \nthe heart of representative democracy in this country. On the one hand, \nwe want to ensure the stability of the legislative branch in the wake \nof such an attack. On the other hand, we should all understand the \nimportance of preserving the unique character of membership in the \nHouse of Representatives, foundations that have not changed since the \nadoption of the Constitution over 214 years ago.\n  In the last Congress, I cochaired, with the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Cox), a bipartisan working group which began serious discussions \non what remedies might be available to the House in the event that a \nlarge number of Members were missing, killed, injured, or incapacitated \nfollowing an attack on this building or any other location where a \ngroup of Members might be gathered. We had serious and thoughtful \ndiscussions that resulted in three simple rules changes that would aid \nthe Speaker in convening this body in the event of a catastrophic \nevent. Those rules changes were made part of the rules of the House \nlast January.\n  But it is very important that every Member understand that we cannot \nembark on these further discussions without an open mind on the issue \nof whether or not a constitutional amendment is necessary in order to \nallow this body to continue to function in the event that many, most, \nor all of us are killed or missing or incapacitated. The Continuity of \nGovernment Commission, cochaired by Lloyd Cutler and former Senator \nAlan Simpson, yesterday released their report and in it recommended the \nadoption of a constitutional amendment that would allow the Congress to \nprovide for these\n\n[[Page H5007]]\n\neventualities by statute or other means.\n  We have to understand the simple fact that the framers intended for \nthis body to be the arm of the Federal Government closest to the \npeople. For that reason, this body is the only body that requires \ndirect election of all of its Members. As we all know, it takes a \nnumber of months to conduct elections; and if this body has lost large \nnumbers of Members, I believe it is essential that the American public \nhave confidence that every part of its government is up to the task of \nresponding to a national emergency.\n  Let me state this in the strongest possible terms. It would be a \ncolossal waste of the time of the Congress if Members of this new joint \ncommittee go into this process with a closed mind on the issue of a \nconstitutional amendment authorizing appointment or replacement of \nMembers in time of crisis. We must have every option on the table; and \nwe have to be willing, both on the joint committee and in this body, to \nexplore the issues, pose the questions, and find the answers. For the \nsake of the country and for the sake of the stability of the people's \nHouse, we must all be willing to undertake this task. Our work last \nyear was a positive first step; but we have a solemn responsibility to \nmake sure that every option is considered, and it is important that the \nHouse work with the Senate to ensure that the entire Congress have a \nplan to respond to a national emergency.\n  I want to commend Chairman Cox for his work on this issue in the \n107th Congress and thank my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nDreier), for bringing the issue to the fore this year. This is a matter \nof such importance and such gravity that we must all devote \nconsiderable energies to it. We must be open, we must be nonpartisan, \nand we must always have in mind that this democracy is resilient, \nresponsible, and ready to meet every challenge. So must we be.\n  I want to read from the resolution one section which underscores the \nbipartisan nature of this undertaking. This is section (b)(2), \nappearing on page 3: ``No recommendation shall be made by the joint \ncommittee except upon the majority vote of the members from each House, \nrespectively.''\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, what does that mean? Well, there are five \nRepublicans from the House and five Democrats from the House on this \njoint committee; five Republicans from the Senate and five Democrats \nfrom the Senate. So that the five Republicans, acting on their own, \ncannot make any recommendations in the House; and the five Democrats, \nacting on their own, cannot make any recommendations. Each party has a \nveto. And, quite frankly, that is exactly the way it should be, that \nonly upon agreement of a majority of the 10 Members from the House and \na majority of the 10 Members from the Senate will we be able to \nrecommend anything back to this body.\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FROST. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I would \njust like to say that again we looked at this modeling it after the \nJoint Committee on the Organization of Congress from 1993; and I want \nto congratulate the now minority, then majority, for in fact putting \ninto place a structure whereby we would in fact ensure that in moving \nahead it must be done in a bipartisan way.\n  These issues that we are going to be addressing, Mr. Speaker, are of \nsuch gravity that it is important that just as we are here to get total \nagreement today with the establishment of this joint committee, that as \nwe come forward with our recommendations that we in the same way have \nthe kind of bipartisan agreement that will be necessary.\n  Mr. FROST. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, this is different from \nthe way we normally operate in the House of Representatives. Normally, \na simple majority, which can be constituted entirely on the majority's \nside, on the Republican side, could prevail on any issue. We are \nchoosing to adopt a different set of rules for this proceeding, and \nthat is exactly the way we should be handling this matter to guarantee \nthat one party will not be able to dictate the outcome on matters of \nthis magnitude.\n  I want to thank the majority party for agreeing to that and for \nmoving forward with this very important resolution. This is a matter \nthat I personally have spent a lot of my time on over the last year, \nbut it would not be possible to move forward at this point had the \nmajority party not been willing to do so. And I thank them on behalf of \nthe minority, and I thank them on behalf of the country for their \nwillingness to do this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to \nexpress my appreciation to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nFrost), for his very kind and supportive words on this important issue \nas we proceed with this very weighty matter. As I mentioned in my \nopening remarks, we yesterday held a hearing of the Subcommittee on \nTechnology and the House, chaired very ably by our friend, the \ngentleman from Atlanta, Georgia (Mr. Linder).\n  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Linder).\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Concurrent \nResolution 190 to establish a joint committee to review House and \nSenate rules, joint rules, and any additional issues of importance \npertaining to the continuity and security of congressional operations. \nThe Rules Subcommittee held a hearing yesterday to hear testimony from \nthe chairman of the Committee on Rules and our ranking minority member, \nthe sponsors of this proposed joint committee. It is a serious \nproposal. It is timely, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) \nand the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) deserve great credit for their \nleadership on this issue.\n  We are considering this kind of procedural proposal here today \nbecause any review of our parliamentary rules and procedures must now \nbe evaluated in a post-September 11 atmosphere that incorporated once \nimplausible circumstances into how the legislative branch will operate. \nFollowing the horrendous acts of terrorism perpetrated on the American \npeople on September 11, our Nation realized it had entered into a new \nera in which liberty and freedom would be under attack from a new kind \nof enemy. Those of us representing the American people in this Chamber \nalso rededicated ourselves to meet our obligation to act for the \nprotection of our citizens and the institutions that govern them.\n  As a result, it is imperative that the Federal Government be in the \nmost effective position to protect the American public, and the most \nvisible sign of our Nation meeting this obligation has revealed itself \nin our efforts to find and eliminate enemies at home and abroad. It is \nalso our obligation to ensure that the continuity of our \nrepresentational government continues.\n  The House took action on the opening day of this Congress to \nimplement some appropriate institutional mechanisms in case of an \nemergency. In light of the critical nature of the considerable \nresponsibilities of the United States Congress, the time is right to \ncontinue to reevaluate our procedural requirements that affect the \nmanner in which our legislative duties will be conducted in the House \nand Senate in an emergency.\n  Mr. Speaker, the mission of this joint committee will be to undertake \na comprehensive review of House and Senate procedures, one, to ensure \nthe continuity and authority of Congress during times of crisis; two, \nto improve congressional procedures necessary for the enactment of \nmeasures affecting homeland security during times of crisis; and, \nthree, to enhance the ability of each Chamber to cooperative \neffectively with the other body on major and consequential issues \nrelated to homeland security.\n  By passing this concurrent resolution today, we put the wheels in \nmotion for an internal assessment to help ensure the continuity and \nsecurity of congressional operations. This represents a serious step in \nthe right direction for modernizing congressional procedures, elevating \nparliamentary preparedness, and having the House and Senate think about \nwhat needs to be done to ensure\n\n[[Page H5008]]\n\nthe legislative's branch continued viability in the face of any \nemergency situation.\n  I thank the House leadership for recognizing the importance of these \nsecurity and continuity of operations matters and for swiftly advancing \nthis proposal to the House floor. I urge unanimous support for this \nbipartisan proposal.\n  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, people viewing this may be curious as to why it is \nnecessary that we consider this matter, other than the obvious that the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) and I have stated.\n  Under the current precedents and under the current judicial \ninterpretation of the precedents of the House, a quorum is a majority \nof those sworn and living. If we only have five Members survive, three \nMembers would be a quorum, and business could be conducted. The \ndifficulty of that would be whether the country would have any \nconfidence in legislation enacted by only five Members.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nBaird).\n  Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his \nleadership on this issue and also the leadership of the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Dreier), the chairman of the Committee on Rules.\n  What we are about here is about as serious as it gets. We are \ncontemplating the possibility that everyone in this building and most \nof the Federal Government officials in this city would be killed. It is \nnot pleasant to contemplate, but I view it as a sign of the strength of \nthis great democratic Republic that we are able to contemplate it \nbecause what we are saying is this: We are proud to have been elected \nand serve in this great body, but there is something bigger than us as \nindividuals. There is an institution that we love and hold dear called \nthe House of Representatives that assures the people of our States and \nour districts that they will have a voice in the Federal Government as \nit deliberates the most weighty matters that come before this Nation.\n  Should we all be killed and not have a mechanism to replace this \ninstitution, we would leave this great Nation, indeed the world, \nwithout the system that has served us so well, the system of checks and \nbalances to ensure that a self-appointed executive would not emerge \nwith no checks and balances, to ensure that an unelected Cabinet member \ncould not exercise extra constitutional powers without the checks of a \nrepresentative body. That is what we are about.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) has done an outstanding job, \nalong with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) on the working group. \nNorm Ornstein is certainly to be credited, as is Tom Mann for the gift \nthey gave this body yesterday with the Commission on Continuity. But we \nhave important work to do. It is now almost 2 years since September 11 \nhappened. We just lack a few months from that tragic date. In this \ntime, we have the opportunity to ensure the continuity of this great \nbody. I hope we will act on that.\n  The entire Constitution was written over the course of a few months \nby very wise individuals who got together and, as this select committee \nwill do, set aside partisan differences. There were no parties at the \ntime. They simply said: What is good for this country? What will help \npreserve our liberties? How can we establish a system that will learn \nfrom the mistakes of the past and persevere through the challenges of \nthe future?\n  We have met new challenges, and we understand now we must adapt the \nways we do business. This committee will help us learn to do that and \nwill establish the procedures we need to move forward. I commend the \ntwo leaders for setting this up.\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Paul).\n  (Mr. PAUL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express a few concerns that I have \nregarding both the commission and the trend toward a constitutional \namendment that might solve some of the problems that people anticipate.\n  I certainly agree with the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) that \nthis is a very serious issue; and this is to me not just a casual \nappointment of a commission, but we are dealing with something that is, \nin a constitutional sense, rather profound because we are talking about \namendments that are suggesting that our governors will appoint Members \nof Congress for the first time in our history. That should be done with \na great deal of caution and clear understanding of what we are doing.\n  My concern, of course, with the commission is that we are moving \nrather rapidly in that direction. Hopefully, that is not the case. We \nhad the commission report of the Continuity of Government Commission \nyesterday, and that was released, and then we had a unanimous consent \nagreement to bring this up, like we need to do this in a hurry.\n  Ordinarily, if we deal with constitutional amendments, quite \nfrequently we will have a constitutional amendment proposed, and then \nwe will hold hearings on that particular amendment. I think we could \nhandle it that way.\n  But I have another concern about the urgent need and the assumption \nthat the world ends if we are not here for a few days. There are times \nwhen we are not here like in August and a few months we take off at \nChristmas. Of course, we can be recalled, but the world does not end \nbecause we're not here. In a way this need for a constitutional \namendment to appoint congressmen is assuming that life cannot go on \nwithout us writing laws.\n  I would suggest that maybe the urgency is not quite as much as one \nthinks. I want to quote Michael Barone who was trying to justify a \nconstitutional amendment that allows governors to appoint moc in a time \nof crisis. He said, ``think of all the emergency legislation that \nCongress passed in the weeks and months after September 11 authorizing \nexpanded police powers. None of this could have happened''. But now as \nwe look back at those emergency conditions, a lot of questions are \nbeing asked about the PATRIOT Act and the attack on our fourth \namendment and civil liberties. I suggest there could be a slower \napproach no harm will come of it.\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. PAUL. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I appreciate the concerns that the gentleman has raised. Let me first \nsay that I was very pleased, and my colleagues on the Committee on \nRules will recall this, as we proceeded with implementation of the \nPATRIOT Act I insisted that we have a sunset clause so that this \ninstitution would be required to take another look at the ramifications \nof the PATRIOT Act, and I know that there are wide-ranging concerns \nthat have been raised.\n  Second, on the issue of the constitutional amendment, I have stated \nthat I am very concerned about the prospect of moving ahead with a \nconstitutional amendment which would take this institution from being \nthe body of the people to becoming, as the other body was designed in \nthe Constitution, to be the body of the States, and make this the body \nof the States again which I believe would make it the case if we were \nto have governors appoint Members of the House of Representatives.\n  I think this joint committee is designed to look at these concerns, \nlook at the issues out there. We have all talked about the gravity of \nit. We know it is a very, very serious matter. I will assure my friend \nthere is no way this committee, if it were to come forward with a \nproposed constitutional amendment, would act without going through the \nprocess of having the Committee on the Judiciary look at the prospect \nof amending the Constitution, and we in the Committee on Rules would \naddress it again, and of course it would have to go through the \nconfirmation process.\n  Mr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say I am pleased to hear what \nthe gentleman has said, because there are some who see this just from \nthe outside, seeing what we are doing here today as nothing more than a \ncontinuity of what was done yesterday. The gentleman from California \n(Mr.\n\n[[Page H5009]]\n\nDreier) suggests he does not see it that way, and that gives me some \nreassurance, and I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear to people who may be watching or \nlistening to this again why we are discussing this. There is a \nhistorical aberration in our Constitution that provides that senators, \nwhen they die or are killed, may be appointed, replacement Senators, \nbut there is no comparable provision for replacement of House Members. \nThat historical aberration arises from the fact that when our \nConstitution was first passed all Senators were appointed. They were \nappointed by their State legislatures. It was only much later in our \nhistory that we went to the direct election of Senators.\n  When we did that, we retained the appointment power for the governors \nof States to replace Senators who die or are killed while in office. No \nsuch power was ever in the Constitution originally for the House of \nRepresentatives, so we have a different situation currently as it \napplies to the Senate and as it applies to the House.\n  Those of us who advocate a change in our Constitution are taking the \nposition that, since the Senate is already covered, since there already \nis a way to replace Senators in our Constitution, there should be a \ncomparable provision for being able to replace House Members in the \nevent of a mass tragedy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island \n(Mr. Langevin).\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to echo the concerns of \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) and his desire and his belief that \nwe need to have an alternative mechanism for appointing Members to the \nHouse in the event of a major catastrophe.\n  I would also like to thank and commend the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Cox) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) for their \noutstanding leadership on this issue. It is a very difficult and in \nmany ways unpleasant subject to be dealing with but one that is very \nnecessary and could mean the survivability of this Republic in the \nevent of a catastrophe.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Cox-Frost working group in the 107th \nCongress, I urged my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 190 so Congress \nmay continue to operate in the aftermath of a catastrophe that kills or \nincapacitates a large number of its Members. I also thank the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Dreier) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) \nand the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) for their leadership on \nthis very important issue.\n  The Constitution declares that Members of the House must be popularly \nelected. However, the specter of terrorism, notably reports that the \nCapitol was an intended target on September 11, as well as the \nsubsequent anthrax attacks, remind us that mass casualties in \nWashington or elsewhere are a real possibility and could have a \ndetrimental effect on the House's ability to fulfill its duties.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  While the Cox-Frost group made some significant progress in resolving \nthese complicated problems in the last Congress, many questions still \nremain. For example, I have been working with the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Ney), the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), and the gentleman \nfrom Connecticut (Mr. Larson) to address the communications needs of \nMembers in emergency conditions. Yesterday, the Continuity of \nGovernment Commission issued its first report with recommendations for \npreserving Congress' ability to function in the wake of a terrorist \nattack. It is Congress' responsibility to consider those \nrecommendations and develop a strategy to ensure that the people's \nbusiness will not be interrupted. Today's resolution will help us reach \nthat goal. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 6 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Cox), who very ably led, along with the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost), the effort to deal with the \ncontinuity of Congress in the 107th Congress.\n  Mr. COX. I want to thank the Speaker, thank the chairman, and thank \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost).\n  Mr. Speaker, when in May 2002 the Speaker asked us, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Frost) and me, to cochair this working group, there was \nnot a Department of Homeland Security, there was not a House committee \nto oversee the Department of Homeland Security; but now that I have \nassumed that responsibility, I can say that I feel there is no issue \nmore integral to homeland security than the preservation and proper \nfunctioning of our democratic institutions in time of national \nemergency. I am very pleased that the next step that this body, and \nindeed the other body, is taking this process is to institutionalize \nthrough a bicameral group that will be chaired on this side by the \nleaders of our Committee on Rules to take a further look at these \nseemingly, in some cases, intractable problems and to solve them.\n  We have in our working group accomplished a great deal and with the \nleadership of the Committee on Rules placed before this House at the \nbeginning of this Congress three changes to our rules that address \ncontinuity issues that were solved in the working group. In addition, \nthe gentleman from Texas and I yesterday introduced legislation to deal \nwith the problems in the Presidential succession law created by these \ncatastrophic circumstances that we are now forced to imagine.\n  When we go back to those horrible images of September 11 which are \nhard to purge from our memory, those video images we have all seen \ncountless times of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, imagine \nthis Capitol if the same images were seen here. Imagine what would be \nthe result, what would be the effect. Not only would Members have been \nkilled if Flight 93, which we now believe was headed for the Capitol, \nhad succeeded in its mission but Members would have been maimed and \ndisabled. The problems that arise under our rules and our laws are not \njust those of how do you fill a vacancy after someone dies, but what \nhappens when that person has not died but is incapable of coming to \nthis Chamber and being part of a quorum? What happens when that occurs \n100 times over? These are the kinds of problems that lack any immediate \nsolution and that therefore must be handed off to this more permanent \nbody that we are establishing by this resolution.\n  I want quickly to commend the other members of the working group for \ntheir yearlong effort. They include, of course, cochairman Martin \nFrost; chairman of the House Committee on Rules, David Dreier, who is \nleading us on the floor today and will lead this effort henceforth; \nchairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Steve Chabot; \nranking member on the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Jerrold \nNadler; chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney; \nchairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Steny Hoyer; chairman of the \nHouse Republican Policy Subcommittee on Redesigning Government, David \nVitter; Representative Brian Baird from whom we have just heard; \nRepresentative Sheila Jackson-Lee; Representative James Langevin, who \nis also with us here today on the floor.\n  Ex officio members of the working group who were enormously important \nto our efforts included the House Parliamentarian, Charles Johnson; the \nDeputy House Parliamentarian, John Sullivan; former Clerk of the House, \nDonn Anderson; House legislative counsel Pope Barrow; House general \ncounsel Michael Stern; and Congressional Research Service senior \nspecialist Walter Olesczek. From May to October of 2002, the working \ngroup held eight very long meetings, hearing testimony from law \nprofessors, constitutional scholars, members of the academic community, \nthink tank scholars and other experts. The working group considered, in \norder, changes to the House rules, because they are the least \nintrusive, most efficient means of solving these problems; next, \nstatutory solutions; and only lastly constitutional amendments.\n  I want to say with respect to this question of a constitutional \namendment because already during this debate we have heard concerns \nraised about willy-nilly amending the Constitution or about overstating \nthe problems when Congress is, for example, out of town during the \nAugust recess with regularity, it was unfortunately necessary for us in \nthis working\n\n[[Page H5010]]\n\ngroup to imagine some circumstances that we hope never arise when not \nonly the whole House but the President and the Vice President also were \nlost. In that circumstance, there are significant questions of \nlegitimacy of both the institutions of the executive and the \nlegislative, but also even more trenchant concerns about the withdrawal \nof the checks and balances that undergird our system and protect our \ncivil liberties.\n  If we imagine what America would be like after such a horrible attack \nthat killed the President, killed the Vice President, killed the \nSpeaker of the House, killed hundreds of Members of this Congress, \nfirst we would have as President, this much would be certain, someone \nwho was unelected, someone who perhaps no one had ever heard of before, \nand someone who might or might not be fit for the job. That person \nwould be vested with the immediate responsibility of presumably \ndetermining whether to declare war, responsibility under article 1 of \nthis body which would not be able to function. That person also would \nbe asked to seek emergency appropriations to deal with this problem. \nYet there would be no Congress. And that person might want to suspend \nhabeas corpus and other civil liberties because of the emergency, and \nthere might be no legislative check against it. These are the \ncounterweight to the arguments that we should not rush into amending \nthe Constitution. These are the problems that the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Dreier) is properly taking up with the other body, and \nI hope they are soon solved.\n  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman).\n  (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I commend the authors of this resolution \nbecause they recognize how important it is to protect our \nconstitutional government, even from the possibility that perhaps \nhundreds of Members of this Congress might be killed by a terrorist \nact. We should, however, also take a look at the possibility that the \ndeath of one, two, or three individuals in line to serve as President \ncould also undermine our constitutional government. We must protect \nboth branches of government from unfortunate acts or terrorist \naggression. That is why I strongly support this resolution and wish to \nbring to the attention of my colleagues a letter that I sent out last \nweek urging them to become cosponsors of the Presidential Succession \nAct of 2003.\n  The line of Presidential succession determines who becomes President \nif both the President and Vice President have died or are unable to \nfulfill their duties. That line should be as solid as the concrete \nbarriers that protect our Capitol grounds. Unfortunately, that line is \nnot. However, with a mere change in statute, not a constitutional \namendment, Congress can ensure the certainty in the line of succession \nas well as the continuity of the Federal policies of the executive \nbranch.\n  Article 2, section 1 of the Constitution allows Congress to determine \nthe line of succession to the Presidency following the Vice President. \nCongress last seriously addressed this issue when it passed the \nPresidential Succession Act of 1947. Unfortunately, the 1947 act is \nambiguous and we cannot afford ambiguity as to the identity or the \nlegitimacy of the President of the United States, particularly at a \ntime of crisis. The 1947 act is further flawed because it allows the \nPresidency to be shifted from one political party to the other during a \n4-year term. This means that if the Vice Presidency is vacant, our \nstock markets and our foreign enemies will wonder whether some \nunfortunate event will cause a radical shift of our policies. A \nterrorist might see an opportunity to radically shift our policies by \nkilling just one individual. And a partially or temporarily impaired \nPresident would be highly unlikely to either take a leave of absence \nunder the 25th amendment or to resign permanently if that action would \nvest control of the executive branch in the opposite political party.\n  Current law provides that if the office of Vice President is vacant, \nthe next in line is the Speaker of the House, followed by the President \npro tempore of the Senate. In the recent season finale of the ``West \nWing,'' the President was under extreme personal stress. There was no \nVice President serving. That President invoked the 25th amendment and \ntemporarily transferred control of the executive branch to the Speaker \nof the House who happened to be of the opposite political party. Would \nthat happen in real life? I would hope so, because I would hope that a \nPresident under extreme stress would take a leave of absence as \nprovided in the 25th amendment. But in real life, a President arguably \nsuffering from temporary impairment would hang on to the Presidency \nwith the same tenacity that my friend Strom Thurmond held on to his \nSenate seat when he knew that if he resigned from the Senate he would \nbe replaced by the appointee of a Democratic Governor.\n  Speaking of my friend Strom Thurmond, we should remember that just a \nfew years ago, while Strom was in his late 90s, he was third in line to \nsucceed to the Presidency. Does this make sense in an era of suicide \nassassins? In a document that I will append in the Record to my remarks \nhere, I will point out that under some scenarios, we could have five \nindividuals, each with a legitimate claim to be President. I will \nsummarize it by simply saying that if we did not have a Speaker of the \nHouse, someone could claim to become President because they were \nserving as temporary Speaker under House rule I, clause 8, subprovision \n(3)(A). Someone who became Speaker of the House could then try to \ndisplace someone who had been temporary Speaker, and then we could have \na President pro tem of the Senate all claiming. We could have even more \nscenarios.\n  Some will say that Presidential succession has never gotten past a \nVice President, but that happened because Gerald Ford was confirmed \npromptly, before Richard Nixon resigned. Furthermore, in April 1865, \nJohn Wilkes Booth headed a partially successful conspiracy to \nassassinate President Lincoln and those who were first, second and \nthird in line to succeed him. Are we sure that al Qaeda can do no \nworse?\n  That is why I will put forward the Presidential Succession Act of \n2003, which is similar to legislation I proposed in March 2001. Under \nit, the President would file a document with the Clerk of this House \nindicating whether third to succeed to the Presidency should be either \nthe Speaker of the House or the minority leader and whether the fourth \nshould be the Senate majority leader or the Senate minority leader. \nAnd, of course, these could be changed if control of the House or the \nSenate changed. More importantly, the bill would state that once \nsomeone becomes President, they serve for the rest of the 4-year term \nand cannot be pushed aside by someone who later becomes, say, Speaker \nof the House and is higher in the list. Once they begin to serve a \nPresidential term, they continue.\n  Today we will act to ensure the continuity of Congress. Later this \nyear we should act to ensure the continuity of the executive branch. \nOur friends and enemies around the world and the investment community \nshould know that similar policies will continue throughout a 4-year \nterm and that the Presidency cannot be shifted to another party by a \ntragic event. More importantly, it should be absolutely clear as to who \nis legitimate President of the United States. We need to act this year.\n\n                   [From the Roll Call, May 21, 2003]\n\n           Act Now To Ensure Smooth Succession to Presidency\n\n                         (By Rep. Brad Sherman)\n\n       In the post-Sept. 11, 2001, reality, we have seen military \n     guards with M-16s patrol the Capitol and anti-aircraft \n     artillery stationed around national monuments. It is no \n     mystery that terrorists actively seek to interrupt our \n     constitutional democracy.\n       The line of presidential succession, which determines who \n     becomes president if both the president and vice president \n     have died or are otherwise unable to carry out their duties, \n     should be as solid as the concrete barriers lining the \n     Capitol grounds. It is not. However, with a change in \n     statute--not a constitutional amendment--Congress can ensure \n     certainty in the line of successors, as well as continuity of \n     federal policies.\n       Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution allows Congress \n     to determine the line of succession to the presidency \n     following the vice president. Congress last visited this \n     issue seriously when it passed the Presidential Succession \n     Act of 1947. Unfortunately, the 1947\n\n[[Page H5011]]\n\n     act us ambiguous and we cannot afford ambiguity as to the \n     identity and legitimacy of the president, particularly at a \n     time of crisis.\n       The 1974 act is further flawed because it allows the \n     presidency to be shifted to an opposing political party. This \n     means if the vice presidency is vacant, our stock markets and \n     foreign enemies will wonder whether an unfortunate event will \n     result in a radical shift in policies; a terrorist might see \n     an ``opportunity'' to radically shift our policies; and a \n     partially or temporarily impaired president would think twice \n     about taking a leave of absence under the 25th Amendment, or \n     resigning, if either action would out the other party in \n     control of all executive departments. Finally, third in the \n     current line of successions is the President Pro Tem, a \n     ceremonial position normally held by the longest-serving \n     member of the Senate majority.\n       Current law provides that if the office of the vice \n     president is vacant, the next in line is the Speaker, \n     followed by the President Pro Tem. The recent ``West Wing'' \n     season final demonstrated how a president, under extreme \n     duress could, at a time when there was no vice president, \n     invoke the 25th Amendment and temporarily transfer control of \n     the White House to a Speaker of the opposite political party. \n     In real life, it is more likely that a president arguably \n     suffering from temporary impairment would hang on to the \n     presidency with the same tenacity that former Sen. Strom \n     Thurmond (R-S.C.) held on to his seat at a time when his \n     resignation would have handed his seat to an appointee of a \n     Democratic governor.\n       Speaking of Thurmond, we should remember that just a few \n     years ago, while in his late 90s, he was third in line for \n     the presidency. Does this make sense in an era of suicide-\n     assassins?\n       Here is a hypothetical designed to illustrate all the \n     ambiguities of the 1947 act. The office of vice president, \n     Speaker and President Pro Tem are all vacant. The president \n     has nominated Ms. Smith to the new vice president, and he \n     awaits her confirmation hearings under the 25th Amendment. \n     The House and the Senate have adjourned for the year, though \n     Mr. Jones is serving as ``temporary House Speaker'' pursuant \n     to House rule 1, clause 8 (3)(A). Now, imagine that the \n     president dies.\n       Does Mr. Jones, the temporary Speaker, become president? \n     Probably not, but we're not sure. In all probability, the \n     secretary of State becomes acting president. But assume the \n     House then reconvenes and elects a Speaker. Does that new \n     Speaker then push aside the secretary of State and become the \n     new president? What if the Senate elects a new President Pro \n     Tem before the House elects a new Speaker? And what if Ms. \n     Smith makes it through her vice presidential confirmation \n     hearings--does she push aside whoever is then serving as \n     president? Under this scenario, and under the ambiguity of \n     the 1947 act, all five of the following could claim the \n     presidency: Ms. Smith, Mr. Jones, the President Pro Tem, the \n     newly elected Speaker and the secretary of State. Other, less \n     contrived scenarios could create three or four claimants to \n     the presidency. Even two plausible claimants to the White \n     House is one too many.\n       Some will say that presidential succession has never gotten \n     past a vice president, in part because Gerald Ford was \n     confirmed promptly, before Richard Nixon resigned. But Sept. \n     11 shows that what is unlikely to occur naturally may well \n     occur. In April 1865, John Wilkes Booth headed a partially \n     successful conspiracy to assassinate President Abraham \n     Lincoln and those who stood first, second and third in line \n     to succeed him. Are we sure that al Qaeda can do no worse?\n       Next month, I will introduce the Presidential Succession \n     Act of 2003, which is similar to legislation I introduced in \n     March 2001. Under this legislation, the president will file \n     an official document with the Clerk of the House designating, \n     after the vice president, the next person in line of \n     succession as either the Speaker or the House Minority \n     Leader. Similarly, the president would file instructions with \n     the Secretary of the Senate, designating the third in line as \n     either the Senate Majority Leader or Minority Leader. (These \n     designations can be revised if the majority becomes the \n     minority.) The bill will further ensure certainty in \n     presidential succession by clearly providing that if someone \n     succeeds to the presidency, that person shall continue to \n     serve until the end of the presidential term.\n       Our friends and enemies around the world, as well as the \n     investment community, should know that similar policies will \n     continue throughout a four-year term, and that the presidency \n     will not be shifted to the other party by a tragic event. \n     More importantly, the law should be absolutely clear so that \n     whoever serves as president, particularly at a time of \n     crisis, has unquestioned legitimacy. By acting now we can \n     accomplish these ends. Or, we can just put this off until a \n     problem arises.\n\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Metairie, Louisiana (Mr. Vitter), who worked very hard \non the commission and was very actively involved in it.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. \nDreier), the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox), and the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Frost) for all of their work on this issue; and that \nwork, of course, must continue.\n  I rise in strong support of this resolution. I was honored and \nprivileged to work on the working group with the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Cox) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) and so \nmany others.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  I think that working group did some very valuable work, laid an \nimportant foundation, and in fact suggested and helped make very real \nand important and fundamental changes in both our rules and some \nstatutes. We are continuing that work I believe today, and in the very \nnear future the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) will put into the \nhopper another bill aimed at changing statutes to again fine tune some \nof these issues with regard to presidential succession and related \nmatters. I am happy to coauthor that bill, and that is further \nprogress.\n  But just as clearly as we have met and gained consensus on some \nissues and made important progress, big questions remain; and clearly \nthe biggest question which I believe must be tackled more adequately is \nthe possibility of mass deaths among House Members and how our \ndemocratic institution of the House, our most democratic institution, \nwould continue to function under that circumstance of national \nemergency. So that is why I think this resolution and the new joint \nwork between the House and the Senate led by the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Chairman Dreier) and others is so very important.\n  I also want to join in the concerns that the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Paul) raised. They are very legitimate concerns that I and many \nother people hold, but clearly there are ways to address those \nconcerns. Clearly, this new group is not headed in any specific \ndirection that the rules addressing those concerns adequately deal \nwith.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work on this issue with \nothers.\n  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to respond to one of the issues raised on the \nother side, and that is the question of the adequacy of replacing \nMembers of the House through special elections.\n  Special elections, of course, are determined by State law; and the \nlaws vary from State to State. Some State laws have special elections \nheld rather promptly. Other States have special elections that extend \nover a long period of time.\n  For example, in my home State of Texas, our former colleague, Mr. \nCombest, shortly after the convening of this Congress, announced that \nhe was resigning, was leaving, and his successor, who was chosen in a \nspecial election under Texas law which included a runoff, was sworn in \ntoday, 6 months into the Congress. So there is a difficulty in citing \nthe remedy of special elections as a way of replacing Members in a \nprompt way.\n  I am very sympathetic to the historical precedent that Members of the \nHouse up until this point can only serve by election, but there are \nextraordinary circumstances. We hope the extraordinary circumstances \nnever occur, but we do need to be ready, should anything like that ever \nhappen.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, this resolution is a very significant \ndevelopment. Again, I want to thank the majority for the way this is \nstructured, for having the sides evenly divided, for requiring a \nmajority vote in each House of the members on this joint committee, and \nI would urge that the Congress, that the House, promptly pass this \nresolution. I would hope that the Senate, the other body, would do the \nsame thing, so the work of this joint committee could begin as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think that we have seen from today's debate that this \nis an extraordinarily serious matter. This coming September 11 will \nmark the second anniversary of one of the most tragic days in our \nNation's history. We all know of the terrible loss of life and we know \nof the threat that existed on that date to this institution, this \nbuilding, which, as we all know, is a symbol not only to Americans but \naround the world of freedom and democracy.\n\n[[Page H5012]]\n\n  For that reason, after this nearly 2-year window of time when we have \ntaken a lot of action in response to September 11, it is important for \nus to now step back and, in a deliberative manner, to very thoughtfully \nlook at the ways in which we can assure that we proceed with fair and \nbalanced representation to maintain a continuity of our Nation's \ngovernance. I believe that we have in this resolution which will \nestablish this joint committee an opportunity to, in a bicameral way, \nlook at this very important question.\n  As I said earlier, exactly 10 years ago, in 1993, I was privileged to \nbe a cochairman of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, \nwhich looked at a lot of the institutional questions that both bodies \nface. Now we will, in the wake of this very, very serious challenge \nthat we face, have the opportunity to look at those questions which \ncontinue.\n  Obviously, it is important for us to recognize the disparity that \nexists between the two bodies. The other body is one which has \ndifferent constituencies than ours, obviously different terms of office \nand, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) has pointed out, different \nways for succession.\n  This institution is known as the People's House. We are the only \nfederally elected officials who must be elected to have the opportunity \nto serve in our positions. I feel it is very important for us to \nmaintain that status, as James Madison envisaged it over two centuries \nago; and I believe that, at the same time, we can, in working with our \ncolleagues in the other body, proceed with a very fair, bipartisan \nprocess, which will allow us to address this.\n  It is obvious, Mr. Speaker, from having listened to the debate which \nwill simply put into place this joint committee, that there is \ndisagreement. But I believe that as we take the input that has been \nprovided by a wide range of individuals, academics, former colleagues, \npeople who spent a lot of time thinking about this, who will be \nproviding us with recommendations, I am convinced that the work of this \njoint committee will be among the most important things that this 108th \nCongress will be able to address.\n  Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge adoption of this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Pursuant to the order of the \nHouse of Wednesday, June 4, 2003, the concurrent resolution is \nconsidered read for amendment and the previous question is ordered.\n  The question is on the concurrent resolution.\n  The concurrent resolution was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ESTABLISHING JOINT COMMITTEE TO REVIEW HOUSE AND SENATE MATTERS ASSURING CONTINUING REPRESENTATION AND CONGRESSIONAL OPERATIONS FOR THE \n                            AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to the order of the House yesterday, I call up the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 190) to establish a joint committee to review House and Senate rules, joint rules, and other matters assuring continuing representation and congressional operations for the American people, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\tThe Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.\n\tThe text of H. Con. Res. 190 is as follows:\n\n                            H. Con. Res. 190\n\n       Whereas the Government must be able to function during \n     emergencies in a manner that gives confidence and security to \n     the American people; and\n       Whereas the Government must ensure the continuation of \n     congressional operations, including procedures for replacing \n     Members, in the aftermath of a catastrophic attack: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That (a) there is hereby established a joint \n     committee composed of 20 members as follows:\n       (1) 10 Members of the House of Representatives as follows: \n     5 from the majority party to be appointed by the Speaker of \n     the House, including the chairman of the Committee on Rules, \n     who shall serve as co-chairman, and 5 from the minority party \n     to be appointed by the Speaker of the House (after \n     consultation with the Minority Leader); and\n       (2) 10 Members of the Senate as follows: 5 from the \n     majority party, including the chairman of the Committee on \n     Rules and Administration, who shall serve as co-chairman, and \n     5 from the minority party, to be appointed by the Majority \n     Leader of the Senate (after consultation with the Minority \n     Leader).\n\n     A vacancy in the joint committee shall not affect the power \n     of the remaining members to execute the functions of the \n     joint committee, and shall be filled in the same manner as \n     the original selection.\n       (b)(1) The joint committee shall make a full study and \n     review of the procedures which should be adopted by the House \n     of Representatives, the Senate, and the Congress for the \n     purpose of (A) ensuring the continuity and authority of \n     Congress during times of crisis, (B) improving congressional \n     procedures necessary for the enactment of measures affecting \n     homeland security during times of crisis, and (C) enhancing \n     the ability of each chamber to cooperate effectively with the \n     other body on major and consequential issues related to \n     homeland security.\n       (2) No recommendation shall be made by the joint committee \n     except upon the majority vote of the members from each House, \n     respectively.\n       (3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, \n     any recommendation with respect to the rules and procedures \n     of one House that only affects matters related solely to that \n     House may only be made and voted on by members of the joint \n     committee from that House and, upon its adoption by a \n     majority of such members, shall be considered to have been \n     adopted by the full committee as a recommendation of the \n     joint committee.\n       (4) The joint committee shall submit to the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives and to the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate an interim report not later than January 31, 2004, and \n     a final report not later than May 31, 2004, of the results of \n     such study and review.\n       (c) The joint committee shall cease to exist no later than \n     May 31, 2004.\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Pursuant to the order of the House of Wednesday, June 4, 2003, the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) each will control 30 minutes.\n\tThe Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier).\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, let me begin by expressing my appreciation to Speaker Hastert for his leadership on this very important issue of the continuity of the Congress.\n\tH. Con. Res. 190 creates a joint committee of the House and Senate for systematic review of what congressional procedures, coordination, devices and leadership are necessary to handle a time of national crisis. Today, Mr. Speaker, we act to assure the American people that there will be continuing representation and congressional operations in the face of any catastrophe.\n\tFor a number of months, I have been considering the continuity of Congress, homeland security, and what measures we need to have in place to make sure that this institution functions in a time of crisis. I am pleased today to bring before the House a measure which has been sponsored by all 13 members of the Committee on Rules, Democrats and Republicans.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n\tMr. Speaker, only on a few occasions in the past have we acted to establish bicameral, bipartisan panels to review the structure and the functioning of this institution. The last time we did so was a decade ago, back in 1993, and I was privileged to be a cochairman of what was called the 1993 Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress.\n\tNow, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, our perception of national priorities clearly has gone through dramatic changes. Congress's initial response to the act of terrorism included establishing the Department of Homeland Security, our Select Committee on Homeland Security; H. Con. Res. 1, which established the opportunity for the Speaker to have an alternative place and designation for us to meet; the task force that was put into place, led by the ranking minority member of the Committee on Rules, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost), and my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox); and, obviously, within the Committee on Appropriations, the Subcommittee on Homeland Security.\n\tLet me take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to praise the work of my friends, the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost), and the other Members who contributed to the thinking that went into the continuity of Congress issue as well as the security of this institution. I also want to extend my congratulations to the Continuity of Government Commission on their work. But I do believe, Mr. Speaker, that more needs to be done, and we need to take a close look at all of those things that have been proposed from a wide range of different sources.\n\tThe Presidency has been transferred in critical situations on numerous occasions: war, assassination, and impeachment. But only two or three times in our Nation's history have emergencies tested the ability of the United States Congress to conduct its business under extreme circumstances. Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, Congress should undertake a thorough review of House and Senate rules, joint rules, and other related matters to ensure the functioning of Congress in the event of any catastrophe.\n\tMr. Speaker, the two Chambers, of course, do have formal and informal devices to bring Representatives and Senators together. We, of course, have conference committees, we have bicameral leadership meetings, but these mechanisms for bicameral organization are typically on an ad hoc basis and they address the legislative and political dynamics of questions that are out there. We have no formal structure in place to jointly address how we would deal with things in the case of an emergency.\n\tPassage of H. Con. Res. 190 would inaugurate a special joint committee study of the ways we can ensure that the structures, procedures and lines of communication between the two Chambers are effectively organized and coordinated so that the legislative branch can fulfill its very important constitutional duties during times of crisis. Specifically, the concurrent resolution establishes a committee of 20 Members, equally divided by Chamber and party. The Speaker and the Senate majority leader would appoint the cochairman of the joint committee as well as the other Members after consultation with the respective minority leaders. The joint committee is to issue an interim report by January 31 of 2004 and a final report by May 31 of 2004, roughly a year from now.\n\tAmong the specific topics the joint committee could consider are continuity of Congress and joint processes and procedures for consideration of homeland security legislation during times of national crisis. Now, Mr. Speaker, I am not wedded to any particular issue. If I am selected to serve on the joint committee, I want to hear from other chairmen and Members about their ideas, including what are we going to be legislating on during a crisis, what do we need to have in place procedurally to deal with this, do we have the proper funding mechanisms in place, and how can we address special elections in order to assure a quorum.\n\tI would like to take a moment, Mr. Speaker, to address the proposals of a constitutional amendment that are out there. I want to say that we had an interesting exchange yesterday in the Subcommittee on Technology and the House of the Committee on Rules, chaired by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder), in which we discussed this. I know there are some people who have come out strongly in favor of amending the Constitution. I am one who is very hesitant to move in the direction of an amendment to the Constitution. I will say that while I keep an open mind, I have yet to be convinced that that is the right thing to do. But I will listen and, clearly, be open to arguments that are there. I do think it is only fair for me to let it be known that I do have strong feelings about that issue myself.\n\tMr. Speaker, I do believe that it is time for us to step forward and take this action. It has been nearly 2 years since September 11 of 2001. We have had a lot of input and a lot of recommendations. We just had yesterday the report come forward from this commission. We obviously will expend time and energy looking at that. So I think that this, as the greatest deliberative body known to man, is now poised to deliberate over these very, very serious, important questions that are over our heads regarding the question of our governance during times of crisis.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. FROST asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, H. Con. Res. 190 creates a bipartisan and bicameral committee to study what new rules, laws, regulations, or constitutional remedies might be needed to assure the continuity of the Congress in the event of a catastrophic event. This resolution moves forward the discussions that began in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on this country. On that day, what had been unthinkable happened. On that day, amidst the carnage in New York, at the Pentagon, and in a field in Pennsylvania, the whole notion that this country is immune from terrorist attacks was destroyed in a matter of minutes.\n\tOne of the potential targets of the terrorists that day was this building, the seat of our government and the greatest symbol of our democracy. Had those enemies of democracy succeeded, our representative democracy might have been thrown into chaos if a large number of Members of the House of Representatives had been killed, injured, or otherwise incapacitated. The simple fact is that the framers provided only for direct election of House Members, and there is nothing in law that would facilitate speedy replacement of Members of the House in the eventuality of a catastrophic event.\n\tSeptember 11 provided a rude awakening in so many ways, but it is the duty of this body to find a remedy for the aftermath of a potential attack on this institution. This is a weighty matter, one that goes to the heart of representative democracy in this country. On the one hand, we want to ensure the stability of the legislative branch in the wake of such an attack. On the other hand, we should all understand the importance of preserving the unique character of membership in the House of Representatives, foundations that have not changed since the adoption of the Constitution over 214 years ago.\n\tIn the last Congress, I cochaired, with the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox), a bipartisan working group which began serious discussions on what remedies might be available to the House in the event that a large number of Members were missing, killed, injured, or incapacitated following an attack on this building or any other location where a group of Members might be gathered. We had serious and thoughtful discussions that resulted in three simple rules changes that would aid the Speaker in convening this body in the event of a catastrophic event. Those rules changes were made part of the rules of the House last January.\n\tBut it is very important that every Member understand that we cannot embark on these further discussions without an open mind on the issue of whether or not a constitutional amendment is necessary in order to allow this body to continue to function in the event that many, most, or all of us are killed or missing or incapacitated. The Continuity of Government Commission, cochaired by Lloyd Cutler and former Senator Alan Simpson, yesterday released their report and in it recommended the adoption of a constitutional amendment that would allow the Congress to provide for these eventualities by statute or other means.\n\tWe have to understand the simple fact that the framers intended for this body to be the arm of the Federal Government closest to the people. For that reason, this body is the only body that requires direct election of all of its Members. As we all know, it takes a number of months to conduct elections; and if this body has lost large numbers of Members, I believe it is essential that the American public have confidence that every part of its government is up to the task of responding to a national emergency.\n\tLet me state this in the strongest possible terms. It would be a colossal waste of the time of the Congress if Members of this new joint committee go into this process with a closed mind on the issue of a constitutional amendment authorizing appointment or replacement of Members in time of crisis. We must have every option on the table; and we have to be willing, both on the joint committee and in this body, to explore the issues, pose the questions, and find the answers. For the sake of the country and for the sake of the stability of the people's House, we must all be willing to undertake this task. Our work last year was a positive first step; but we have a solemn responsibility to make sure that every option is considered, and it is important that the House work with the Senate to ensure that the entire Congress have a plan to respond to a national emergency.\n\tI want to commend Chairman Cox for his work on this issue in the 107th Congress and thank my friend, the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), for bringing the issue to the fore this year. This is a matter of such importance and such gravity that we must all devote considerable energies to it. We must be open, we must be nonpartisan, and we must always have in mind that this democracy is resilient, responsible, and ready to meet every challenge. So must we be.\n\tI want to read from the resolution one section which underscores the bipartisan nature of this undertaking. This is section (b)(2), appearing on page 3: ``No recommendation shall be made by the joint committee except upon the majority vote of the members from each House, respectively.''\n\tNow, Mr. Speaker, what does that mean? Well, there are five Republicans from the House and five Democrats from the House on this joint committee; five Republicans from the Senate and five Democrats from the Senate. So that the five Republicans, acting on their own, cannot make any recommendations in the House; and the five Democrats, acting on their own, cannot make any recommendations. Each party has a veto. And, quite frankly, that is exactly the way it should be, that only upon agreement of a majority of the 10 Members from the House and a majority of the 10 Members from the Senate will we be able to recommend anything back to this body.\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n\tMr. FROST. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I would just like to say that again we looked at this modeling it after the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress from 1993; and I want to congratulate the now minority, then majority, for in fact putting into place a structure whereby we would in fact ensure that in moving ahead it must be done in a bipartisan way.\n\tThese issues that we are going to be addressing, Mr. Speaker, are of such gravity that it is important that just as we are here to get total agreement today with the establishment of this joint committee, that as we come forward with our recommendations that we in the same way have the kind of bipartisan agreement that will be necessary.\n\tMr. FROST. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Speaker, this is different from the way we normally operate in the House of Representatives. Normally, a simple majority, which can be constituted entirely on the majority's side, on the Republican side, could prevail on any issue. We are choosing to adopt a different set of rules for this proceeding, and that is exactly the way we should be handling this matter to guarantee that one party will not be able to dictate the outcome on matters of this magnitude.\n\tI want to thank the majority party for agreeing to that and for moving forward with this very important resolution. This is a matter that I personally have spent a lot of my time on over the last year, but it would not be possible to move forward at this point had the majority party not been willing to do so. And I thank them on behalf of the minority, and I thank them on behalf of the country for their willingness to do this.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to express my appreciation to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost), for his very kind and supportive words on this important issue as we proceed with this very weighty matter. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we yesterday held a hearing of the Subcommittee on Technology and the House, chaired very ably by our friend, the gentleman from Atlanta, Georgia (Mr. Linder).\n\tMr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder).\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n\tMr. LINDER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Concurrent Resolution 190 to establish a joint committee to review House and Senate rules, joint rules, and any additional issues of importance pertaining to the continuity and security of congressional operations. The Rules Subcommittee held a hearing yesterday to hear testimony from the chairman of the Committee on Rules and our ranking minority member, the sponsors of this proposed joint committee. It is a serious proposal. It is timely, and the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) deserve great credit for their leadership on this issue.\n\tWe are considering this kind of procedural proposal here today because any review of our parliamentary rules and procedures must now be evaluated in a post-September 11 atmosphere that incorporated once implausible circumstances into how the legislative branch will operate. Following the horrendous acts of terrorism perpetrated on the American people on September 11, our Nation realized it had entered into a new era in which liberty and freedom would be under attack from a new kind of enemy. Those of us representing the American people in this Chamber also rededicated ourselves to meet our obligation to act for the protection of our citizens and the institutions that govern them.\n\tAs a result, it is imperative that the Federal Government be in the most effective position to protect the American public, and the most visible sign of our Nation meeting this obligation has revealed itself in our efforts to find and eliminate enemies at home and abroad. It is also our obligation to ensure that the continuity of our representational government continues.\n\tThe House took action on the opening day of this Congress to implement some appropriate institutional mechanisms in case of an emergency. In light of the critical nature of the considerable responsibilities of the United States Congress, the time is right to continue to reevaluate our procedural requirements that affect the manner in which our legislative duties will be conducted in the House and Senate in an emergency.\n\tMr. Speaker, the mission of this joint committee will be to undertake a comprehensive review of House and Senate procedures, one, to ensure the continuity and authority of Congress during times of crisis; two, to improve congressional procedures necessary for the enactment of measures affecting homeland security during times of crisis; and, three, to enhance the ability of each Chamber to cooperative effectively with the other body on major and consequential issues related to homeland security.\n\tBy passing this concurrent resolution today, we put the wheels in motion for an internal assessment to help ensure the continuity and security of congressional operations. This represents a serious step in the right direction for modernizing congressional procedures, elevating parliamentary preparedness, and having the House and Senate think about what needs to be done to ensure the legislative's branch continued viability in the face of any emergency situation.\n\tI thank the House leadership for recognizing the importance of these security and continuity of operations matters and for swiftly advancing this proposal to the House floor. I urge unanimous support for this bipartisan proposal.\n\tMr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n\tMr. Speaker, people viewing this may be curious as to why it is necessary that we consider this matter, other than the obvious that the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) and I have stated.\n\tUnder the current precedents and under the current judicial interpretation of the precedents of the House, a quorum is a majority of those sworn and living. If we only have five Members survive, three Members would be a quorum, and business could be conducted. The difficulty of that would be whether the country would have any confidence in legislation enacted by only five Members.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird).\n\tMr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his leadership on this issue and also the leadership of the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), the chairman of the Committee on Rules.\n\tWhat we are about here is about as serious as it gets. We are contemplating the possibility that everyone in this building and most of the Federal Government officials in this city would be killed. It is not pleasant to contemplate, but I view it as a sign of the strength of this great democratic Republic that we are able to contemplate it because what we are saying is this: We are proud to have been elected and serve in this great body, but there is something bigger than us as individuals. There is an institution that we love and hold dear called the House of Representatives that assures the people of our States and our districts that they will have a voice in the Federal Government as it deliberates the most weighty matters that come before this Nation.\n\tShould we all be killed and not have a mechanism to replace this institution, we would leave this great Nation, indeed the world, without the system that has served us so well, the system of checks and balances to ensure that a self-appointed executive would not emerge with no checks and balances, to ensure that an unelected Cabinet member could not exercise extra constitutional powers without the checks of a representative body. That is what we are about.\n\tThe gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) has done an outstanding job, along with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) on the working group. Norm Ornstein is certainly to be credited, as is Tom Mann for the gift they gave this body yesterday with the Commission on Continuity. But we have important work to do. It is now almost 2 years since September 11 happened. We just lack a few months from that tragic date. In this time, we have the opportunity to ensure the continuity of this great body. I hope we will act on that.\n\tThe entire Constitution was written over the course of a few months by very wise individuals who got together and, as this select committee will do, set aside partisan differences. There were no parties at the time. They simply said: What is good for this country? What will help preserve our liberties? How can we establish a system that will learn from the mistakes of the past and persevere through the challenges of the future?\n\tWe have met new challenges, and we understand now we must adapt the ways we do business. This committee will help us learn to do that and will establish the procedures we need to move forward. I commend the two leaders for setting this up.\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Paul).\n  (Mr. PAUL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express a few concerns that I have regarding both the commission and the trend toward a constitutional amendment that might solve some of the problems that people anticipate.\n\tI certainly agree with the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) that this is a very serious issue; and this is to me not just a casual appointment of a commission, but we are dealing with something that is, in a constitutional sense, rather profound because we are talking about amendments that are suggesting that our governors will appoint Members of Congress for the first time in our history. That should be done with a great deal of caution and clear understanding of what we are doing.\n\tMy concern, of course, with the commission is that we are moving rather rapidly in that direction. Hopefully, that is not the case. We had the commission report of the Continuity of Government Commission yesterday, and that was released, and then we had a unanimous consent agreement to bring this up, like we need to do this in a hurry.\n\tOrdinarily, if we deal with constitutional amendments, quite frequently we will have a constitutional amendment proposed, and then we will hold hearings on that particular amendment. I think we could handle it that way.\n\tBut I have another concern about the urgent need and the assumption that the world ends if we are not here for a few days. There are times when we are not here like in August and a few months we take off at Christmas. Of course, we can be recalled, but the world does not end because we're not here. In a way this need for a constitutional amendment to appoint congressmen is assuming that life cannot go on without us writing laws.\n\tI would suggest that maybe the urgency is not quite as much as one thinks. I want to quote Michael Barone who was trying to justify a constitutional amendment that allows governors to appoint moc in a time of crisis. He said, ``think of all the emergency legislation that Congress passed in the weeks and months after September 11 authorizing expanded police powers. None of this could have happened''. But now as we look back at those emergency conditions, a lot of questions are being asked about the PATRIOT Act and the attack on our fourth amendment and civil liberties. I suggest there could be a slower approach no harm will come of it.\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n\tMr. PAUL. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n\tI appreciate the concerns that the gentleman has raised. Let me first say that I was very pleased, and my colleagues on the Committee on Rules will recall this, as we proceeded with implementation of the PATRIOT Act I insisted that we have a sunset clause so that this institution would be required to take another look at the ramifications of the PATRIOT Act, and I know that there are wide-ranging concerns that have been raised.\n\tSecond, on the issue of the constitutional amendment, I have stated that I am very concerned about the prospect of moving ahead with a constitutional amendment which would take this institution from being the body of the people to becoming, as the other body was designed in the Constitution, to be the body of the States, and make this the body of the States again which I believe would make it the case if we were to have governors appoint Members of the House of Representatives.\n\tI think this joint committee is designed to look at these concerns, look at the issues out there. We have all talked about the gravity of it. We know it is a very, very serious matter. I will assure my friend there is no way this committee, if it were to come forward with a proposed constitutional amendment, would act without going through the process of having the Committee on the Judiciary look at the prospect of amending the Constitution, and we in the Committee on Rules would address it again, and of course it would have to go through the confirmation process.\n\tMr. PAUL. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say I am pleased to hear what the gentleman has said, because there are some who see this just from the outside, seeing what we are doing here today as nothing more than a continuity of what was done yesterday. The gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) suggests he does not see it that way, and that gives me some reassurance, and I thank the gentleman.\n\tMr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n\tMr. Speaker, I want to make it clear to people who may be watching or listening to this again why we are discussing this. There is a historical aberration in our Constitution that provides that senators, when they die or are killed, may be appointed, replacement Senators, but there is no comparable provision for replacement of House Members. That historical aberration arises from the fact that when our Constitution was first passed all Senators were appointed. They were appointed by their State legislatures. It was only much later in our history that we went to the direct election of Senators.\n\tWhen we did that, we retained the appointment power for the governors of States to replace Senators who die or are killed while in office. No such power was ever in the Constitution originally for the House of Representatives, so we have a different situation currently as it applies to the Senate and as it applies to the House.\n\tThose of us who advocate a change in our Constitution are taking the position that, since the Senate is already covered, since there already is a way to replace Senators in our Constitution, there should be a comparable provision for being able to replace House Members in the event of a mass tragedy.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).\n\tMr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I would just like to echo the concerns of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) and his desire and his belief that we need to have an alternative mechanism for appointing Members to the House in the event of a major catastrophe.\n\tI would also like to thank and commend the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) for their outstanding leadership on this issue. It is a very difficult and in many ways unpleasant subject to be dealing with but one that is very necessary and could mean the survivability of this Republic in the event of a catastrophe.\n\tMr. Speaker, as a member of the Cox-Frost working group in the 107th Congress, I urged my colleagues to support H. Con. Res. 190 so Congress may continue to operate in the aftermath of a catastrophe that kills or incapacitates a large number of its Members. I also thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Baird) for their leadership on this very important issue.\n\tThe Constitution declares that Members of the House must be popularly elected. However, the specter of terrorism, notably reports that the Capitol was an intended target on September 11, as well as the subsequent anthrax attacks, remind us that mass casualties in Washington or elsewhere are a real possibility and could have a detrimental effect on the House's ability to fulfill its duties.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n\tWhile the Cox-Frost group made some significant progress in resolving these complicated problems in the last Congress, many questions still remain. For example, I have been working with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) to address the communications needs of Members in emergency conditions. Yesterday, the Continuity of Government Commission issued its first report with recommendations for preserving Congress' ability to function in the wake of a terrorist attack. It is Congress' responsibility to consider those recommendations and develop a strategy to ensure that the people's business will not be interrupted. Today's resolution will help us reach that goal. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox), who very ably led, along with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost), the effort to deal with the continuity of Congress in the 107th Congress.\n\tMr. COX. I want to thank the Speaker, thank the chairman, and thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost).\n\tMr. Speaker, when in May 2002 the Speaker asked us, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) and me, to cochair this working group, there was not a Department of Homeland Security, there was not a House committee to oversee the Department of Homeland Security; but now that I have assumed that responsibility, I can say that I feel there is no issue more integral to homeland security than the preservation and proper functioning of our democratic institutions in time of national emergency. I am very pleased that the next step that this body, and indeed the other body, is taking this process is to institutionalize through a bicameral group that will be chaired on this side by the leaders of our Committee on Rules to take a further look at these seemingly, in some cases, intractable problems and to solve them.\n\tWe have in our working group accomplished a great deal and with the leadership of the Committee on Rules placed before this House at the beginning of this Congress three changes to our rules that address continuity issues that were solved in the working group. In addition, the gentleman from Texas and I yesterday introduced legislation to deal with the problems in the Presidential succession law created by these catastrophic circumstances that we are now forced to imagine.\n\tWhen we go back to those horrible images of September 11 which are hard to purge from our memory, those video images we have all seen countless times of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, imagine this Capitol if the same images were seen here. Imagine what would be the result, what would be the effect. Not only would Members have been killed if Flight 93, which we now believe was headed for the Capitol, had succeeded in its mission but Members would have been maimed and disabled. The problems that arise under our rules and our laws are not just those of how do you fill a vacancy after someone dies, but what happens when that person has not died but is incapable of coming to this Chamber and being part of a quorum? What happens when that occurs 100 times over? These are the kinds of problems that lack any immediate solution and that therefore must be handed off to this more permanent body that we are establishing by this resolution.\n\tI want quickly to commend the other members of the working group for their yearlong effort. They include, of course, cochairman Martin Frost; chairman of the House Committee on Rules, David Dreier, who is leading us on the floor today and will lead this effort henceforth; chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Steve Chabot; ranking member on the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, Jerrold Nadler; chairman of the Committee on House Administration, Bob Ney; chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Steny Hoyer; chairman of the House Republican Policy Subcommittee on Redesigning Government, David Vitter; Representative Brian Baird from whom we have just heard; Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee; Representative James Langevin, who is also with us here today on the floor.\n\tEx officio members of the working group who were enormously important to our efforts included the House Parliamentarian, Charles Johnson; the Deputy House Parliamentarian, John Sullivan; former Clerk of the House, Donn Anderson; House legislative counsel Pope Barrow; House general counsel Michael Stern; and Congressional Research Service senior specialist Walter Olesczek. From May to October of 2002, the working group held eight very long meetings, hearing testimony from law professors, constitutional scholars, members of the academic community, think tank scholars and other experts. The working group considered, in order, changes to the House rules, because they are the least intrusive, most efficient means of solving these problems; next, statutory solutions; and only lastly constitutional amendments.\n\tI want to say with respect to this question of a constitutional amendment because already during this debate we have heard concerns raised about willy-nilly amending the Constitution or about overstating the problems when Congress is, for example, out of town during the August recess with regularity, it was unfortunately necessary for us in this working group to imagine some circumstances that we hope never arise when not only the whole House but the President and the Vice President also were lost. In that circumstance, there are significant questions of legitimacy of both the institutions of the executive and the legislative, but also even more trenchant concerns about the withdrawal of the checks and balances that undergird our system and protect our civil liberties.\n\tIf we imagine what America would be like after such a horrible attack that killed the President, killed the Vice President, killed the Speaker of the House, killed hundreds of Members of this Congress, first we would have as President, this much would be certain, someone who was unelected, someone who perhaps no one had ever heard of before, and someone who might or might not be fit for the job. That person would be vested with the immediate responsibility of presumably determining whether to declare war, responsibility under article 1 of this body which would not be able to function. That person also would be asked to seek emergency appropriations to deal with this problem. Yet there would be no Congress. And that person might want to suspend habeas corpus and other civil liberties because of the emergency, and there might be no legislative check against it. These are the counterweight to the arguments that we should not rush into amending the Constitution. These are the problems that the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier) is properly taking up with the other body, and I hope they are soon solved.\n\tMr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).\n  (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I commend the authors of this resolution because they recognize how important it is to protect our constitutional government, even from the possibility that perhaps hundreds of Members of this Congress might be killed by a terrorist act. We should, however, also take a look at the possibility that the death of one, two, or three individuals in line to serve as President could also undermine our constitutional government. We must protect both branches of government from unfortunate acts or terrorist aggression. That is why I strongly support this resolution and wish to bring to the attention of my colleagues a letter that I sent out last week urging them to become cosponsors of the Presidential Succession Act of 2003.\n\tThe line of Presidential succession determines who becomes President if both the President and Vice President have died or are unable to fulfill their duties. That line should be as solid as the concrete barriers that protect our Capitol grounds. Unfortunately, that line is not. However, with a mere change in statute, not a constitutional amendment, Congress can ensure the certainty in the line of succession as well as the continuity of the Federal policies of the executive branch.\n\tArticle 2, section 1 of the Constitution allows Congress to determine the line of succession to the Presidency following the Vice President. Congress last seriously addressed this issue when it passed the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Unfortunately, the 1947 act is ambiguous and we cannot afford ambiguity as to the identity or the legitimacy of the President of the United States, particularly at a time of crisis. The 1947 act is further flawed because it allows the Presidency to be shifted from one political party to the other during a 4-year term. This means that if the Vice Presidency is vacant, our stock markets and our foreign enemies will wonder whether some unfortunate event will cause a radical shift of our policies. A terrorist might see an opportunity to radically shift our policies by killing just one individual. And a partially or temporarily impaired President would be highly unlikely to either take a leave of absence under the 25th amendment or to resign permanently if that action would vest control of the executive branch in the opposite political party.\n\tCurrent law provides that if the office of Vice President is vacant, the next in line is the Speaker of the House, followed by the President pro tempore of the Senate. In the recent season finale of the ``West Wing,'' the President was under extreme personal stress. There was no Vice President serving. That President invoked the 25th amendment and temporarily transferred control of the executive branch to the Speaker of the House who happened to be of the opposite political party. Would that happen in real life? I would hope so, because I would hope that a President under extreme stress would take a leave of absence as provided in the 25th amendment. But in real life, a President arguably suffering from temporary impairment would hang on to the Presidency with the same tenacity that my friend Strom Thurmond held on to his Senate seat when he knew that if he resigned from the Senate he would be replaced by the appointee of a Democratic Governor.\n\tSpeaking of my friend Strom Thurmond, we should remember that just a few years ago, while Strom was in his late 90s, he was third in line to succeed to the Presidency. Does this make sense in an era of suicide assassins? In a document that I will append in the Record to my remarks here, I will point out that under some scenarios, we could have five individuals, each with a legitimate claim to be President. I will summarize it by simply saying that if we did not have a Speaker of the House, someone could claim to become President because they were serving as temporary Speaker under House rule I, clause 8, subprovision (3)(A). Someone who became Speaker of the House could then try to displace someone who had been temporary Speaker, and then we could have a President pro tem of the Senate all claiming. We could have even more scenarios.\n\tSome will say that Presidential succession has never gotten past a Vice President, but that happened because Gerald Ford was confirmed promptly, before Richard Nixon resigned. Furthermore, in April 1865, John Wilkes Booth headed a partially successful conspiracy to assassinate President Lincoln and those who were first, second and third in line to succeed him. Are we sure that al Qaeda can do no worse?\n\tThat is why I will put forward the Presidential Succession Act of 2003, which is similar to legislation I proposed in March 2001. Under it, the President would file a document with the Clerk of this House indicating whether third to succeed to the Presidency should be either the Speaker of the House or the minority leader and whether the fourth should be the Senate majority leader or the Senate minority leader. And, of course, these could be changed if control of the House or the Senate changed. More importantly, the bill would state that once someone becomes President, they serve for the rest of the 4-year term and cannot be pushed aside by someone who later becomes, say, Speaker of the House and is higher in the list. Once they begin to serve a Presidential term, they continue.\n\tToday we will act to ensure the continuity of Congress. Later this year we should act to ensure the continuity of the executive branch. Our friends and enemies around the world and the investment community should know that similar policies will continue throughout a 4-year term and that the Presidency cannot be shifted to another party by a tragic event. More importantly, it should be absolutely clear as to who is legitimate President of the United States. We need to act this year.\n\n                   [From the Roll Call, May 21, 2003]\n\n           Act Now To Ensure Smooth Succession to Presidency\n\n                         (By Rep. Brad Sherman)\n\n       In the post-Sept. 11, 2001, reality, we have seen military \n     guards with M-16s patrol the Capitol and anti-aircraft \n     artillery stationed around national monuments. It is no \n     mystery that terrorists actively seek to interrupt our \n     constitutional democracy.\n       The line of presidential succession, which determines who \n     becomes president if both the president and vice president \n     have died or are otherwise unable to carry out their duties, \n     should be as solid as the concrete barriers lining the \n     Capitol grounds. It is not. However, with a change in \n     statute--not a constitutional amendment--Congress can ensure \n     certainty in the line of successors, as well as continuity of \n     federal policies.\n       Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution allows Congress \n     to determine the line of succession to the presidency \n     following the vice president. Congress last visited this \n     issue seriously when it passed the Presidential Succession \n     Act of 1947. Unfortunately, the 1947 \n     act us ambiguous and we cannot afford ambiguity as to the \n     identity and legitimacy of the president, particularly at a \n     time of crisis.\n       The 1974 act is further flawed because it allows the \n     presidency to be shifted to an opposing political party. This \n     means if the vice presidency is vacant, our stock markets and \n     foreign enemies will wonder whether an unfortunate event will \n     result in a radical shift in policies; a terrorist might see \n     an ``opportunity'' to radically shift our policies; and a \n     partially or temporarily impaired president would think twice \n     about taking a leave of absence under the 25th Amendment, or \n     resigning, if either action would out the other party in \n     control of all executive departments. Finally, third in the \n     current line of successions is the President Pro Tem, a \n     ceremonial position normally held by the longest-serving \n     member of the Senate majority.\n       Current law provides that if the office of the vice \n     president is vacant, the next in line is the Speaker, \n     followed by the President Pro Tem. The recent ``West Wing'' \n     season final demonstrated how a president, under extreme \n     duress could, at a time when there was no vice president, \n     invoke the 25th Amendment and temporarily transfer control of \n     the White House to a Speaker of the opposite political party. \n     In real life, it is more likely that a president arguably \n     suffering from temporary impairment would hang on to the \n     presidency with the same tenacity that former Sen. Strom \n     Thurmond (R-S.C.) held on to his seat at a time when his \n     resignation would have handed his seat to an appointee of a \n     Democratic governor.\n       Speaking of Thurmond, we should remember that just a few \n     years ago, while in his late 90s, he was third in line for \n     the presidency. Does this make sense in an era of suicide-\n     assassins?\n       Here is a hypothetical designed to illustrate all the \n     ambiguities of the 1947 act. The office of vice president, \n     Speaker and President Pro Tem are all vacant. The president \n     has nominated Ms. Smith to the new vice president, and he \n     awaits her confirmation hearings under the 25th Amendment. \n     The House and the Senate have adjourned for the year, though \n     Mr. Jones is serving as ``temporary House Speaker'' pursuant \n     to House rule 1, clause 8 (3)(A). Now, imagine that the \n     president dies.\n       Does Mr. Jones, the temporary Speaker, become president? \n     Probably not, but we're not sure. In all probability, the \n     secretary of State becomes acting president. But assume the \n     House then reconvenes and elects a Speaker. Does that new \n     Speaker then push aside the secretary of State and become the \n     new president? What if the Senate elects a new President Pro \n     Tem before the House elects a new Speaker? And what if Ms. \n     Smith makes it through her vice presidential confirmation \n     hearings--does she push aside whoever is then serving as \n     president? Under this scenario, and under the ambiguity of \n     the 1947 act, all five of the following could claim the \n     presidency: Ms. Smith, Mr. Jones, the President Pro Tem, the \n     newly elected Speaker and the secretary of State. Other, less \n     contrived scenarios could create three or four claimants to \n     the presidency. Even two plausible claimants to the White \n     House is one too many.\n       Some will say that presidential succession has never gotten \n     past a vice president, in part because Gerald Ford was \n     confirmed promptly, before Richard Nixon resigned. But Sept. \n     11 shows that what is unlikely to occur naturally may well \n     occur. In April 1865, John Wilkes Booth headed a partially \n     successful conspiracy to assassinate President Abraham \n     Lincoln and those who stood first, second and third in line \n     to succeed him. Are we sure that al Qaeda can do no worse?\n       Next month, I will introduce the Presidential Succession \n     Act of 2003, which is similar to legislation I introduced in \n     March 2001. Under this legislation, the president will file \n     an official document with the Clerk of the House designating, \n     after the vice president, the next person in line of \n     succession as either the Speaker or the House Minority \n     Leader. Similarly, the president would file instructions with \n     the Secretary of the Senate, designating the third in line as \n     either the Senate Majority Leader or Minority Leader. (These \n     designations can be revised if the majority becomes the \n     minority.) The bill will further ensure certainty in \n     presidential succession by clearly providing that if someone \n     succeeds to the presidency, that person shall continue to \n     serve until the end of the presidential term.\n       Our friends and enemies around the world, as well as the \n     investment community, should know that similar policies will \n     continue throughout a four-year term, and that the presidency \n     will not be shifted to the other party by a tragic event. \n     More importantly, the law should be absolutely clear so that \n     whoever serves as president, particularly at a time of \n     crisis, has unquestioned legitimacy. By acting now we can \n     accomplish these ends. Or, we can just put this off until a \n     problem arises.\n\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Metairie, Louisiana (Mr. Vitter), who worked very hard on the commission and was very actively involved in it.\n\tMr. VITTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Dreier), the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox), and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) for all of their work on this issue; and that work, of course, must continue.\n\tI rise in strong support of this resolution. I was honored and privileged to work on the working group with the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) and so many others.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n\tI think that working group did some very valuable work, laid an important foundation, and in fact suggested and helped make very real and important and fundamental changes in both our rules and some statutes. We are continuing that work I believe today, and in the very near future the gentleman from California (Mr. Cox) will put into the hopper another bill aimed at changing statutes to again fine tune some of these issues with regard to presidential succession and related matters. I am happy to coauthor that bill, and that is further progress.\n\tBut just as clearly as we have met and gained consensus on some issues and made important progress, big questions remain; and clearly the biggest question which I believe must be tackled more adequately is the possibility of mass deaths among House Members and how our democratic institution of the House, our most democratic institution, would continue to function under that circumstance of national emergency. So that is why I think this resolution and the new joint work between the House and the Senate led by the gentleman from California (Chairman Dreier) and others is so very important.\n\tI also want to join in the concerns that the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Paul) raised. They are very legitimate concerns that I and many other people hold, but clearly there are ways to address those concerns. Clearly, this new group is not headed in any specific direction that the rules addressing those concerns adequately deal with.\n\tMr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work on this issue with others.\n\tMr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, I want to respond to one of the issues raised on the other side, and that is the question of the adequacy of replacing Members of the House through special elections.\n\tSpecial elections, of course, are determined by State law; and the laws vary from State to State. Some State laws have special elections held rather promptly. Other States have special elections that extend over a long period of time.\n\tFor example, in my home State of Texas, our former colleague, Mr. Combest, shortly after the convening of this Congress, announced that he was resigning, was leaving, and his successor, who was chosen in a special election under Texas law which included a runoff, was sworn in today, 6 months into the Congress. So there is a difficulty in citing the remedy of special elections as a way of replacing Members in a prompt way.\n\tI am very sympathetic to the historical precedent that Members of the House up until this point can only serve by election, but there are extraordinary circumstances. We hope the extraordinary circumstances never occur, but we do need to be ready, should anything like that ever happen.\n\tMr. Speaker, in closing, this resolution is a very significant development. Again, I want to thank the majority for the way this is structured, for having the sides evenly divided, for requiring a majority vote in each House of the members on this joint committee, and I would urge that the Congress, that the House, promptly pass this resolution. I would hope that the Senate, the other body, would do the same thing, so the work of this joint committee could begin as soon as possible.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\tMr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n\tMr. Speaker, I think that we have seen from today's debate that this is an extraordinarily serious matter. This coming September 11 will mark the second anniversary of one of the most tragic days in our Nation's history. We all know of the terrible loss of life and we know of the threat that existed on that date to this institution, this building, which, as we all know, is a symbol not only to Americans but around the world of freedom and democracy. \n\tFor that reason, after this nearly 2-year window of time when we have taken a lot of action in response to September 11, it is important for us to now step back and, in a deliberative manner, to very thoughtfully look at the ways in which we can assure that we proceed with fair and balanced representation to maintain a continuity of our Nation's governance. I believe that we have in this resolution which will establish this joint committee an opportunity to, in a bicameral way, look at this very important question.\n\tAs I said earlier, exactly 10 years ago, in 1993, I was privileged to be a cochairman of the Joint Committee on the Organization of Congress, which looked at a lot of the institutional questions that both bodies face. Now we will, in the wake of this very, very serious challenge that we face, have the opportunity to look at those questions which continue.\n\tObviously, it is important for us to recognize the disparity that exists between the two bodies. The other body is one which has different constituencies than ours, obviously different terms of office and, as the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) has pointed out, different ways for succession.\n\tThis institution is known as the People's House. We are the only federally elected officials who must be elected to have the opportunity to serve in our positions. I feel it is very important for us to maintain that status, as James Madison envisaged it over two centuries ago; and I believe that, at the same time, we can, in working with our colleagues in the other body, proceed with a very fair, bipartisan process, which will allow us to address this.\n\tIt is obvious, Mr. Speaker, from having listened to the debate which will simply put into place this joint committee, that there is disagreement. But I believe that as we take the input that has been provided by a wide range of individuals, academics, former colleagues, people who spent a lot of time thinking about this, who will be providing us with recommendations, I am convinced that the work of this joint committee will be among the most important things that this 108th Congress will be able to address.\n\tMr. Speaker, with that, I urge adoption of this resolution.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Pursuant to the order of the House of Wednesday, June 4, 2003, the concurrent resolution is considered read for amendment and the previous question is ordered.\n\tThe question is on the concurrent resolution.\n\tThe concurrent resolution was agreed to.\n\tA motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["David Dreier", "Martin Frost", "John Linder", "Brian Baird", "Ron Paul", "James R.

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the \nCommittee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 258 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 258\n\n       Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it \n     shall be in order without intervention of any point of order \n     to consider in the House the bill (S. 222) to approve the \n     settlement of the water rights claims of the Zuni Indian \n     Tribe in Apache County, Arizona, and for other purposes.

The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final \n     passage without intervening motion except: (1) 40 minutes of \n     debate on the bill equally divided and controlled by the \n     chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit.\n       Sec. 2. Upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in \n     order without intervention of any point of order to consider \n     in the House the bill (S. 273) to provide for the expeditious \n     completion of the acquisition of land owned by the State of \n     Wyoming within the boundaries of Grand Teton National Park, \n     and for other purposes. The bill shall be considered as read \n     for amendment. The previous question shall be considered as \n     ordered on the bill to final passage without intervening \n     motion except: (1) 40 minutes of debate on the bill equally \n     divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Resources; and (2) one motion to \n     recommit.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) \nis recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate \nonly, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as \nI may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time \nyielded is for the purpose of debate only.\n  (Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise \nand extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 258 is a \nclosed rule providing for the consideration of two measures, S. 222, \nthe Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act, and S. 273, the \nGrand Teton National Park Land Exchange Act.\n  The rule provides that S. 222 shall be debatable in the House for 40 \nminutes, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the \nCommittee on Resources. The rule also waives all points of order \nagainst consideration of the bill and provides one motion to recommit, \nwith or without instruction.\n  The rule further provides that S. 273 shall be debatable in the House \nfor 40 minutes, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member \nof the Committee on Resources.\n  Finally, the rule waives all points of order against consideration of \nthe bill and provides one motion to recommit, with or without \ninstructions.\n  Mr. Speaker, both of the bills covered by this rule were considered \nby the House under suspension of the rules on June 3. Neither bill was \nadopted, having failed to receive the required two-thirds of the votes \ncast, but each bill was supported by a clear majority in the House.\n  The Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act approves a \nsettlement of the water rights claims of the Zuni Indian Tribe in \nApache County, Arizona. The bill resolves all of the claims of the Zuni \nTribe to water rights in the Little Colorado River basin and elsewhere \nin Arizona. The bill also provides resources to restore riparian \nwetlands to the Zuni Heaven Reservation that are of great religious and \ncultural significance to the tribe and its members.\n  The Grand Teton National Park Land Exchange Act provides for the \nacquisition of land owned by the State of Wyoming within the boundaries \nof the Grand Teton National Park. These lands, rich in wildlife \nhabitat, will be exchanged for other Federal lands or assets of equal \nvalue. In turn, the State will be able to acquire lands that have \ngreater potential to generate revenue for public schools, ensuring that \nthe State of Wyoming meets its constitutional mandate to maximize \nrevenues from its school trust lands.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are forced to take up the \nvaluable time of the House to consider for a second time this week two \nmeasures that have been previously approved by a solid majority in this \nHouse. The measures have been fully debated.\n  Accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule \nand pass the underlying bills without further delay.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. I thank the \ngentleman from Washington for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, this morning during the debate on the Check 21 open \nrule, I warned this body that open rules are a rarity, an endangered \nspecies, if you will. Well, here we are about to consider not an open \nrule but a closed rule on two noncontroversial bills. But what do you \nexpect? This is the norm. This is business as usual in this House.\n  I also want this Chamber and the American people to remember this \nmoment, because it is historic. This also is a rarity here. We finally \nhave seen a tax cut that the Republicans do not like. In the dead of \nnight, faced with the decision of either providing tax relief for 12 \nmillion working families or giving a tax cut to Donald Trump, the \nRepublicans chose Donald Trump and left the children out in the cold.\n  And who exactly is left behind by this glaring omission? Nearly one \nin five children of our active duty military. These families are only \nmaking around $27,000 a year. They did not\n\n[[Page H5013]]\n\nhave the good fortune to be born with the last name of ``Gates'' or \n``Buffett'' or ``Cheney.'' But they are trying to make a living, and \nthey are doing so by serving their country. These are children of \npeople who are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the Republicans, \nin their greed and zeal for tax cuts for their rich friends, decided \nthese families do not need any tax relief.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Now, of course, Republicans claim that they provide tax relief only \nfor people who pay income tax, but we all know people pay more than \njust income tax. There is a payroll tax. There is property tax. There \nis a sales tax. But the Republicans in their warped thought process \nconsider payroll tax relief and child tax credit a new form of welfare. \nWe heard this argument earlier this morning, and it is outrageous; and \nquite frankly, it is insulting to these hardworking Americans.\n  As we all know, this could not be farther from the truth. It is the \nRepublicans who encourage welfare in the Tax Code by giving tax breaks \nto corporations that flee this country for tax havens in other \ncountries. Their disingenuous argument does not fly with the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Speaker, the legislative process in this body is broken. There is \nno excuse for the majority's actions. We are here today to reconsider \ntwo bills that should have been passed under suspension of the rules. \nThe bills are not controversial, but the majority's actions are.\n  As we all know, on Tuesday three bills were defeated under suspension \nof the rules. House Democrats using one of the few procedural tools at \nour disposal, voted against these bills, not on their merits but to \nexpress our frustration that the House leadership refuses to allow for \nconsideration of a bill that would give our working families the tax \nrelief that they deserve.\n  So today is also payback day. I think it is shameful and spiteful; \nand it is, unfortunately, very typical around here. They will not say \nit on the other side of the aisle, so I am going to say it right here \nnow.\n  What is the payback? Among other things, showing disrespect for one \nof the finest individuals ever to grace the halls of Congress. The one \nbill that was defeated on Tuesday that is not on today's schedule is \nthe bill to name a Federal building in Indianapolis for former Senator \nBirch Bayh. We should be naming multiple courthouses in this country \nfor Birch Bayh.\n  Their tactics will not work. We are not going to be intimidated. We \nare going to keep talking about the issues that matter to working \nAmericans, and issues like tax fairness are high among them. If the \nRepublicans were serious about tax relief and if they were serious \nabout their support for working families, they would schedule a vote to \nreinstate this provision. That is what we are fighting for. That is \nwhat we are asking for. But they will not, because they are not serious \nabout this. They are merely providing lip service, telling Americans \nwhat they want to hear while padding the pockets of their wealthy \nfriends.\n  Mr. Speaker, at the end of this debate on the rule I will ask my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question. If the previous \nquestion is defeated, I will offer an amendment to provide for the \nconsideration of the Rangel-Davis-DeLauro bill to help the people the \nRepublicans would rather leave behind.\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones).\n  (Mrs. Jones of Ohio asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding \ntime to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, the two bills that are being considered here today were \ngreat suspension bills that were on the Journal a couple of days ago. \nHowever, Democrats, in an effort to voice our concern about leaving \nbehind millions of Americans who are low-income families, voted against \nthose suspension bills.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, to borrow a recent popular phrase, I am shocked \nand awed by the consummate arrogance, fiscal irresponsibility, and \ncandid lack of compassion of the Republican lawmakers of this body.\n  I have been on the floor many times in the past several months \nexpressing my outrage at the unfairness and untimeliness of the various \nGOP tax plans, and once again I find myself at the podium in a state of \ndisbelief about the efforts of the self-proclaimed ``compassionate \nconservative party'' to exclude some of the neediest families in our \nNation from tax relief in the tax bill that was signed into law last \nweek.\n  In an administration that has claimed to want to leave no child \nbehind, we are now realizing that, indeed, 12 million of them were left \nbehind, and 521,000 in my State.\n  In a time where special attention is being given to our brave men and \nwomen of our Armed Forces who served so well in Iraq, I think it is \ninappropriate to see how these last-minute shenanigans have actually \nleft many of them out. The majority of our military members are in the \npay grades of E5 and below. These are the sergeants, petty officers, \nlance corporals, specialists, and airmen, whose round-the-clock efforts \nmade the military victory in Iraq swift and decisive. But an E5 with 6 \nyears in service makes just $24,000. His family is left behind.\n  Mr. Speaker, to borrow a recent popular phrase, I am shocked and awed \nby the consummate arrogance, fiscal irresponsibility, and candid lack \nof compassion of the Republican lawmakers of this body. I have been on \nthis floor many times in the past several months expressing my outrage \nat the unfairness and untimeliness of the various GOP tax plans, and I \nagain find myself at the podium in a state of disbelief about the self-\nproclaimed ``compassionate conservative' party's efforts to exclude \nsome of the neediest families in our Nation from tax relief in the tax \nbill that was signed into law last week.\n  In an administration that has claimed to want to ``Leave no Child \nBehind,'' we are to realizing that there will indeed be children left \nbehind--12 million of them in fact; 527,000 in my State of Ohio.\n  In a time where special attention is being given to our brave men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces who served so well in Iraq, I think it is \nappropriate to note how the last minute shenanigans of Republican \nlawmakers to strip out a provision of their tax bill that would have \nensured that families making between $10,500 to $26,000 would get the \nfull child tax credit other taxpayers get, will affect our military \npersonnel.\n  The majority of our military members are in the pay grades of E-5 and \nbelow. These are the sergeants, the petty officers, the lance \ncorporals, specialists, and airmen whose round the clock efforts made \nthe military victory in Iraq swift and decisive. But an E-5 with 6 \nyears in the service makes just $24,000 in base pay per year. An E-2 \njust new to the military makes just $15,840 in base pay. And these are \njust some of the millions of family members who will suffer, and their \nchildren will suffer, their spouses will suffer, because of the back \ndoor wrangling by Republicans to give even more money to the wealthiest \nof American taxpayers.\n  Mr. Rangel has introduced a fair and responsible alternative to \naddress this injustice, but I am afraid it will be to little avail. \nRather than focus on the important issues facing our Nation, the \nRepublican leadership seems intent to focus on solutions in search of \nproblems--such as this week's constitutional amendment to flag \ndesecration. I haven't been made aware that flag desecration is a \nproblem in this country--but every week when I return to my \ncongressional district, I am made keenly aware that the economic health \nof our country is a problem. Unfortunately, ti seems to be a problem \nsome Members of this body choose to ignore.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Sherman).\n  (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose a rule that does not allow \nthe House to consider providing working families with the child care \ncredit. The current situation imposes the injury of denying these \nworking families $400 that they need and then adds the insult of \ntelling these families that they are not taxpayers, so they do not \ndeserve any tax relief. Of course, looking at their paycheck stubs, \nthey see the taxes they are paying.\n  Allowing corporations to avoid American taxes just by renting a hotel \nin the Bahamas, $8 billion; allowing millionaires to pay virtually \nnothing on their dividend income, $80 billion;\n\n[[Page H5014]]\n\neliminating the estate tax even on the largest estates, $138 billion; \ntelling working families that they do not deserve relief and that they \nare not taxpayers, that is priceless.\n  There are some things campaign contributions just will not buy. For \neverything else, there is RepubliCard, accepted at the finest country \nclubs in the Bahamas. Members will want to get the Deficit Express \ncard, now that the Republican Congress has increased the credit limit \nto $12 trillion. The Deficit Express card? Do not leave the House \nwithout it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Rangel), the distinguished ranking member on the \nCommittee on Ways and Means.\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion for the previous \nquestion so that we might have the opportunity to amend a rule and to \nbring to the House legislation that would bring some equity to the \nrecently passed tax bill.\n  I do not think many Members of the House knew that those that were \nmaking the decision would deliberately exclude the benefit of the child \ntax credit for people making less than $26,000. I refuse to believe \nthat people can be so callous that they would deliberately try to make \nadjustments to a tax bill that was geared to, as the leadership would \nsay, those who pay the taxes, and exclude the privilege and the \nopportunity for people to get credit that are in low income merely \nbecause they do not pay ``the taxes.''\n  We have 6.5 million working families that do pay taxes, albeit those \ntaxes may be perceived by the majority not to be important. But they do \npay taxes, and they have lost the benefits of receiving tax credits for \ntheir children.\n  But Mr. Speaker, even worse than that, yesterday we passed the \nresolution paying honor to those brave men and women that were placed \nin harm's way as a result of the so-called ``victory'' in Iraq. As I \nsaid yesterday, parades are important, saluting the flag is important, \nhaving a bumper sticker is important; but how we treat these veterans \nis even far more important.\n  I know that Republicans do not know, and Democrats are learning, that \nas a result of so-called tax benefits given to these people that were \nin combat, that over 200,000 that served in Iraq will be denied the tax \ncredit for their children. Why? Because the language of the tax law is \nthat they have to have taxable income. Out of the benevolence of our \nhearts we have said that if they served in combat, they do not have to \npay taxes.\n  I hope Members will consider to speedily bring up my bill so that we \ncan remedy this error that has been made. Nobody thought that by \nremoving tax liability we would be actually taking away the benefit of \nthe child tax credits.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record an article that appeared in USA \nToday on this day that says, ``Military Kids Get Slighted on Tax \nCredit.''\n  The article referred to is as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, June 5, 2003]\n\n              Study: Military Kids Slighted on Tax Credit\n\n\n          Parents earn too little to qualify for the provision\n\n                         (By William M. Welch)\n\n       Washington.--Nearly one in five children of active-duty \n     U.S. military families won't benefit from the increased tax \n     credit signed last week by President Bush because their \n     parents earn too little to qualify, a study being released \n     today concludes.\n       The finding by the Children's Defense Fund, a liberal \n     advocacy group, comes as Bush and Republican congressional \n     leaders are under increasing fire for agreeing to omit \n     working poor families from the increased child credit \n     included in the $350 billion, 10-year tax cut plan and aid \n     for states.\n       Those military families would have received a check of up \n     to $400 per child under a provision that the Senate added to \n     the bill. But that ``refundable'' credit to families who pay \n     little or no federal income tax, but do pay payroll taxers, \n     was deleted in final negotiations between Bush and Republican \n     leader of Congress.\n       Families who have children and earn more than about $27,000 \n     a year are due to receive checks next month of up to $400 per \n     child, as an advance on an increase in the credit from $600 \n     to $1,000.\n       The group said 250,000 of the 1.4 million children in \n     active-duty military families will not qualify for the \n     benefit because of the omission.\n       An additional 750,000 children denied the benefit have \n     parents who are military veterans, the fund concluded. It \n     based its findings on latest U.S. Census data.\n       Democrats, liberal groups and some moderate Republicans in \n     Congress are trying to build pressure on Bush and GOP leaders \n     to pass legislation quickly extending the credit, to those \n     families that were left out.\n       Democrats immediately invoked U.S. troops still in Iraq as \n     a political justification for another bill expanding the \n     credit.\n       ``Thousands of military personnel, people who put their \n     lives on the line for our country, won't receive the child \n     credit unless we correct the child credit unless we correct \n     the bill,'' Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said.\n       The $3.5 billion cost would be paid for by cracking down on \n     business tax avoidance schemes under the Democrats' proposal. \n     They said fast action was needed to assure 12 million low-\n     income families are able to receive a check when the \n     government begins mailing them to more affluent families \n     starting July 1.\n       Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Minority \n     Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., were negotiating a possible \n     agreement that would permit the Senate to vote, perhaps this \n     week, on competing proposals aimed at providing just such a \n     remedy to the working poor.\n       Republican leaders of the House of Representatives are \n     resisting the move. They say Bush didn't propose giving the \n     added credit to the working poor as part of his original \n     economic stimulus plan, and that sending tax refunds to \n     people who pay no federal income tax may be bad policy.\n       ``This is something that has been blown out of \n     proportion,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who is on the \n     tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. ``It was not part of \n     the original bill, nor was it part of the bill in the House. \n     . . . We never debated it. . . . It is a new idea, and it is \n     one we ought to think about.''\n       In another effort to build pressure, a coalition of liberal \n     groups today begins airing TV ads in Washington blasting Bush \n     for leaving the working poor out of the child credit benefit \n     increase.\n       The Center for Community Change is buying a relatively \n     modest amount of airtime, but it is encouraging hundreds of \n     like-minded groups to air the same ad in other cites.\n       The ad shows two children: one too poor to qualify for the \n     increased credit and another, whose parents make more money, \n     who receives it. ``President Bush chose the most fortunate to \n     get the most,'' an announcer says.''\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nWoolsey).\n  Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule because \nworking families should be our priority today, families like Cori's. \nCori came to a local Head Start in my district at a low point in her \nlife. She was a single parent without any support system and very \nlittle money and very little self-esteem. She had just completed a \nrecovery program and was seeking to put her life back together.\n  Cori went on to volunteer for Head Start, completed an AA degree in \nearly childhood development, and now Cori is a Head Start employee for \nthe past 3 years and wants to get her bachelor's degree. Mr. Speaker, \nCori and her two daughters will be denied the child tax credit, while \nthose making more than $1 million a year receive overall tax cuts \ntotalling $93,500.\n  Our priority today should be, must be, the Rangel-Davis-DeLauro bill, \nwhich will expand the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief for \nlower-income working families. Passing it can be the first step to \nreversing the wrong done to these hard workers.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Davis).\n  Mr. DAVIS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of heated \ndebate about this issue all morning, but I think there is a basic \nundisputed fact that frankly should rise above the fray: there was no \neffort to limit this tax break until the end game of the conference \nreport process, when the administration and those who were shaping the \ntax cut needed to find $3 billion.\n  When they needed to do that, they did not search the high end of the \nbracket; they did not search the offshore loopholes. They went into the \npockets of people who need tax relief more than anyone else. That was a \nchoice of priorities. It was a statement that the people who do the \nhardest work in this country are, frankly, the ones who would be asked \nto sacrifice first.\n  I wonder what the people of this country will think, what our \nconstituents will think, when they hear that\n\n[[Page H5015]]\n\nunder the rules of this House they do not even deserve a vote. I wonder \nwhat the people who work every single day will think when they hear \nthat a child tax break for them will be welfare. I wonder what these \nindividuals who bear the brunt of payroll taxes will think when they \nhear that they do not need a tax credit because they really are not \ntaxpayers. I wonder what the parents in my district, who begin paying \ntaxes in the State of Alabama at $4,000, will think when they hear that \nthey do not need tax relief.\n  This plan, as we knew from the beginning, strikes the wrong \npriorities. It leaves out people who are most in need of help, Mr. \nSpeaker. I think that it is incumbent on us as a matter of conscience \nthat we correct this imbalance.\n  This is the work that we ought to do for the people, that of \ncorrecting imbalances where they exist and that of correcting \ninequities where they exist, and not looking into the pockets of our \nweakest people to balance our budget.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel).\n  (Mr. EMANUEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow morning the new unemployment \nnumbers come out, and we are probably close to nearly 3 million people \nthat will have lost their jobs in the last 2 years. We have added $3 \ntrillion to the Nation's debt. That has been the end result of this \neconomic plan.\n  Now, what we are looking for here is 12 million children of working \nparents to get a tax cut and be treated like the rest of America's \nchildren. These are children of working people. Some, as the Children's \nDefense Fund report shows, are the children of our Armed Forces. They \nare also children of the law enforcement community, firefighters, \nfirst-year teachers, people who work in security in our office \nbuildings across this country, people who work day in and day out \nputting their hours in and trying to teach their children right from \nwrong.\n  What has gone on here is what is wrong with this House today. We came \nhere not just to be votes but to give voice to our values. I know there \nare good people with good values on the other side of the aisle. There \nis nothing just in the notion of denying 12 million children, 6\\1/2\\ \nmillion families who work full-time, denying those children who are \nalso America's children a tax cut. We can depreciate the machinery of \nour corporations, depreciate the value of their machinery; but we \ncannot appreciate America's children.\n  I was part of an administration that created and extended the $500-\nper-child tax credit and gave health insurance to 10 million uninsured \nchildren whose parents worked full time.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  We balanced the budget. We also provided tax cuts in capital gains, \nbut we balanced the budget. It was in balance with our values. These \nare not the values we espoused on Memorial Day when we welcomed home \nour veterans and remembered them for what they had done for this \ncountry. This vote should also be remembered.\n  We can do right. We can correct the wrong, hold our heads up high, \nnot wear this in shame for what it does.\n  These are 12 million of America's children. Let us do right. Let us \nremember them as we do every day, trying to do right by our values.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for \nyielding me time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out for my friends on the other \nside of the aisle that I was prepared, as were my colleagues earlier \nthis week, to vote in favor of this bill and suspension that would \nprotect lands around the Grand Tetons, Wyoming. In fact, my in-laws are \nhomesteaded around the Grand Tetons in Wyoming and I know they were \nvery much in favor of seeing this land preserved for ages to come, \nincluding my children and their grandchildren.\n  We voted to strike it down to make a point, that there are 12 million \nchildren who would not be served by the recent tax cut that you imposed \nupon this country. In fact, in USA Today today, there is an article \nthat says one out of five of those 12 million children who will not be \ngetting a benefit, the families that will get a benefit of the child \ntax credit, are serving in our military today. Their parents are \nserving in the military, the same military that brought us the victory \nand did so much to preserve what this country stands for in the \nconflict in Iraq.\n  I have news for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Working \npeople, believe it or not, working people have children. Working people \nhave children. Working people make and made this country what it is \ntoday. Do not forget the working people of this country.\n  Do not forget the working people of this country. They deserve and \nneed a child tax credit just as much as the wealthiest people in this \ncountry. They are the men and women who, day in and day out, provide \nfor this country, for the backbone of this country.\n  It is interesting that there was a move on earlier this week as well \nand a bill that was supposed to come before us today that would have \neliminated comp time as well. This week has been an attack upon the \nworking families of our Nation, and the Republican party should be \nashamed of themselves.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the very real concerns of \nthe Zuni tribe and its children.\n  This bill would provide critical access to the Little Colorado River \nBasin to allow the Zuni Indian Tribe acquisition of surface water \nrights and development of groundwater. The acquisition of water rights \nand associated lands are vital to the Zuni Indian Tribe's future \neconomic development; and, along those same lines, the child tax credit \nis critical in helping low-income families, including Zunis, achieve \nsome level of economic security.\n  This bill secures tribal rights to assured water supplies for present \nand future generations, while at the same time providing for the sound \nmanagement of an increasingly scarce resource. Because of the \nimportance and sacredness all forms and sources of water, all prayers \nand songs of the three major components of the Zuni religion contain \nlanguage asking for rain and snow to ensure that all crops have enough \nwater to finish their life paths to provide sustenance for their Zuni \nchildren. Likewise, enduring access to the child tax credit will help \nZuni families provide economic sustenance to their children.\n  By now, the whole Nation knows what happened 2 weeks ago. They know \nthat a tax credit which would have helped nearly 12 million children \nfrom 6.5 million low-income families, including Zuni families, was \nsecretly eliminated by the administration and the gentleman from Texas' \n(Mr. DeLay) Republican majority.\n  These families, these Zuni families earn between $10,500 and $26,625 \nper year, families who really need this tax cut and, yes, they do pay \ntaxes and they are important.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) said we have more important \nmatters. These Zuni children are important. In Arizona, 138,000 \nfamilies with children, 21 percent of the families in the State, are \nnot helped by the child tax credit increase because of the Republicans' \nlast-minute actions. 403,000 Arizona children would be eligible if the \nchild tax credit were made fully refundable, with an additional \n$259,000 million in credit going to families in the State.\n  This House ought to be about the working families in this country, \nthose who are Zunis and those who are not. We promised them a child tax \ncredit, and this majority removed it to provide the opportunity for \n$93,000 in tax cuts to the richest 184,000 millionaires in the country.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Strickland).\n  Mr. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my Republican \ncolleagues in this House. Why would you, in a fit of anger because you \nwere not able to get the size of the tax cut you wanted, hold poor \nlittle children hostage in order to extract a larger tax cut for those \nwho were already wealthy?\n  It is a fair question.\n  In the middle of the night, over one-half million Ohio children were \nexcluded from this benefit. Those are\n\n[[Page H5016]]\n\nchildren who have moms and dads who are working but their incomes are \nso low that they may not be required to pay income taxes. But let me \ntell you, they pay property taxes. They pay Social Security/payroll \ntaxes. They pay all kinds of other taxes. Oh, it is very clever of you \nto say they do not pay income tax.\n  I am absolutely disgusted with what has happened in this House. CNN \nreported that the conservative leader of your party, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. DeLay), brushed aside criticism that the tax bill did not \nexpand the child tax credit and make it available to millions of poor \nfamilies. But, he said, House Republicans might support doing so if it \nprodded senators to vote for a broader tax package. In other words, you \nmay be willing to help the poor kids if it means you can get more money \nfor your rich friends. It is as simple as that, as simple as that.\n  These are just not the rantings of a Democrat. Let me tell you what \nSenator John McCain said about it. Senator McCain said, My God, what \nkind of message are we sending when we leave out low-income families, \nexactly those who are in that category of the enlisted men and women \nwho are fighting for us in Iraq today? It is beyond belief.\n  And it is beyond belief, but you have got time to redeem yourself. \nYou have got time to change this policy and take care of the kids, \n500,000 in Ohio, who need your help.\n\n\n                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Members should refrain from \nquoting members of the other body.\n  The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on the other side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) \nhas 27 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how many speakers does the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Hastings) have to discuss this issue?\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. The issue, of course, we are discussing \nis the rule for the two suspension bills that we, unfortunately, had \nmajority vote earlier this week but, unfortunately, did not have the \ntwo-thirds. But we may have, counting myself, two speakers between now \nand the time we close.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman want to use some of his \ntime now?\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we have used up several speakers. I think \nfor balance, if one of the gentleman's speakers is here, they could go.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston).\n  (Mr. KINGSTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks, and include extraneous material.)\n  Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me \ntime.\n  I wanted to say to my colleagues in the House, I certainly intend to \nstay on the subject matter of this rule equally as much as all the \nDemocrats who have been speaking at least.\n  I want to talk to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about \nthis child tax refundable credit which they are so indignant about. \nBecause I want to remind them, you all had nothing to do with putting \nit on the books, nothing. We were glad that you like it because it was \na Republican idea, but every single one of you, every single one of \nyour speakers has voted against it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to help you a little bit out here and just kind \nof remind you so far we have heard from the gentleman from New York \n(Mr. Crowley), the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the \ngentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones), the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSherman), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Strickland), the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey), \nand the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), all good folks. \nHowever, they have all voted against this refundable tax credit, May \n16, 2001, when the Republicans put it on the books. I do not know what \nyou were thinking.\n  This thing that you were pretending to champion, you voted against. \nIt was a Republican idea. Where were you when the battle was being \nfought? I am going to review a little bit of history, and let me say to \nthis, you all are looking around stunned which I understand.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. KINGSTON. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, if it was such a good idea, number one, \nwhy did you remove it? Number two, I do not recall us ever having voted \non this in the House. It was inserted in the Senate. Let us be \naccurate.\n  Mr. KINGSTON. Reclaiming my time, let me jog the gentleman's memory. \nHere is what the situation was, and the gentleman is a distinguished \nmember of the Committee on Rules and has lots of bills that pass \nthrough his desk, so I will not hold you responsible for knowing \neverything.\n  Prior to 2001, the child tax credit was $500 per child. It was passed \nunder a Republican bill and, as the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nEmanuel) pointed out, it was signed by President Clinton. So you can \nclaim a little bipartisanship there, even though that was passed by \nRepublican votes when it was in the House, but prior to 2001 the child \ntax credit was $500. The credit was not refundable for most families. \nHowever, for a family with three kids or more, the credit was \nrefundable; and it was not offset by the earned income tax credit. That \nwas prior to 2001.\n  Now enter President Bush and the 2001 tax cut. Under that, the \nproposal was to increase the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000. The \ncredit was $600 for the year 2003, and it was scheduled to reach $1,000 \nper child in 2010. That law made the child tax credit partially \nrefundable for all families with children, not just those who had three \nkids or more.\n  Now, we had the vote on that May 16, 2001, and I have got the Roll \nCall from that, and at that time every one of you all voted against it. \nAs a matter of fact, 197 Democrats voted against this.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats come out here looking for some \nrhetoric, and the big rhetoric of the Democratic party this year really \nthat has been led by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) is, \nwe could have torn that statue down a lot cheaper.\n  I know a lot of folks are against the war. And then it was, well, the \nplan is not working when we were going up the Euphrates. And then as \nsoon as they tore down the statue, I know a lot of folks on the left, \nand I want to say not all the members of the Democrat party but a lot \nof folks on the left were disturbed that a 23-year-old Marine corporal \nwho was in theater had the audacity of hanging an American flag on a \nSaddam Hussein statue. Of course, he was denounced in the liberal, \nleft-wing community for doing that.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. KINGSTON. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, that is a little unfair. I do not think anyone \nobjected to flags being flown and so forth. You make a good point on \nsome of the other things, but that is a little unfair on the flag.\n  Mr. KINGSTON. Let me say to my friend from Tennessee, that is why I \nsaid not all the Democrats but a lot of folks on the left denounced the \nfact that that flag was hung.\n  Mr. FORD. That is unfair.\n  Mr. KINGSTON. I would also point out that you were not one of them.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. KINGSTON. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. That is outrageous.\n  Mr. KINGSTON. Reclaiming my time, I will yield further to you in just \none second.\n  I am very pleased that you all are listening. Let me do this, because \nI am being generous here, but my ranking member of the Committee on \nRules says that maybe we should do this a little bit more on your time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern).\n\n[[Page H5017]]\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Let me say for the record what I am outraged at what is \nin the paper today, that nearly one in five children of U.S. military \nfamilies will not benefit from the increased tax credit signed by \nPresident Bush.\n  Mr. KINGSTON. I am glad that not only does the gentleman listen to \nfine speeches like mine, but he also reads the paper, which is very \ngood.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  I suspect it is probably The New York Times or The Washington Post.\n  Let me just say this, does that article point out that my colleagues \nvoted against phasing in the tax cut, the refundability, in 2001? That \nis all I want to say.\n  What I would love to hear from our Democrat colleagues, Mr. Speaker, \nwho are saying I voted against this tax cut and a tax cut which was a \njobs bill, took 3 million working families off the tax roll, 3 million, \nand I understand they wanted them on. We thought it would be helpful \nfor the working families of America to get off the tax roll. The \nreality is they voted against it. They wanted to keep them on. I \nunderstand that. I just wish they would acknowledge in the year 2001 \nthat they voted against the child tax refundability clause, and I have \nthe vote in my hand; and I can submit it for the Record, Mr. Speaker, \nand do that.\n  If my colleagues want to be helpful, what they ought to do on some of \nthese tax bills that are aimed at creating jobs is say, hey, we want to \namend the bill and we will do this. We will do this in a spirit of a \ndemocratic, small D, democratic House and process. We are going to vote \nfor the bill if we put in some of their ideas, because this is the way \nit really should work, the best of their party and the best of our \nparty combined together to put out just the best thoughts and do what \nis right for working families.\n  Let me point out that a family of four making $11,000 a year pays no \nincome tax, pays about $842 in payroll taxes and receives $4,140 under \nthe earned income tax credit. We think that is good. We think it also \nwould be helpful, though, if my colleagues could join us in making \nthese child tax credits permanent because their idea that they are \nconcerned about now might have some merits. Why do they not join us in \nsaying we are going to make these child tax credits permanent? We are \nnot going to do a bait and switch, when in the year 2011 they are gone.\n  While we are at it, because we all know that a family of mom and dad \nhave great potential for stability, why do we not end the marriage tax \npenalty together? Again, I throw out an olive branch to my colleagues, \ncould they join us in making the marriage tax penalty permanent? That \nwould be very helpful for the working poor. There are so many things \nthat we could do together.\n  Another idea is the 10 percent tax bracket, the 10 percent rate. \nCould my colleagues join us in making that permanent? These are all \nthings that could help the working poor.\n  We are not going to say we have the franchise on helping the working \npoor just because we voted to take 3 million off the payrolls and my \ncolleagues voted against it. We are saying maybe they can join us on \nthe next job creation package and come up with something that is in the \nbest interest of all of us.\n  I would love to yield to the gentleman from Tennessee, but we are \ngetting to the point we have got a lot of Members who want to go ahead \nand have a vote, and I am a little concerned about that.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield for a quick question?\n  Mr. KINGSTON. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, what is the problem then if my colleagues \nbelieve in removing all these taxes, which I think there is a lot of \nmerit to, I am a big tax cutter like the gentleman is? I support those \nideas. How is that consistent with the taking 3 million, or I should \nsay up to 12 million, children or removing them from the target of a \ntax cut which my colleagues did, they voted for it?\n  Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, let me say this. Our \nobjective is to get people working, and that was the real goal of this \nto get folks working.\n  Let me say this to my friend from Tennessee: if the gentleman wants \nto join us in making the child tax credit permanent; the marriage tax \npenalty, eliminate it permanently; the 10 percent tax credit, make that \npermanent, he and I need to get together because I think we can move \nthe ball down the road, and that is all we want to do.\n  I am just saying that the planned, orchestrated campaign of the \nDemocrat Party to denounce something that they all voted against in the \nyear 2002, I just wish the speakers would say I voted against this in \n2001, but it is a great idea and now I am mad that the Republicans are \nnot doing it this way; I want it done even though I did not share any \nof the burden by being responsible and voting for it.\n  I want to end with this. There are a lot of differences between the \nDemocrat and the Republican parties. They seem to be the group of \nfrivolous lawsuits and starving trial lawyers. We are the party of tort \nreform, ending frivolous medical liabilities, making health care \naffordable and accessible. They seem to like unemployment checks and \ngovernment handouts. We like paychecks, jobs and opportunities.\n  They like welfare and low expectations. We like welfare reform, jobs.\n  Mr. FORD. . . .\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). The gentleman from Tennessee is \ndefinitely out of order, has not been recognized, and the Chair would \nappreciate it if the gentleman would not speak when the other gentleman \nhas the time.\n  Mr. FORD. . . .\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee is not \nrecognized. The Chair would ask the gentleman to take his seat. The \nChair would ask the gentleman to take a seat. The gentleman from \nGeorgia may continue.\n  Mr. FORD. . . .\n  Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, here is the situation with welfare reform, \nMr. Speaker. We passed welfare reform at a time when there were 14 \nmillion people on welfare. At that time, we were called all kinds of \nnames, and they were saying it was heartless and we were mean-spirited \nand everything else and that these folks were unable to help \nthemselves. What is interesting is in 1996 when we passed welfare \nreform, we had 14 million people on welfare. Today, that number is down \nto 5 million people, too high; but we need to continue working on that. \nThe 9 million people are now tax paying, working, enjoying the \nopportunity, sharing in the American Dream. They are glad that we \npassed welfare reform.\n  There is a component in this that the Democrats are proposing which \nis simply welfare, and I think there may be some merit in that. I have \nno trouble at all in a healthy discussion on tinkering with welfare \nreform. This is good for everybody, but what our tax package was about \nwas creating jobs, and we are going to continue to be the party of \nwelfare reform, jobs and opportunity.\n\n                      Committee on Ways and Means\n\n\n                 child credit refundability fact sheet\n\n       What was the child credit prior to 2001?\n       Prior to 2001, the child credit was $500 per eligible \n     child. The credit was not refundable for most families. \n     However, for families with 3 or more eligible children, the \n     credit was refundable to the extent the family had payroll \n     tax liability that was not offset by the Earned Income Credit \n     (EIC).\n       How was the child credit expanded in 2001?\n       The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2001 significantly expanded the child credit in two important \n     ways.\n       (1) The law gradually increased the credit from $500 to \n     $1,000. The credit was $600 for 2003 and was scheduled to \n     reach $1,000 in 2010.\n       (2) The law made the child credit partially refundable for \n     all families with children--not just those with 3 or more \n     children. The credit is now refundable by an amount equal to \n     10 percent of the family's earned income in excess of \n     $10,000. The $10,000 threshold is indexed annually for \n     inflation (it is $10,500 for 2003), and the 10 percent \n     refundability rate will increase to 15 percent in 2005.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                NAYS--197\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAckerman                Harman                    Neal\nAllen                   Hastings (FL)             Oberstar\nAndrews                 Hill                      Obey\nBaca                    Hilliard                  Olver\nBaird                   Hinchey                   Ortiz\nBaldacci                Hinojosa                  Owens\nBaldwin                 Hoeffel                   Pallone\nBarcia                  Holden                    Pascrell\nBarrett                 Holt                      Pastor\nBecerra                 Honda                     Payne\nBentsen                 Hooley                    Pelosi\nBerkley                 Hoyer                     Peterson (MN)\nBerman                  Inslee                    Phelps\nBerry                   Israel                    Pomeroy\nBlagojevich             Jackson (IL)              Price (NC)\n\n[[Page H5018]]\n\n \nBlumenauer              Jackson-Lee (TX)          Rahall\nBonior                  Jefferson                 Rangel\nBorski                  Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Georgia \nhis tax package is about welfare for the rich. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nto the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, what incredible nonsense we have heard here \non the floor of the House this afternoon, this attempt to raise the \nflag and besmirch Members of this House over their stance on the \nAmerican flag practically on the eve of Flag Day.\n  Let me tell the gentleman (Mr. Kingston), there are two kinds of \npeople today that have the American flag wrapped around them. Some of \nthem are young men and women who come back in coffins with the flag \ndraped around it, who gave their all in the ultimate sacrifice for this \ncountry; and all of us honor them, whatever our views about the \nPresident's policy. But the other kind of people we do not honor, and \nit is those who choose to wrap their own bad policies that they cannot \ndefend by stretching the flag around themselves.\n  What are the merits of the argument about the child tax credit? Who \ncame up with it in the first place? I think the names are Al Gore and \nTom Downey, who both served in this body who long ago presented a child \ntax credit proposal. How did it become law? It eventually became law \nwith the signature of a Democratic President in 1997 when we passed the \nBalanced Budget Act with the support of a large number of Members on \nboth sides of this aisle, balancing the budget, not busting it as this \nRepublican tax bill would do.\n  The child tax credit has had strong Democratic support within our \ncaucus and within the Committee on Ways and Means on which I serve, and \nthe only reason any Democrat has voted against that child tax credit on \nthis floor was when it was used, much as the flag has been misused this \nafternoon, as the reason for voting for a bill that gave most all of \nthe help to the people at the top and none of the people at the bottom.\n  I am glad that my colleague from Texas (Mr. DeLay) has joined us this \nafternoon. He has announced to the American people that there are more \nimportant things to do than to ensure that the child tax credit is \navailable to people that earn a mere $20,000, $25,000 a year. Who are \nthose people? They are the people that empty the bed pans at the \nnursing homes. They are the cafeteria workers in our public schools. \nThey are the people that we check out with at the gas station when we \ngo in to pay for our gas. They are people that are sweeping the floors \ntoday at the hospitals around America.\n  Why do those young women and men not have an opportunity to get the \nsame type of child tax credit available to those at the top? They are \nworking. Some of them are working two and three jobs to have a chance \nto advance out of poverty and share in the American Dream. They respect \nthe flag just as much as the gentleman from Georgia does, but they \nwould also like to share in a little of the American Dream.\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 \nminutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the distinguished \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, my, my, my, what a heated debate we are \nhaving today. I came to the well to talk about what this debate is all \nabout. A lot has been left out by those Members on the other side of \nthe aisle because they are afraid for the truth to surface, so I wanted \nto bring the real facts about what is going on here.\n  The child tax credit provision in this new tax law is refundable, and \nit is refundable to the extent 10 percent of earned income in excess of \n$10,500, people that make $10,500 get a refundable tax rebate. In 2005, \nthe 10 percent rate goes up to 15 percent.\n  What this fight is over is there was a provision in the Senate that \nbasically said they wanted to accelerate that 2 years, and we may want \nto do that in the proper way under regular order; but what the \nDemocrats are angry about is that we did not accelerate that spending \nincrease; and thanks to the tax relief passed by Republican Congresses \nover the last 8 years, 13 million American families have had their \nentire income tax liability eliminated, eliminated.\n  The gentleman from Texas brings up who are these people. I would like \nto show my colleagues one. Here is a married couple earning $30,000 \nwith three children. Before the 2001 law, that they voted against, this \nmarried couple would be paying a marginal rate of 15 percent, which \nmeans their income tax liability is over $1,000 and their payroll tax \nliability is $2,160. Before the 2001 law, they would get a $1,500 \ncredit, and they would get an earned income tax credit of $782, which \nmeans that their income tax liability was zero. They still had a \npayroll tax liability; but because of EITC, the payment from the \ngovernment was zero.\n  So after 2001, this same family would have an income tax liability of \n$688, $2,160 from their payroll tax liability; but they get $1,800 in a \nchild tax credit, and they get a $992 earned income tax credit, which \nmeans that their income tax liability is still zero, but their payroll \ntax liability goes down to $48.\n  After this law that the President passed that they voted against, \nthat the President signed a week ago, this same family is going to have \nan income tax liability of $525, payroll tax liability of $2,160, but \nthey get a child tax credit of $2,475, and they get an earned income \ntax credit of $992, which actually helps them pay not only for their \npayroll taxes; it reimburses them for their payroll taxes. They pay no \nincome taxes. They actually get a check for $782.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  A check from the American taxpayers. No tax liability, but they get \nto put $782 in their pocket.\n  Now, let us take a single mother that makes $20,000 and has two \nchildren. They are going through the same thing. What has happened to \nher is she gets a check of over $1,000. Over $1,000. She pays no \npayroll taxes, she pays no income taxes, and she gets a check for \n$1,000. They voted against that. They voted against that.\n  Now they want to come and tell the American people they are all tax \nrelievers. Now all of a sudden they are tax relievers, and they want to \ngive more tax relief to the taxpaying public and to people that do not \nhave a tax liability.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. DeLAY. They fail to----\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, may I have order?\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I just want to ask the gentleman if he will yield for a \nquick question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). The gentleman from Texas has \nthe time.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. I understand.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not yielding to the \ngentlewoman. The gentleman may proceed.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. . . .\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not yielding. The gentleman \nmay proceed.\n\n[[Page H5019]]\n\n  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, what has happened here is they also do not \nwant to mention that in the bill signed by the President last week we \nraised by 10 percent and added more people to the rolls that do not pay \nincome taxes. So this notion that we are not taking care of the poor \nworking families of this country are completely false; and, most \nimportantly, they voted against it. We passed it without their votes, \nmoved forward, gave tax relief to poor working families in this \ncountry; and we will continue to do so.\n  When the Senate does something, we always take it into consideration \nand we will move forward. I would just remind the Members of this House \nthat we have now almost a trillion dollars left in the budget to do \nmore tax relief for the American people, and we are coming back. We are \ngoing to have at least two if not three more tax relief packages for \nthe American people. Because we feel very strongly that we need jobs in \nthis country, we need economic growth in this country, and American \nfamilies need to keep more of their hard-earned money\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Will the gentleman \nyield on the tax question?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's time has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Rangel).\n  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would hope that the distinguished majority \nleader would extend the courtesy to his Members and not leave the \nfloor. It is so important when Members have something to say to correct \ntheir position that they stay on the floor, not for Democrats but for \nRepublicans as well.\n  This is a very edifying thing that he said in the well of the House. \nHe is trying to rebut the allegations that we have made that in the \nlast tax bill that the working people in the lower incomes were \ndeliberately left out of the bill. Now, my colleague can go back to \nlast year, the year before last, 10 years from now, but the accusation \nwas made and still stands. The accusation is that the Republican \nleadership cared more about accelerating tax relief for the wealthiest \npeople than they did for working people.\n  So let us not come here and mislead and make these statements and \nwalk off the floor. There is a tendency for all of us to be out of \norder when we see the arrogance, the indifference, and the lack of \nrespect that certain Members, especially those in the leadership, have \nfor those that have to work here each and every day.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMcGovern) has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining and the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Hastings) has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  As I pointed out earlier, this is a rule on two suspensions that were \nunfortunately defeated earlier this week that deal with serious matters \nin the southwestern part of the United States, at least one of them \ndoes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nRenzi) to speak on one of these matters.\n  Mr. RENZI. Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out to my colleagues \nthat what we are here to debate is the rule as it affects the Zuni \ntribe of New Mexico and Arizona as it affects the sacred lands and \nthose lands right now that have no water.\n  We were able to provide them with enough land in 1984 to establish \nZuni Heaven in Arizona, a reservation, and yet without Senator Kyl's \nintervention we would not have been able to achieve the kind of water \nthat we see the communities in rural Arizona supplying now.\n  This summer, while we debate separate issues, the Zuni people are \nhoping to engage in their 4-year migration and trek to their holy \nlands, to their holy site. So the delay that we imposed 2 days ago, the \ndelay we impose today affects their ability to plan and celebrate this \nagreement. And there is all kinds of agreement, I think even from both \nsides, if my colleagues will allow us to get to it. We need to be able \nto restore the tribe's ability to perform not only the religious duties \nbut the farming and subsistence that they need in order to care for \ntheir children.\n  So when we talk about children today, the Zuni people themselves are \nwaiting to plant their crops and feed their children. They are waiting \nto take their children to their sacred lands, their wetlands, to teach \ntheir children their sacred rights. There will be no more delay if we \ncan get this to a vote. Each day, each hour, each minute we allow to \npass, the Zuni people feel there are inequities and that the agreement \ncannot be reached.\n  For the record, I want the Zuni people to know that what they see \nhere today does not reflect upon them as a people. There are hours and \ntimes, Special Orders available in this House for this issue to be \ndebated. Instead, my colleagues have taken their issue and turned this \ninto a side show.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this \ntime. And since I could not get the gentleman from Texas to answer a \nsimple question for me, maybe I can pose a question to his colleagues \nand see if we can get an answer.\n  It appears in fact that the Senate has come to some agreement; that \nthe Senate has said on a bipartisan basis that we need to address the \nfact that 12 million children were left out of the equation; that they \nwere supposed to be able to have the benefit of a $400 tax credit, \nthese 6.5 million families. The Senate has come to an agreement with \nabout a $10 billion package.\n  I want to get an answer from the Republican side of the aisle as to \nwhether or not they will bring up the Senate package for us to be able \nto deliberate and help those 12 million children and those 6.5 million \nhouseholds. The Senate has done it; we ought to be able to do it here \nand to address that issue.\n  If we can, we would like to get an answer to that question.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto see if anyone on the other side wants to respond. We are waiting.\n  Mr. Speaker, I guess we are not going to get an answer to that \nquestion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee \n(Mr. Ford).\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, I want you to know I mean no disrespect to you \npersonally or to the institution, but the notion that somehow welfare \nhas any role in this debate is asinine. My colleagues know and we know, \nas do those watching know, certainly our colleagues in the Senate know, \nthat everyone we are discussing today with regard to this child tax \ncredit are working people.\n  The welfare reform package that passed this Congress passed before I \ngot here, so it is easy for me to say I would have voted for it, since \nI was not here. But I can assure my colleagues that my votes since that \ntime are consistent with that.\n  Now, I appreciate the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) coming down \nhere, but what he did, I think, was to lay out pretty clearly for those \non our side and the other side just the difference in priorities. Our \npriorities differ in great ways from the Republicans. Many of us like \ntax cuts; my Republican colleagues like tax cuts. We think tax cuts \nshould benefit more people, the Republicans think they should benefit a \nlesser group of people. No disrespect to you. Do not mean to ridicule \nmy colleagues personally, but there are complete differences in \npriorities and realities.\n  The reality is what we are discussing today. People earning $25,000 a \nyear or less make up a good portion of America. Frankly, those of us on \nthis floor, that is a fraction of what we earn year in and year out. \nAnd how dare we, as we pass a tax cut bill, how dare we say that we \nhave done enough for people that make $11,000, $12,000, $13,000, \n$14,000 and $15,000 a year. How dare we say that to their children, \nwhen the facts betray everything that you believe and I believe.\n  Frankly, if these children whom we are denying this tax credit to \ncould vote, they would vote all of us out of office. As many times as \nwe have lied to them about building new schools and putting more \nteachers in the classrooms, they would fire the President, might have \neven fired the former President.\n\n[[Page H5020]]\n\n  So let us be honest. We deny 12 million children a tax credit. No \nfunny math, no Enron accounting, no Arthur Andersen accounting can \nrefute that. We should do better and we can.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this \ntime. A question was posed and unanswered. We can wait for an answer, \nif my colleagues have one.\n  Is there no answer to the question?\n  Apparently, there is no answer, I tell the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut, to the question she posed. Let me tell her and my \ncolleagues why.\n  Mr. Speaker, yesterday syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington, no \nDemocrat and no liberal, and very wealthy, said this in the Los Angeles \nTimes, and I quote: ``A magnetic compass always points north; a moral \ncompass should always point out that heaping billions on the rich while \nensuring that one out of six American children do not get a penny is \ndead wrong.''\n  Dead wrong. Arianna Huffington. Not the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer), not the Democrats, not those fuzzy-headed liberals my \nRepublican colleagues like to talk about, but Arianna Huffington. She \ncontinued: ``But that's exactly what congressional Republicans did in \npushing through tax cut legislation last month, and that's what \nPresident Bush signed off on.'' Arianna Huffington.\n  Mr. Speaker, America now knows that the GOP's moral compass lies \nshattered on the conference room floor where the final deals on the \nRepublican tax bill were cut 2 weeks ago.\n  Why did the majority leader leave the floor? The majority leader left \nthe floor because he used an example just above the $28,000, where he \nwould have been wrong. My colleagues, the moral compass is absent.\n  There was a report that showed that the policies in 2001 and 2003 are \nleading to a $44.4 trillion deficit. Who did that? Two people in the \nBush administration asked to do that report and OMB. And guess what? \nThey stonewalled the report. Why? Because they did not want the \nmagnitude of the debt tax that we are imposing on every American family \nknown while at the same time, when they had no lobbyist in that hall, \nthose 12 million children, who did not have somebody highly paid to sit \nin that hallway and say do not cut us, found themselves cut out of the \nbill that in the still and dark of the night, with no Democrats \npresent, was brought out to this floor, pages and pages of bill, with \nminutes to review it.\n  Arianna Huffington is correct. Shame, shame, shame.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining 30 seconds. I \nurge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we \ncan help millions of children and working families. We have heard the \nother side defend the indefensible.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. Speaker, if they do not want to help millions of working \nfamilies, they should at least have the guts to go on record as voting \nno instead of hiding behind procedures. So let this House work its \nwill. Let us have a little democracy in this Chamber. Vote on the \nprevious question so we can bring up the Rangel bill and literally help \nmillions of children in this country.\n\nWorking Families Tax Credit Act of 2003--Summary of H.R. 2286, June 4, \n                                  2003\n\n       Republicans have left moderate-income families behind in \n     their zeal to cut taxes on millionaires, contrary to their \n     ``leave no child behind'' rhetoric.\n       H.R. 2286 helps moderate-income working families and is \n     revenue neutral.\n\n\n                               provisions\n\n       Provides Child Credit to More Working Families: Lowers to \n     $7,500 (from $10,500) the amount of the wages a family must \n     have before refundability of the child credit begins. This is \n     identical to a provision that was included in the house \n     Democratic alternative on the economic stimulus legislation. \n     The credit would be allowed for approximately 19 million \n     additional children by reason of this change.\n       Increases Benefit for Working Families: Increases partial \n     refundability from 10 percent of wages to 15 percent of \n     wages. Again, this is identical to a provision that was \n     included in the Democratic alternative. This would result in \n     an average credit increase of over $300 per child.\n       Helps Families of Soldiers in Combat: Allows refundability \n     for families of soldiers in combat zones even though combat \n     wages are not taxed.\n       Speeds up Marriage Penalty Relief for Lower Income Working \n     Couples: Makes effective immediately the marriage penalty \n     relief in the Earned Income Tax Credit that was provided in \n     the 2001 tax cut. This is the only marriage penalty relief \n     not accelerated in the recently enacted tax bill.\n       Does Not Increase the Deficit: Closes corporate loopholes: \n     prohibits tax shelters, and taxes corporations that move \n     headquarters offshore (expatriates).\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment \nand description of the amendment be printed in the Record immediately \nbefore the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, this is a rule on two suspension \nbills that were, unfortunately, not passed earlier this week. They are \nvery important bills to those areas that are affected.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the chart that the \ndistinguished majority leader discussed earlier today.\n\n            EXAMPLES: REFUNDABILITY OF CHILD CREDIT FOR 2003\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Pre-2001\n                                            law      2001 law   2003 law\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Example 1: Married couple earning $30,000 with 3 children\n \nTax liability before credits:\n    Earnings...........................     30,000     30,000     30,000\n    Standard deduction.................

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of \nmy time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a \nquorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Evidently a quorum is not present.\n  The Sergeant at Arms will notify absent Members.\n  Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes \nthe minimum time for electronic voting,

Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call up House Resolution 258 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\tThe Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 258\n\n       Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it \n     shall be in order without intervention of any point of order \n     to consider in the House the bill (S. 222) to approve the \n     settlement of the water rights claims of the Zuni Indian \n     Tribe in Apache County, Arizona, and for other purposes. The \n     bill shall be considered as read for amendment. The previous \n     question shall be considered as ordered on the bill to final \n     passage without intervening motion except: (1) 40 minutes of \n     debate on the bill equally divided and controlled by the \n     chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     Resources; and (2) one motion to recommit.\n       Sec. 2. Upon the adoption of this resolution it shall be in \n     order without intervention of any point of order to consider \n     in the House the bill (S. 273) to provide for the expeditious \n     completion of the acquisition of land owned by the State of \n     Wyoming within the boundaries of Grand Teton National Park, \n     and for other purposes. The bill shall be considered as read \n     for amendment. The previous question shall be considered as \n     ordered on the bill to final passage without intervening \n     motion except: (1) 40 minutes of debate on the bill equally \n     divided and controlled by the chairman and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Resources; and (2) one motion to \n     recommit.\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) is recognized for 1 hour.\n\tMr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.\n  (Mr. HASTINGS of Washington asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 258 is a closed rule providing for the consideration of two measures, S. 222, the Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act, and S. 273, the Grand Teton National Park Land Exchange Act.\n\tThe rule provides that S. 222 shall be debatable in the House for 40 minutes, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Resources. The rule also waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and provides one motion to recommit, with or without instruction.\n\tThe rule further provides that S. 273 shall be debatable in the House for 40 minutes, equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the Committee on Resources.\n\tFinally, the rule waives all points of order against consideration of the bill and provides one motion to recommit, with or without instructions.\n\tMr. Speaker, both of the bills covered by this rule were considered by the House under suspension of the rules on June 3. Neither bill was adopted, having failed to receive the required two-thirds of the votes cast, but each bill was supported by a clear majority in the House.\n\tThe Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act approves a settlement of the water rights claims of the Zuni Indian Tribe in Apache County, Arizona. The bill resolves all of the claims of the Zuni Tribe to water rights in the Little Colorado River basin and elsewhere in Arizona. The bill also provides resources to restore riparian wetlands to the Zuni Heaven Reservation that are of great religious and cultural significance to the tribe and its members.\n\tThe Grand Teton National Park Land Exchange Act provides for the acquisition of land owned by the State of Wyoming within the boundaries of the Grand Teton National Park. These lands, rich in wildlife habitat, will be exchanged for other Federal lands or assets of equal value. In turn, the State will be able to acquire lands that have greater potential to generate revenue for public schools, ensuring that the State of Wyoming meets its constitutional mandate to maximize revenues from its school trust lands.\n\tMr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that we are forced to take up the valuable time of the House to consider for a second time this week two measures that have been previously approved by a solid majority in this House. The measures have been fully debated.\n\tAccordingly, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and pass the underlying bills without further delay.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 6 minutes. I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding me the time.\n\tMr. Speaker, this morning during the debate on the Check 21 open rule, I warned this body that open rules are a rarity, an endangered species, if you will. Well, here we are about to consider not an open rule but a closed rule on two noncontroversial bills. But what do you expect? This is the norm. This is business as usual in this House.\n\tI also want this Chamber and the American people to remember this moment, because it is historic. This also is a rarity here. We finally have seen a tax cut that the Republicans do not like. In the dead of night, faced with the decision of either providing tax relief for 12 million working families or giving a tax cut to Donald Trump, the Republicans chose Donald Trump and left the children out in the cold.\n\tAnd who exactly is left behind by this glaring omission? Nearly one in five children of our active duty military. These families are only making around $27,000 a year. They did not have the good fortune to be born with the last name of ``Gates'' or ``Buffett'' or ``Cheney.'' But they are trying to make a living, and they are doing so by serving their country. These are children of people who are fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but the Republicans, in their greed and zeal for tax cuts for their rich friends, decided these families do not need any tax relief.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n\tNow, of course, Republicans claim that they provide tax relief only for people who pay income tax, but we all know people pay more than just income tax. There is a payroll tax. There is property tax. There is a sales tax. But the Republicans in their warped thought process consider payroll tax relief and child tax credit a new form of welfare. We heard this argument earlier this morning, and it is outrageous; and quite frankly, it is insulting to these hardworking Americans.\n\tAs we all know, this could not be farther from the truth. It is the Republicans who encourage welfare in the Tax Code by giving tax breaks to corporations that flee this country for tax havens in other countries. Their disingenuous argument does not fly with the American people.\n\tMr. Speaker, the legislative process in this body is broken. There is no excuse for the majority's actions. We are here today to reconsider two bills that should have been passed under suspension of the rules. The bills are not controversial, but the majority's actions are.\n\tAs we all know, on Tuesday three bills were defeated under suspension of the rules. House Democrats using one of the few procedural tools at our disposal, voted against these bills, not on their merits but to express our frustration that the House leadership refuses to allow for consideration of a bill that would give our working families the tax relief that they deserve.\n\tSo today is also payback day. I think it is shameful and spiteful; and it is, unfortunately, very typical around here. They will not say it on the other side of the aisle, so I am going to say it right here now.\n\tWhat is the payback? Among other things, showing disrespect for one of the finest individuals ever to grace the halls of Congress. The one bill that was defeated on Tuesday that is not on today's schedule is the bill to name a Federal building in Indianapolis for former Senator Birch Bayh. We should be naming multiple courthouses in this country for Birch Bayh.\n\tTheir tactics will not work. We are not going to be intimidated. We are going to keep talking about the issues that matter to working Americans, and issues like tax fairness are high among them. If the Republicans were serious about tax relief and if they were serious about their support for working families, they would schedule a vote to reinstate this provision. That is what we are fighting for. That is what we are asking for. But they will not, because they are not serious about this. They are merely providing lip service, telling Americans what they want to hear while padding the pockets of their wealthy friends.\n\tMr. Speaker, at the end of this debate on the rule I will ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question. If the previous question is defeated, I will offer an amendment to provide for the consideration of the Rangel-Davis-DeLauro bill to help the people the Republicans would rather leave behind.\n\tMr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones).\n  (Mrs. Jones of Ohio asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.)\n\tMrs. JONES of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.\n\tMr. Speaker, the two bills that are being considered here today were great suspension bills that were on the Journal a couple of days ago. However, Democrats, in an effort to voice our concern about leaving behind millions of Americans who are low-income families, voted against those suspension bills.\n\tIn fact, Mr. Speaker, to borrow a recent popular phrase, I am shocked and awed by the consummate arrogance, fiscal irresponsibility, and candid lack of compassion of the Republican lawmakers of this body.\n\tI have been on the floor many times in the past several months expressing my outrage at the unfairness and untimeliness of the various GOP tax plans, and once again I find myself at the podium in a state of disbelief about the efforts of the self-proclaimed ``compassionate conservative party'' to exclude some of the neediest families in our Nation from tax relief in the tax bill that was signed into law last week.\n\tIn an administration that has claimed to want to leave no child behind, we are now realizing that, indeed, 12 million of them were left behind, and 521,000 in my State.\n\tIn a time where special attention is being given to our brave men and women of our Armed Forces who served so well in Iraq, I think it is inappropriate to see how these last-minute shenanigans have actually left many of them out. The majority of our military members are in the pay grades of E5 and below. These are the sergeants, petty officers, lance corporals, specialists, and airmen, whose round-the-clock efforts made the military victory in Iraq swift and decisive. But an E5 with 6 years in service makes just $24,000. His family is left behind.\n\tMr. Speaker, to borrow a recent popular phrase, I am shocked and awed by the consummate arrogance, fiscal irresponsibility, and candid lack of compassion of the Republican lawmakers of this body. I have been on this floor many times in the past several months expressing my outrage at the unfairness and untimeliness of the various GOP tax plans, and I again find myself at the podium in a state of disbelief about the self-proclaimed ``compassionate conservative' party's efforts to exclude some of the neediest families in our Nation from tax relief in the tax bill that was signed into law last week.\n\tIn an administration that has claimed to want to ``Leave no Child Behind,'' we are to realizing that there will indeed be children left behind--12 million of them in fact; 527,000 in my State of Ohio.\n\tIn a time where special attention is being given to our brave men and women of the Armed Forces who served so well in Iraq, I think it is appropriate to note how the last minute shenanigans of Republican lawmakers to strip out a provision of their tax bill that would have ensured that families making between $10,500 to $26,000 would get the full child tax credit other taxpayers get, will affect our military personnel.\n\tThe majority of our military members are in the pay grades of E-5 and below. These are the sergeants, the petty officers, the lance corporals, specialists, and airmen whose round the clock efforts made the military victory in Iraq swift and decisive. But an E-5 with 6 years in the service makes just $24,000 in base pay per year. An E-2 just new to the military makes just $15,840 in base pay. And these are just some of the millions of family members who will suffer, and their children will suffer, their spouses will suffer, because of the back door wrangling by Republicans to give even more money to the wealthiest of American taxpayers.\n\tMr. Rangel has introduced a fair and responsible alternative to address this injustice, but I am afraid it will be to little avail. Rather than focus on the important issues facing our Nation, the Republican leadership seems intent to focus on solutions in search of problems--such as this week's constitutional amendment to flag desecration. I haven't been made aware that flag desecration is a problem in this country--but every week when I return to my congressional district, I am made keenly aware that the economic health of our country is a problem. Unfortunately, ti seems to be a problem some Members of this body choose to ignore.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).\n  (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose a rule that does not allow the House to consider providing working families with the child care credit. The current situation imposes the injury of denying these working families $400 that they need and then adds the insult of telling these families that they are not taxpayers, so they do not deserve any tax relief. Of course, looking at their paycheck stubs, they see the taxes they are paying.\n\tAllowing corporations to avoid American taxes just by renting a hotel in the Bahamas, $8 billion; allowing millionaires to pay virtually nothing on their dividend income, $80 billion; eliminating the estate tax even on the largest estates, $138 billion; telling working families that they do not deserve relief and that they are not taxpayers, that is priceless.\n\tThere are some things campaign contributions just will not buy. For everything else, there is RepubliCard, accepted at the finest country clubs in the Bahamas. Members will want to get the Deficit Express card, now that the Republican Congress has increased the credit limit to $12 trillion. The Deficit Express card? Do not leave the House without it.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), the distinguished ranking member on the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  (Mr. RANGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion for the previous question so that we might have the opportunity to amend a rule and to bring to the House legislation that would bring some equity to the recently passed tax bill.\n\tI do not think many Members of the House knew that those that were making the decision would deliberately exclude the benefit of the child tax credit for people making less than $26,000. I refuse to believe that people can be so callous that they would deliberately try to make adjustments to a tax bill that was geared to, as the leadership would say, those who pay the taxes, and exclude the privilege and the opportunity for people to get credit that are in low income merely because they do not pay ``the taxes.''\n\tWe have 6.5 million working families that do pay taxes, albeit those taxes may be perceived by the majority not to be important. But they do pay taxes, and they have lost the benefits of receiving tax credits for their children.\n\tBut Mr. Speaker, even worse than that, yesterday we passed the resolution paying honor to those brave men and women that were placed in harm's way as a result of the so-called ``victory'' in Iraq. As I said yesterday, parades are important, saluting the flag is important, having a bumper sticker is important; but how we treat these veterans is even far more important.\n\tI know that Republicans do not know, and Democrats are learning, that as a result of so-called tax benefits given to these people that were in combat, that over 200,000 that served in Iraq will be denied the tax credit for their children. Why? Because the language of the tax law is that they have to have taxable income. Out of the benevolence of our hearts we have said that if they served in combat, they do not have to pay taxes.\n\tI hope Members will consider to speedily bring up my bill so that we can remedy this error that has been made. Nobody thought that by removing tax liability we would be actually taking away the benefit of the child tax credits.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, I include for the Record an article that appeared in USA Today on this day that says, ``Military Kids Get Slighted on Tax Credit.''\n\tThe article referred to is as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, June 5, 2003]\n\n              Study: Military Kids Slighted on Tax Credit\n\n\n          Parents earn too little to qualify for the provision\n\n                         (By William M. Welch)\n\n       Washington.--Nearly one in five children of active-duty \n     U.S. military families won't benefit from the increased tax \n     credit signed last week by President Bush because their \n     parents earn too little to qualify, a study being released \n     today concludes.\n       The finding by the Children's Defense Fund, a liberal \n     advocacy group, comes as Bush and Republican congressional \n     leaders are under increasing fire for agreeing to omit \n     working poor families from the increased child credit \n     included in the $350 billion, 10-year tax cut plan and aid \n     for states.\n       Those military families would have received a check of up \n     to $400 per child under a provision that the Senate added to \n     the bill. But that ``refundable'' credit to families who pay \n     little or no federal income tax, but do pay payroll taxers, \n     was deleted in final negotiations between Bush and Republican \n     leader of Congress.\n       Families who have children and earn more than about $27,000 \n     a year are due to receive checks next month of up to $400 per \n     child, as an advance on an increase in the credit from $600 \n     to $1,000.\n       The group said 250,000 of the 1.4 million children in \n     active-duty military families will not qualify for the \n     benefit because of the omission.\n       An additional 750,000 children denied the benefit have \n     parents who are military veterans, the fund concluded. It \n     based its findings on latest U.S. Census data.\n       Democrats, liberal groups and some moderate Republicans in \n     Congress are trying to build pressure on Bush and GOP leaders \n     to pass legislation quickly extending the credit, to those \n     families that were left out.\n       Democrats immediately invoked U.S. troops still in Iraq as \n     a political justification for another bill expanding the \n     credit.\n       ``Thousands of military personnel, people who put their \n     lives on the line for our country, won't receive the child \n     credit unless we correct the child credit unless we correct \n     the bill,'' Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said.\n       The $3.5 billion cost would be paid for by cracking down on \n     business tax avoidance schemes under the Democrats' proposal. \n     They said fast action was needed to assure 12 million low-\n     income families are able to receive a check when the \n     government begins mailing them to more affluent families \n     starting July 1.\n       Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Minority \n     Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., were negotiating a possible \n     agreement that would permit the Senate to vote, perhaps this \n     week, on competing proposals aimed at providing just such a \n     remedy to the working poor.\n       Republican leaders of the House of Representatives are \n     resisting the move. They say Bush didn't propose giving the \n     added credit to the working poor as part of his original \n     economic stimulus plan, and that sending tax refunds to \n     people who pay no federal income tax may be bad policy.\n       ``This is something that has been blown out of \n     proportion,'' said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who is on the \n     tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. ``It was not part of \n     the original bill, nor was it part of the bill in the House. \n     . . . We never debated it. . . . It is a new idea, and it is \n     one we ought to think about.''\n       In another effort to build pressure, a coalition of liberal \n     groups today begins airing TV ads in Washington blasting Bush \n     for leaving the working poor out of the child credit benefit \n     increase.\n       The Center for Community Change is buying a relatively \n     modest amount of airtime, but it is encouraging hundreds of \n     like-minded groups to air the same ad in other cites.\n       The ad shows two children: one too poor to qualify for the \n     increased credit and another, whose parents make more money, \n     who receives it. ``President Bush chose the most fortunate to \n     get the most,'' an announcer says.''\n\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey).\n\tMs. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this rule because working families should be our priority today, families like Cori's. Cori came to a local Head Start in my district at a low point in her life. She was a single parent without any support system and very little money and very little self-esteem. She had just completed a recovery program and was seeking to put her life back together.\n\tCori went on to volunteer for Head Start, completed an AA degree in early childhood development, and now Cori is a Head Start employee for the past 3 years and wants to get her bachelor's degree. Mr. Speaker, Cori and her two daughters will be denied the child tax credit, while those making more than $1 million a year receive overall tax cuts totalling $93,500.\n\tOur priority today should be, must be, the Rangel-Davis-DeLauro bill, which will expand the child tax credit and marriage penalty relief for lower-income working families. Passing it can be the first step to reversing the wrong done to these hard workers.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Davis).\n\tMr. DAVIS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot of heated debate about this issue all morning, but I think there is a basic undisputed fact that frankly should rise above the fray: there was no effort to limit this tax break until the end game of the conference report process, when the administration and those who were shaping the tax cut needed to find $3 billion.\n\tWhen they needed to do that, they did not search the high end of the bracket; they did not search the offshore loopholes. They went into the pockets of people who need tax relief more than anyone else. That was a choice of priorities. It was a statement that the people who do the hardest work in this country are, frankly, the ones who would be asked to sacrifice first.\n\tI wonder what the people of this country will think, what our constituents will think, when they hear that under the rules of this House they do not even deserve a vote. I wonder what the people who work every single day will think when they hear that a child tax break for them will be welfare. I wonder what these individuals who bear the brunt of payroll taxes will think when they hear that they do not need a tax credit because they really are not taxpayers. I wonder what the parents in my district, who begin paying taxes in the State of Alabama at $4,000, will think when they hear that they do not need tax relief.\n\tThis plan, as we knew from the beginning, strikes the wrong priorities. It leaves out people who are most in need of help, Mr. Speaker. I think that it is incumbent on us as a matter of conscience that we correct this imbalance.\n\tThis is the work that we ought to do for the people, that of correcting imbalances where they exist and that of correcting inequities where they exist, and not looking into the pockets of our weakest people to balance our budget.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel).\n  (Mr. EMANUEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow morning the new unemployment numbers come out, and we are probably close to nearly 3 million people that will have lost their jobs in the last 2 years. We have added $3 trillion to the Nation's debt. That has been the end result of this economic plan.\n\tNow, what we are looking for here is 12 million children of working parents to get a tax cut and be treated like the rest of America's children. These are children of working people. Some, as the Children's Defense Fund report shows, are the children of our Armed Forces. They are also children of the law enforcement community, firefighters, first-year teachers, people who work in security in our office buildings across this country, people who work day in and day out putting their hours in and trying to teach their children right from wrong.\n\tWhat has gone on here is what is wrong with this House today. We came here not just to be votes but to give voice to our values. I know there are good people with good values on the other side of the aisle. There is nothing just in the notion of denying 12 million children, 6\\1/2\\ million families who work full-time, denying those children who are also America's children a tax cut. We can depreciate the machinery of our corporations, depreciate the value of their machinery; but we cannot appreciate America's children.\n\tI was part of an administration that created and extended the $500-per-child tax credit and gave health insurance to 10 million uninsured children whose parents worked full time.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n\tWe balanced the budget. We also provided tax cuts in capital gains, but we balanced the budget. It was in balance with our values. These are not the values we espoused on Memorial Day when we welcomed home our veterans and remembered them for what they had done for this country. This vote should also be remembered.\n\tWe can do right. We can correct the wrong, hold our heads up high, not wear this in shame for what it does.\n\tThese are 12 million of America's children. Let us do right. Let us remember them as we do every day, trying to do right by our values.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).\n\tMr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding me time.\n\tMr. Speaker, I just want to point out for my friends on the other side of the aisle that I was prepared, as were my colleagues earlier this week, to vote in favor of this bill and suspension that would protect lands around the Grand Tetons, Wyoming. In fact, my in-laws are homesteaded around the Grand Tetons in Wyoming and I know they were very much in favor of seeing this land preserved for ages to come, including my children and their grandchildren.\n\tWe voted to strike it down to make a point, that there are 12 million children who would not be served by the recent tax cut that you imposed upon this country. In fact, in USA Today today, there is an article that says one out of five of those 12 million children who will not be getting a benefit, the families that will get a benefit of the child tax credit, are serving in our military today. Their parents are serving in the military, the same military that brought us the victory and did so much to preserve what this country stands for in the conflict in Iraq.\n\tI have news for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Working people, believe it or not, working people have children. Working people have children. Working people make and made this country what it is today. Do not forget the working people of this country.\n\tDo not forget the working people of this country. They deserve and need a child tax credit just as much as the wealthiest people in this country. They are the men and women who, day in and day out, provide for this country, for the backbone of this country.\n\tIt is interesting that there was a move on earlier this week as well and a bill that was supposed to come before us today that would have eliminated comp time as well. This week has been an attack upon the working families of our Nation, and the Republican party should be ashamed of themselves.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n\tMs. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the very real concerns of the Zuni tribe and its children.\n\tThis bill would provide critical access to the Little Colorado River Basin to allow the Zuni Indian Tribe acquisition of surface water rights and development of groundwater. The acquisition of water rights and associated lands are vital to the Zuni Indian Tribe's future economic development; and, along those same lines, the child tax credit is critical in helping low-income families, including Zunis, achieve some level of economic security.\n\tThis bill secures tribal rights to assured water supplies for present and future generations, while at the same time providing for the sound management of an increasingly scarce resource. Because of the importance and sacredness all forms and sources of water, all prayers and songs of the three major components of the Zuni religion contain language asking for rain and snow to ensure that all crops have enough water to finish their life paths to provide sustenance for their Zuni children. Likewise, enduring access to the child tax credit will help Zuni families provide economic sustenance to their children.\n\tBy now, the whole Nation knows what happened 2 weeks ago. They know that a tax credit which would have helped nearly 12 million children from 6.5 million low-income families, including Zuni families, was secretly eliminated by the administration and the gentleman from Texas' (Mr. DeLay) Republican majority.\n\tThese families, these Zuni families earn between $10,500 and $26,625 per year, families who really need this tax cut and, yes, they do pay taxes and they are important.\n\tThe gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) said we have more important matters. These Zuni children are important. In Arizona, 138,000 families with children, 21 percent of the families in the State, are not helped by the child tax credit increase because of the Republicans' last-minute actions. 403,000 Arizona children would be eligible if the child tax credit were made fully refundable, with an additional $259,000 million in credit going to families in the State.\n\tThis House ought to be about the working families in this country, those who are Zunis and those who are not. We promised them a child tax credit, and this majority removed it to provide the opportunity for $93,000 in tax cuts to the richest 184,000 millionaires in the country.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Strickland).\n\tMr. STRICKLAND. Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my Republican colleagues in this House. Why would you, in a fit of anger because you were not able to get the size of the tax cut you wanted, hold poor little children hostage in order to extract a larger tax cut for those who were already wealthy?\n\tIt is a fair question.\n\tIn the middle of the night, over one-half million Ohio children were excluded from this benefit. Those are children who have moms and dads who are working but their incomes are so low that they may not be required to pay income taxes. But let me tell you, they pay property taxes. They pay Social Security/payroll taxes. They pay all kinds of other taxes. Oh, it is very clever of you to say they do not pay income tax.\n\tI am absolutely disgusted with what has happened in this House. CNN reported that the conservative leader of your party, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), brushed aside criticism that the tax bill did not expand the child tax credit and make it available to millions of poor families. But, he said, House Republicans might support doing so if it prodded senators to vote for a broader tax package. In other words, you may be willing to help the poor kids if it means you can get more money for your rich friends. It is as simple as that, as simple as that.\n\tThese are just not the rantings of a Democrat. Let me tell you what Senator John McCain said about it. Senator McCain said, My God, what kind of message are we sending when we leave out low-income families, exactly those who are in that category of the enlisted men and women who are fighting for us in Iraq today? It is beyond belief.\n\tAnd it is beyond belief, but you have got time to redeem yourself. You have got time to change this policy and take care of the kids, 500,000 in Ohio, who need your help.\n\n\n                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Members should refrain from quoting members of the other body.\n\tThe gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) has 9 minutes remaining.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on the other side?\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) has 27 minutes remaining.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how many speakers does the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) have to discuss this issue?\n\tMr. HASTINGS of Washington. The issue, of course, we are discussing is the rule for the two suspension bills that we, unfortunately, had majority vote earlier this week but, unfortunately, did not have the two-thirds. But we may have, counting myself, two speakers between now and the time we close.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman want to use some of his time now?\n\tMr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, we have used up several speakers. I think for balance, if one of the gentleman's speakers is here, they could go.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Who yields time?\n\tMr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston).\n  (Mr. KINGSTON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks, and include extraneous material.)\n\tMr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.\n\tI wanted to say to my colleagues in the House, I certainly intend to stay on the subject matter of this rule equally as much as all the Democrats who have been speaking at least.\n\tI want to talk to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about this child tax refundable credit which they are so indignant about. Because I want to remind them, you all had nothing to do with putting it on the books, nothing. We were glad that you like it because it was a Republican idea, but every single one of you, every single one of your speakers has voted against it.\n\tMr. Speaker, I want to help you a little bit out here and just kind of remind you so far we have heard from the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley), the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Jones), the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman), the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Strickland), the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Woolsey), and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), all good folks. However, they have all voted against this refundable tax credit, May 16, 2001, when the Republicans put it on the books. I do not know what you were thinking.\n\tThis thing that you were pretending to champion, you voted against. It was a Republican idea. Where were you when the battle was being fought? I am going to review a little bit of history, and let me say to this, you all are looking around stunned which I understand.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n\tMr. KINGSTON. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, if it was such a good idea, number one, why did you remove it? Number two, I do not recall us ever having voted on this in the House. It was inserted in the Senate. Let us be accurate.\n\tMr. KINGSTON. Reclaiming my time, let me jog the gentleman's memory. Here is what the situation was, and the gentleman is a distinguished member of the Committee on Rules and has lots of bills that pass through his desk, so I will not hold you responsible for knowing everything.\n\tPrior to 2001, the child tax credit was $500 per child. It was passed under a Republican bill and, as the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Emanuel) pointed out, it was signed by President Clinton. So you can claim a little bipartisanship there, even though that was passed by Republican votes when it was in the House, but prior to 2001 the child tax credit was $500. The credit was not refundable for most families. However, for a family with three kids or more, the credit was refundable; and it was not offset by the earned income tax credit. That was prior to 2001.\n\tNow enter President Bush and the 2001 tax cut. Under that, the proposal was to increase the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000. The credit was $600 for the year 2003, and it was scheduled to reach $1,000 per child in 2010. That law made the child tax credit partially refundable for all families with children, not just those who had three kids or more.\n\tNow, we had the vote on that May 16, 2001, and I have got the Roll Call from that, and at that time every one of you all voted against it. As a matter of fact, 197 Democrats voted against this.\n\tSo, Mr. Speaker, when the Democrats come out here looking for some rhetoric, and the big rhetoric of the Democratic party this year really that has been led by the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi) is, we could have torn that statue down a lot cheaper.\n\tI know a lot of folks are against the war. And then it was, well, the plan is not working when we were going up the Euphrates. And then as soon as they tore down the statue, I know a lot of folks on the left, and I want to say not all the members of the Democrat party but a lot of folks on the left were disturbed that a 23-year-old Marine corporal who was in theater had the audacity of hanging an American flag on a Saddam Hussein statue. Of course, he was denounced in the liberal, left-wing community for doing that.\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n\tMr. KINGSTON. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, that is a little unfair. I do not think anyone objected to flags being flown and so forth. You make a good point on some of the other things, but that is a little unfair on the flag.\n\tMr. KINGSTON. Let me say to my friend from Tennessee, that is why I said not all the Democrats but a lot of folks on the left denounced the fact that that flag was hung.\n\tMr. FORD. That is unfair.\n\tMr. KINGSTON. I would also point out that you were not one of them.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n\tMr. KINGSTON. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. That is outrageous.\n\tMr. KINGSTON. Reclaiming my time, I will yield further to you in just one second.\n\tI am very pleased that you all are listening. Let me do this, because I am being generous here, but my ranking member of the Committee on Rules says that maybe we should do this a little bit more on your time.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern). \n\tMr. McGOVERN. Let me say for the record what I am outraged at what is in the paper today, that nearly one in five children of U.S. military families will not benefit from the increased tax credit signed by President Bush.\n\tMr. KINGSTON. I am glad that not only does the gentleman listen to fine speeches like mine, but he also reads the paper, which is very good.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n\tI suspect it is probably The New York Times or The Washington Post.\n\tLet me just say this, does that article point out that my colleagues voted against phasing in the tax cut, the refundability, in 2001? That is all I want to say.\n\tWhat I would love to hear from our Democrat colleagues, Mr. Speaker, who are saying I voted against this tax cut and a tax cut which was a jobs bill, took 3 million working families off the tax roll, 3 million, and I understand they wanted them on. We thought it would be helpful for the working families of America to get off the tax roll. The reality is they voted against it. They wanted to keep them on. I understand that. I just wish they would acknowledge in the year 2001 that they voted against the child tax refundability clause, and I have the vote in my hand; and I can submit it for the Record, Mr. Speaker, and do that.\n\tIf my colleagues want to be helpful, what they ought to do on some of these tax bills that are aimed at creating jobs is say, hey, we want to amend the bill and we will do this. We will do this in a spirit of a democratic, small D, democratic House and process. We are going to vote for the bill if we put in some of their ideas, because this is the way it really should work, the best of their party and the best of our party combined together to put out just the best thoughts and do what is right for working families.\n\tLet me point out that a family of four making $11,000 a year pays no income tax, pays about $842 in payroll taxes and receives $4,140 under the earned income tax credit. We think that is good. We think it also would be helpful, though, if my colleagues could join us in making these child tax credits permanent because their idea that they are concerned about now might have some merits. Why do they not join us in saying we are going to make these child tax credits permanent? We are not going to do a bait and switch, when in the year 2011 they are gone.\n\tWhile we are at it, because we all know that a family of mom and dad have great potential for stability, why do we not end the marriage tax penalty together? Again, I throw out an olive branch to my colleagues, could they join us in making the marriage tax penalty permanent? That would be very helpful for the working poor. There are so many things that we could do together.\n\tAnother idea is the 10 percent tax bracket, the 10 percent rate. Could my colleagues join us in making that permanent? These are all things that could help the working poor.\n\tWe are not going to say we have the franchise on helping the working poor just because we voted to take 3 million off the payrolls and my colleagues voted against it. We are saying maybe they can join us on the next job creation package and come up with something that is in the best interest of all of us.\n\tI would love to yield to the gentleman from Tennessee, but we are getting to the point we have got a lot of Members who want to go ahead and have a vote, and I am a little concerned about that.\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield for a quick question?\n\tMr. KINGSTON. I yield to the gentleman from Tennessee.\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, what is the problem then if my colleagues believe in removing all these taxes, which I think there is a lot of merit to, I am a big tax cutter like the gentleman is? I support those ideas. How is that consistent with the taking 3 million, or I should say up to 12 million, children or removing them from the target of a tax cut which my colleagues did, they voted for it?\n\tMr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, let me say this. Our objective is to get people working, and that was the real goal of this to get folks working.\n\tLet me say this to my friend from Tennessee: if the gentleman wants to join us in making the child tax credit permanent; the marriage tax penalty, eliminate it permanently; the 10 percent tax credit, make that permanent, he and I need to get together because I think we can move the ball down the road, and that is all we want to do.\n\tI am just saying that the planned, orchestrated campaign of the Democrat Party to denounce something that they all voted against in the year 2002, I just wish the speakers would say I voted against this in 2001, but it is a great idea and now I am mad that the Republicans are not doing it this way; I want it done even though I did not share any of the burden by being responsible and voting for it.\n\tI want to end with this. There are a lot of differences between the Democrat and the Republican parties. They seem to be the group of frivolous lawsuits and starving trial lawyers. We are the party of tort reform, ending frivolous medical liabilities, making health care affordable and accessible. They seem to like unemployment checks and government handouts. We like paychecks, jobs and opportunities.\n\tThey like welfare and low expectations. We like welfare reform, jobs.\n\tMr. FORD. . . .\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). The gentleman from Tennessee is definitely out of order, has not been recognized, and the Chair would appreciate it if the gentleman would not speak when the other gentleman has the time.\n\tMr. FORD. . . .\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee is not recognized. The Chair would ask the gentleman to take his seat. The Chair would ask the gentleman to take a seat. The gentleman from Georgia may continue.\n\tMr. FORD. . . .\n\tMr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, here is the situation with welfare reform, Mr. Speaker. We passed welfare reform at a time when there were 14 million people on welfare. At that time, we were called all kinds of names, and they were saying it was heartless and we were mean-spirited and everything else and that these folks were unable to help themselves. What is interesting is in 1996 when we passed welfare reform, we had 14 million people on welfare. Today, that number is down to 5 million people, too high; but we need to continue working on that. The 9 million people are now tax paying, working, enjoying the opportunity, sharing in the American Dream. They are glad that we passed welfare reform.\n\tThere is a component in this that the Democrats are proposing which is simply welfare, and I think there may be some merit in that. I have no trouble at all in a healthy discussion on tinkering with welfare reform. This is good for everybody, but what our tax package was about was creating jobs, and we are going to continue to be the party of welfare reform, jobs and opportunity.\n\n                      Committee on Ways and Means\n\n\n                 child credit refundability fact sheet\n\n       What was the child credit prior to 2001?\n       Prior to 2001, the child credit was $500 per eligible \n     child. The credit was not refundable for most families. \n     However, for families with 3 or more eligible children, the \n     credit was refundable to the extent the family had payroll \n     tax liability that was not offset by the Earned Income Credit \n     (EIC).\n       How was the child credit expanded in 2001?\n       The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of \n     2001 significantly expanded the child credit in two important \n     ways.\n       (1) The law gradually increased the credit from $500 to \n     $1,000. The credit was $600 for 2003 and was scheduled to \n     reach $1,000 in 2010.\n       (2) The law made the child credit partially refundable for \n     all families with children--not just those with 3 or more \n     children. The credit is now refundable by an amount equal to \n     10 percent of the family's earned income in excess of \n     $10,000. The $10,000 threshold is indexed annually for \n     inflation (it is $10,500 for 2003), and the 10 percent \n     refundability rate will increase to 15 percent in 2005.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                NAYS--197------------------------------------------------------------------------Ackerman                Harman                    NealAllen                   Hastings (FL)             OberstarAndrews                 Hill                      ObeyBaca                    Hilliard                  OlverBaird                   Hinchey                   OrtizBaldacci                Hinojosa                  OwensBaldwin                 Hoeffel                   PalloneBarcia                  Holden                    PascrellBarrett                 Holt                      PastorBecerra                 Honda                     PayneBentsen                 Hooley                    PelosiBerkley                 Hoyer                     Peterson (MN)Berman                  Inslee                    PhelpsBerry                   Israel                    PomeroyBlagojevich             Jackson (IL)              Price (NC) \n Blumenauer              Jackson-Lee (TX)          RahallBonior                  Jefferson                 RangelBorski                  Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentleman from Georgia his tax package is about welfare for the rich. I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).\n\tMr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, what incredible nonsense we have heard here on the floor of the House this afternoon, this attempt to raise the flag and besmirch Members of this House over their stance on the American flag practically on the eve of Flag Day.\n\tLet me tell the gentleman (Mr. Kingston), there are two kinds of people today that have the American flag wrapped around them. Some of them are young men and women who come back in coffins with the flag draped around it, who gave their all in the ultimate sacrifice for this country; and all of us honor them, whatever our views about the President's policy. But the other kind of people we do not honor, and it is those who choose to wrap their own bad policies that they cannot defend by stretching the flag around themselves.\n\tWhat are the merits of the argument about the child tax credit? Who came up with it in the first place? I think the names are Al Gore and Tom Downey, who both served in this body who long ago presented a child tax credit proposal. How did it become law? It eventually became law with the signature of a Democratic President in 1997 when we passed the Balanced Budget Act with the support of a large number of Members on both sides of this aisle, balancing the budget, not busting it as this Republican tax bill would do.\n\tThe child tax credit has had strong Democratic support within our caucus and within the Committee on Ways and Means on which I serve, and the only reason any Democrat has voted against that child tax credit on this floor was when it was used, much as the flag has been misused this afternoon, as the reason for voting for a bill that gave most all of the help to the people at the top and none of the people at the bottom.\n\tI am glad that my colleague from Texas (Mr. DeLay) has joined us this afternoon. He has announced to the American people that there are more important things to do than to ensure that the child tax credit is available to people that earn a mere $20,000, $25,000 a year. Who are those people? They are the people that empty the bed pans at the nursing homes. They are the cafeteria workers in our public schools. They are the people that we check out with at the gas station when we go in to pay for our gas. They are people that are sweeping the floors today at the hospitals around America.\n\tWhy do those young women and men not have an opportunity to get the same type of child tax credit available to those at the top? They are working. Some of them are working two and three jobs to have a chance to advance out of poverty and share in the American Dream. They respect the flag just as much as the gentleman from Georgia does, but they would also like to share in a little of the American Dream.\n\tMr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the distinguished majority leader.\n\tMr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, my, my, my, what a heated debate we are having today. I came to the well to talk about what this debate is all about. A lot has been left out by those Members on the other side of the aisle because they are afraid for the truth to surface, so I wanted to bring the real facts about what is going on here.\n\tThe child tax credit provision in this new tax law is refundable, and it is refundable to the extent 10 percent of earned income in excess of $10,500, people that make $10,500 get a refundable tax rebate. In 2005, the 10 percent rate goes up to 15 percent.\n\tWhat this fight is over is there was a provision in the Senate that basically said they wanted to accelerate that 2 years, and we may want to do that in the proper way under regular order; but what the Democrats are angry about is that we did not accelerate that spending increase; and thanks to the tax relief passed by Republican Congresses over the last 8 years, 13 million American families have had their entire income tax liability eliminated, eliminated.\n\tThe gentleman from Texas brings up who are these people. I would like to show my colleagues one. Here is a married couple earning $30,000 with three children. Before the 2001 law, that they voted against, this married couple would be paying a marginal rate of 15 percent, which means their income tax liability is over $1,000 and their payroll tax liability is $2,160. Before the 2001 law, they would get a $1,500 credit, and they would get an earned income tax credit of $782, which means that their income tax liability was zero. They still had a payroll tax liability; but because of EITC, the payment from the government was zero.\n\tSo after 2001, this same family would have an income tax liability of $688, $2,160 from their payroll tax liability; but they get $1,800 in a child tax credit, and they get a $992 earned income tax credit, which means that their income tax liability is still zero, but their payroll tax liability goes down to $48.\n\tAfter this law that the President passed that they voted against, that the President signed a week ago, this same family is going to have an income tax liability of $525, payroll tax liability of $2,160, but they get a child tax credit of $2,475, and they get an earned income tax credit of $992, which actually helps them pay not only for their payroll taxes; it reimburses them for their payroll taxes. They pay no income taxes. They actually get a check for $782.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n\tA check from the American taxpayers. No tax liability, but they get to put $782 in their pocket.\n\tNow, let us take a single mother that makes $20,000 and has two children. They are going through the same thing. What has happened to her is she gets a check of over $1,000. Over $1,000. She pays no payroll taxes, she pays no income taxes, and she gets a check for $1,000. They voted against that. They voted against that.\n\tNow they want to come and tell the American people they are all tax relievers. Now all of a sudden they are tax relievers, and they want to give more tax relief to the taxpaying public and to people that do not have a tax liability.\n\tMs. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?\n\tMr. DeLAY. They fail to----\n\tMs. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield for a question?\n\tMr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, may I have order?\n\tMs. DeLAURO. I just want to ask the gentleman if he will yield for a quick question.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). The gentleman from Texas has the time.\n\tMs. DeLAURO. I understand.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not yielding to the gentlewoman. The gentleman may proceed.\n\tMs. DeLAURO. . . .\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is not yielding. The gentleman may proceed. \n\tMr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, what has happened here is they also do not want to mention that in the bill signed by the President last week we raised by 10 percent and added more people to the rolls that do not pay income taxes. So this notion that we are not taking care of the poor working families of this country are completely false; and, most importantly, they voted against it. We passed it without their votes, moved forward, gave tax relief to poor working families in this country; and we will continue to do so.\n\tWhen the Senate does something, we always take it into consideration and we will move forward. I would just remind the Members of this House that we have now almost a trillion dollars left in the budget to do more tax relief for the American people, and we are coming back. We are going to have at least two if not three more tax relief packages for the American people. Because we feel very strongly that we need jobs in this country, we need economic growth in this country, and American families need to keep more of their hard-earned money\n\tMr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield? Will the gentleman yield on the tax question?\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's time has expired.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Rangel).\n\tMr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I would hope that the distinguished majority leader would extend the courtesy to his Members and not leave the floor. It is so important when Members have something to say to correct their position that they stay on the floor, not for Democrats but for Republicans as well.\n\tThis is a very edifying thing that he said in the well of the House. He is trying to rebut the allegations that we have made that in the last tax bill that the working people in the lower incomes were deliberately left out of the bill. Now, my colleague can go back to last year, the year before last, 10 years from now, but the accusation was made and still stands. The accusation is that the Republican leadership cared more about accelerating tax relief for the wealthiest people than they did for working people.\n\tSo let us not come here and mislead and make these statements and walk off the floor. There is a tendency for all of us to be out of order when we see the arrogance, the indifference, and the lack of respect that certain Members, especially those in the leadership, have for those that have to work here each and every day.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining and the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings) has 13 minutes remaining.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tAs I pointed out earlier, this is a rule on two suspensions that were unfortunately defeated earlier this week that deal with serious matters in the southwestern part of the United States, at least one of them does.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi) to speak on one of these matters.\n\tMr. RENZI. Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out to my colleagues that what we are here to debate is the rule as it affects the Zuni tribe of New Mexico and Arizona as it affects the sacred lands and those lands right now that have no water.\n\tWe were able to provide them with enough land in 1984 to establish Zuni Heaven in Arizona, a reservation, and yet without Senator Kyl's intervention we would not have been able to achieve the kind of water that we see the communities in rural Arizona supplying now.\n\tThis summer, while we debate separate issues, the Zuni people are hoping to engage in their 4-year migration and trek to their holy lands, to their holy site. So the delay that we imposed 2 days ago, the delay we impose today affects their ability to plan and celebrate this agreement. And there is all kinds of agreement, I think even from both sides, if my colleagues will allow us to get to it. We need to be able to restore the tribe's ability to perform not only the religious duties but the farming and subsistence that they need in order to care for their children.\n\tSo when we talk about children today, the Zuni people themselves are waiting to plant their crops and feed their children. They are waiting to take their children to their sacred lands, their wetlands, to teach their children their sacred rights. There will be no more delay if we can get this to a vote. Each day, each hour, each minute we allow to pass, the Zuni people feel there are inequities and that the agreement cannot be reached.\n\tFor the record, I want the Zuni people to know that what they see here today does not reflect upon them as a people. There are hours and times, Special Orders available in this House for this issue to be debated. Instead, my colleagues have taken their issue and turned this into a side show.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n\tMs. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. And since I could not get the gentleman from Texas to answer a simple question for me, maybe I can pose a question to his colleagues and see if we can get an answer.\n\tIt appears in fact that the Senate has come to some agreement; that the Senate has said on a bipartisan basis that we need to address the fact that 12 million children were left out of the equation; that they were supposed to be able to have the benefit of a $400 tax credit, these 6.5 million families. The Senate has come to an agreement with about a $10 billion package.\n\tI want to get an answer from the Republican side of the aisle as to whether or not they will bring up the Senate package for us to be able to deliberate and help those 12 million children and those 6.5 million households. The Senate has done it; we ought to be able to do it here and to address that issue.\n\tIf we can, we would like to get an answer to that question.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to see if anyone on the other side wants to respond. We are waiting.\n\tMr. Speaker, I guess we are not going to get an answer to that question.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford).\n\tMr. FORD. Mr. Speaker, I want you to know I mean no disrespect to you personally or to the institution, but the notion that somehow welfare has any role in this debate is asinine. My colleagues know and we know, as do those watching know, certainly our colleagues in the Senate know, that everyone we are discussing today with regard to this child tax credit are working people.\n\tThe welfare reform package that passed this Congress passed before I got here, so it is easy for me to say I would have voted for it, since I was not here. But I can assure my colleagues that my votes since that time are consistent with that.\n\tNow, I appreciate the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) coming down here, but what he did, I think, was to lay out pretty clearly for those on our side and the other side just the difference in priorities. Our priorities differ in great ways from the Republicans. Many of us like tax cuts; my Republican colleagues like tax cuts. We think tax cuts should benefit more people, the Republicans think they should benefit a lesser group of people. No disrespect to you. Do not mean to ridicule my colleagues personally, but there are complete differences in priorities and realities.\n\tThe reality is what we are discussing today. People earning $25,000 a year or less make up a good portion of America. Frankly, those of us on this floor, that is a fraction of what we earn year in and year out. And how dare we, as we pass a tax cut bill, how dare we say that we have done enough for people that make $11,000, $12,000, $13,000, $14,000 and $15,000 a year. How dare we say that to their children, when the facts betray everything that you believe and I believe.\n\tFrankly, if these children whom we are denying this tax credit to could vote, they would vote all of us out of office. As many times as we have lied to them about building new schools and putting more teachers in the classrooms, they would fire the President, might have even fired the former President. \n\tSo let us be honest. We deny 12 million children a tax credit. No funny math, no Enron accounting, no Arthur Andersen accounting can refute that. We should do better and we can.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).\n\tMr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. A question was posed and unanswered. We can wait for an answer, if my colleagues have one.\n\tIs there no answer to the question?\n\tApparently, there is no answer, I tell the gentlewoman from Connecticut, to the question she posed. Let me tell her and my colleagues why.\n\tMr. Speaker, yesterday syndicated columnist Arianna Huffington, no Democrat and no liberal, and very wealthy, said this in the Los Angeles Times, and I quote: ``A magnetic compass always points north; a moral compass should always point out that heaping billions on the rich while ensuring that one out of six American children do not get a penny is dead wrong.''\n\tDead wrong. Arianna Huffington. Not the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), not the Democrats, not those fuzzy-headed liberals my Republican colleagues like to talk about, but Arianna Huffington. She continued: ``But that's exactly what congressional Republicans did in pushing through tax cut legislation last month, and that's what President Bush signed off on.'' Arianna Huffington.\n\tMr. Speaker, America now knows that the GOP's moral compass lies shattered on the conference room floor where the final deals on the Republican tax bill were cut 2 weeks ago.\n\tWhy did the majority leader leave the floor? The majority leader left the floor because he used an example just above the $28,000, where he would have been wrong. My colleagues, the moral compass is absent.\n\tThere was a report that showed that the policies in 2001 and 2003 are leading to a $44.4 trillion deficit. Who did that? Two people in the Bush administration asked to do that report and OMB. And guess what? They stonewalled the report. Why? Because they did not want the magnitude of the debt tax that we are imposing on every American family known while at the same time, when they had no lobbyist in that hall, those 12 million children, who did not have somebody highly paid to sit in that hallway and say do not cut us, found themselves cut out of the bill that in the still and dark of the night, with no Democrats present, was brought out to this floor, pages and pages of bill, with minutes to review it.\n\tArianna Huffington is correct. Shame, shame, shame.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining 30 seconds. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question so that we can help millions of children and working families. We have heard the other side defend the indefensible.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n\tMr. Speaker, if they do not want to help millions of working families, they should at least have the guts to go on record as voting no instead of hiding behind procedures. So let this House work its will. Let us have a little democracy in this Chamber. Vote on the previous question so we can bring up the Rangel bill and literally help millions of children in this country.\nWorking Families Tax Credit Act of 2003--Summary of H.R. 2286, June 4, \n                                  2003\n\n       Republicans have left moderate-income families behind in \n     their zeal to cut taxes on millionaires, contrary to their \n     ``leave no child behind'' rhetoric.\n       H.R. 2286 helps moderate-income working families and is \n     revenue neutral.\n\n\n                               provisions\n\n       Provides Child Credit to More Working Families: Lowers to \n     $7,500 (from $10,500) the amount of the wages a family must \n     have before refundability of the child credit begins. This is \n     identical to a provision that was included in the house \n     Democratic alternative on the economic stimulus legislation. \n     The credit would be allowed for approximately 19 million \n     additional children by reason of this change.\n       Increases Benefit for Working Families: Increases partial \n     refundability from 10 percent of wages to 15 percent of \n     wages. Again, this is identical to a provision that was \n     included in the Democratic alternative. This would result in \n     an average credit increase of over $300 per child.\n       Helps Families of Soldiers in Combat: Allows refundability \n     for families of soldiers in combat zones even though combat \n     wages are not taxed.\n       Speeds up Marriage Penalty Relief for Lower Income Working \n     Couples: Makes effective immediately the marriage penalty \n     relief in the Earned Income Tax Credit that was provided in \n     the 2001 tax cut. This is the only marriage penalty relief \n     not accelerated in the recently enacted tax bill.\n       Does Not Increase the Deficit: Closes corporate loopholes: \n     prohibits tax shelters, and taxes corporations that move \n     headquarters offshore (expatriates).\n\tMr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the amendment and description of the amendment be printed in the Record immediately before the vote on the previous question.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts?\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tMr. HASTINGS of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n\tMr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, this is a rule on two suspension bills that were, unfortunately, not passed earlier this week. They are very important bills to those areas that are affected.\n\tMr. Speaker, I include for the Record the chart that the distinguished majority leader discussed earlier today.\n\n            EXAMPLES: REFUNDABILITY OF CHILD CREDIT FOR 2003------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Pre-2001\n                                            law      2001 law   2003 law------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Example 1: Married couple earning $30,000 with 3 children\n Tax liability before credits:\n    Earnings...........................     30,000     30,000     30,000\n    Standard deduction.................

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous question.\n\tThe question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.\n\tMr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not present.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Evidently a quorum is not present.\n\tThe Sergeant at Arms will notify absent Members.\n\tPursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for electronic voting, if ordered, on adoption of the resolution, which will be followed by a 5-minute vote on the question of passage of H.R. 1474 which was postponed earlier today.\n\tThe vote was taken by electronic device,

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 258, I call up \nthe Senate bill (S. 222) to approve the settlement of the water rights \nclaims of the Zuni Indian Tribe in Apache County, Arizona, and for \nother purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.\n  The text of S. 222 is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 222\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Zuni Indian Tribe Water \n     Rights Settlement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States, in keeping with \n     its trust responsibility to Indian tribes, to promote Indian \n     self-determination, religious freedom, political and cultural \n     integrity, and economic self-sufficiency, and to settle, \n     wherever possible, the water rights claims of Indian tribes \n     without lengthy and costly litigation.\n       (2) Quantification of rights to water and development of \n     facilities needed to use tribal water supplies effectively is \n     essential to the development of viable Indian reservation \n     communities, particularly in arid western States.\n       (3) On August 28, 1984, and by actions subsequent thereto, \n     the United States established a reservation for the Zuni \n     Indian Tribe in Apache County, Arizona upstream from the \n     confluence of the Little Colorado and Zuni Rivers for long-\n     standing religious and sustenance activities.\n       (4) The water rights of all water users in the Little \n     Colorado River basin in Arizona have been in litigation since \n     1979, in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and \n     for the County of Apache in Civil No. 6417, In re The General \n     Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Little \n     Colorado River System and Source.\n       (5) Recognizing that the final resolution of the Zuni \n     Indian Tribe's water claims through litigation will take many \n     years and entail great expense to all parties, continue to \n     limit the Tribe's access to water with economic, social, and \n     cultural consequences to the Tribe, prolong uncertainty as to \n     the availability of water supplies, and seriously impair the \n     long-term economic planning and development of all parties, \n     the Tribe and neighboring non-Indians have sought to settle \n     their disputes to water and reduce the burdens of litigation.\n       (6) After more than 4 years of negotiations, which included \n     participation by representatives of the United States, the \n     Zuni Indian Tribe, the State of Arizona, and neighboring non-\n     Indian communities in the Little Colorado River basin, the \n     parties have entered into a Settlement Agreement to resolve \n     all of the Zuni Indian Tribe's water rights claims and to \n     assist the Tribe in acquiring surface water rights, to \n     provide for the Tribe's use of groundwater, and to provide \n     for the wetland restoration of the Tribe's lands in Arizona.\n       (7) To facilitate the wetland restoration project \n     contemplated under the Settlement Agreement, the Zuni Indian \n     Tribe acquired certain lands along the Little Colorado River \n     near or adjacent to its Reservation that are important for \n     the success of the project and will likely acquire a small \n     amount of similarly situated additional lands. The parties \n     have agreed not to object to the United States taking title \n     to certain of these lands into trust status; other lands \n     shall remain in tribal fee status. The parties have worked \n     extensively to resolve various governmental concerns \n     regarding use of and control over those lands, and to provide \n     a successful model for these types of situations, the State, \n     local, and tribal governments intend to enter into an \n     Intergovernmental Agreement that addresses the parties' \n     governmental concerns.\n       (8) Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the neighboring \n     non-Indian entities will assist in the Tribe's acquisition of \n     surface water rights and development of groundwater, store \n     surface water supplies for the Zuni Indian Tribe, and make \n     substantial additional contributions to carry out the \n     Settlement Agreement's provisions.\n       (9) To advance the goals of Federal Indian policy and \n     consistent with the trust responsibility of the United States \n     to the Tribe, it is appropriate that the United States \n     participate in the implementation of the Settlement Agreement \n     and contribute funds for the rehabilitation of religious \n     riparian areas and other purposes to enable the Tribe to use \n     its water entitlement in developing its Reservation.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to approve, ratify, and confirm the Settlement \n     Agreement entered into by the Tribe and neighboring non-\n     Indians;\n       (2) to authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior \n     to execute and perform the Settlement Agreement and related \n     waivers;\n       (3) to authorize and direct the United States to take legal \n     title and hold such title to certain lands in trust for the \n     benefit of the Zuni Indian Tribe; and\n       (4) to authorize the actions, agreements, and \n     appropriations as provided for in the Settlement Agreement \n     and this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

and\n       (iii) the proposed right-of-way acquisition will comply \n     with the procedures in part 169 of title 25, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, not inconsistent with this subsection and other \n     generally applicable Federal laws unrelated to the \n     acquisition of interests across trust lands.\n       (B) Alternatives.--If the criteria described in clauses (i) \n     through (iii) of subparagraph (A) are not met, the Secretary \n     may propose an alternative right-of-way, or other \n     accommodation that complies with the criteria.\n       (d) Certain Claims Prohibited.--The United States shall \n     make no claims for reimbursement of costs arising out of the \n     implementation of this Act or the Settlement Agreement \n     against any Indian-owned land within the Tribe's Reservation, \n     and no assessment shall be made in regard to such costs \n     against such lands.\n       (e) Vested Rights.--Except as described in paragraph 5.3 of \n     the Settlement Agreement (recognizing the Zuni Tribe's use of \n     1,500 acre-feet per annum of groundwater) this Act and the \n     Settlement Agreement do not create any vested right to \n     groundwater under Federal or State law, or any priority to \n     the use of groundwater that would be superior to any other \n     right or use of groundwater under Federal or State law, \n     whether through this Act, the Settlement Agreement, or by \n     incorporation of any abstract, agreement, or stipulation \n     prepared under the Settlement Agreement. Notwithstanding the \n     preceding sentence, the rights of parties to the agreements \n     referred to in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of section 4(c) and \n     paragraph 5.8 of the Settlement Agreement, as among \n     themselves, shall be as stated in those agreements.\n       (f) Other Claims.--Nothing in the Settlement Agreement or \n     this Act quantifies or otherwise affects the water rights, \n     claims, or entitlements to water of any Indian tribe, band, \n     or community, other than the Zuni Indian Tribe.\n       (g) No Major Federal Action.--\n       (1) In general.--Execution of the Settlement Agreement by \n     the Secretary as provided for in section 4(a) shall not \n     constitute major Federal action under the National \n     Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).\n       (2) Settlement agreement.--In implementing the Settlement \n     Agreement, the Secretary shall comply with all aspects of--\n       (A) the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.);\n       (B) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.); and\n       (C) all other applicable environmental laws (including \n     regulations).\n\n     SEC. 9.

Pursuant to House Resolution 258, the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi) and the gentleman from New Mexico \n(Mr. Udall) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi).\n  (Mr. RENZI asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks, and include extraneous material.)\n  Mr. RENZI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, in order for my colleagues to get home and be a little \nmore efficient, we have had discussions on this bill. I think that both \nsides are now ready to vote on it in agreement. I urge adoption.\n  S. 222, authored by Senator Jon Kyl and identical to legislation \nintroduced by me and Congressman J.D. Hayworth of Arizona, would \nresolve water rights claims and litigation in the Little Colorado River \nbasin. I would like to commend the commitment and persistence of \nSenator Kyl on this important settlement. I would also like to \nrecognize the patience and perseverance of the Zuni Tribe.\n  The Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2003 would \ncodify the settlement of the Zuni Indian Tribe's water rights for its \nreligious lands in northeastern Arizona. Congress first recognized the \nimportance of these lands in 1984 when it created the Zuni Heaven \nReservation. While land issues were addressed in 1984, water rights \nremained in question until Sen. Kyl's intervention.\n  Uncertainty existed in several of the rural towns upstream from the \nnewly-created Zuni Heaven. These small communities upstream from this \nReservation have now been fully-appropriated. A resolution was reached \nthat avoided costly litigation. Parties included the Zuni Tribe, the \nUnited States on behalf of the Zuni Tribe, the State of Arizona, \nincluding the Arizona Game and Fish Commission, the Arizona State Land \nDepartment, and the Arizona State Parks Board, as well as the major \nwater users in this area; negotiations were conducted for many years to \nproduce an acceptable agreement for all parties.\n  This legislation would provide the Zuni Tribe with the resources and \nprotections necessary to acquire water rights from willing sellers. In \naddition, this legislation will restore and protect the wetland \nenvironment that previously existed on Zuni Heaven.\n  In return, the Zuni Tribe will grandfather existing water uses and \nwaive claims against many future water uses in the Little Colorado \nRiver Basin. This legislation exemplifies that the Zuni Tribe \ncan achieve its needs for the Zuni Heaven Reservation and avoid a \ndisruption to local water users and industry. The United States will \nalso avoid costly litigation and satisfy its trust responsibilities to \nthe Zuni Tribe.\n\n  This legislation provides much needed assurances to all settlement \nparticipants and is the result of four years of good faith \nnegotiations.\n  I would like to identify and commend the work of the parties to the \nZuni Settlement. The parties consist of rural communities in the First \nDistrict of Arizona, including the City of St. Johns, the Town of Eagar \nand the Town of Springerville. In addition, the State of Arizona, \nspecifically, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the State Land \nDepartment and the Arizona State Parks Board, Salt River Project, \nTucson Electric Power Company, St. Johns Irrigation and Ditch Company, \nthe Lyman Water Company and the Round Valley Water Users' Association.\n  It is now up to this body to take the final step in making this \nsettlement a reality. I ask\n\n[[Page H5028]]\n\nmy colleagues to pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  (Mr. UDALL of New Mexico asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. \n222, the Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2003. This is \na unique water rights settlement, carefully designed to protect the \nZuni's most sacred site while at the same time preserving access to \nwater supplies for upstream users.\n  The Zunis are counting on this legislation, as my colleague from \nArizona knows, to finally settle critical water questions. I urge my \ncolleagues to support Senate S. 222. I would congratulate the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Renzi) on his leadership.\n  This is a unique water rights settlement, carefully designed to \nprotect the Zuni's most sacred site while at the same time preserving \naccess to water supplies for upstream water users.\n  Recently, a delegation of Zuni tribal leaders and members visited my \noffice here in Washington. They told me Zuni Heaven, a riparian area \nalong the Little Colorado River, is central to the Zuni religious and \ncultural traditions and is the place where Zuni deities and ancestors \nhave resided from time immemorial.\n  This sacred riparian area is the home of the Kachina, one of the \nhighest religious orders in Zuni culture, and was in historical times, \na very lust riparian area with willow, cottonwood, cattails, turtles, \nand waterfowl.\n  Ever since the 1877 Presidential order reduced the Zuni cultural \nhomelands and established the current Zuni Reservation in New Mexico, \nthe Zuni people have maintained the practice of making a pilgrimage to \nZuni Heaven.\n  Every 4 years, Zunis from western New Mexico trek over 50 miles to \nZuni Heaven, located in northeast Arizona, to perform religious \nceremonies during the summer solstice. This pilgrimage is very \nimportant because it helps sustain and rejuvenate Zuni cultural and \nreligious traditions.\n  The Zuni Water Rights Settlements will help the Zuni people restore \ntheir sacred Zuni Heaven to the way it was as described in ancient \nhistorical accounts. Furthermore, it will help them develop wetlands \nfor water plants, birds and other animals so important and necessary in \ncarrying on the Zuni Kachina religion.\n  I extend my compliments to the Zuni people, the State of Arizona, and \nthe non-Indian organizations who participated in the negotiations that \nresulted in this historic water settlement.\n  It is unfortunate that we were not able to pass this bill when it \nfirst came before the House earlier this week. The Zuni are counting on \nthis legislation to finally settle critical questions about their water \nrights. We are now able to pass this bill and send it to the President \nfor his signature, and I urge my colleagues to support S. 222.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RENZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 258, the Senate bill is considered read \nfor amendment and the previous question is ordered.\n  The question is on third reading of the Senate bill.\n  The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the \nthird time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the Senate \nbill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and \nnays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ZUNI INDIAN TRIBE WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 2003\n\n\tMr. RENZI. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 258, I call up the Senate bill (S. 222) to approve the settlement of the water rights claims of the Zuni Indian Tribe in Apache County, Arizona, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\tThe Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.\n\tThe text of S. 222 is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 222\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Zuni Indian Tribe Water \n     Rights Settlement Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States, in keeping with \n     its trust responsibility to Indian tribes, to promote Indian \n     self-determination, religious freedom, political and cultural \n     integrity, and economic self-sufficiency, and to settle, \n     wherever possible, the water rights claims of Indian tribes \n     without lengthy and costly litigation.\n       (2) Quantification of rights to water and development of \n     facilities needed to use tribal water supplies effectively is \n     essential to the development of viable Indian reservation \n     communities, particularly in arid western States.\n       (3) On August 28, 1984, and by actions subsequent thereto, \n     the United States established a reservation for the Zuni \n     Indian Tribe in Apache County, Arizona upstream from the \n     confluence of the Little Colorado and Zuni Rivers for long-\n     standing religious and sustenance activities.\n       (4) The water rights of all water users in the Little \n     Colorado River basin in Arizona have been in litigation since \n     1979, in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and \n     for the County of Apache in Civil No. 6417, In re The General \n     Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Little \n     Colorado River System and Source.\n       (5) Recognizing that the final resolution of the Zuni \n     Indian Tribe's water claims through litigation will take many \n     years and entail great expense to all parties, continue to \n     limit the Tribe's access to water with economic, social, and \n     cultural consequences to the Tribe, prolong uncertainty as to \n     the availability of water supplies, and seriously impair the \n     long-term economic planning and development of all parties, \n     the Tribe and neighboring non-Indians have sought to settle \n     their disputes to water and reduce the burdens of litigation.\n       (6) After more than 4 years of negotiations, which included \n     participation by representatives of the United States, the \n     Zuni Indian Tribe, the State of Arizona, and neighboring non-\n     Indian communities in the Little Colorado River basin, the \n     parties have entered into a Settlement Agreement to resolve \n     all of the Zuni Indian Tribe's water rights claims and to \n     assist the Tribe in acquiring surface water rights, to \n     provide for the Tribe's use of groundwater, and to provide \n     for the wetland restoration of the Tribe's lands in Arizona.\n       (7) To facilitate the wetland restoration project \n     contemplated under the Settlement Agreement, the Zuni Indian \n     Tribe acquired certain lands along the Little Colorado River \n     near or adjacent to its Reservation that are important for \n     the success of the project and will likely acquire a small \n     amount of similarly situated additional lands. The parties \n     have agreed not to object to the United States taking title \n     to certain of these lands into trust status; other lands \n     shall remain in tribal fee status. The parties have worked \n     extensively to resolve various governmental concerns \n     regarding use of and control over those lands, and to provide \n     a successful model for these types of situations, the State, \n     local, and tribal governments intend to enter into an \n     Intergovernmental Agreement that addresses the parties' \n     governmental concerns.\n       (8) Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the neighboring \n     non-Indian entities will assist in the Tribe's acquisition of \n     surface water rights and development of groundwater, store \n     surface water supplies for the Zuni Indian Tribe, and make \n     substantial additional contributions to carry out the \n     Settlement Agreement's provisions.\n       (9) To advance the goals of Federal Indian policy and \n     consistent with the trust responsibility of the United States \n     to the Tribe, it is appropriate that the United States \n     participate in the implementation of the Settlement Agreement \n     and contribute funds for the rehabilitation of religious \n     riparian areas and other purposes to enable the Tribe to use \n     its water entitlement in developing its Reservation.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to approve, ratify, and confirm the Settlement \n     Agreement entered into by the Tribe and neighboring non-\n     Indians;\n       (2) to authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior \n     to execute and perform the Settlement Agreement and related \n     waivers;\n       (3) to authorize and direct the United States to take legal \n     title and hold such title to certain lands in trust for the \n     benefit of the Zuni Indian Tribe; and\n       (4) to authorize the actions, agreements, and \n     appropriations as provided for in the Settlement Agreement \n     and this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Pursuant to House Resolution 258, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi) and the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) each will control 20 minutes.\n\tThe Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi).\n  (Mr. RENZI asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks, and include extraneous material.)\n\tMr. RENZI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, in order for my colleagues to get home and be a little more efficient, we have had discussions on this bill. I think that both sides are now ready to vote on it in agreement. I urge adoption.\n\tS. 222, authored by Senator Jon Kyl and identical to legislation introduced by me and Congressman J.D. Hayworth of Arizona, would resolve water rights claims and litigation in the Little Colorado River basin. I would like to commend the commitment and persistence of Senator Kyl on this important settlement. I would also like to recognize the patience and perseverance of the Zuni Tribe.\n\tThe Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2003 would codify the settlement of the Zuni Indian Tribe's water rights for its religious lands in northeastern Arizona. Congress first recognized the importance of these lands in 1984 when it created the Zuni Heaven Reservation. While land issues were addressed in 1984, water rights remained in question until Sen. Kyl's intervention.\n\tUncertainty existed in several of the rural towns upstream from the newly-created Zuni Heaven. These small communities upstream from this Reservation have now been fully-appropriated. A resolution was reached that avoided costly litigation. Parties included the Zuni Tribe, the United States on behalf of the Zuni Tribe, the State of Arizona, including the Arizona Game and Fish Commission, the Arizona State Land Department, and the Arizona State Parks Board, as well as the major water users in this area; negotiations were conducted for many years to produce an acceptable agreement for all parties.\n\tThis legislation would provide the Zuni Tribe with the resources and protections necessary to acquire water rights from willing sellers. In addition, this legislation will restore and protect the wetland environment that previously existed on Zuni Heaven.\n\tIn return, the Zuni Tribe will grandfather existing water uses and waive claims against many future water uses in the Little Colorado River Basin. This legislation exemplifies that the Zuni Tribe can achieve its needs for the Zuni Heaven Reservation and avoid a disruption to local water users and industry. The United States will also avoid costly litigation and satisfy its trust responsibilities to the Zuni Tribe.\n\n\tThis legislation provides much needed assurances to all settlement participants and is the result of four years of good faith negotiations.\n\tI would like to identify and commend the work of the parties to the Zuni Settlement. The parties consist of rural communities in the First District of Arizona, including the City of St. Johns, the Town of Eagar and the Town of Springerville. In addition, the State of Arizona, specifically, the Arizona Game and Fish Department, the State Land Department and the Arizona State Parks Board, Salt River Project, Tucson Electric Power Company, St. Johns Irrigation and Ditch Company, the Lyman Water Company and the Round Valley Water Users' Association.\n\tIt is now up to this body to take the final step in making this settlement a reality. I ask my colleagues to pass this important legislation.\n\tMr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\tMr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. UDALL of New Mexico asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\tMr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 222, the Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2003. This is a unique water rights settlement, carefully designed to protect the Zuni's most sacred site while at the same time preserving access to water supplies for upstream users.\n\tThe Zunis are counting on this legislation, as my colleague from Arizona knows, to finally settle critical water questions. I urge my colleagues to support Senate S. 222. I would congratulate the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Renzi) on his leadership.\n\tThis is a unique water rights settlement, carefully designed to protect the Zuni's most sacred site while at the same time preserving access to water supplies for upstream water users.\n\tRecently, a delegation of Zuni tribal leaders and members visited my office here in Washington. They told me Zuni Heaven, a riparian area along the Little Colorado River, is central to the Zuni religious and cultural traditions and is the place where Zuni deities and ancestors have resided from time immemorial.\n\tThis sacred riparian area is the home of the Kachina, one of the highest religious orders in Zuni culture, and was in historical times, a very lust riparian area with willow, cottonwood, cattails, turtles, and waterfowl.\n\tEver since the 1877 Presidential order reduced the Zuni cultural homelands and established the current Zuni Reservation in New Mexico, the Zuni people have maintained the practice of making a pilgrimage to Zuni Heaven.\n\tEvery 4 years, Zunis from western New Mexico trek over 50 miles to Zuni Heaven, located in northeast Arizona, to perform religious ceremonies during the summer solstice. This pilgrimage is very important because it helps sustain and rejuvenate Zuni cultural and religious traditions.\n\tThe Zuni Water Rights Settlements will help the Zuni people restore their sacred Zuni Heaven to the way it was as described in ancient historical accounts. Furthermore, it will help them develop wetlands for water plants, birds and other animals so important and necessary in carrying on the Zuni Kachina religion.\n\tI extend my compliments to the Zuni people, the State of Arizona, and the non-Indian organizations who participated in the negotiations that resulted in this historic water settlement.\n\tIt is unfortunate that we were not able to pass this bill when it first came before the House earlier this week. The Zuni are counting on this legislation to finally settle critical questions about their water rights. We are now able to pass this bill and send it to the President for his signature, and I urge my colleagues to support S. 222.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\tMr. RENZI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n\tPursuant to House Resolution 258, the Senate bill is considered read for amendment and the previous question is ordered.\n\tThe question is on third reading of the Senate bill.\n\tThe Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the third time.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the Senate bill.\n\tThe question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.\n\tMr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n\tThe yeas and nays were ordered.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Rick Renzi", "Tom Udall"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Pursuant to House Resolution 258, the \ngentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin) and the gentleman from New Mexico \n(Mr. Udall) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin).\n  Mrs. CUBIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, having already debated this bill, I urge its adoption.\n  I rise in support of S. 273, and ask that this body support its \npassage.\n  The Grand Teton National Park Land Exchange Act was introduced by \nSenator Thomas, co-sponsored by Senator Enzi, and is supported by all \nfive elected Wyoming state officials, the National Park Service and the \nlocal communities.\n\n[[Page H5029]]\n\n  The measure passed the Senate on April 3, 2003, under unanimous \nconsent.\n  This bill presents a very unique opportunity with regards to federal \nland management in our National Parks that will greatly benefit the \nAmerican public as well as Wymoning school children.\n  The Jackson Valley has a history as colorful and amazing as the Grand \nTetons that rise nearly 14,000 feet above the glacial lakes at their \nbase.\n  The first visitors to the Grand Tetons and the Jackson Valley were \nthe Shoshone, Crow, Blackfoot, and Gros Ventre Indian tribes who \ntreated the area as a summer hunting ground and sacred area.\n  Later, in the 1800's, many fur trappers visited this consecrated \nground, and were stunned by its raw beauty and diverse ecosystem. In \n1807 even John Colter, who had separated from the Lewis and Clark \nexpedition, explored the area and returned with far fetched tales of \ngeysers, hot springs, and mountains that touched the sky.\n  It was years before his supposed hallucinations were indeed found to \nbe true. From 1824-1840 the Grand Tetons were the central rendezvous \nsite for mountain men all across the west, swapping tall tales and \npelts. The Green River Rendezvous continues to this very day.\n  After the area was settled at the turn of the century, the town of \nJackson elected a Town Mayor and City Council entirely comprised of \nwomen . . . showing just how intelligent the people of Wyoming were, \nand are, to this very day. This was the first All-Female town \ngovernment in our Nation's history. This, of course, occurred in my \nhome state of Wyoming, the Equality State.\n  Grand Teton National Park was later established by Congress on \nFebruary 29, 1929, to protect the natural resources of the Teton range \nand the Jackson area's unique beauty.\n  On March 15, 1943, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established \nthe Jackson Hole National Monument adjacent to the Park.\n  Grand Teton National Park was expanded to its present size by \nCongress on September 14, 1950, to include a portion of the land from \nthe Jackson Hole National Monument.\n  The Park currently encompasses approximately 310,000 acres of \nwilderness and some of the most amazing scenery to be found in any \ncorner of the world.\n  However, when Wyoming received its statehood in 1890, sections of \nland were set aside for school revenue purposes. All income from these \nlands--rents, grazing fees, sales or other sources--is placed in a \nspecial trust fund for the benefit of students in the state.\n  The establishment of these school sections pre-dates the creation of \nmost national parks or monuments within our state boundaries, creating \nseveral state in-holdings within federal land masses, such as in Grand \nTeton National Park.\n  Currently over 1406 acres of state surface and mineral acres are held \nby the state of Wyoming in isolated plots within Grand Teton National \nPark.\n  This legislation would allow the State of Wyoming to trade or sell \nthese precious state lands locked up inside the Park to the federal \ngovernment in exchange for other federal lands, minerals or \nappropriated dollars, or a combination of all three, to address \nWyoming's public school funding needs.\n  Further, the American public can consolidate under National Park \nService management the lands within Grand Teton National Park's borders \nand protect them from future development pressures placed upon the \nstate for the benefit of our schoolchildren.\n  It is a win-win scenario for everyone involved.\n  Within 90 days after this bill is signed into law, the land would be \nvalued through agreement by the Wyoming Governor and the Secretary of \nthe Interior. If there is no agreement, an appraisal process will be \nset up to determine the value of the lands or minerals in question to \nensure fairness to all parties.\n  There will also be an appeals process to further ensure fairness to \nboth the Federal Government and the state of Wyoming.\n  Within 180 days after the state land value is determined, the \nInterior Secretary, in consultation with the Governor, shall determine \nan exchange of federal assets of equal value for the state lands.\n  This body has an incredible opportunity to allow the consolidation of \nlands within Grand Teton National Park borders, and to allow the state \nof Wyoming to capture fair value for their property to benefit all \nWyoming school children.\n  I respectfully request that the members of this body support the \nGrand Teton National Park Land Exchange Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I support the Senate bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. CUBIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 258, the Senate bill is considered read \nfor amendment and the previous question is ordered.\n  The question is on third reading of the Senate bill.\n  The Senate bill was ordered to be read a third time, and was read the \nthird time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 258, I call up the Senate bill (S. 273) to provide for the expeditious completion of the acquisition of land owned by the State of Wyoming within the boundaries of Grand Teton National Park, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\tThe Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.\n\tThe text of S. 273 is as follows:\n\n                                 S. 273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Grand Teton National Park \n     Land Exchange Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act:\n       (1) The term ``Federal lands'' means public lands as \n     defined in section 103(e) of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1702(e)).\n       (2) The term ``Governor'' means the Governor of the State \n     of Wyoming.\n       (3) The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Interior.\n       (4) The term ``State lands'' means lands and interest in \n     lands owned by the State of Wyoming within the boundaries of \n     Grand Teton National Park as identified on a map titled \n     ``Private, State & County Inholdings Grand Teton National \n     Park'', dated March 2001, and numbered GTNP/0001.\n\n     SEC. 3. ACQUISITION OF STATE LANDS.\n\n       (a) The Secretary is authorized to acquire approximately \n     1,406 acres of State lands within the exterior boundaries of \n     Grand Teton National Park, as generally depicted on the map \n     referenced in section 2(4), by any one or a combination of \n     the following--\n       (1) donation;\n       (2) purchase with donated or appropriated funds; or\n       (3) exchange of Federal lands in the State of Wyoming that \n     are identified for disposal under approved land use plans in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this Act under section 202 \n     of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 \n     U.S.C. 1712) that are of equal value to the State lands \n     acquired in the exchange.\n       (b) In the event that the Secretary or the Governor \n     determines that the Federal lands eligible for exchange under \n     subsection (a)(3) are not sufficient or acceptable for the \n     acquisition of all the State lands identified in section \n     2(4), the Secretary shall identify other Federal lands or \n     interests therein in the State of Wyoming for possible \n     exchange and shall identify such lands or interests together \n     with their estimated value in a report to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate and \n     the Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives. \n     Such lands or interests shall not be available for exchange \n     unless authorized by an Act of Congress enacted after the \n     date of submission of the report.\n\n     SEC. 4.

AUTHORIZATION FOR APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary for the purposes of this Act.\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 258, the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin) and the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) each will control 20 minutes.\n\tThe Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin).\n\tMrs. CUBIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. Speaker, having already debated this bill, I urge its adoption.\n\tI rise in support of S. 273, and ask that this body support its passage.\n\tThe Grand Teton National Park Land Exchange Act was introduced by Senator Thomas, co-sponsored by Senator Enzi, and is supported by all five elected Wyoming state officials, the National Park Service and the local communities. \n\tThe measure passed the Senate on April 3, 2003, under unanimous consent.\n\tThis bill presents a very unique opportunity with regards to federal land management in our National Parks that will greatly benefit the American public as well as Wymoning school children.\n\tThe Jackson Valley has a history as colorful and amazing as the Grand Tetons that rise nearly 14,000 feet above the glacial lakes at their base.\n\tThe first visitors to the Grand Tetons and the Jackson Valley were the Shoshone, Crow, Blackfoot, and Gros Ventre Indian tribes who treated the area as a summer hunting ground and sacred area.\n\tLater, in the 1800's, many fur trappers visited this consecrated ground, and were stunned by its raw beauty and diverse ecosystem. In 1807 even John Colter, who had separated from the Lewis and Clark expedition, explored the area and returned with far fetched tales of geysers, hot springs, and mountains that touched the sky.\n\tIt was years before his supposed hallucinations were indeed found to be true. From 1824-1840 the Grand Tetons were the central rendezvous site for mountain men all across the west, swapping tall tales and pelts. The Green River Rendezvous continues to this very day.\n\tAfter the area was settled at the turn of the century, the town of Jackson elected a Town Mayor and City Council entirely comprised of women . . . showing just how intelligent the people of Wyoming were, and are, to this very day. This was the first All-Female town government in our Nation's history. This, of course, occurred in my home state of Wyoming, the Equality State.\n\tGrand Teton National Park was later established by Congress on February 29, 1929, to protect the natural resources of the Teton range and the Jackson area's unique beauty.\n\tOn March 15, 1943, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt established the Jackson Hole National Monument adjacent to the Park.\n\tGrand Teton National Park was expanded to its present size by Congress on September 14, 1950, to include a portion of the land from the Jackson Hole National Monument.\n\tThe Park currently encompasses approximately 310,000 acres of wilderness and some of the most amazing scenery to be found in any corner of the world.\n\tHowever, when Wyoming received its statehood in 1890, sections of land were set aside for school revenue purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, and I am glad to see \nhim on the floor, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the leader, for \nthe purpose of inquiring about the schedule for next week.\n  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer) for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for \nmorning hour debates and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will \nconsider several measures under suspension of rules. A final list of \nthose bills will be sent to the Members' offices by the end of the \nweek. Any votes called on those measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.\n  On Tuesday and Wednesday we expect to consider additional bills under \nsuspension of the rules. We also plan to consider several bills under a \nrule: H.R. 2115, the Flight 100--Century of Aviation Reauthorization \nAct, to reauthorize programs for the Federal Aviation Administration; \nH.R. 1115, the Class Action Fairness Act; and H.R. 2143, the Unlawful \nInternet Gambling Funding Prohibition Act.\n  In addition to these bills, we may also consider H.R. 1528, the \nTaxpayer Protection and IRS Accountability Act.\n  And, finally, I would like to note for all Members that we are making \na change in the schedule that was sent to offices at the beginning of \nthe year. We do not plan to have votes next Friday, June 13.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the leader for his informing us of the schedule \nthat is contemplated for next week.\n  Mr. Leader, I do not see Child Tax Credit legislation listed on next \nweek's schedule. I did not hear you talk about that.\n  We have a bill, as I think you probably know, the Rangel/DeLauro/\nDavis bill, that will make sure working families and our service \nmembers left out of the recently enacted tax bill get the child tax \ncredit they should have. We have sought unanimous consent to bring this \nbill up, but we have been denied and not successful. There is \napparently agreement in the Senate, as we understand it, to take this \nmatter up perhaps today.\n  When do you expect that we might be able to consider child tax credit \nlegislation on the floor, Mr. Leader?\n  Mr. DeLAY. The gentleman knows that we think we have already done \nchild tax credit in a very meaningful way. Whatever the Senate does, \ncertainly we will take it under consideration, but our schedule and our \nagenda that has been announced from the first of the year is that we \nwill have several tax relief bills. Of those bills, maybe this \nprovision that the gentleman is talking about could be included. I do \nnot know, but the Committee on Ways and Means would certainly take it \nunder advisement.\n  We have scheduled certainly an international tax bill for this \nsummer. We have already announced that we would like to see the total \nrepeal of death tax made permanent. There will probably be another tax \nrelief bill, so there is plenty of opportunity for the gentleman to \ntalk about that provision that the Senate may have left out of the bill \nsigned by the President a week ago.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman. He and I may disagree as to the \nfact that the Senate left it out. It was left out. We agree on that. \nThe Senate, of course, had it in its bill. We did not.\n  Am I correct then that there are no plans next week to have on the \nfloor of the House as far as you know a child tax credit bill?\n  Mr. DeLAY. I cannot say no plans. As the gentleman knows, in this \nbusiness you never say never.\n  I am under the impression that the other body has some sort of \npackage that they have put together. If they pass that package today or \ntomorrow, the Committee on Ways and Means can certainly take it under \nadvisement and make recommendations to the leadership, and that may \nhappen next week. I just cannot tell the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his observation. I take it then \nthat if the Senate does not pass something over here, that we would \nhave no thought that that would be on the schedule for next week?\n  Mr. DeLAY. If the minority on the Committee on Ways and Means wants \nto participate in the process, certainly in those tax provisions that \nare being worked on as we speak by the Committee on Ways and Means, \nthey could certainly participate in that process, try to get their \nprovision in, gather the votes to pass it, and bring it out here, and \nhopefully they would support a tax relief bill.\n  Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, without taking this further, than \nperhaps we need to go in a colloquy of this type on the schedule, Mr. \nLeader. In a serious vein, the minority on the Committee on Ways and \nMeans would love to participate in the process. I would tell the \nleader, with all due respect and very sincerely, the minority in the \nCommittee on Ways and Means does not believe it is included in the \nprocess; and that is of concern to us.\n  If perhaps you could talk with the chairman, with your persuasive \npowers, perhaps, in fact, we could participate in the process and \nperhaps we would be able to offer such an amendment; and, clearly, if \nthat would happen, we would offer such an amendment, I assure the \nleader. So if he could help us with the chairman of the\n\n[[Page H5032]]\n\ncommittee, that would be greatly appreciated.\n  Medicare prescription drugs, Mr. Leader, what can you tell us about \nwhen we can expect to see Medicare prescription drug legislation \nconsidered in the committees of jurisdiction and then on the floor?\n  Mr. DeLAY. As previously announced, we had tried to get Medicare \nmodernization onto the floor before the Memorial Day break. Obviously, \nthere was a tremendous amount of work that needed to be done, and we \nhad to postpone that goal. We have set a new goal, and we hope that we \ncan have Medicare modernization to the floor before the July 4 break. \nThe Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce are working hard to develop a proposal that would modernize \nand preserve the Medicare program and provide needy citizens with life-\nsaving drugs. But while the complexity of this issue means that our \nstaffs and committees need to be working and they are working very \nhard, we still hope to have a bill for the House to consider before the \nend of the month.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that information.\n  Lastly, I would ask the gentleman, I have served on the Committee on \nAppropriations for many years. We have not marked up yet, as the \ngentleman knows, any bills in subcommittee nor, obviously, in full \ncommittee at this point in time. In fact, we have not been given 302(b) \nallocation, as the leader knows. Would the leader be able to tell us \nwhat schedule he now foresees for appropriations bills and when we \nmight do the 302(b) allocations?\n  Mr. DeLAY. The gentleman is absolutely correct. We are way behind in \nour appropriations process. I am very concerned about that. We had \nhoped that this year that the House and the Senate could work out an \nagreement of allocation so that we could work together more smoothly \nthan we have in the past as two bodies. We are still hopeful that we \ncan get that kind of an agreement. But I anticipate the mark-ups in the \nsubcommittee to begin, and I am very hopeful they can start beginning \nnext week. But it is still probably a little too early to tell.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  Reclaiming my time, obviously, last year the discussion was the \nfailure to pass a budget undermined the appropriations process. Of \ncourse, we have passed a budget, I would say somewhat facetiously. That \nprobably undermines the appropriations process as well, but, \nnevertheless, we are behind, as the gentleman indicates. We are \nconcerned that we get so far behind that we are unable to pass \nappropriations bills by the end of the fiscal year, and I am pleased to \nhear that perhaps we are moving ahead to start giving the allocation \nfor the subcommittees and having mark-ups perhaps as soon as next week. \nI thank the gentleman for the information.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)\n\tMr. HOYER.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for two bills \nto provide financial relief to our Nation's senior citizens. Both men \nand women will receive assistance with this legislation, but because \nolder women are often with less financial resources, they will \nparticularly benefit.\n  My first bill, H.R. 1922, the Fair Taxes for Seniors Act, allows the \nfact that the current capital gains tax exemption on the sale of a home \nis not working for seniors who live in areas with higher housing \nprices. The bill provides a one-time increase in the capital gains \nexemption for sales of homes for citizens who are 50 years and older.\n  My second bill, the Social Security Survivors Fairness Act, provides \nSocial Security widows benefits for women under the age of 60. Mr. \nSpeaker, I have stories about various seniors in my District talking \nabout the need for this exemption for the capital gains of the sale of \ntheir home and also for the lowering of the age for which they can \nbecome eligible for Social Security.\n  I will include my full statement at this point.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for two bills to provide \nfinancial relief to our Nation's senior citizens. Both men and women \nwill receive assistance with this legislation, but because older women \nare often with less financial resources, they will particularly \nbenefit.\n  My first bill is H.R. 1922, the Fair Taxes for Seniors Act.

My \nbill provides a one-time increase in the capital gains tax exemption on \nthe sale of a home for citizens who are 50 or older.\n  Eleanor, a 78-year-old citizen, lives in Glen Ellyn, Illinois and \nbought her home 45 years ago with her husband, who has passed away. The \ncombined Federal and State taxes on her home after the current capital \ngains exemption are $68,000. She needs this money from the sale of her \nhouse in order to move into a nursing home. Eleanor wants to stay in \nthe Chicago area because her friends are there, but the price of \nnursing care there is high. Should a 78-year-old woman have to move \nfrom the city she has lived all her life because, as a widow, she is \nconsidered single and has to pay higher taxes?\n  Marilyn is a single, professional woman who lives in Mission Hills, \nCalifornia--near my congressional district. She chose to become \ninvolved in her community and has stayed in the same house throughout \nher lifetime. Marilyn is now 60 years old and wants to sell her home \nand move to a smaller condo in the same area. Her combined Federal and \nState taxes are $169,940 after the current exemption. Should singles \nwho remain in one house for many years be taxed for their stability--\nand essentially for being single?\n  Sally, a divorced, single mother in Seattle, Washington is 57 years \nold. She chose to stay in one home for 37 years so her children could \nstay in the same school system and she could live near her work and her \nchurch. One of her adult children has developed severe health problems \nand has to pay medical bills not covered by insurance. Sally is selling \nher home to pay some of the doctor's bills. Her combined Federal and \nState taxes are $64,000. This tax money is money that Sally should be \nable to use to pay off medical bills as well as to get ready for her \nown retirement.\n  My bill would provide a one-time increase of $500,000 for a single \nperson and $1 million for a couple in the amount excludable from the \nsale of a principal residence for taxpayers who have reached the age of \n50. Let us help our citizens over age 50 who have lived in one home for \nmany years. Let them keep the proceeds from the sale of their homes for \nretirement and health care costs. An added benefit is that family \nmembers and perhaps the government will be relieved of the burden of \ncaring for these individuals as they grow older.\n  My second bill is H.R. 1923, the Social Security Survivors Fairness \nAct, to provide Social Security widows' benefits for women under the \nage of 60. Maria is a 58-year-old widow who lives in San Ysidro, \nCalifornia in my congressional district.

Something occurs that you all are a part of, and you all know \nwhat those were.\n  I also asked and you all made a pledge as a class to do well in your \nduties, do well in your school work, do well in the dorm activities, \nand for the most part, I think you can say you accomplished your \nmission well, and I am very thankful as the Chairman of the page board \nthat I did not have to see very many of you very often.

So you can sit back at home and watch it on \ntelevision for a little bit and enjoy it that way instead of having to \nparticipate in it every day.\n  Over the years, you will come to understand just how important an \nexperience this is for you, or at least I hope you will, and I think \nall of you will do that.\n  First, I just want to say the job that you do for us is very \nimportant. I liken it to being the grease that helps to make the House \nof Representatives run every day from having squeaky wheels. It is the \noil that makes the machine work correctly. You really do in a very \nquiet and silent way, kind of behind the scenes, you perform very \nimportant functions for us, and we are very grateful for that. \nSometimes perhaps we do not say it often enough or we do not say it in \nthe right way. So I just want to say thank you for the outstanding job \nthat you do.\n  It would not be possible to do the job of pages with other people \nhandling those tasks. There is a very special reason that we have kept \nthis program constituted the way it is, with young people coming from \nall walks of life, all parts of the United States, all kinds of \ncommunities, all backgrounds, all ethnic groups, that come here to get \na sense of what the House of Representatives, what the Congress, what \nthe United States Government is all about because in a very real sense, \nyou go back to your communities, to your schools, to your families, to \nyour fellow students as ambassadors, as ambassadors from the House of \nRepresentatives, as ambassadors from the United States Congress to tell \nthem something about the institution that you have had an opportunity \nfor a year not just to study but to live, to actually be a part of.\n  So for this last year, you have really come to understand in ways \nperhaps that you do not even recognize right now because it is just \nabsorbed to you but over the years you will understand things that you \nknow now about the House of Representatives that other people do not \nunderstand and do not know about.\n  The most important thing that I hope you will take away from this is \nthat the people who serve here are good. The people who work in this \nplace are good. The staff that work behind this desk, the staff that \nwork in all of the buildings, that work in all of the offices, the \nstaff that help you to go through this year, the Members who serve in \nthe House of Representatives and the Members who serve in the United \nStates Senate, sure there are bad eggs. There are always bad eggs \nsomeplace, but they are by and large good people.\n  The most important thing is not that. It is the institution itself. \nThe institution is much larger than the people who serve in this body. \nThis morning we swore in a new Member. I think I heard the figure, the \n9,883rd person in the history of the United States to serve in the \nHouse of Representatives. It is a great privilege for me to serve in \nthe House, and I can guarantee that as I look out to faces here there \nare one or two, maybe more, of you who will someday be back here as \nMembers of the House of Representatives.\n  It is not the people that serve here. It is the institution itself \nthat makes this country different from other countries. It is the \nconcept of the rule of law. It is the concept of the history. It is the \nconcept of the institution that makes our government work.\n  In my capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, \nExport Financing and Related Programs I have a responsibility and an \nopportunity to travel to a lot of countries around the world, and \nsometimes I see countries that have great wealth, great natural \nresources, have everything going for them except they do not have the \ninstitutions. They do not have the rule of law. That is what makes the \nUnited States different.\n  We should never just assume it is always there. It is something that \nhas to be protected. It is something that has to be worked for every \nday. That is why I think this that you now have a responsibility as a \nformer page to go back to your communities, to become active citizens \nin your communities, to help to participate in your community, to \nparticipate in the political process.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  You will do it in different ways. Most of you will never run for any \noffice; but you will get involved, perhaps in a school community, in \nthe school board. You will do one of these different things; and \nsomeday, yes, one of you will be in Congress. Maybe one of you will be \nPresident of the United States. I can look out here and see many that I \nthink might fill that role.\n  The important thing is that you stay involved in your community. The \nimportant thing is that you make a contribution to this great country \nso that your children and your grandchildren can someday sit on this \nfloor and have the same experience. It does not just happen. It happens \nbecause Americans care enough to make it happen. You have cared enough \nto come here and to be a part of this, and we thank you for the job \nthat you have done. We thank you for the commitment that you have made \nyear long to this responsibility, to this work. And we thank you now as \nyou go back to your communities.\n  I wish you all the very best, and I hope I see the faces of many of \nyou around here in the future. Thank you. Godspeed.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I \nwant to make sure I hand in the list of the departing pages, the class \nof 2003, over here. As you know, you will want to make sure you grab \nyour official transcript of the day's proceedings and activities and \nyou will be able to see your name in the Congressional Record, and that \nis why we do that.\n  Perhaps one of you will become Speaker of the House, maybe you will \nbe the President; but the really good job is to be the chairman of the \nPage Board, so that is what you ought to shoot for. Anybody can be \nPresident, not very many people can be chairman of the Page Board or a \nmember of the Page Board; and that is what you should be shooting for.\n  I am pleased today to recognize a true friend of the page program. \nYou are in the 20th anniversary class, the reconstituted page program. \nThis year, my colleague who is on the Page Board, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Kildee), is celebrating 20 years of service to this \nprogram. I have only been doing it 5 years, and look at all the gray \nhair I have; but he has been doing it 20 years.\n  Mr. Kildee has touched the lives of literally thousands of pages just \nlike you throughout his 20 years. In his early days on the board, he \noversaw the creation of the page school and the residence hall. Most \nrecently, he was instrumental in the planning and construction phases \nof the brand new residence hall. And as I like to say, you all are \nliving in tall cotton compared to the location the other pages resided \nin. They had to really weather some severe hardships. But the gentleman \nfrom Michigan was very instrumental in that planning, and I think you \nare all pleased with the residence hall. I know I am. And I know you \nare all grateful to him for that.\n  Under the leadership of the gentleman from Michigan, the program has \ngrown and flourished to be an outstanding opportunity for bright young \npeople. Today, the program encompasses aspects of academic work and a \nsocial life that has made it truly a comprehensive experience. We thank \nhim for his tireless dedication to the Page Board and we congratulate \nhim for 20 years of service.\n  I am going to ask Mr. Kildee to come up, but what he does not know, \nand I will go over here now, is that we have a little surprise for him. \nWe are going to present to him this plaque: ``The United States House \nof Representatives Page Program, Presented to the Honorable Dale \nKildee, In Honor of 20 Years of Service to the Page Program, 1983 to \n2003.''\n\n[[Page H5035]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much. Mr. \nSpeaker, this has been a great year. It has been a great 20 years. \nIndeed, Mr. Speaker, I have served now 20 years on the Page Board, \nhaving been appointed by Speaker Tip O'Neill. I would like to express \nmy personal gratitude to all the pages who have served so diligently in \nthis House during the 108th Congress. It is the 14th Congress that I \nhave served in, and I love every day of it.\n  We Members of Congress, we all recognize the important role that you \npages have in making this House really work, work efficiently, and work \nwith some inspiration from you because we all get inspired by those who \nare younger than us, have those ideals and remind us of those ideals. I \nhave had some meals with some of you, enjoyed that very much, and had a \nchance to talk to you on the floor. This has been a very, very good \ngroup.\n  This group of young people, you come from all across our Nation, and \nyou represent what is so good in our country. You give us so much hope \nfor our future. Indeed, I think all of us can say, those of us \nespecially who are so close to the page program, that we are better \npeople for having had contact with you because you give us such \ninspiration and so much hope.\n  To become a page you have proven yourself first of all to be \nacademically qualified. It is not easy to become a page. You have \nventured away from the security of your homes and families to spend \ntime in, for most all of you, a very, very unfamiliar city. And through \nthis experience as a page you have witnessed a new culture, made new \nfriends; and some of you will, I will guarantee, I have been here 27 \nyears in the Congress, 20 years on the Page Board, some of you, 27 and \nmore years from now, will still be friends and you will be staying in \ncontact. Because I know some of those pages I first met when I became a \nmember of the Page Board still remain in contact.\n  We all know that this body has experienced so many things and you \nhave witnessed history like no other group. There is a great group in \nthis country called Close Up, which is a very good group; but no one, \nno one has seen the Congress as close up as you. No one. You have seen \nthis body address the awesome question of war itself. You have become \nreally part of history.\n  Your job is not an easy one. First of all, you have to possess the \nmaturity to balance the very competing demands for your time and your \nenergy. I always say there are three different arenas down here: you \nhave the floor and the buildings around the Capitol, where you have \nassignments; you have the school and the demands in the school; and you \nhave the dorm. There are three different arenas. And let me tell you, \nyou have done a very, very good job in every one of those arenas, and I \nam personally very, very proud of you.\n  And you have to work long hours, really long hours, and interact with \npeople at every level. We have some people who are humble in this body \nand some maybe not as humble, but you interact with all of them and you \ndo it well. You face a challenge in the school itself. It is a very \ntough school. Former Congressman William Whitehurst, Republican, who \nwent on the Page Board with me, he and I worked together to get that \nschool accredited. And, Bill, if you are listening, thanks a lot. He \nlives in Virginia, and he was just a great Member; and we were \ndetermined to get the school accredited. And it is a tough school.\n  You are away, and you have to go back for your senior year to another \nschool. That alone presents a challenge to you. But you will meet that \nchallenge because you are special people. I am sure that you will \nconsider the time spent here in Washington, D.C. to be one of the most \nvaluable experiences of your life and that will lead you on to very \nsuccessful and productive lives.\n  My two sons were pages in this body, and they went on to serve their \ncountry as captains in the Army. One is leaving, my youngest one, \nleaving for Pakistan very shortly. He has been in Afghanistan, \nUzbekistan. But there are so many ways of serving one's country; and \nyou have grown in your love for this country, you have grown in respect \nfor this country, and you have seen the Congress at its best and \nsometimes at its worst. We are human beings, but this is the best \nsystem in the world.\n  We are going to miss all of you very, very much; and may God bestow \nhis richest blessings upon you. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan for all \nthe work he has done, and I also want to recognize and thank some other \nfolks for their long-time service and who are very special to the \nprogram, and you know many of them. Donn Anderson, former Clerk of the \nHouse and former page himself, serves on the Page Board as a member \nemeritus. Of course, he has a 20-year record. Donn, thank you. Barbara \nBowen, who has ushered countless students through the confusing worlds \nof algebra and pre-calculus as the House page math teacher. And Ron \nWeitzel has instructed bright-eyed pages in the rich and complex \nhistory of America as the House page school history teacher. Thank you, \nDonn, Barbara, and Ron for your dedication and commitment to the page \nprogram.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from \nthe great State of California (Mr. Lewis), to say a few words. Mr. \nChairman.\n  Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding me this time.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a totally unexpected circumstance, for \nit has not been my privilege to serve on the Page Board. My name is \nJerry Lewis, from California. I have the privilege of chairing the \nsubcommittee that deals with national defense. Our Secretary of Defense \nand General Meyers are briefing the Members, as you may know, over in \nthe Rayburn Building; and we have had those discussions many a time. \nBut I came here to the floor for other reasons and found this going on \nand thought it might be an opportunity to express my appreciation and \nsay a few words to this class as you are leaving, for a time at any \nrate, the Nation's capital.\n  I wanted to share a couple of thoughts with you. When I was young, \nnot really thinking about public affairs, I grew up in a household \nwhere my mother was a Democrat and my father was a Republican. So I \ngrew up pretty confused, and over those early years spent a lot of time \ntrying to figure out what are the Democrats all about and what are the \nRepublicans all about, and is there really a lot of difference between \nthese huge gray donkeys and elephants.\n  I came to Washington for the first time in 1955 as a student at UCLA, \nalong with 11 other students, on our way to India in a program that \nexisted before the Peace Corps, called Project India. Our job was to \ntravel to Southeast Asia, go from community to community in India and \ntry to communicate with our friends, Indian college students. On the \nway, we stopped in the Nation's capital. I had not been far out of San \nBernardino before that. We spent a couple of days talking to USIA and \nthe State Department people, and then we took a half day off to look at \nthe monuments of this wonderful place. That is the story I kind of want \nto begin to share with you.\n  On that trip together we walked up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial \nfor the first time, saw that wonderful statue seated in that temple. It \nis a magnificent first experience, chills up your spine. We had an \nappointment shortly thereafter on the edge of the Potomac, and in those \ndays you could take a chain of boats and ride in a chain of boats along \nthe Potomac and look at the Capitol and monuments from a different \nperspective.\n  We found ourselves waiting for a half hour, 45 minutes, and finally \nan hour went by only to learn that the reason for our wait was because \ntwo of our students were being told they would have to ride in a boat \nto be attached to the back because they happened to be black. The \nsummer of 1955, 12 young idealistic kids from UCLA going to India to \ntalk about freedom and hope and opportunity, and that scene at the \nLincoln Memorial, and then that experience on the Potomac is something \nyou just cannot wipe out of your memory.\n  But the point was not at all that our country had not made \nsignificant progress between the days of Lincoln and that summer of \n1955. Clearly we had made much progress in our country. Clearly, also, \nwe have made a lot\n\n[[Page H5036]]\n\nof progress since then and today. But the real point is, as I visit \nLincoln, the real point is that this is our government, your \ngovernment. If we are not happy with pieces of it, clearly we have a \nresponsibility to try to impact it, to push it, to shove it down a \npathway that makes a lot more sense from our perspective.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I went to India that summer thinking that maybe I might \nactually go into politics some time. I thought then I would probably \nrun for office as a Democrat. I came back from India convinced, as I \nwent through the summer trying to figure out the differences between \nthe two great parties, that for me, Jerry Lewis, I probably absolutely \nwould run for public office one day, but if I did so, I had made the \ndecision that the place where I could have the biggest impact was on \nthe Republican side of the aisle instead.\n  I draw the painting regarding the Potomac for one reason, and the \nquest for the difference between one or the other, I would love to hear \nfrom some of you in the months and years ahead, hear from you about \nwhat you decide to do in terms of your pathway in life, and what you \ndecided to do if you involved yourself in partisan politics. Because it \nis people like you who make the two great parties great. But, more \nimportantly, you can continue to make sure that our country is by far \nthe best and the most important force for freedom in the world.\n  Thank you for what you have done, and it is a pleasure to have been \nwith you.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, obviously, the chairman \nfor sharing some time with us. I have a few last things to mention that \nare more serious, and then we will have a few lighthearted comments.\n  I would challenge you to find out what motivates yourself. What you \nhave learned as a page going through this program is what is going to \nserve you well. You have learned a good work ethnic and how to work \nhard. That is going to be important throughout the rest of your life. \nYou have learned the importance of a good education. That will tide you \nover as you continue to pursue that.\n  You have learned how to respect one another. I think what our world \nneeds more of is people learning how to respect one another, and I \nthink the program does a great job in doing that.\n  Also, do not give up. Whatever happens, do not give up. At West \nPoint, my alma mater, we say much of the history we teach was made by \nthe individuals we taught; and I think that is true, what can be said \nof the page program and the page school, because much of the history \nthat we know now today has been made by former pages.\n  You have in essence now a great tradition to follow, and I want to \nencourage you to make us proud. And you already have made us proud. You \nall in this group have completed more than 1,400 hours of community \nservice. We need to tell that story. You know it, but this helps us get \nthe message out. That breaks down to an average of 21 hours per page.\n  Some examples of the things that you have done are Horton's Kids \nTutoring Program. That was covered in one of the local papers. The \nMultiple Sclerosis Walk, Calvary Women's Shelter, Martha's Table, \nRonald McDonald House and work at the Congressional Cemetery.\n  As a class, you have also proven to have the most terrible luck with \nweather. From the misty Sunday morning you moved in until the misty \nnight of your prom, you have slogged through countless seminars and \nresidence hall trips in the rain. In fact, the sun just came up today \nafter many, many days of overcast skies. You did not even get a \nreprieve on the day that you were led through the Shenandoahs in the \nrain. You braved the elements recently on a trip to Six Flags and when \nyou rode the roller coasters despite the rain.\n  You have proven that rain cannot dampen your enthusiasm and good \nhumor, and it looks like you may be in luck: No rain forecasted for \ntomorrow's departure ceremony, but, given your track record, I would \nnot count on it. I am going to echo Mrs. Miranda's advice, bring rain \ngear.\n  Also, we have discovered that the future President of the United \nStates, Bryce Chitwood, who was in charge of the page auction which \nraised a record-breaking amount of money for the page prom, $9,000, it \nlooks like his fund-raising skills are well organized for future goals \nand aspirations.\n  Our future Major League baseball player, Ben Hanna, who, it has been \nsaid, has great baseball player's hair. I have no idea what that means. \nAll I know is what I am reading here.\n  One future NASCAR driver, Katie Murray, just has to learn to keep all \nfour wheels on the track.\n  We have one future tycoon, John Malcovitch, who was born to wear a \ntuxedo and will be in the same league as Bill Gates, who was also a \npage. And I have also been told that at least three of our pages are \ngoing directly to college, skipping their senior year, and \ncongratulations, I think. They are Sam Rykaczewski, Lauren Conn, and \nMichael Tanner. This is just one example of all the great successes.\n  But also as exciting is Democratic pages last week participated in \nthe annual ``How many pages can you fit into a cloakroom phone booth?'' \nThat is not a tradition on the other side, and I hesitate to mention it \nbecause it might become one. The answer is 11, and congratulations. I \ndo not know if that is a record or not. I will have to talk to your \nfolks and see where the record might be. I cannot imagine getting 11 in \none of those phone booths.\n  You also have discovered the nook between the page desk and the \nstorage cabinet. You all call it the reading corner. Mrs. Ivester calls \nit the sleeping corner, and Democratic pages rush to work each day in \nhopes that they will find the secret candy drawer filled. When the \ndrawer is empty, they can always count on the Democratic cloakroom \nmanagers feeding them bags of Georgia peanuts throughout the day. \nDemocratic pages often say they work for peanuts.\n  I know that Helen and Pat back in the Republican cloakroom want to \nmake sure that we have a special thanks for Matt Buckham for all his \nwork carrying groceries for them.\n  We have talked through the aspect of this point in time in history \nand you all being involved in that. I think Members have been able to \nrelay our thanks to you for your commitment to the institution. As \nchairman of the page board, I can speak for my colleague from Michigan \nand the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) to say we thank you \nfor upholding the honor and the integrity of the program. It makes it a \nlot easier for us.\n  Not only that, but the good work that you have done in volunteering, \nI think you have set a new standard for future page classes. We are \ndefinitely going to miss you, but life goes on. You have great \nchallenges ahead. Always remember this important time in your life will \nnot only be in your memory, but it will be in ours. We look forward to \nseeing you when you come back to visit.\n  God bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America.\n\n                       Departing Pages, 2002-2003\n\n       Yvonne Aguilar, Claire Anderson, Candice Armstrong, Harry \n     Bond, Trisha Belle, Robert Brown, Matthew Buckham, Donald \n     Burke, Samuel Burke, Simona Burke, Thomas Carroll, Chris \n     Cantrell, Stephanie Chesnov, Bryce Chitwood, Daniel Clayson, \n     Kevin Clout, Lauren Conn, Christopher Denton, Ben Fendler, \n     Susan Forrester, Doug Gill, David Gorgani, Laura Greenwood, \n     Emily Hagan, Benjamin Hannan, Margaret Hartley, Jane Heaton, \n     Alicia Hines, Margaret Hobbs, Chris Kataros, James Kotecki, \n     Jeffrey Lakin, Erica Lally, Julie Leonard, Rong Li, Alejandra \n     Lopez, John Malcovich, Tania Martinez, Emily McCarthy, Emily \n     MacMillan-Ladd, Jennifer McDervitt, Laura Meixel, Greta \n     Meyers, Michael Mullee, Kiera Murphy, Kaitlin Murray, \n     Kristine Nagle, Amber Nixon, Lauren Noyes, Garrett Payne, \n     Lisandro Rivera, Alex Rochester, Rene Rosales, Sam \n     Rykazewski, Matthew Schmitz, Allie Smoot, Neva St. Morris, \n     Sarah Stafford, Elizabeth Sterling, Annabell Talamoa, Michael \n     Tanner, Michael Tedori, Emily Toner, Emily White, Rebecca \n     Williams, Leandra Wilson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "HONORING THE PAGE CLASS OF 2003\n\n  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)\n\tMr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, if I could ask the page class of 2003 to come down and take seats here in the first and second row, maybe spread it out to both sides.\n\tHere we are, about to end a year, and this is a tradition. Unfortunately, a lot of us have to go back to our district and will not be here for graduation. I know the class is having the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Tom Davis) speak. He will represent us well as a former page himself, but this gives us a chance as a collective body to say thank you for all your work and support and friendship and things that you have done over the years.\n\tObviously, we remember just a short time ago welcoming you and I do not know if you remember some of the comments, but I know what I have said to other classes is that you get an opportunity to observe and work with elected Members of Congress and you will see history in the making. We did not know what that would be, but it has happened every year. Something occurs that you all are a part of, and you all know what those were.\n\tI also asked and you all made a pledge as a class to do well in your duties, do well in your school work, do well in the dorm activities, and for the most part, I think you can say you accomplished your mission well, and I am very thankful as the Chairman of the page board that I did not have to see very many of you very often. So thank you for not only doing your work but upholding the great tradition of the page program because that helps us continue to move the page program forward.\n\tI am going to be able to intersperse comments as I have a lot of colleagues that want to make sure they say a special farewell to you, and so I am going to pause right now. I am going to ask the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), my colleague, to come up and say his farewell as a Member of Congress.\n\tMr. KOLBE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois for yielding to me, and I want to say to all of you it is great to be here with you on this day. This is something of a bittersweet day, I know, for you as you leave an experience that is going to be an experience of a lifetime. I can tell you that from having been through it myself many years ago as a page, but it is also you are going to be returning home to your friends and your families, and that is always good, and you are not going to have to be rousted out of bed in the morning for early duty over here and you are not going to have late nights on the floor of the House for a while. So you can sit back at home and watch it on television for a little bit and enjoy it that way instead of having to participate in it every day.\n\tOver the years, you will come to understand just how important an experience this is for you, or at least I hope you will, and I think all of you will do that.\n\tFirst, I just want to say the job that you do for us is very important. I liken it to being the grease that helps to make the House of Representatives run every day from having squeaky wheels. It is the oil that makes the machine work correctly. You really do in a very quiet and silent way, kind of behind the scenes, you perform very important functions for us, and we are very grateful for that. Sometimes perhaps we do not say it often enough or we do not say it in the right way. So I just want to say thank you for the outstanding job that you do.\n\tIt would not be possible to do the job of pages with other people handling those tasks. There is a very special reason that we have kept this program constituted the way it is, with young people coming from all walks of life, all parts of the United States, all kinds of communities, all backgrounds, all ethnic groups, that come here to get a sense of what the House of Representatives, what the Congress, what the United States Government is all about because in a very real sense, you go back to your communities, to your schools, to your families, to your fellow students as ambassadors, as ambassadors from the House of Representatives, as ambassadors from the United States Congress to tell them something about the institution that you have had an opportunity for a year not just to study but to live, to actually be a part of.\n\tSo for this last year, you have really come to understand in ways perhaps that you do not even recognize right now because it is just absorbed to you but over the years you will understand things that you know now about the House of Representatives that other people do not understand and do not know about.\n\tThe most important thing that I hope you will take away from this is that the people who serve here are good. The people who work in this place are good. The staff that work behind this desk, the staff that work in all of the buildings, that work in all of the offices, the staff that help you to go through this year, the Members who serve in the House of Representatives and the Members who serve in the United States Senate, sure there are bad eggs. There are always bad eggs someplace, but they are by and large good people.\n\tThe most important thing is not that. It is the institution itself. The institution is much larger than the people who serve in this body. This morning we swore in a new Member. I think I heard the figure, the 9,883rd person in the history of the United States to serve in the House of Representatives. It is a great privilege for me to serve in the House, and I can guarantee that as I look out to faces here there are one or two, maybe more, of you who will someday be back here as Members of the House of Representatives.\n\tIt is not the people that serve here. It is the institution itself that makes this country different from other countries. It is the concept of the rule of law. It is the concept of the history. It is the concept of the institution that makes our government work.\n\tIn my capacity as chairman of the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs I have a responsibility and an opportunity to travel to a lot of countries around the world, and sometimes I see countries that have great wealth, great natural resources, have everything going for them except they do not have the institutions. They do not have the rule of law. That is what makes the United States different.\n\tWe should never just assume it is always there. It is something that has to be protected. It is something that has to be worked for every day. That is why I think this that you now have a responsibility as a former page to go back to your communities, to become active citizens in your communities, to help to participate in your community, to participate in the political process.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n\tYou will do it in different ways. Most of you will never run for any office; but you will get involved, perhaps in a school community, in the school board. You will do one of these different things; and someday, yes, one of you will be in Congress. Maybe one of you will be President of the United States. I can look out here and see many that I think might fill that role.\n\tThe important thing is that you stay involved in your community. The important thing is that you make a contribution to this great country so that your children and your grandchildren can someday sit on this floor and have the same experience. It does not just happen. It happens because Americans care enough to make it happen. You have cared enough to come here and to be a part of this, and we thank you for the job that you have done. We thank you for the commitment that you have made year long to this responsibility, to this work. And we thank you now as you go back to your communities.\n\tI wish you all the very best, and I hope I see the faces of many of you around here in the future. Thank you. Godspeed.\n\tMr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. I want to make sure I hand in the list of the departing pages, the class of 2003, over here. As you know, you will want to make sure you grab your official transcript of the day's proceedings and activities and you will be able to see your name in the Congressional Record, and that is why we do that.\n\tPerhaps one of you will become Speaker of the House, maybe you will be the President; but the really good job is to be the chairman of the Page Board, so that is what you ought to shoot for. Anybody can be President, not very many people can be chairman of the Page Board or a member of the Page Board; and that is what you should be shooting for.\n\tI am pleased today to recognize a true friend of the page program. You are in the 20th anniversary class, the reconstituted page program. This year, my colleague who is on the Page Board, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), is celebrating 20 years of service to this program. I have only been doing it 5 years, and look at all the gray hair I have; but he has been doing it 20 years.\n\tMr. Kildee has touched the lives of literally thousands of pages just like you throughout his 20 years. In his early days on the board, he oversaw the creation of the page school and the residence hall. Most recently, he was instrumental in the planning and construction phases of the brand new residence hall. And as I like to say, you all are living in tall cotton compared to the location the other pages resided in. They had to really weather some severe hardships. But the gentleman from Michigan was very instrumental in that planning, and I think you are all pleased with the residence hall. I know I am. And I know you are all grateful to him for that.\n\tUnder the leadership of the gentleman from Michigan, the program has grown and flourished to be an outstanding opportunity for bright young people. Today, the program encompasses aspects of academic work and a social life that has made it truly a comprehensive experience. We thank him for his tireless dedication to the Page Board and we congratulate him for 20 years of service.\n\tI am going to ask Mr. Kildee to come up, but what he does not know, and I will go over here now, is that we have a little surprise for him. We are going to present to him this plaque: ``The United States House of Representatives Page Program, Presented to the Honorable Dale Kildee, In Honor of 20 Years of Service to the Page Program, 1983 to 2003.'' \n\tMr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).\n\tMr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much. Mr. Speaker, this has been a great year. It has been a great 20 years. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, I have served now 20 years on the Page Board, having been appointed by Speaker Tip O'Neill. I would like to express my personal gratitude to all the pages who have served so diligently in this House during the 108th Congress. It is the 14th Congress that I have served in, and I love every day of it.\n\tWe Members of Congress, we all recognize the important role that you pages have in making this House really work, work efficiently, and work with some inspiration from you because we all get inspired by those who are younger than us, have those ideals and remind us of those ideals. I have had some meals with some of you, enjoyed that very much, and had a chance to talk to you on the floor. This has been a very, very good group.\n\tThis group of young people, you come from all across our Nation, and you represent what is so good in our country. You give us so much hope for our future. Indeed, I think all of us can say, those of us especially who are so close to the page program, that we are better people for having had contact with you because you give us such inspiration and so much hope.\n\tTo become a page you have proven yourself first of all to be academically qualified. It is not easy to become a page. You have ventured away from the security of your homes and families to spend time in, for most all of you, a very, very unfamiliar city. And through this experience as a page you have witnessed a new culture, made new friends; and some of you will, I will guarantee, I have been here 27 years in the Congress, 20 years on the Page Board, some of you, 27 and more years from now, will still be friends and you will be staying in contact. Because I know some of those pages I first met when I became a member of the Page Board still remain in contact.\n\tWe all know that this body has experienced so many things and you have witnessed history like no other group. There is a great group in this country called Close Up, which is a very good group; but no one, no one has seen the Congress as close up as you. No one. You have seen this body address the awesome question of war itself. You have become really part of history.\n\tYour job is not an easy one. First of all, you have to possess the maturity to balance the very competing demands for your time and your energy. I always say there are three different arenas down here: you have the floor and the buildings around the Capitol, where you have assignments; you have the school and the demands in the school; and you have the dorm. There are three different arenas. And let me tell you, you have done a very, very good job in every one of those arenas, and I am personally very, very proud of you.\n\tAnd you have to work long hours, really long hours, and interact with people at every level. We have some people who are humble in this body and some maybe not as humble, but you interact with all of them and you do it well. You face a challenge in the school itself. It is a very tough school. Former Congressman William Whitehurst, Republican, who went on the Page Board with me, he and I worked together to get that school accredited. And, Bill, if you are listening, thanks a lot. He lives in Virginia, and he was just a great Member; and we were determined to get the school accredited. And it is a tough school.\n\tYou are away, and you have to go back for your senior year to another school. That alone presents a challenge to you. But you will meet that challenge because you are special people. I am sure that you will consider the time spent here in Washington, D.C. to be one of the most valuable experiences of your life and that will lead you on to very successful and productive lives.\n\tMy two sons were pages in this body, and they went on to serve their country as captains in the Army. One is leaving, my youngest one, leaving for Pakistan very shortly. He has been in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan. But there are so many ways of serving one's country; and you have grown in your love for this country, you have grown in respect for this country, and you have seen the Congress at its best and sometimes at its worst. We are human beings, but this is the best system in the world.\n\tWe are going to miss all of you very, very much; and may God bestow his richest blessings upon you. Thank you very much.\n\tMr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan for all the work he has done, and I also want to recognize and thank some other folks for their long-time service and who are very special to the program, and you know many of them. Donn Anderson, former Clerk of the House and former page himself, serves on the Page Board as a member emeritus. Of course, he has a 20-year record. Donn, thank you. Barbara Bowen, who has ushered countless students through the confusing worlds of algebra and pre-calculus as the House page math teacher. And Ron Weitzel has instructed bright-eyed pages in the rich and complex history of America as the House page school history teacher. Thank you, Donn, Barbara, and Ron for your dedication and commitment to the page program.\n\tMr. Speaker, I yield to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from the great State of California (Mr. Lewis), to say a few words. Mr. Chairman.\n\tMr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.\n\tLadies and gentlemen, this is a totally unexpected circumstance, for it has not been my privilege to serve on the Page Board. My name is Jerry Lewis, from California. I have the privilege of chairing the subcommittee that deals with national defense. Our Secretary of Defense and General Meyers are briefing the Members, as you may know, over in the Rayburn Building; and we have had those discussions many a time. But I came here to the floor for other reasons and found this going on and thought it might be an opportunity to express my appreciation and say a few words to this class as you are leaving, for a time at any rate, the Nation's capital.\n\tI wanted to share a couple of thoughts with you. When I was young, not really thinking about public affairs, I grew up in a household where my mother was a Democrat and my father was a Republican. So I grew up pretty confused, and over those early years spent a lot of time trying to figure out what are the Democrats all about and what are the Republicans all about, and is there really a lot of difference between these huge gray donkeys and elephants.\n\tI came to Washington for the first time in 1955 as a student at UCLA, along with 11 other students, on our way to India in a program that existed before the Peace Corps, called Project India. Our job was to travel to Southeast Asia, go from community to community in India and try to communicate with our friends, Indian college students. On the way, we stopped in the Nation's capital. I had not been far out of San Bernardino before that. We spent a couple of days talking to USIA and the State Department people, and then we took a half day off to look at the monuments of this wonderful place. That is the story I kind of want to begin to share with you.\n\tOn that trip together we walked up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial for the first time, saw that wonderful statue seated in that temple. It is a magnificent first experience, chills up your spine. We had an appointment shortly thereafter on the edge of the Potomac, and in those days you could take a chain of boats and ride in a chain of boats along the Potomac and look at the Capitol and monuments from a different perspective.\n\tWe found ourselves waiting for a half hour, 45 minutes, and finally an hour went by only to learn that the reason for our wait was because two of our students were being told they would have to ride in a boat to be attached to the back because they happened to be black. The summer of 1955, 12 young idealistic kids from UCLA going to India to talk about freedom and hope and opportunity, and that scene at the Lincoln Memorial, and then that experience on the Potomac is something you just cannot wipe out of your memory.\n\tBut the point was not at all that our country had not made significant progress between the days of Lincoln and that summer of 1955. Clearly we had made much progress in our country. Clearly, also, we have made a lot of progress since then and today. But the real point is, as I visit Lincoln, the real point is that this is our government, your government. If we are not happy with pieces of it, clearly we have a responsibility to try to impact it, to push it, to shove it down a pathway that makes a lot more sense from our perspective.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n\tMr. Speaker, I went to India that summer thinking that maybe I might actually go into politics some time. I thought then I would probably run for office as a Democrat. I came back from India convinced, as I went through the summer trying to figure out the differences between the two great parties, that for me, Jerry Lewis, I probably absolutely would run for public office one day, but if I did so, I had made the decision that the place where I could have the biggest impact was on the Republican side of the aisle instead.\n\tI draw the painting regarding the Potomac for one reason, and the quest for the difference between one or the other, I would love to hear from some of you in the months and years ahead, hear from you about what you decide to do in terms of your pathway in life, and what you decided to do if you involved yourself in partisan politics. Because it is people like you who make the two great parties great. But, more importantly, you can continue to make sure that our country is by far the best and the most important force for freedom in the world.\n\tThank you for what you have done, and it is a pleasure to have been with you.\n\tMr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, obviously, the chairman for sharing some time with us. I have a few last things to mention that are more serious, and then we will have a few lighthearted comments.\n\tI would challenge you to find out what motivates yourself. What you have learned as a page going through this program is what is going to serve you well. You have learned a good work ethnic and how to work hard. That is going to be important throughout the rest of your life. You have learned the importance of a good education. That will tide you over as you continue to pursue that.\n\tYou have learned how to respect one another. I think what our world needs more of is people learning how to respect one another, and I think the program does a great job in doing that.\n\tAlso, do not give up. Whatever happens, do not give up. At West Point, my alma mater, we say much of the history we teach was made by the individuals we taught; and I think that is true, what can be said of the page program and the page school, because much of the history that we know now today has been made by former pages.\n\tYou have in essence now a great tradition to follow, and I want to encourage you to make us proud. And you already have made us proud. You all in this group have completed more than 1,400 hours of community service. We need to tell that story. You know it, but this helps us get the message out. That breaks down to an average of 21 hours per page.\n\tSome examples of the things that you have done are Horton's Kids Tutoring Program. That was covered in one of the local papers. The Multiple Sclerosis Walk, Calvary Women's Shelter, Martha's Table, Ronald McDonald House and work at the Congressional Cemetery.\n\tAs a class, you have also proven to have the most terrible luck with weather. From the misty Sunday morning you moved in until the misty night of your prom, you have slogged through countless seminars and residence hall trips in the rain. In fact, the sun just came up today after many, many days of overcast skies. You did not even get a reprieve on the day that you were led through the Shenandoahs in the rain. You braved the elements recently on a trip to Six Flags and when you rode the roller coasters despite the rain.\n\tYou have proven that rain cannot dampen your enthusiasm and good humor, and it looks like you may be in luck: No rain forecasted for tomorrow's departure ceremony, but, given your track record, I would not count on it. I am going to echo Mrs. Miranda's advice, bring rain gear.\n\tAlso, we have discovered that the future President of the United States, Bryce Chitwood, who was in charge of the page auction which raised a record-breaking amount of money for the page prom, $9,000, it looks like his fund-raising skills are well organized for future goals and aspirations.\n\tOur future Major League baseball player, Ben Hanna, who, it has been said, has great baseball player's hair. I have no idea what that means. All I know is what I am reading here.\n\tOne future NASCAR driver, Katie Murray, just has to learn to keep all four wheels on the track.\n\tWe have one future tycoon, John Malcovitch, who was born to wear a tuxedo and will be in the same league as Bill Gates, who was also a page. And I have also been told that at least three of our pages are going directly to college, skipping their senior year, and congratulations, I think. They are Sam Rykaczewski, Lauren Conn, and Michael Tanner. This is just one example of all the great successes.\n\tBut also as exciting is Democratic pages last week participated in the annual ``How many pages can you fit into a cloakroom phone booth?'' That is not a tradition on the other side, and I hesitate to mention it because it might become one. The answer is 11, and congratulations. I do not know if that is a record or not. I will have to talk to your folks and see where the record might be. I cannot imagine getting 11 in one of those phone booths.\n\tYou also have discovered the nook between the page desk and the storage cabinet. You all call it the reading corner. Mrs. Ivester calls it the sleeping corner, and Democratic pages rush to work each day in hopes that they will find the secret candy drawer filled. When the drawer is empty, they can always count on the Democratic cloakroom managers feeding them bags of Georgia peanuts throughout the day. Democratic pages often say they work for peanuts.\n\tI know that Helen and Pat back in the Republican cloakroom want to make sure that we have a special thanks for Matt Buckham for all his work carrying groceries for them.\n\tWe have talked through the aspect of this point in time in history and you all being involved in that. I think Members have been able to relay our thanks to you for your commitment to the institution. As chairman of the page board, I can speak for my colleague from Michigan and the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Mrs. Wilson) to say we thank you for upholding the honor and the integrity of the program. It makes it a lot easier for us.\n\tNot only that, but the good work that you have done in volunteering, I think you have set a new standard for future page classes. We are definitely going to miss you, but life goes on. You have great challenges ahead. Always remember this important time in your life will not only be in your memory, but it will be in ours. We look forward to seeing you when you come back to visit.\n\tGod bless you all, and may God bless the United States of America.\n\n                       Departing Pages, 2002-2003\n\n       Yvonne Aguilar, Claire Anderson, Candice Armstrong, Harry \n     Bond, Trisha Belle, Robert Brown, Matthew Buckham, Donald \n     Burke, Samuel Burke, Simona Burke, Thomas Carroll, Chris \n     Cantrell, Stephanie Chesnov, Bryce Chitwood, Daniel Clayson, \n     Kevin Clout, Lauren Conn, Christopher Denton, Ben Fendler, \n     Susan Forrester, Doug Gill, David Gorgani, Laura Greenwood, \n     Emily Hagan, Benjamin Hannan, Margaret Hartley, Jane Heaton, \n     Alicia Hines, Margaret Hobbs, Chris Kataros, James Kotecki, \n     Jeffrey Lakin, Erica Lally, Julie Leonard, Rong Li, Alejandra \n     Lopez, John Malcovich, Tania Martinez, Emily McCarthy, Emily \n     MacMillan-Ladd, Jennifer McDervitt, Laura Meixel, Greta \n     Meyers, Michael Mullee, Kiera Murphy, Kaitlin Murray, \n     Kristine Nagle, Amber Nixon, Lauren Noyes, Garrett Payne, \n     Lisandro Rivera, Alex Rochester, Rene Rosales, Sam \n     Rykazewski, Matthew Schmitz, Allie Smoot, Neva St. Morris, \n     Sarah Stafford, Elizabeth Sterling, Annabell Talamoa, Michael \n     Tanner, Michael Tedori, Emily Toner, Emily White, Rebecca \n     Williams, Leandra Wilson.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["John Shimkus", "Jim Kolbe", "Dale E.

As a grandfather whose grandchildren have benefited from Elaine's professionalism, I can say that her retirement will be a loss to the school and the families she has guided during her career.\n\tMr. Speaker, congratulations to Elaine Patterson on a distinguished career educating South Florida's youth, and on behalf of the Shaw family, I thank Elaine for her service.

SHINSEKI\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Lewis) is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have before me an outline of \ninformation regarding General Eric Shinseki, Chief of the United States \nArmy, who is on the verge of his retirement. The material before me \ninvolves much more than the 5 minutes that is available to us at this \nmoment, but the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) and I want to \nmake sure that all of this is in the Record.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a genuine American hero, \nour retiring Chief of Staff of the United States Army, Eric K. \nShinseki. After leading the Army during successful campaigns against \nterrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq and putting the Army on an \nirreversible track towards transformation, General Shinseki is stepping \ndown as Chief of Staff of the Army next week.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is many a thing that I would say, but most of us \nin the House have come to know and be spellbound by the story of \nGeneral Shinseki's life. Indeed, Hollywood could not have written a \nbetter story that would reflect an Horatio Alger kind of hero during \nour very age.\n  Mr. Speaker, when I first met General Shinseki, I was a newly elected \nchairman of the Subcommittee on National Security of the Committee on \nAppropriations. Shortly after assuming that responsibility, I was asked \nto go to the swearing-in of the new Army Chief, meeting a general whom \nI had really not known at all for the first time, the beginning of a \nvery deep and growing friendship.\n  Eric Shinseki, upon being sworn in, was introduced; and in that \nintroduction I learned for the first time when he was born, Rick \nShinseki was born a foreign alien, for he was of Japanese dissent, born \nin Hawaii, and World War II was raging. So a foreign alien. Think of \nthat and think of the reflection and what that says about our country \nthat some years later that same individual rises to be the Chief of the \nUnited\n\n[[Page H5038]]\n\nStates Army. It is a fantastic reflection of this country's strength \nand what it means in terms of service and opportunity for those who \nwill but serve.\n  Another piece of that introduction and the Chief's speech says an \nawful lot about this guy Rick Shinseki. I will never forget his words. \nTurning to the audience, he said, I want all of you who are here \npresent to know I would not be here today if it were not for the \nShinseki women, and he pointed out some two dozen of those women who \nwere in the audience, his grandmother, his mother, wife, daughters, et \ncetera. With that, he went on to outline his vision for the future of \nthe Army relatively near term, and for the first time I heard in a \nmeaningful way an outline by a military leader that involved the term \ntransformation. He was about transforming the American Army and making \nsure we found ourselves on a pathway that would allow the Army to lead \nthis free country as the only remaining superpower for the decades \nahead.\n  As he discussed the fact that the Army needed to be lighter and \nquicker and stronger, I heard a fellow just behind me who also had \nstars on his shoulders, I heard him gasp, what does this guy think the \nMarine Corps is for, although the terms he used in expressing that \nsentiment were a little stronger than I have used here. But, \nnonetheless, a clear illustration that there continues to be \ncompetition between our branches, which is good, but there also \ncontinues to be a great need for transformation throughout the \nDepartment of Defense. And the first guy out on the point regarding \nthat transformation is this great Chief who is now retiring, Eric \nShinseki.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha) and I have had a chance \nto work very closely with the Chief. We have had a chance to play a \nrole in developing ideas of his such as the future combat system, to \ntalk out loud about what that future battlefield might look like and to \ntalk about the fact that we are responsible for by far the largest \nbudget in the Congress, those moneys that flow on behalf of our \nnational defense and allowing America to be the voice for freedom. \nIndeed, in those conversations time and time again, the General and I \ncome back to this thought:\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  That is the thought that the reason we spend these moneys is not \nbecause we are about to wage war but because America is the force for \npeace and we appropriate these dollars and work with the Army and the \nrest of our forces on behalf of peace in the world. So as General Eric \nK. Shinseki goes on to a new part of his life, we thank him for his \ngreat and wonderful service, and we all are in his debt.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a genuine American hero--\nour retiring Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General Eric K. \nShinseki. After leading the Army during successful campaigns against \nterrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq and putting the Army on an \nirreversible track towards transformation, General Shinseki is stepping \ndown as chief of staff next week.\n  Many of us in the Congress have come to know, and be spellbound by, \nthe story of General Shinseki's life. Indeed, Hollywood couldn't have \nwritten a better Horatio Alger story. General Shinseki, as we've all \ncome to know, was born during World War II to Japanese-American parents \nat a time when the fears of war created a regrettable episode in our \nhistory--the internment of American citizens and loyal immigrants. \nBetween then and now, much has changed in the world and in this \ncountry. General Shinseki has been a positive force for some of that \nchange, even as his incredible professional accomplishments are a \nsymbol of that change.\n  Indeed, I remember so well the first time I heard the Shinseki story. \nIt was during the introduction at his swearing-in ceremony as the \nArmy's Chief of Staff. That story moved me, but I was also struck by \nGeneral Shinseki's own remarks that followed. He spoke eloquently and \nforcefully on a broad range of topics--it was during these remarks that \nI first heard the term ``transformation.'' General Shinseki shared with \nus his powerful vision for change and I was intrigued at how clear his \ntransformational ideas were, and how resolute and determined he seemed \nin bringing this about. I also remember what he said about his family--\njust how important they were to him. He singled out, as he called them, \nthe dozen or so ``Shinseki women,'' in the audience--his grandmother, \nmother, sisters, wife, and daughters--saying he wouldn't be where he \nwas today without them. His sincere humility and gratitude on this his \nbig day, was inspiring. It was a moving set of remarks on a propitious \nand portentous day, an event that remains fresh in my memory even now.\n  With the guiding hand of loving parents, Ric Shinseki matured into an \nextraordinary young American with rock-solid values and with a calling \nto serve--``Duty, Honor, Country.'' This West Point graduate is a \ndecorated combat veteran and an accomplished peacemaker. He is a fierce \nwarrior-leader with a Master's degree in Literature--a true Renaissance \nman. His story is an inspiration for us all. He has lived the \n``American Dream'' rising to become the 34th Army Chief of Staff.\n  As a young junior officer, Ric Shinseki served valiantly and \nselflessly in Vietnam, where he was wounded twice--once so severely his \ntroops were convinced he would not survive. His valor and courage under \nfire won him three Bronze Star Medals for valor and two Purple Hearts.\n\n  A ``soldier's soldier'' who has commanded at every level, General \nShinseki is also a reflective and intellectually gifted leader. In \naddition to West Point, General Shinseki has attended the National War \nCollege and Duke University. Those of us in the Congress involved \nextensively with defense issues have come to know him as an insightful \nthinker and inspirational speaker and writer. He is someone we all \ntrust and respect.\n  Nearing the pinnacle of his Army career, General Shinseki spent 15 \nmonths as the commander of the NATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia in \n1997. He led this force with remarkable skill, helping that land begin \nto heal the wounds of years of war. His abilities as a warrior-diplomat \nsubsequently helped the Army prepare for and execute its peacekeeping \nresponsibilities in Kosovo.\n  General Eric Shinseki became Army Chief of Staff in June 1999--just \nsix months after I took the job as chairman of the House Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. Over the past four years, we have spent a \nlot of the time together, professionally and socially, and I have \nalways come away from those meetings inspired and thoughtful about the \ngeneral's visionary ideas.\n  In many ways his early performance in Vietnam revealed the true \nmeasure and character of this man. This is a tough man who sticks to \nwhat he believes is right, even when it is unpopular, controversial, \nand sometimes even when it is against his own interests. True courage. \nAnd we have seen more of this during his tour as Army Chief of Staff.\n  After only a few months into his tenure as Army Chief, General \nShinseki unveiled his comprehensive plan for transformation, the vision \nfor which, as I mentioned earlier, he introduced at his swearing-in \nceremony. This town is indebted to him for bringing our collective \nattention to this important mandate. Transformation is now a very \npopular phrase in defense circles, with many proclaimed authors, but \nin this Body in these chambers, we know where this all started and \ngained traction--with the humble and understated Ric Shinseki.\n\n  Think about how difficult it was for this career Armor officer, a \nTanker himself, to lead the Army in a direction away from 70-ton tanks \ntowards a lighter, more strategically responsive force. Indeed, General \nShinseki faced considerable skepticism within the naturally \nconservative institution that is the U.S. Army. An Army, after all, \nthat had been tremendously successful over the past decade during major \ncombat operations in Panama, the Persian Gulf, and in several other \nlesser contingencies and peacekeeping operations around the globe. Yet, \nGeneral Shinseki knew that more than incremental changes were needed to \nget the Army ready for future requirements--it wasn't enough to look \nbackwards as validation of work well done.\n  After 9-11, and after devastating attacks only yards away from his \noffice, General Shinseki quickly moved the Army onto a ``wartime \nfooting.'' Like all Americans, I watched with pride and wonderment as \nour armed forces quickly accomplished their objectives time and again \nin Afghanistan and most recently now in Iraq. This is the legacy that \nGeneral Shinseki leaves behind--a fabulously well trained and \ndisciplined force that is helping win the Global War on Terror, while \nat the same time it is transforming itself to meet the threats of the \n21st Century.\n  Throughout our time together, I have greatly valued this man's \nopinion and judgment that is always carefully arrived at and based upon \nover three and a half decades of experience and committed service to \nthe nation. We haven't always agreed, in fact, we've had some major \ndifferences over the years, but there is not one in this town I respect \nmore than our outgoing Army Chief of Staff. We will miss him sorely. \nAnd we will miss his lovely wife Patty, too. She has steadfastly and \nselflessly stood by her husband and the Army for over 38 years and \ntoday on behalf of my colleagues of the United States Congress, we say \n``thank you'' for a job well done, and may\n\n[[Page H5039]]\n\nGod bless you with health and happiness in all future endeavors. \nAlthough we now end our time together as Chairman and Chief, we will \nalways remain friends.\n  Mr. Speaker, I greatly appreciate this very special opportunity to \nhonor my friend, General Eric Shinseki--a model citizen and soldier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "TRIBUTE TO GENERAL ERIC K.

Mr. Speaker, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico like \nthe majority of States is confronting a number of challenges as it \nstrives to provide quality health care to its 4 million citizens. Our \nlocal government is committed to strengthening the health care system. \nIn fact, the Commonwealth finances approximately 85 percent of the \ncosts of Medicaid in Puerto Rico, a burden no other jurisdiction has \nand one that is becoming unbearable. For us to move forward, it is \nessential that the Federal Government be an active and strong partner \nin this endeavor. As Congress considers creating a prescription drug \nbenefit as well as enacting fundamental Medicare reform, I urge my \ncolleagues to ensure that any Medicare legislation approved by Congress \naddresses the needs of the U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico.\n  Since its inception, Medicare has provided health care for seniors \nliving in Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, we must not exclude now our 525,000 \nseniors from any new basic health care coverage. Therefore, it is \nessential that beneficiaries living in the island have access to the \nsame level of prescription drug coverage under the same terms and \nconditions as is offered to all others throughout the country. In \naddition, any Medicare prescription drug program must provide \nappropriate subsidies for low-income beneficiaries in Puerto Rico as in \nother all jurisdictions.\n  Puerto Rico's workers and employers pay their full share of Social \nSecurity and Medicare payroll taxes to the Federal Government. \nBeneficiaries who live in the island are as much a part of Medicare as \nthose living in Florida, California, or Nebraska. Limitations on the \nbenefits of subsidies that have no foundation in health care policy but \nbased on geographic location would undermine the social insurance \nnature of this vital programs and would fail the fundamental goal of \nproviding uniform Medicare benefits to all.\n  The second issue that I expect Congress to address in the Medicare \nreform bill is the payment to hospitals in Puerto Rico. While all U.S. \nhospitals receive 100 percent Federal reimbursement, hospitals in \nPuerto Rico only receive 50 percent through a special formula. No other \njurisdiction receives this type of treatment under the Medicare system. \nAs a result of this disparity, our hospitals operate under extreme \nfinancial constraints and some have even decided to withdraw from the \nprogram.\n  Again, U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico pay the same Federal payroll \ntaxes as any other jurisdiction. They deserve equity. Therefore, \nMedicare reimbursement to Puerto Rico hospitals should be equitable \nwith all other U.S. jurisdictions' hospitals.\n  Finally, I urge Congress to enact legislation to correct the great \ndisparity that currently assists in Medicare payments to physicians in \nPuerto Rico. This is the same disparity that rural physicians across \nthe country experience today. In fact, our physicians currently have \nthe lowest geographic cost-of-practice index value in the entire United \nStates despite the fact that the city of San Juan has the eighth \nhighest cost of living in the United States. As a result, not only are \nour rural areas suffering; physicians in metropolitan areas such as San \nJuan are carrying a great burden when they treat Medicare patients.\n  Mr. Speaker, doctors in Puerto Rico provide the same time and skill \nto patients, and they must be paid appropriately for their great, noble \nwork.\n  I would like to finish by thanking my colleagues in the House and \nSenate who have continuously supported us on resolving these critical \nissues to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries in Puerto Rico are \nafforded quality health care.

As a result, not only are our rural areas suffering; physicians in metropolitan areas such as San Juan are carrying a great burden when they treat Medicare patients.\n\tMr. Speaker, doctors in Puerto Rico provide the same time and skill to patients, and they must be paid appropriately for their great, noble work.\n\tI would like to finish by thanking my colleagues in the House and Senate who have continuously supported us on resolving these critical issues to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries in Puerto Rico are afforded quality health care. They all realize that fairness is essential to quality health care, and that is as true in Puerto Rico as it is elsewhere in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Anibal Acevedo-Vila"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Under a previous order of the House, the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Gutknecht) is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise again to speak to the House today \nabout the cost of prescription drugs here in the United States, \nparticularly relative to the rest of the world. Mark Twain once was \ntalking about facts, and he said you can ignore the facts, you can deny \nthe facts, you can even distort the facts, but in the end there they \nare.\n  I would like to talk today about the facts because there are people \nin this town who are attempting to both deny and distort the facts, but \nI think the facts more and more are indisputable. For example, we have \nbeen doing much of our own research. We purchased a number of the top-\nselling drugs in Munich, Germany, about a month ago. For example, we \nbought this package of Glucophage. Glucophage is a marvelous drug, \nparticularly for those suffering from diabetes. We bought this drug in \nMunich, Germany, at a pharmacy for $5. This same package of Glucophage \nsells here in the United States for $29.95. We bought another drug, a \nvery commonly prescribed drug that is a blood thinner. In fact, my \nfather takes this drug. It's called Coumadin. Coumadin here in the \nUnited States, this package of Coumadin sells for roughly $84. We \nbought this drug in Germany for $21. But I think the one that bothers \nme the most, and I have talked about this before and I still do not \nhave a good answer and frankly some of the people in the FDA ought to \nhelp us get the answer, this is a drug called Tamoxifen, perhaps the \nreal miracle drug as it relates to treating women's breast cancer. \nTamoxifen. We bought this drug in Munich, Germany, for $59.05 American. \nIt sells here in the United States, the same box, same milligrams, it \nsells for $360; $60 in Germany, $360 here.\n  The question we have to ask is why? Why the big disparities? And some \npeople say it is price controls, but that is not exactly true in \nGermany. The Germans do not have what some people say they do in terms \nof price controls. What they do allow is for their pharmacists to be \nable to shop around to get the best price. Unfortunately, Americans are \nheld hostage. If one goes to Tokyo, Japan, and buys a steak, that steak \nwill cost over $100. One can buy that same steak here in Washington \neven at inflated Washington, D.C. prices, for probably $25. Back in my \nhome district one can buy the best steak in town in many of the towns I \nrepresent for $10 or $15. But the difference is the Japanese are held \ncaptive. They do not allow American beef into their markets; so those \ncaptive Japanese are forced to pay those higher prices.\n  What we are saying in the legislation which I hope to introduce next \nweek is let our people go. Allow the markets to work, open up markets. \nAnd that is why I have sponsored the Pharmaceutical Market Access bill. \nFacts are stubborn things, as John Adams said. I would invite Members \nand those who may be watching to get a copy of this book: The title is \n``The Big Fix, How the Pharmaceutical Industry Rips American Consumers \nOff.'' It is by Katharine Greider. I do not know that much about \nKatharine Greider, but she has got some very interesting things to say \nabout what has been happening in the pharmaceutical industry.\n  Finally, let me say the big argument is safety, safety, safety, we \ncannot guarantee that if people buy their drugs from Munich, Germany, \nor Geneva, Switzerland, that those drugs will be safe. But I would \ninvite the Members to look at some of the counterfeit-proof technology \nthat is available today. There are companies that make this technology \nso that we can guarantee that this is in fact Coumadin and not \nsomething else. We can do this safely. Americans deserve world-class \ndrugs at world market prices. Americans are willing to subsidize sub-\nSaharan Africa. We are unwilling to continue to subsidize the starving \nSwiss. I hope Members will get the facts. I hope Members will look at \nthis bill. I hope\n\n[[Page H5040]]\n\nMembers will cosponsor it with me.

Mr. President, I first thank the majority whip, Senator \nMcConnell, and the Democrat whip, Senator Reid, for their very kind \ncomments this morning. Then I thank you, Mr. President, and other \nmembers of the leadership, for your unwavering support of this freshman \nclass.\n  I also recognize Senator Frist for the traditional courtesies of a \nmaiden speech to be extended to the new Senator and express my \nappreciation for his commitment to the rich history of this great \ntradition.\n  Tradition is held that, by waiting a respectful length of time, \nsenior colleagues would appreciate the humility shown by a new Member \nof the Senate who would use the occasion to address an issue of \nconcern.\n  I come in that sense today to share my thoughts on a matter that \nweighs heavily on my mind. Hunger is the silent enemy lurking within \ntoo many American homes. It is a tragedy I have seen firsthand and far \ntoo many times throughout my life in public service. This is not a new \nissue.\n  In 1969, while I was serving as Deputy Assistant to the President for \nConsumer Affairs, I was privileged to assist in planning the White \nHouse Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health. In opening the \nconference, President Nixon said:\n\n       Malnutrition is a national concern because we are a nation \n     that cares about its people, how they feel, how they live. We \n     care whether they are well and whether they are happy.\n\n  This still rings true today.\n  On National Hunger Awareness Day, I want to highlight what has become \na serious problem for too many families, particularly in North \nCarolina.\n  My home State is going through a painful economic transition. Once \nthriving textile mills have been shuttered. Family farms are going out \nof business. Tens of thousands of workers have been laid off from their \njobs. Entire areas of textile and furniture manufacturing are slowly \nphasing out as high-tech manufacturing and service companies become the \ndominant industry of the State. Many of these traditional manufacturing \njobs have been in rural areas where there are fewer jobs and residents \nwho are already struggling to make ends meet.\n  In 1999, North Carolina had the 12th lowest unemployment rate in the \nUnited States. By December 2001, the State had fallen to 46--from 12 to \n46. That same year, according to the Rural Center, North Carolina \ncompanies announced 63,222 layoffs. Our State lost more manufacturing \njobs between 1997 and the year 2000 than any State except New York.\n  Entire communities have been uprooted by this crisis. In the town of \nSpruce Pine in Mitchell County, 30 percent--30 percent--of the town's \nresidents lost their jobs in the year 2001. Ninety percent of those \nlayoffs were in textile and furniture manufacturing. These are real \nnumbers and real lives from a State that is hurting.\n  Our families are struggling to find jobs, to pay their bills, and, as \nwe hear more and more often, to even put food on the table. In fact, \nthe unemployment trend that started in 1999 resulted in 11.1 percent of \nNorth Carolina families not always having enough food to meet their \nbasic needs. That is according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \nAnd North Carolina's rate is higher than the national average. This \nmeans that among North Carolina's 8.2 million residents, nearly 900,000 \nare dealing with hunger. Some are hungry, others are on the verge.\n  My office was blessed recently to meet a young veteran, Michael \nWilliams, and his family. Michael served his country for 8 years in the \nU.S. Army before leaving to work in private industry and use the \ncomputer skills he had gained while serving in the military. He was \nearning a good living, but after September 11 and the terrorist \nattacks, he and his wife Gloria felt it was time to move their two \nchildren closer to family back home in North Carolina. As he said, ``It \nwas time to bring the grandbabies home.''\n  But Michael has found a shortage of jobs since his return. He worked \nwith a temp agency but that job ended. It has been so hard to make ends \nmeet that the family goes to a food bank near their Clayton, NC, home \ntwice a month because with rent, utilities, and other bills, there is \nlittle left to buy food.\n  Their story is not unlike so many others. Hard-working families are \nworrying each day about how to feed their children. As if this were not \nenough, our food banks are having a hard time finding food to feed \nthese families. In some instances, financial donations have dropped off \nor corporations have scaled back on food donations. In other cases, \nthere are just too many people and not enough food.\n  At the Food Bank of the Albemarle in northeast North Carolina, \nexecutive director Gus Smith says more people are visiting this food \nbank even as donations are off by 25 percent. Thus Gus says, ``We just \ncan't help everybody at this point in time.'' To try to cope, they \nrecently moved to a 4-day workweek, meaning the entire staff had to \ntake a 20-percent pay cut just to keep the doors open.\n  America's Second Harvest, a network of 216 food banks across the \ncountry, reports it saw the number of people seeking emergency hunger \nrelief rise by 9 percent in the year 2001 to 23.3 million people. In \nany given week, it is estimated that 7 million people are served at \nemergency feeding sites around the country.\n  These numbers are troubling indeed. No family--in North Carolina or \nanywhere in America--should have to worry about where they will find \nfood to eat. No parent should have to tell their child there is no \nmoney left for groceries. This is simply unacceptable.\n  I spent most of the congressional Easter recess going to different \nsites in North Carolina: homeless and hunger shelters, food \ndistribution sites, soup kitchens, farms, even an office where I went \nthrough the process of applying for Government assistance through the \nWIC Program, the Women, Infants, and Children Program.\n  I was also able to meet, on several occasions, with a group known as \nthe Society of Saint Andrew. This organization, like some others across \nthe country, is doing impressive work in the area of gleaning. That is \nwhen excess crops, that would otherwise be thrown out, are taken from \nfarms, packing houses, and warehouses, and distributed to the needy.\n\n  Gleaning immediately brings to my mind the Book of Ruth in the Old \nTestament. She gleaned in the fields so that her family could eat. You \nsee, Mr. President, in Biblical times farmers were encouraged to leave \ncrops in their fields for the poor and the travelers. Even as far back \nas in Leviticus, Chapter 19, in the Old Testament, we read the words:\n\n       And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou \n     gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shall leave them for \n     the poor and the stranger.\n\n  So gleaning was long a custom in Biblical days, a command by God to \nhelp those in need. It is a practice we should utilize much more \nextensively today. It is astounding that the most recent figures \navailable indicate that approximately 96 billion pounds of good, \nnutritious food, including that at the farm and retail levels, is left \nover or thrown away in this country.\n  It is estimated that only 6 percent of crops are actually gleaned in \nNorth Carolina. A tomato farmer in North Carolina sends 20,000 pounds \nof tomatoes to landfills each day during harvest season.\n\n[[Page S7419]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to present an example of \nproduce on the Senate floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. DOLE. Sometimes the produce cannot be sold. Sometimes it is \nunderweight or not a perfect shape, like this sweet potato I show you \nin my hand. This would be rejected because it is not the exact \nspecification. Other times it is simply surplus food, more than the \ngrocery stores can handle, but it is still perfectly good to eat.\n  Imagine the expense to that farmer in dumping 20,000 pounds of \ntomatoes each day during his harvest season. And this cannot be good \nfor the environment. In fact, food is the single largest component of \nour solid waste stream--more than yard trimmings or even newspapers. \nSome of it does decompose, but it often takes several years. Other food \njust sits in landfills, literally mummified. Putting this food to good \nuse, through gleaning, will reduce the amount of waste going to our \nalready overburdened landfills.\n  I am so appreciative of my friends at the Environmental Defense Fund \nfor working closely with me on this issue. Gleaning also helps the \nfarmer because he does not have to haul off and plow under crops that \ndo not meet exact specifications of grocery chains, and it certainly \nhelps the hungry, by giving them not just any food but food that is \nboth nutritious and fresh.\n  The Society of Saint Andrew is the only comprehensive program in \nNorth Carolina that gleans available produce and then sorts, packages, \nprocesses, transports, and delivers excess food to feed the hungry.\n  In the year 2001, the organization gleaned 9.7 million pounds--almost \n10 million pounds--or 29.1 million servings of food. It only costs a \npenny--1 penny--a serving to glean and deliver this food to those in \nneed. Even more amazing, the Society of Saint Andrew does all this with \na tiny staff and an amazing 9,200 volunteers.\n\n  These are the types of innovative ideas we should be exploring. I \nhave been told by the Society of Saint Andrew that $100,000 would \nprovide at least 10 million servings of food for hungry North \nCarolinians.\n  I set out to raise that money for the Society in the last few weeks, \nand thanks to the compassion of a number of caring individuals, \ncompanies, and organizations, we were able to surpass our goal and \nraise $180,000--enough for over 18 million servings of food. More than \never, I believe this is a worthy effort that can be used as a model \nnationwide.\n  I am passionate about leading an effort to increase gleaning in North \nCarolina and across America. The gleaning system works because of the \ncooperative efforts of so many groups, from the Society of Saint Andrew \nand its volunteers who gather and deliver the food, to the dozens of \nchurches and humanitarian organizations that help distribute this food \nto the hungry. Indeed, gleaning is, at its best, a public-private \npartnership.\n  Private organizations are doing a great job with limited resources. \nBut we must make some changes on the public side to help them leverage \ntheir scarce dollars to feed the hungry. I have heard repeatedly that \nthe single biggest concern for gleaners is transportation. The food is \nthere. The issue is how to transport it in larger volume.\n  I want to change the Tax Code to give transportation companies that \nvolunteer trucks for gleaned food a tax incentive. And there are other \nneeded tax changes. Currently, only large publicly traded corporations \ncan take tax credits for giving food to these gleaning programs. But it \nis not just large corporations that provide this food; it is the family \nfarmers and the small businesses. Why should a farmer who gives up his \nperfectly good produce or the small restaurant owner who gives food to \nthe hungry not receive the same tax benefits? The Senate has already \npassed legislation as part of the CARE Act that would fix this \ninequity. Now the House of Representatives needs to complete work on \nthis bill.\n  However, but the answer to the hunger problem does not stop with \ngleaning. That is just part of the overall effort. There are other ways \nwe can help, too.\n  This year, we will be renewing the National School Lunch Program and \nother important child nutrition programs, and there are some areas I am \ninterested in reviewing.\n  Under School Lunch, children from families with incomes at or below \n130 percent of poverty are eligible for free meals. Children from \nfamilies with incomes between 130 percent and 185 percent of poverty \ncan be charged no more than 40 cents. This may seem to be a nominal \namount, but for a struggling family with several children the costs add \nup. School administrators in North Carolina tell me that they hear from \nparents in tears because they don't know how to pay for their child's \nschool meals.\n  The Federal Government now considers incomes up to 185 percent of \npoverty when deciding if a family is eligible for benefits under the \nWIC program. Should we not use the same standard for School Lunch? \nStandardizing the guidelines would even allow us to immediately certify \nchildren from WIC families for the School Lunch Program. It is time to \nclarify this bureaucratic situation and harmonize our Federal income \nassistance guidelines so we can help those most in need.\n  The School Lunch Program is the final component of our commitment to \nchild nutrition, and we must do everything to maintain and strengthen \nits integrity so that it works for those who need it and isn't viewed \nas a Government giveaway.\n  There are a lot of interesting ideas being discussed such as \nadjusting area eligibility guidelines in the Summer Food Program. But \nthese need to be looked at carefully, and we need to ask important \nquestions such as how many people would be affected and what is the \ncost. I have discussed many of these ideas with groups such as \nAmerica's Second Harvest, Bread for the World, the Food Research and \nAction Center, and the American School Food Service Association. I look \nforward to the opportunity of exploring them further during \nreauthorization of these important programs in the Agriculture \nCommittee, on which I am honored to serve.\n  Our work cannot stop within our own borders. The Food and Agriculture \nOrganization of the United Nations says hunger affects millions \nworldwide. During my 8 years as president of the American Red Cross, I \nvisited Somalia during the heart-wrenching famine. In Mojada, I came \nacross a little boy under a sack. I thought he was dead. His brother \npulled back that sack and sat him up and he was severely malnourished. \nHe couldn't eat the rice and beans in the bowl beside him; he was too \nmalnourished. I asked for camel's milk to feed him.\n  As I put my arm around his back and lifted that cup to his mouth, it \nwas almost as if little bones were piercing through his flesh. I will \nnever forget that. That is when the horror of starvation becomes real, \nwhen you can touch it.\n  There are many things that will haunt me the rest of my life. When I \nvisited Goma, Zaire, which is now Congo, this was a place where \nmillions of Rwandans had fled the bloodshed in their own country but \nthey stopped at the worst possible place, on volcanic rock. You \ncouldn't drill for latrines so cholera and dysentery were rampant. You \ncouldn't dig for graves, so I was literally stepping over dead bodies \nas I tried to help those refugees. Those bodies were carried to the \nroadside twice a day. They were hauled off to mass graves.\n  Former Senators Bob Dole and George McGovern are the architects of \nthe Global Food Program, which has a goal of ensuring that 300 million \nschoolchildren overseas get at least one nutritious meal a day. The \nDepartment of Agriculture estimates that 120 million schoolage \nchildren around the world are not enrolled in school in part because of \nhunger or malnutrition. The majority of these children are girls. The \nGlobal Food for Education Program is now operating in 38 countries and \nfeeding 9 million schoolchildren.\n\n  I want to see this program expanded. I plan to work on Appropriations \nto advance that goal. Just helping a child get a good meal can make \nsuch a difference in developing countries. Feeding children entices \nthem to come to school which allows them to learn, to have some hope, \nsome future. And improved literacy certainly helps the productivity, \nthereby boosting the economy.\n\n[[Page S7420]]\n\n  This problem deserves national discussion. Hunger affects so many \naspects of our society. In the spirit of that landmark conference held \nby the White House in 1969, I am asking President Bush to convene a \nsecond White House conference so that the best and brightest minds can \nreview these problems together.\n  I am honored to work with leaders of the battle to eradicate hunger: \nFormer Congressman Tony Hall, now the United States Ambassador to the \nU.N. food and agricultural programs, and former Congresswoman Eva \nClayton from my own State of North Carolina, now an assistant director \ngeneral for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. Both \nwere champions on hunger while in Congress. And there are many others. \nFormer Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a leader on gleaning; \nCatherine Bertini, Under Secretary General of the United Nations who \nwas praised for her leadership to get food aid to those in need \nthroughout the world; Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson, cochair of the \nCongressional Hunger Center who carries on the legacy of her late \nhusband Bill who was a dear friend and leader on this issue.\n  Here in this body, my chairman on the Agriculture Committee, Thad \nCochran, and ranking member Tom Harkin, Dick Lugar, Patrick Leahy, Pat \nRoberts, and Gordon Smith are leaders in addressing hunger issues.\n  Partisan politics has no role in this fight. Hunger does not \ndifferentiate between Democrats and Republicans. Just as it stretches \nacross so many ethnicities, so many areas, so must we.\n  As Washington Post columnist David Broder wrote yesterday: America \nhas some problems that defy solution. This one does not. It just needs \ncaring people and a caring government working together.\n  I get inspiration from the Bible and John, chapter 21, when Jesus \nasked Peter: Do you love me? Peter, astounded that Jesus was asking him \nthis question again, says: Lord, you know everything. You know that I \nlove you. And Jesus replies: Then feed my sheep.\n  One of North Carolina's heroes, the Reverend Billy Graham, has often \nsaid that we are not cisterns made for hoarding; we are vessels made \nfor sharing. I look forward to working with Billy Graham in this \neffort. Indeed every religion, not just Christianity, calls on us to \nfeed the hungry. Jewish tradition promises that feeding the hungry will \nnot go unrewarded. Fasting is one of the pillars of faith of Islam and \nis a way to share the conditions of the hungry poor while purifying the \nspirit and humbling the flesh. Compassion or karuna is one of the key \nvirtues of Buddhism. This issue cuts across religious lines, too.\n  I speak today on behalf of the millions of families who are \nvulnerable, who have no voice, for this little Sudanese girl in this \npicture, stumbling toward a feeding station and so many like her. I saw \nthis picture some years ago in a newspaper. It broke my heart. I went \nback to find that picture today because, as I recall the story, she had \nbeen walking for a long, long way and she had not yet reached that \nfeeding station. That has been emblazoned on my mind since that time.\n\n  Anthropologist Margaret Meade said: Never doubt that a small group of \nthoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the \nonly thing that ever has.\n  One of my heroes is William Wilberforce, a true man of God. An old \nfriend John Newton persuaded him that his political life could be used \nin the service of God. He worked with a dedicated group. They were \ncommitted people of faith. His life and career were centered on two \ngoals: abolishing slavery in England and improving moral values. He \nknew that his commitment might cost him friends and influence but he \nwas determined to stand for what he believed was right. It took 21 \nyears and Wilberforce sacrificed his opportunity to serve as Prime \nMinister. But he was the moving force in abolishing slavery and \nchanging the moral values of England.\n  In my lifetime, I have seen Americans split the atom, abolish Jim \nCrow, eliminate the scourge of polio, win the cold war, plant our flag \non the surface of the Moon, map the human genetic code, and belatedly \nrecognize the talents of women, minorities, the disabled, and others \nonce relegated to the shadows. Already a large group of citizens has \njoined what I believe will become an army of volunteers and advocates.\n  Today I invite all of my colleagues to join me in this endeavor. Let \nus recommit ourselves to the goal of eradicating hunger. Committed \nindividuals can make a world of difference, even, I might say, a \ndifferent world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to President \nBush be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2003.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The White House Conference on Food, \n     Nutrition and Health, convened by President Richard Nixon on \n     December 2, 1969, may well have been one of the country's \n     most productive and far-reaching White House conferences. At \n     the time, President Nixon said that the conference was \n     ``intended to focus national attention and resources on our \n     country's remaining--and changing--nutrition problems.'' In \n     hindsight, it achieved that and more.\n       So much has been accomplished since that historic White \n     House conference. With bipartisan support in Congress, the \n     food stamp program has been reformed and expanded, school \n     nutrition programs have been improved and now reach over 27 \n     million children each school day, WIC was created, and \n     nutrition labels now appear on most food items.\n       At the same time, however, the mission is not complete. \n     There are children who qualify for reduced price meals in \n     North Carolina, and throughout the country, but their \n     families cannot afford even this nominal fee. And while 16 \n     million children participate in the free and reduced school \n     lunch program, in the summer many children go without. \n     America's Second Harvest, an extraordinary organization, \n     reports that demand often exceeds the supply of food in local \n     communities. Further, the country is challenged by the \n     paradox of hunger and obesity.\n       Mr. President, it is time, I believe, for another White \n     House conference to assess the progress we have made in the \n     fight against hunger and to recommit the country to the \n     remaining challenges. I was pleased to work with President \n     Nixon on the 1969 conference; I would be honored to work with \n     you on a second historic conference.\n       There is a very special tradition in America when it comes \n     to fighting hunger. Perhaps it is a function of our \n     agricultural bounty, the famines in Europe that led to early \n     migration, or the teachings of all major religions, but \n     Americans are intolerant of hunger in our land of plenty.\n       Mr. President, I hope you will convene a second White House \n     conference with the business, civic and charitable \n     organizations, educators and advocates who continue to work \n     tirelessly to address hunger in America and around the world. \n     Hunger is not a partisan issue and I know that we can work \n     together, with our colleagues on both sides of the political \n     aisle, to address the problems and needs that still exist. \n     Thank you very much for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elizabeth Dole.\n\n  Mrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "NATIONAL HUNGER AWARENESS DAY\n\n\tMrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I first thank the majority whip, Senator McConnell, and the Democrat whip, Senator Reid, for their very kind comments this morning. Then I thank you, Mr. President, and other members of the leadership, for your unwavering support of this freshman class.\n\tI also recognize Senator Frist for the traditional courtesies of a maiden speech to be extended to the new Senator and express my appreciation for his commitment to the rich history of this great tradition.\n\tTradition is held that, by waiting a respectful length of time, senior colleagues would appreciate the humility shown by a new Member of the Senate who would use the occasion to address an issue of concern.\n\tI come in that sense today to share my thoughts on a matter that weighs heavily on my mind. Hunger is the silent enemy lurking within too many American homes. It is a tragedy I have seen firsthand and far too many times throughout my life in public service. This is not a new issue.\n\tIn 1969, while I was serving as Deputy Assistant to the President for Consumer Affairs, I was privileged to assist in planning the White House Conference on Food, Nutrition, and Health. In opening the conference, President Nixon said:\n\n       Malnutrition is a national concern because we are a nation \n     that cares about its people, how they feel, how they live. We \n     care whether they are well and whether they are happy.\n\n\tThis still rings true today.\n\tOn National Hunger Awareness Day, I want to highlight what has become a serious problem for too many families, particularly in North Carolina.\n\tMy home State is going through a painful economic transition. Once thriving textile mills have been shuttered. Family farms are going out of business. Tens of thousands of workers have been laid off from their jobs. Entire areas of textile and furniture manufacturing are slowly phasing out as high-tech manufacturing and service companies become the dominant industry of the State. Many of these traditional manufacturing jobs have been in rural areas where there are fewer jobs and residents who are already struggling to make ends meet.\n\tIn 1999, North Carolina had the 12th lowest unemployment rate in the United States. By December 2001, the State had fallen to 46--from 12 to 46. That same year, according to the Rural Center, North Carolina companies announced 63,222 layoffs. Our State lost more manufacturing jobs between 1997 and the year 2000 than any State except New York.\n\tEntire communities have been uprooted by this crisis. In the town of Spruce Pine in Mitchell County, 30 percent--30 percent--of the town's residents lost their jobs in the year 2001. Ninety percent of those layoffs were in textile and furniture manufacturing. These are real numbers and real lives from a State that is hurting.\n\tOur families are struggling to find jobs, to pay their bills, and, as we hear more and more often, to even put food on the table. In fact, the unemployment trend that started in 1999 resulted in 11.1 percent of North Carolina families not always having enough food to meet their basic needs. That is according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And North Carolina's rate is higher than the national average. This means that among North Carolina's 8.2 million residents, nearly 900,000 are dealing with hunger. Some are hungry, others are on the verge.\n\tMy office was blessed recently to meet a young veteran, Michael Williams, and his family. Michael served his country for 8 years in the U.S. Army before leaving to work in private industry and use the computer skills he had gained while serving in the military. He was earning a good living, but after September 11 and the terrorist attacks, he and his wife Gloria felt it was time to move their two children closer to family back home in North Carolina.

There are other ways we can help, too.\n\tThis year, we will be renewing the National School Lunch Program and other important child nutrition programs, and there are some areas I am interested in reviewing.\n\tUnder School Lunch, children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of poverty are eligible for free meals. Children from families with incomes between 130 percent and 185 percent of poverty can be charged no more than 40 cents. This may seem to be a nominal amount, but for a struggling family with several children the costs add up. School administrators in North Carolina tell me that they hear from parents in tears because they don't know how to pay for their child's school meals.\n\tThe Federal Government now considers incomes up to 185 percent of poverty when deciding if a family is eligible for benefits under the WIC program. Should we not use the same standard for School Lunch? Standardizing the guidelines would even allow us to immediately certify children from WIC families for the School Lunch Program. It is time to clarify this bureaucratic situation and harmonize our Federal income assistance guidelines so we can help those most in need.\n\tThe School Lunch Program is the final component of our commitment to child nutrition, and we must do everything to maintain and strengthen its integrity so that it works for those who need it and isn't viewed as a Government giveaway.\n\tThere are a lot of interesting ideas being discussed such as adjusting area eligibility guidelines in the Summer Food Program. But these need to be looked at carefully, and we need to ask important questions such as how many people would be affected and what is the cost. I have discussed many of these ideas with groups such as America's Second Harvest, Bread for the World, the Food Research and Action Center, and the American School Food Service Association. I look forward to the opportunity of exploring them further during reauthorization of these important programs in the Agriculture Committee, on which I am honored to serve.\n\tOur work cannot stop within our own borders. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations says hunger affects millions worldwide. During my 8 years as president of the American Red Cross, I visited Somalia during the heart-wrenching famine. In Mojada, I came across a little boy under a sack. I thought he was dead. His brother pulled back that sack and sat him up and he was severely malnourished. He couldn't eat the rice and beans in the bowl beside him; he was too malnourished. I asked for camel's milk to feed him.\n\tAs I put my arm around his back and lifted that cup to his mouth, it was almost as if little bones were piercing through his flesh. I will never forget that. That is when the horror of starvation becomes real, when you can touch it.\n\tThere are many things that will haunt me the rest of my life. When I visited Goma, Zaire, which is now Congo, this was a place where millions of Rwandans had fled the bloodshed in their own country but they stopped at the worst possible place, on volcanic rock. You couldn't drill for latrines so cholera and dysentery were rampant. You couldn't dig for graves, so I was literally stepping over dead bodies as I tried to help those refugees. Those bodies were carried to the roadside twice a day. They were hauled off to mass graves.\n\tFormer Senators Bob Dole and George McGovern are the architects of the Global Food Program, which has a goal of ensuring that 300 million schoolchildren overseas get at least one nutritious meal a day. The Department of Agriculture estimates that 120 million schoolage children around the world are not enrolled in school in part because of hunger or malnutrition. The majority of these children are girls. The Global Food for Education Program is now operating in 38 countries and feeding 9 million schoolchildren.\n\n\tI want to see this program expanded. I plan to work on Appropriations to advance that goal. Just helping a child get a good meal can make such a difference in developing countries. Feeding children entices them to come to school which allows them to learn, to have some hope, some future. And improved literacy certainly helps the productivity, thereby boosting the economy. \n\tThis problem deserves national discussion. Hunger affects so many aspects of our society. In the spirit of that landmark conference held by the White House in 1969, I am asking President Bush to convene a second White House conference so that the best and brightest minds can review these problems together.\n\tI am honored to work with leaders of the battle to eradicate hunger: Former Congressman Tony Hall, now the United States Ambassador to the U.N. food and agricultural programs, and former Congresswoman Eva Clayton from my own State of North Carolina, now an assistant director general for the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. Both were champions on hunger while in Congress. And there are many others. Former Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, a leader on gleaning; Catherine Bertini, Under Secretary General of the United Nations who was praised for her leadership to get food aid to those in need throughout the world; Congresswoman Jo Ann Emerson, cochair of the Congressional Hunger Center who carries on the legacy of her late husband Bill who was a dear friend and leader on this issue.\n\tHere in this body, my chairman on the Agriculture Committee, Thad Cochran, and ranking member Tom Harkin, Dick Lugar, Patrick Leahy, Pat Roberts, and Gordon Smith are leaders in addressing hunger issues.\n\tPartisan politics has no role in this fight. Hunger does not differentiate between Democrats and Republicans. Just as it stretches across so many ethnicities, so many areas, so must we.\n\tAs Washington Post columnist David Broder wrote yesterday: America has some problems that defy solution. This one does not. It just needs caring people and a caring government working together.\n\tI get inspiration from the Bible and John, chapter 21, when Jesus asked Peter: Do you love me? Peter, astounded that Jesus was asking him this question again, says: Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you. And Jesus replies: Then feed my sheep.\n\tOne of North Carolina's heroes, the Reverend Billy Graham, has often said that we are not cisterns made for hoarding; we are vessels made for sharing. I look forward to working with Billy Graham in this effort. Indeed every religion, not just Christianity, calls on us to feed the hungry. Jewish tradition promises that feeding the hungry will not go unrewarded. Fasting is one of the pillars of faith of Islam and is a way to share the conditions of the hungry poor while purifying the spirit and humbling the flesh. Compassion or karuna is one of the key virtues of Buddhism. This issue cuts across religious lines, too.\n\tI speak today on behalf of the millions of families who are vulnerable, who have no voice, for this little Sudanese girl in this picture, stumbling toward a feeding station and so many like her. I saw this picture some years ago in a newspaper. It broke my heart. I went back to find that picture today because, as I recall the story, she had been walking for a long, long way and she had not yet reached that feeding station. That has been emblazoned on my mind since that time.\n\n\tAnthropologist Margaret Meade said: Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.\n\tOne of my heroes is William Wilberforce, a true man of God. An old friend John Newton persuaded him that his political life could be used in the service of God. He worked with a dedicated group. They were committed people of faith. His life and career were centered on two goals: abolishing slavery in England and improving moral values. He knew that his commitment might cost him friends and influence but he was determined to stand for what he believed was right. It took 21 years and Wilberforce sacrificed his opportunity to serve as Prime Minister. But he was the moving force in abolishing slavery and changing the moral values of England.\n\tIn my lifetime, I have seen Americans split the atom, abolish Jim Crow, eliminate the scourge of polio, win the cold war, plant our flag on the surface of the Moon, map the human genetic code, and belatedly recognize the talents of women, minorities, the disabled, and others once relegated to the shadows. Already a large group of citizens has joined what I believe will become an army of volunteers and advocates.\n\tToday I invite all of my colleagues to join me in this endeavor. Let us recommit ourselves to the goal of eradicating hunger. Committed individuals can make a world of difference, even, I might say, a different world.\n\tMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to President Bush be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2003.\n     President George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The White House Conference on Food, \n     Nutrition and Health, convened by President Richard Nixon on \n     December 2, 1969, may well have been one of the country's \n     most productive and far-reaching White House conferences. At \n     the time, President Nixon said that the conference was \n     ``intended to focus national attention and resources on our \n     country's remaining--and changing--nutrition problems.'' In \n     hindsight, it achieved that and more.\n       So much has been accomplished since that historic White \n     House conference. With bipartisan support in Congress, the \n     food stamp program has been reformed and expanded, school \n     nutrition programs have been improved and now reach over 27 \n     million children each school day, WIC was created, and \n     nutrition labels now appear on most food items.\n       At the same time, however, the mission is not complete. \n     There are children who qualify for reduced price meals in \n     North Carolina, and throughout the country, but their \n     families cannot afford even this nominal fee. And while 16 \n     million children participate in the free and reduced school \n     lunch program, in the summer many children go without. \n     America's Second Harvest, an extraordinary organization, \n     reports that demand often exceeds the supply of food in local \n     communities. Further, the country is challenged by the \n     paradox of hunger and obesity.\n       Mr. President, it is time, I believe, for another White \n     House conference to assess the progress we have made in the \n     fight against hunger and to recommit the country to the \n     remaining challenges. I was pleased to work with President \n     Nixon on the 1969 conference; I would be honored to work with \n     you on a second historic conference.\n       There is a very special tradition in America when it comes \n     to fighting hunger. Perhaps it is a function of our \n     agricultural bounty, the famines in Europe that led to early \n     migration, or the teachings of all major religions, but \n     Americans are intolerant of hunger in our land of plenty.\n       Mr. President, I hope you will convene a second White House \n     conference with the business, civic and charitable \n     organizations, educators and advocates who continue to work \n     tirelessly to address hunger in America and around the world. \n     Hunger is not a partisan issue and I know that we can work \n     together, with our colleagues on both sides of the political \n     aisle, to address the problems and needs that still exist. \n     Thank you very much for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Elizabeth Dole.\n\n\tMrs. DOLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tMr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes as if in morning business.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

That joint hearing is to focus on military families raising \nchildren.\n  Our military has dropped from 3 million to 1.4 million, so we have \nfewer people in the Armed Services, but we have more missions; we have \nfewer soldiers; we have more women as a part of the military; we have \nmore military spouses working; we have longer deployments; we have more \nmilitary children.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To promote the use of cellulosic biomass ethanol derived from \n                         agricultural residue)\n\n       On page 8, strike lines 16 through 19 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(4) Cellulosic biomass ethanol.--For the purpose of \n     paragraph (2), 1 gallon of cellulosic biomass ethanol--\n       ``(A) shall be considered to be the equivalent of 1.5 \n     gallons of renewable fuel; or\n       ``(B) if the cellulosic biomass is derived from \n     agricultural residue, shall be considered to be the \n     equivalent of 2.5 gallons of renewable fuel.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very delighted to offer this \namendment on behalf of myself, Senator Lugar, and Senator Cantwell. I \nthink it is quite a pro-ethanol amendment because what we are trying to \ndo here is encourage the development of ethanol that is produced from \nagricultural residues.\n  This amendment will, in fact, promote the production of agricultural \nresidue ethanol. I want to tell my colleagues why this is important. I \nbelieve that biomass ethanol derived from agricultural residue could be \na significant source of ethanol in California and also throughout the \nUnited States. Every State has agricultural waste, including those \nproducing corn.\n  I hope my colleagues who have the production of corn, wheat, \nsugarcane, rice, barley, beets, or oats in their States will realize \nthis amendment is very important to them. I also believe the use of \nagricultural residue ethanol will make it easier for many of our \nStates--certainly for California--to meet an ethanol mandate without \nprice spikes and gasoline shortages as it increases the flexibility \nthat the country has to meet this mandate.\n  What is agricultural residue ethanol? I am sure if people are \nwatching, they are thinking: This cannot be interesting. To me, it is \nvery interesting because it is fuel made from the fibrous portion of \nplants, as is ethanol, but it differs from conventional ethanol in the \nfollowing significant ways.\n  First, the manufacturing process does not consume fossil fuels but \nrather uses plant byproducts and waste to create the energy to run the \nprocess. So, in a time in our history when we are trying to lessen our \ndependence on fossil fuel, I think this amendment is quite an important \nstatement for us to make. I am very proud that Senator Lugar agrees \nbecause he is someone with much experience in this area.\n  Second, the raw material does not compete as a food source for humans \nand is available today based on existing farm practices.\n  Third, it uses existing waste products, thus decreasing disposal \nneeds.\n  Ethanol made from agricultural residue, such as rice, wheat straw, \nand sugarcane waste, can be locally produced and does not require that \ncorn and other commodities be grown just to make ethanol.\n  What we are talking about is using the residue, not growing food just \nto produce ethanol at a time when we are throwing food away because we \nhave an overabundance in many of these areas. And, then we have been \nvery energy inefficient by using the fossil fuel to develop the \nethanol. What we are saying is the waste of agricultural materials is \ngoing to be put to good use.\n  Is this a pie-in-the-sky idea? No, it is not. In 1999, Sacramento \nValley produced enough rice straw waste--500,000 tons of which is \nburned in the field--to\n\n[[Page S7422]]\n\nproduce 100 million gallons of agricultural residue ethanol.\n  By putting these agricultural wastes to good use, converting them \ninto energy resources, agricultural ethanol residue production reduces \nlandfill disposal and open-air burning. We are using the waste we \notherwise would dispose of either by burning, which dirties the air, or \nthrowing it into a landfill. This will improve air quality and water \nquality.\n  Further, agricultural residue ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by \nmore than 90 percent compared to gasoline. I reiterate, agricultural \nresidue ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by more than 90 percent \ncompared to gasoline. And it also creates markets for unused \nagricultural products that are generally expensive to dispose of. \nAgricultural residue ethanol can give our farmers and our rural \ncommunities enhanced economic security.\n  We clearly know that as a new technology, agricultural residue \nethanol faces an uphill struggle to break into the ethanol market.\n  Right now we know, when we look at the marketplace, that there is \nmuch room to grow here if we look at the numbers. We only have a very \nsmall number of gallons that are being derived from anything other than \ncorn. So we have a chance. This, again, is not a pie-in-the-sky idea.\n\n  Currently, the only commercial facility is the Iogen facility in \nCanada which converts wheat straw into fermentable sugar and the sugar \ninto bioethanol. Iogen Corporation's goal is to produce 180,000 gallons \nof ethanol annually. I believe we should promote these types of \nfacilities in the United States of America. Our amendment, I believe, \nwill ensure this.\n  We provide in our amendment more incentives for this type of \nagricultural residue ethanol production in the United States of \nAmerica. As this mandate hits my State of California, and other States, \nwhere they have to spend a lot of money to bring that ethanol into to \nthe State, it is going to be very cost competitive to import this type \nof ethanol from Canada. Why do we want to do that when we have the \nability, if we have wheat, corn, beets, oats, barley, or rice, to name \na few? We can do this in our country, and we can have a whole new \nindustry. We can make ethanol more affordable to those of us who live \nin States far away from the Midwest.\n  In the underlying bill, there is a 1.5-gallon credit for numerous \ntypes of biomass ethanol. This means that a gallon of biomass ethanol \ncounts as 1.5 gallons in meeting the bill's mandate. So there is a \nlittle incentive to use biomass ethanol, and I am very proud of that \nbecause we worked hard on that issue in our committee.\n  What we want to do, it seems to me, is increase that credit to 2.5 \ngallons if the ethanol is made from agricultural residues. The fact is \nthat agricultural residues provide us with an amazing opportunity and a \npromising opportunity to produce ethanol that has the potential of \nproviding many economic and environmental benefits.\n  We are very pleased to offer this amendment. Right now, up to this \npoint, we have seen amendments that people have viewed as anti-ethanol. \nThis is an amendment that should bring us together. It should unite us \nbecause there are so many other crops that could be used--and, by the \nway, are going to be used--but we want to incentivize those \nagricultural crops.\n  That is what our amendment does. Senator Lugar, Senator Cantwell, and \nI are very pleased to offer this amendment. We are very hopeful it will \nbe adopted. We are very hopeful we will not have opposition.\n  Mr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor. \nI also suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada does not control the \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nI will call for shortly be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the quorum call will be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from \nCalifornia who has just offered an amendment which expands the \nsubstances that can be used for ethanol conversion. I am willing to \naccept the amendment. I favor the amendment. I understand the \ndistinguished minority manager would like to speak on the subject at \nthis point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nCalifornia on this amendment. It substantially improves this portion of \nthe bill and does provide additional opportunity for developing ethanol \nfrom these other sources. It is good environmental policy. It is good \nenergy policy. I very much support the amendment.\n  As I understand it, most of those people who looked at this agreed to \nit. I agree with my colleague from New Mexico that this is an amendment \nwe should agree to unanimously in the Senate and we should maintain it \nin conference, insisting on it in our discussions with the House.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I cannot thank enough both of my \ncolleagues, my friends, from New Mexico, Senator Domenici and Senator \nBingaman.\n  I want to make sure Senators understand exactly what we do. We \nincrease the credit to 2.5 gallons if the ethanol is made from \nagricultural residue. It is giving an incentive to our farmers who \nproduce rice, wheat, barley, oats, sugar beets, and others, an \nincentive to use the waste.\n  I was going to have a rollcall vote on this, but given the assurances \nof Senators Domenici and Bingaman, who have stated very clearly and \nhave told me they will not drop this amendment in conference--can I \nrely on that commitment? I ask both my friends one more time.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I say to the Senator, I will do my very best. I \nindicated that to you and I will do my very best. I make that \ncommitment to you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You will do your very best?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Meaning you will not drop it in conference, which is what \nyou told me?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And my other friend, my ranking member, has made the same \npledge?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me respond, to the extent I am persuasive in the \nconference, I will commit to keeping this provision in the law.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I see the Democratic leader is on the Senate floor. It \nwould be a wonderful thing if he could speak out on this amendment as \nwell. We have both Senators from New Mexico, and Senator Lugar. I am \ntrying not to put the Senate through a rollcall vote. If I have these \nstrong commitments, it will make me feel a lot better about it. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her efforts to improve upon this legislation. I have \nindicated to her privately that I support the amendment. I would \nsupport it if there were a rollcall vote.\n  The fact that Dick Lugar, the initial cosponsor of this legislation \nwhen we introduced it several years ago, is a proud sponsor of this \namendment is some indication of the degree to which the ethanol \ncommunity and those of us who support this proposal would be supporting \nher amendment.\n  As my colleagues from New Mexico, both the chairman and the ranking \nmember, have noted, there is no reason, when we get into conference, \nthis\n\n[[Page S7423]]\n\nshould not remain intact as part of the Energy bill.\n  It is a good amendment. It provides even more opportunities to meet \nthe targets set out in this legislation.\n  So I would do all I could as Democratic leader to ensure that at the \nend of the day, when this legislation comes back in the form of a \nconference report, we will continue to see the Boxer amendment \nintegrally a part of the bill itself and a part of this amendment.\n  Again, let me congratulate her, thank her, and indicate I will be \nvery supportive.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle. I know he is \nworking endless hours to get this amendment finished. I think this \nenhances the amendment, I really do. I am very grateful.\n  Before I ask for a voice vote, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8 minutes remaining to the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 6 minutes to my colleague from Washington, \nSenator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \nher hard work on this amendment. I am glad to join Senator Lugar and \nSenator Boxer as a cosponsor of this amendment. Senator Boxer has spent \nan invaluable amount of time on the whole ethanol debate, but I think \nthe amendment she offers this morning goes a long way in adding \ndiversity and efficiency to our ethanol plan. It seems my colleagues \nare enthusiastic about supporting this in the overall energy package.\n  I rise to support the Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment. As we have \nheard, this amendment would increase from 1.5 gallons to 2.5 gallons \nthe credit available to refiners who choose to use ethanol derived from \ncertain types of biomass to meet the requirement of our renewable fuels \nstandard. Senator Boxer did an excellent job, giving us all a lesson in \nbiomass 101 as it relates to ethanol and the products that could be \nused as part of this biomass requirement.\n  This amendment ensures that as we strive to reduce our reliance on \nforeign oil, displacing it with home-grown products that provide both \nenvironmental benefits and economic stimulus to our nation's rural \ncommunities, we also develop the renewable fuels diversity that is the \nhallmark of what I think is a good energy policy.\n  My colleagues may have been told this, or they may learn it now for \nthe first time, but it was in 1925 that Henry Ford told the New York \nTimes that ethanol was ``the fuel of the future.'' But while 90 percent \nof the ethanol produced in this Nation today was derived from corn, \nHenry Ford's vision was much broader. He said:\n\n       The fuel of the future is going to come from apples, weeds \n     and sawdust--almost anything. There is fuel in every bit of \n     vegetable matter that can be fermented.\n\n  That is what he told the Times back in that period.\n  This amendment attempts to move forward on that vision. I believe it \nis logical, and I believe Senator Boxer and Senator Lugar are right on \ntarget in providing leadership on this issue.\n  While today the ethanol that is derived from corn more or less \ndominates the renewable fuels market, this is not the circumstance for \nevery State in our country. The State of Washington, for example, is \nmuch more a producer of wheat, which would hold significant promise as \na potential source for the biomass ethanol.\n  Despite the promise of these alternatives, the technology for \nproducing ethanol from these sources such as wheat and straw and other \nagricultural products has lagged behind for a number of reasons. Yet by \nproviding appropriate incentives today with this amendment, and \npromoting research and development, we can move this forward on a cost-\ncompetitive basis.\n  The Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment would increase the renewable fuels \nstandard credit for one specific type of material, the agricultural \nresidues such as wheat or rice or straw, from that 1.5 to 2.5, \nreflecting what is really a recent DOE analysis on what we should \nachieve.\n  So moving forward on these incentives for development of ethanol \nproduction is simply a matter of good public policy. I say this for \nfour or five reasons.\n  We get the environmental benefits from this, we get the potential \nenergy gains, we get the long-term cost impacts of having fuel \ndiversity, and, of course, we get the spread of economic benefits to \nall of our Nation's agricultural communities.\n  In our State of Washington, there is much going on in this area. \nThere are many farmers who have come together in a variety of ways to \njoin in thinking about ethanol production. With the construction of one \n40-million-gallon plant, the State of Washington could become entirely \nethanol self-sufficient. According to a study conducted by our State \nuniversity, such a plan would have a significant economic impact, \nparticularly in our rural communities in the eastern part of \nWashington.\n  A single 40-million-gallon production plant could create 104 direct \njobs and about 300 indirect jobs. Local communities could see an \neconomic benefit, according to the study, of about $19 million per year \nwith a statewide benefit of somewhere between $20 million and $30 \nmillion per year. With the construction of these various plants, \nWashington State could reach self-sufficiency and could, under the \nfuels standard proposal here today, become a supplier to other Western \nStates.\n  The State of Washington and agricultural communities want to help \nmeet the renewable fuels standard. They want to join with Senators \nFrist and Daschle in their proposal. But we don't have the corn or the \nabundance to make that happen. So we want to see this diversity. In \nfact, a recent Washington State University extension program concluded \nthat we could produce 200 million gallons per year in ethanol if we had \nimprovement in technologies and diversification of resources.\n  In conclusion, to help this become reality, a broad coalition of \nWashington agricultural and environmentalist interests have banded \ntogether. They helped pass this package in our State legislature with a \nvariety of tax incentives and broad production of biofuels. These bills \nwere signed by our Governor last month and they have our State moving \nforward on this agenda.\n  The Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment adds a Federal dimension to these \nefforts. This provision reflects good public policy from the Federal \nGovernment and good energy policy, and helps those States that are \nfurther away from ethanol diversity to participate in our national \nenergy goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a couple of minutes remaining. I \nknow we are going to set our amendment aside.\n  I wanted to close this debate again by thanking Senator Lugar for his \nleadership, Senator Cantwell for her leadership, and both Senators from \nNew Mexico as well as Senator Daschle for their help.\n  I think any Senator who has corn in their State, wheat in their \nState, sugarcane in their State, rice, barley, beets, oats, apples, or \nany fructose-rich product is going to be very happy with this \namendment.\n  In order to use the agricultural residue and make it into ethanol, it \nis going to require a little incentive. Although the underlying bill \nhas a slight incentive, experts tell us it is not enough to really move \nforward on this very good way to make ethanol. I think it will really \nhelp those States that are far away from the Midwest.\n  By the way, it does not hurt any State because corn will still be \nused.\n  I yield the floor. I thank my colleagues very much.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to setting it aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 856 to Amendment No. 850\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n\n[[Page S7424]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n     Jeffords, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     856 to amendment No. 850.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for equal liability treatment of vehicle fuels and \n                            fuel additives)\n\n       Beginning on page 18, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through page 19, line 17, and insert the following:\n       ``(p) Renewable Fuels Safe Harbor.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of Federal or State law, a renewable fuel \n     used or intended to be used as a motor vehicle fuel, or any \n     motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuel, shall be \n     subject to liability standards that are not less protective \n     of human health, welfare, and the environment than any other \n     motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive.''.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think for anyone in this Chamber who \ncares about the health and safety of people--I know that is every one \nof us--this amendment is very important.\n  A waiver of liability is in this underlying bill for renewable fuels. \nMy amendment to the renewable fuels portion of this Energy bill will \nensure that all motor vehicle fuels and fuel additives are held to the \nsame liability standards by striking the safe harbor and adding the \nfollowing language. This is the language of my amendment:\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a \nrenewable fuel used or intended to be used as a motor vehicle fuel, or \nany motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuel, shall be subject to \nliability standards that are not less protective of human health, \nwelfare, and the environment than any other motor vehicle fuel or fuel \nadditive.\n  Is this not a fair idea? As we go into this whole new production of \nethanol, be it derived from corn or be it derived from agricultural \nresidues or municipal waste or wherever we wind up getting it, \nrenewable fuel should be subject to the same liability standards as any \nother motor vehicle fuel.\n  We have expenses in this area--where we have added MTBE, for example, \nto fuel. We found out later it was very dangerous. It hurt a lot of our \ncommunities. I will get into that later.\n  The safe harbor language in this underlying bill waives all product \nliability design defect claims, including the failure to warn the \npeople. Any claim that has not been filed by the date of enactment of \nthis section will be forever barred.\n  We should not be doing this. We don't know all the impacts of what we \nare doing today. Why would we give a safe harbor to ethanol or various \nrefiners of ethanol?\n  I have to say to those who will oppose me--and there will be many, \nand I know that, and I accept that--if ethanol is so safe--I pray it \nis; maybe it is, by the way--if it is so safe, why have the companies \ninvolved in its production transferred this liability provision in the \nbill? I think anytime someone says my product is 100 percent safe, but \ngive me a waiver from liability, protect me from a lawsuit if something \nhappens--you have to say who wins and who loses in this situation. \nRequests for this kind of special interest free pass require a very \nclose look. And I hope we will take a look.\n  The interests behind this bill have gotten a loophole that eliminates \na big chunk of the liability they would have under the law if they \ndamaged the public health or the environment. The exemption language in \nthe bill raises a red flag right away. It begins:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or state \n     law. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, you and I have been around here long enough to know \nthat when we start off with ``notwithstanding any other provision of \nFederal law,'' the public is going to be losing rights.\n  The bill goes on to say that ``Renewable fuel--ethanol cannot be \nfound to be defectively designed or manufactured.''\n  Imagine, the bill says ``Renewable fuels cannot be found to be \ndefectively designed or manufactured.''\n  Compliance with laws and regulations is not necessary for getting the \nliability waiver. There is only a limited compliance requirement under \nthe Clean Air Act.\n  Again, we all pray and hope that there will be no danger from \nwidespread use of ethanol. The liability exemption, however, is \ndangerous because there are many unanswered questions about ethanol. We \nknow there are real benefits to it, such as fewer carbon monoxide and \ntoxic air emissions, but there are questions about adverse effects.\n  According to EPA's ``1999 Blue Ribbon Panel Report on Oxygenates in \nGasoline,'' ethanol is extremely soluble in water and would spread into \nthe environment. It may further spread plumes of benzene, toluene, \nethyl benzene, and xylene because ethanol may inhibit the breakdown of \nthese toxic materials.\n\n  This isn't Senator Boxer talking. This isn't the people who want this \namendment talking. This isn't environmental groups talking. This isn't \nthe American Lung Association talking or anybody else. This is EPA's \n1999 Blue Ribbon Panel Report on Oxygenates in Gasoline.\n  Studies demonstrate that ethanol increases the size and migration of \nbenzene plumes. Researchers say more ground water wells will experience \ncontamination from MTBE and benzene, a known carcinogen, if ethanol \nleaks into water supplies. There are also questions about the impact of \nethanol on sensitive populations, such as children. We already know we \nhave seen in our children more and more problems lately, more and more \nproblems because they are so much more sensitive to pollutants in the \nenvironment.\n  Questions surrounding ethanol's effect on public health and the \nenvironment should be answered before Congress grants a broad waiver \nfrom liability for its harmful effects. We should err on the side of \ncaution and we should err on the side of protecting the taxpayers.\n  Supporters of this liability exemption argue that immunity from \nproduct liability design defect claims is not so broad. They are going \nto tell you we keep every other claim in place but we only will limit \nproduct liability design defect claims. But this ignores the fact that \nproduct defect claims are the clearest way to hold accountable \nmanufacturers whose products cause injury to public health or the \nenvironment. Litigation in California involving drinking water \ncontaminated by MTBE rests on claims that MTBE was defective in design. \nIn a landmark case, decided in April 2000, a San Francisco jury found \nthat, based on the theory that MTBE is a defective product, several \nmajor oil companies are legally responsible for the environmental harm \nto Lake Tahoe's ground water. The jury found that many of these same \noil companies acted with malice because they were aware of the dangers \nbut withheld information.\n  So here you go, Mr. President. You can see it, a jury of our peers--\nnot Senators, not people behind a microphone--found out that the \nproduct MTBE, which is an additive to gasoline, as is ethanol, was \ndefective in design. The verdict came forward based on the product \nliability issue.\n  In that case, the oil companies knew the risks of MTBE. They did not \nwarn anyone and--guess what--Lake Tahoe could have gotten stuck with a \n$45 million cleanup bill. If it was not able to sue under the defective \nproduct claim, that $45 million would have to come from the taxpayers \nwho live in Lake Tahoe. Let's see what the MTBE cleanup cost would be. \nAccording to recent estimates, it would cost $29 billion to clean up \nMTBE. MTBE, an additive to gasoline--when it was added, everyone stood \nup and said: Oh, it is safe. It is wonderful. It will clean up the air. \nIt did. But it polluted the water. People can't drink the water.\n  If you ever smelled water that is contaminated by MTBE, you would \nknow no one could drink it. It has a foul odor and it is yellow in \ncolor. This is what it is going to cost. If we waive the liability for \nthe companies that make MTBE, guess who gets stuck with the $29 billion \nbill. The taxpayers, instead of the people who made that product. That \nis not right.\n  By the way, in the House version of this bill, they not only give a \nsafe harbor to ethanol, they give it to MTBE, which is a total, \ncomplete outrage. I\n\n[[Page S7425]]\n\nhope everyone understands that. It is in the House bill. I am happy it \nisn't in the Senate bill. I hope we can get rid of it in the \nconference.\n\n  Companies are responsible for this, not the taxpayers.\n  Now, this is the issue. Again, people will stand up and say: Oh, we \nare only waiving this very small area in liability law. They say: \nProduct liability design defect is all we are waiving.\n  Well, let's look at what the judge said in the MTBE case. He threw \nout the negligence claim. He said that did not apply. He threw out the \nnuisance claim. He said that did not apply. The only thing that applied \nwas defective product liability--and that is what my colleagues are \ngoing to waive for the makers of renewable fuels.\n  My colleagues, please listen to me. I know you want to have an \nethanol bill. Bless your heart. Go for it. But do not waive liability \nfor the manufacturers of ethanol because someday it could come back to \nhaunt you.\n  If ethanol is so safe, you do not need to do this. It makes no sense.\n  You talk to my colleagues: Ethanol is safe. It has been out there \nsince the 1970s. It is safe, it is safe, it is safe. I guess maybe they \nhave not read the 1999 special EPA Blue Ribbon Report, which says: \nDanger, maybe there is a problem. But for them to waive defective \nproduct liability and to say that is the only thing they are waiving, \nwhen it is the only thing the courts have said is an opportunity, makes \nno sense at all.\n  I had one of my colleagues come up to me yesterday and say: Well, \nSenator Boxer, you voted for a safe harbor in the Y2K bill when the \ncomputer companies had to do a very quick fix on computers. I say to my \nfriends, I did that. That only happens once in 1,000 years, and there \nis no direct impact on health and safety. So let's not confuse one safe \nharbor and another safe harbor.\n  So, clearly, we know this is kind of a shuck and a jive situation: \nOh, we are only going to throw out one little part of liability law. \nBut guess what. It is the only one that works. We do not want \ncommunities to be left holding the bag if there is a problem in the \nfuture because that is a pretty heavy bag for the local community and \nthe local taxpayers to pick up--its cleanup costs, its possible health \nproblems and its water pollution and possible air pollution.\n  I am going to get to the issue that the supporters will raise: That \nthis is a mandate and, therefore, the suppliers deserve this liability \nexemption.\n  Congress regularly mandates that manufacturers meet a variety of \nguidelines and requirements, but we do not exempt all manufacturers \nfrom State and Federal product liability design defect laws.\n  When gasoline leaks today, there is no loophole. The polluter pays, \ndespite the fact that Congress regulates gasoline. Congress mandated \nthe installation of airbags in automobiles, made them mandatory. \nCongress said: You must have airbags. You remember that battle. The \nautomobile companies said: We don't want them. (Of course, now they are \nsaying they are happy to have them.) But, in any case, we mandated \nthem. But if there is a problem with airbags, we did not give a \nliability waiver to the automobile companies. If that product is \ndefective, the product is defective and people have to be held \naccountable and responsible.\n  I thought that was what we stood for in the Senate. We talk about \naccountability. We talk about responsibility. We talk about people \ntaking responsibility for their actions, and yet we are going to give \nsome of the biggest companies in the world a waiver from liability. \nShame on us if we do this. It is not as if we did not have experience \nbefore, doing it with MTBE. It is not as if we do not know that the \ncost to clean up MTBE is in the tens of billions of dollars. If the \ncompanies were off the hook, it would be the local taxpayers who have \nto pay.\n  Again, supporters of this liability loophole claim ethanol is safe so \nno one needs to worry about this liability exemption. So, again, I ask \na question--a rhetorical question--if you are not worried about any \nill-effects from ethanol, why are you fighting me so hard on this? Why \nnot join hands with me and say we are going to treat ethanol like we \ntreat every other product?\n  I, again, want to read the language I have added in this amendment \nwhich I hope will be adopted:\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a \nrenewable fuel used or intended to be used as a motor vehicle fuel, or \nany motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuels, shall be subject to \nliability standards that are not less protective of human health, \nwelfare, and the environment than any other motor vehicle fuel or fuel \nadditive.\n  That is all I am saying. I am not holding ethanol to a different \nstandard. I just spoke in support of ethanol made from agricultural \nresidues. I think those folks have to meet safety standards, and one \nway to make sure they do is to not take away their liability. Ethanol \nshould be subject to liability standards as strong as any other fuel \nadditive. No more, no less. We are not making it any harsher. We are \nnot making it any easier on them. We should not shift the burden of \ncleaning up problems caused by ethanol to our local communities, our \nmayors, our city council people, our Governors, and the rest.\n  No public policy is served by immunizing the refiners and chemical \ncompanies from responsibility in the future if it turns out that this \nwas a problem and they knew it, and they didn't tell anyone about it.\n  How much time remains on my side, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes 23 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take another couple minutes. Then I will reserve \nthe remainder and allow my colleagues to argue this case.\n  Let me tell you who is on my side. Who is on the side of making sure \nthat we don't give the safe harbor liability waiver for renewable \nfuels? Many local and State governments, water utilities support my \namendment, public health, consumer and environmental organizations. \nThese include the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies; the \nAmerican Water Works Association, which together represent water \nsystems serving 180 million Americans across the country. Do you know \nwhy they are with me on this? They may be stuck cleaning up the water \nsupply. They can't afford it. This is almost like putting an unfunded \nmandate on local people if, in fact, there are problems with ethanol. \nAnd that is why the American Water Works Association is for my \namendment.\n  Continuing the list of those who oppose the liability waiver: \nAssociation of California Water Agencies; National Association of Water \nCompanies; South Tahoe Public Utility District. Do you know why they \nare for it? Because they know if they didn't have the chance to sue on \nthis, they would have to bear the cleanup responsibility from MTBE \ncontamination. The City of Santa Monica and Orange County Water \nDistrict likewise know the effect that ground water contamination can \nhave. They are with me.\n  How about these groups? American Lung Association is for the \namendment; American Public Health Association; California Clean Water \nAction; Citizens for a Future New Hampshire, Cahaba River Society; \nCitizen's Environmental Coalition; Clean Water Action; the Consumer \nFederation of America; Environmental Defense; Ecology Center; \nEnvironmental Working Group; Friends of the Earth; League of \nConservation Voters; Mono Lake Committee; National Sludge Alliance; the \nNatural Resources Defense Council; the New Jersey Coalition Against \nTonics; the New Jersey Environmental Federation; Physicians for Social \nResponsibility; the Sierra Club; Rivers Unlimited; Spring Lake Park \nGroundwater Guardians; and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n  That is just a partial list of the folks out there who are saying to \nSenators: Please, if you are going to move ahead with a new product \nlike this--it is not a new product, but it is certainly going to be a \nproduct that is going to now be ubiquitous across the country--if you \nare going to do this, then make sure you take every caution and every \nprotection not to waive the protections the American people now have \nfrom a defective product.\n  And, once more, just let's be clear on this. There are no other ways \nfor communities to recover costs if this turns out to be a mistake. \nNegligence, out the window; nuisance, out the window. It is defective \nproduct liability the courts have said is the only way people can go.\n\n[[Page S7426]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has about 10 minutes 4 seconds \nremaining. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, to respond to the question asked by the \ndistinguished Senator from California, why are we fighting it? One of \nthe biggest problems is, you get in this quagmire of lawsuits and \nnothing ever gets done in terms of cleanup. This is something we have \nbeen fighting for a long time.\n  This is going to be a more brief statement than it was going to be \nbefore because right now we have a very significant piece of \nlegislation before the committee I chair on the clear skies \nlegislation, which is the most far-reaching reduction in powerplant \npollutions in the history of clean air. So it is very significant, and \nI do have to get back.\n  I have stated on many occasions my concern about the fact that this \ncountry does not have a comprehensive energy policy. I have also \ncriticized Republicans and Democrats alike. We didn't get a \ncomprehensive energy policy in the Reagan administration or the first \nBush administration or the Clinton administration. We are going to get \none with this. That is why this is so significant.\n  As Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said, it is a serious \nstrategic issue. This is a national security issue.\n  The amendment we are talking about, the underlying bill, the Frist-\nDaschle-Inhofe amendment, represents a compromise on a lot of \ncontentious issues. As with all compromises, there are provisions I \nlike and I don't like. I am afraid there is a lot of misinformation \nbeing circulated about the safe harbor provision. Time and time again, \nwe hear if the safe harbor provision is enacted into law, first, \ncitizens cannot take refiners to court under our tort system; and, \nsecond, any responsible ethanol contamination that happens in the \nfuture would not get cleaned up. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  First, let me address the statement that any tort claim that has not \nbeen filed by the date of enactment of this section will be forever \nbarred. Even with the enactment of the safe harbor provision, if a \nplaintiff makes a case, here are just a few tort theories that can be \nused in environmental cases: Trespass, trespass is not affected by safe \nharbor; nuisance, not affected by safe harbor; negligence, not \naffected; breach of implied warranty, not affected by safe harbor; a \nbreach of express warranty, not affected by safe harbor. Safe harbor \ndoes not affect any of these tort theories.\n  In fact, ethanol has been approved by the EPA as a fuel additive. Now \nCongress is mandating the use of ethanol. So the Federal Government has \ngiven ethanol its stamp of approval and now Congress is mandating it. \nHow can we now say that refiners and blenders are open to suits for \nclaims that the ``product has design or manufacturing defects''? Design \ndefect claims actually hamper cleanups by interfering with regulatory \nagencies. Regulatory agency oversight--Federal, State, and local--is \nfrustrated by the product liability claims because these agencies lose \ncontrol of the remedy process. These agencies are supposed to be in \ncontrol of the remedy process. That answers the question asked, Why are \nwe concerned about this? We want to get these things cleaned up.\n  When product liability claims are permitted, the plaintiff's motive \nbecomes recovery of a large money judgment rather than a judgment \nmandating a remedy to be performed by the party who released the \ngasoline. Very often, the only thing getting cleaned up are the trial \nlawyers' mansions purchased with the spoils of these settlements. In \nfact, a recent report from the Council of Economic Advisors found that \nusing the tort system in this way ``is extremely inefficient, returning \nonly 20 cents of the tort cost dollar for that purpose.''\n  Now, I would like to address the rumors that sites will not get \ncleaned up or that polluters will not pay. The Safe Harbor provisions--\nin no way--affects liability, and therefore, cleanups under any Federal \nor State environmental law. Any statement to the contrary is false. \nEnforcement of these laws is by the authorized Federal agency and \nStates. If there were a spill, here are some examples of environmental \nlaws that offer cleanup and liability provisions:\n  1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); 2. Clean Water Act; \n3. Oil Pollution Act (OPA); 4. Superfund. Generally speaking, Congress \nintended that oil spills be cleaned up by the Oil Pollution Act. \nHowever, the Inhofe Amendment to last Congress' Brownfields bill signed \ninto law by the President is taking hug strides in cleaning up nearly \n250,000 petroleum contaminated sites, such as abandon gas stations.\n  No. 5, Natural Resource Damages (NRD), under the Oil Pollution Act, \nSuperfund, and the Clean Water Act.\n  So as you can see, there are enormous protections through the tort \nsystem as well as through environmental laws. Again, I ask my \ncolleagues to oppose the Boxer amendment and support the motion to \ntable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield to me for about 1 minute?\n  Mr. BOND. I am happy to accommodate my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator is prepared to speak \nagainst the Boxer amendment, as his colleague just did. I, too, have \ncome to the floor to speak against the Boxer amendment.\n  The underlying Frist-Daschle amendment creates a narrow prospective \nsafe harbor from liability for defect in design or manufacture of a \nrenewable fuel. There is no liability protection for MTBE in the \nunderlying amendment. I oppose the Boxer amendment. Many colleagues in \nthe Senate feel strongly in opposition, I believe, and we will be able \nto defeat this amendment.\n  And, to qualify for the limited protection that is in the underlying \namendment, a renewable fuel must be evaluated by EPA for toxicity, \ncarcinogenicity, air quality impacts, and water quality impacts, and \nmust be used in compliance with any restrictions imposed by EPA.\n  Further, the burden of cleanup for environmental contamination would \nnot be shifted.\n  That is, the safe harbor provision that is in the RFS amendment would \nnot affect liability under Federal and state environmental laws, and \ntherefore would not affect response, remediation and clean-up.\n  Let me make this point clear: the underlying provision would not \naffect in any way a company's legal responsibility to clean up the \ncontamination of any groundwater by gasoline, regardless of whether it \ncontained oxygenates or additives of any kind.\n  In addition, the safe harbor provision for renewable fuels does not \naffect liability under other tort law provisions, including negligence, \ntrespass, and nuisance, and it does not prevent the award of \ncompensatory or punitive damages.\n  Importantly, defective product liability cases only make up 0.002 \npercent of all civil cases filed each year according to the National \nCenter for State Courts.\n  Finally, an amendment to change or strike the safe harbor provision \nwould destroy this long-standing renewable fuels agreement, and result \nin the status quo and no national phaseout of MTBE, which has \ncontaminated some groundwater supplies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his fine statement. \nReally, the fact that we are here today in a bipartisan effort reflects \nthe good work that has gone on. After intense negotiations between the \nethanol and oil industries, agriculture, the environmental community, \nconsumer groups, and the States, we have a historic agreement that is \nembodied in the Frist-Daschle bill which will provide for significant \ngrowth in the renewable fuels industries, including ethanol and \nbiodiesel.\n  Industry has been working for months to implement these \nrecommendations that are protective of the environment, provide \nrefiners with increased flexibility, and provide agriculture with \ncertain growth in market opportunities for ethanol and biodiesel. \nCertainly, the occupant of the chair, who is from Missouri, knows how \ngreat the growth of the ethanol and biodiesel industry is in our State, \nas farmers are\n\n[[Page S7427]]\n\ncoming together in cooperatives to build facilities to meet the need \nfor this clean, renewable fuel. These are tremendous opportunities for \nimproving our environment, reducing our dependence upon foreign oil, \nand providing a strong economic base for rural America.\n  The key provisions of the bipartisan agreement, I think most people \nknow, are:\n  A Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) in which part of our nation's fuel \nsupply, growing to 5 billion gallons by 2012, is provided by renewable, \ndomestic fuels; eliminating the Federal reformulated gasoline, RFG, 2.0 \nwt. percent oxygen requirement; phasing down the use of MTBE in the \nU.S. gasoline market over 4 years; and protecting the air quality gains \nof the reformulated gasoline program.\n  These provisions will increase U.S. fuels supplies, promote more \nU.S.-sourced energy, protect the environment, and stimulate rural \neconomic development through increased production and use of domestic, \nrenewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.\n  The historic fuels agreement contained in the Reliable Fuels Act, S. \n791, provides for a gradual phase-in of the use of renewable fuels, \nbeginning with 2.6 billion gallons in 2005 and growing to 5 billion \ngallons in 2012. Some have expressed concerns regarding the bill's \nrenewable fuels ``safe harbor provision,'' arguing it provides \n``sweeping liability exemptions for damage to public health or the \nenvironment resulting from renewable fuels or their use in conventional \ngasoline.'' This is a clear misrepresentation of the provision.\n  The safe harbor provision is intended to offer some protection to \nrefiners that are required to use renewable fuels under this bill. It \nis aimed at as yet unknown and undeveloped renewable fuels, not \nethanol. Ethanol has been used in the U.S. safely and effectively for \nmore than 20 years. But without some limited safe harbor, refiners may \nbe reluctant to commercialize new fuels that may otherwise qualify for \nthis program.\n  Ethanol has received a clean bill of health. According to a report on \nethanol's health and environmental fate completed by Cambridge \nEnvironmental, Inc., no health threat is expected from increased \nethanol use. The report concludes exposure to ethanol vapors coming \nfrom ethanol-blended gasoline is very unlikely to have adverse health \nconsequences. Importantly, after an exhaustive study of ethanol's \nimpact on health, air quality and water resources, the California \nEnvironmental Policy Council awarded ethanol a clean bill of health.\n  Ethanol is rapidly biodegraded in surface water, groundwater and \nsoil. Ethanol is a safe biodegradable and renewable fuel that does not \nharm drinking water resources. A recent study by Surbec Environmental \nconcluded that ethanol poses no threat to surface water and ground \nwater According to the report, ethanol is a naturally occurring \nsubstance produced during the fermentation of organic matter and can be \nexpected to biodegrade rapidly in essentially all environments.\n  The safe harbor provision is very limited. It applies only to claims \nthat a renewable fuel is defective in design or manufacture. These \nrequirements include both compliance with requests for information \nabout a fuel's public health and environmental effects and compliance \nwith any regulations adopted by the EPA. If these requirements are not \nmet, the safe harbor protection does not apply and liability will be \ndetermined under otherwise applicable law. This provision does not \naffect claims based on the wrongful release of a renewable fuel into \nthe environment. Anyone harmed by a release of that kind would retain \nall the rights he has under current law.\n  Safeguards are provided for in the bill. The legislation requires EPA \nto conduct studies of the long-term health and environmental effects of \nrenewable fuels. Under this bill, the Administrator has the authority \nto control or even prohibit the sale of renewable fuels that may \nadversely affect air or water quality or the public health. There is no \nsafe harbor if the Administrator's rules are violated.\n  A vote for the amendment may disrupt the historic agreement. The \nbipartisan compromise on fuels issues in S. 791 represents a carefully \ncrafted agreement among the oil industry, ethanol producers, \nagriculture groups, and environmental and public health interests, \nincluding the American Lung Association, the Union of Concerned \nScientists and Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, \nNESCAUM, among others. An amendment to change or strike the safe harbor \nprovision would effectively dissolve the agreement, resulting in the \nstatus quo and continued MTBE use.\n  MTBE use is a problem. MTBE has been shown to be harmful, and MTBE \nmust be phased out and replaced by the other renewable, benign \noxygenate--ethanol.\n  I will just say generally, on all of these amendments designed to \nattack ethanol, there are tremendous economic benefits of this \nrenewable fuel standard.\n  Tripling the use of renewable fuels will have a significant positive \nimpact on both the farm and overall economy, while significantly \nreducing our foreign imports.\n  According to an economic analysis of the legislation completed by AUS \nconsultants, over the next decade RFS would reduce the Nation's trade \ndeficit by more than $34 billion in 1996 dollars, increase U.S. gross \ndomestic product by $156 billion by 2012, create more than 214,000 new \njobs throughout the entire economy, expand household income by an \nadditional $51.7 billion, increase net farm income by nearly $6 billion \nper year, create $5.3 billion of new investment in renewable fuel \nproduction capacity, and displace more than 1.6 billion barrels of \nimported oil.\n  One other canard that is often raised against ethanol is that it is \nnot a positive energy balance. Energy balance refers to the energy \ncontact of ethanol minus the fossil energy used to produce it. In 2002, \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture and Argonne National Laboratories \nconcluded that ethanol contains 34 percent more energy than is used in \nthe production process, including the energy used to grow and harvest \nthe grain, process the grain into ethanol, and to transport the ethanol \nto gasoline terminals for distribution.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Energy, ethanol produced from \nbiomass generates 6.8 Btu for every Btu of fossil energy consumed. The \nproduction of reformulated gasoline without ethanol generates only .79 \nBtu for every Btu of fossil energy consumed. Therefore, producing \nethanol produces roughly eight times more Btu than using energy-\nproduced reformulated gasoline. And it achieves a net gain in a more \ndesirable form of energy. It provides clean environmental benefits.\n  With the war we face on terrorism, we have to be more concerned about \nU.S. energy. We need to reduce imported oil. We can develop and supply \nthat oil from our rich farmlands. It will increase the availability of \nU.S. fuel supplies while easing an overburdened refining industry. No \nnew oil refineries have been built in the U.S. since 1976, but 68 \nethanol production facilities have been built during that time.\n  As ethanol and biodiesel are blended with gasoline and diesel after \nthe refining process, they directly increase domestic fuel capacity. \nBlending 10-percent ethanol in a gallon of gas provides an additional \n10-percent volume to the transportation fuel market, easing the oil \nrefinery sector that is operating at capacity.\n  The environmental benefits have already been discussed. It can reduce \nglobal warming. In 2002, ethanol use in the U.S. reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions by 4.3 million tons, the equivalent of removing more than \n636,000 vehicles from the road.\n  There is a long list of organizations that are supporting the fuels \nagreement. Rather than take the time of my colleagues to read those, I \nask unanimous consent that this list of organizations supporting the \nfuel agreement before us today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       American Farm Bureau Federation, American Petroleum \n     Institute, Renewable Fuels Association, National Corn Growers \n     Association, National Farmers Union, Northeast States for \n     Coordinated Air Use Management, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \n     National Biodiesel Board, American Bioenergy Association, \n     American Coalition for Ethanol, American Corn Growers \n     Association, American Lung Association, American Soybean \n     Association, Bluewater Network, California Farmers Union, \n     California Renewable Fuels\n\n[[Page S7428]]\n\n     Partnership, Citizens Committee to Complete the Refuge, Clean \n     Energy Now (Greenpeace), Clean Fuels Development Coalition, \n     Climate Solutions, Cook Inlet Keeper, County of Ventura \n     Public Works Department, Earth Island Journal, Environmental \n     and Energy Study Institute, Ethanol Producers and Consumers, \n     General Biomass Company, Governors' Ethanol Coalition, \n     Illinois Student Environmental Network, Institute for \n     Agriculture & Trade Policy, Institute for Local Self-\n     Reliance, International Marine Mammal Project, Kettle Range \n     Conservation Group, Kinergy Resources, Mangrove Action \n     Project, Masada Resource Group, National Grain Sorghum \n     Producers, New River Foundation, New Uses Council, Northwoods \n     Conservation Association, Oceanic Resource Foundation, Oregon \n     Environmental Council, Pacific Biodiversity Institute, Plumas \n     Corporation, Renewable Energy Action Project, Save Our \n     Shores, Soybean Producers of America, The Brower Fund, The \n     Minnesota Project, Tides Foundation, Union of Concerned \n     Scientists, Waste Action Project, Waterkeeper Alliance, West \n     Coast People's Energy Co-op, and Women Involved in Farm \n     Economics.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment and, just for good measure, I urge them to oppose all of the \nother amendments which seem to be targeted at ethanol. The manager of \nthe bill, Senator Domenici, has pointed out that we see many attacks \ncoming on ethanol. I ask my colleagues to continue to support ethanol \nand reject this and the other amendments.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to yield a couple of minutes to \nmy friend from New Mexico. Before I do, I wish to point out that I \nconsider this an ethanol-friendly amendment because I believe there \nwill be much more confidence in ethanol as an additive to our gasoline \nif people know there are no special waivers of liability, that this \nfuel will have to be subjected to the same rigorous standards in a \ncourt of law should something go wrong.\n  I do not envision this as an unfriendly amendment, although I know \nsome of my colleagues feel otherwise.\n  It is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \noffering the amendment. I do support the amendment.\n  The general rule which has served us well in this country is that if \nyou design or manufacture a product that proves to be defective and \nthat product then injures someone, you can be held liable. That has \nallowed us to protect the health and safety of the American people. It \nis a substantial protection for all of us.\n  This safe harbor provision that the Senator from California wants to \nstrike says:\n\n       No renewable fuel shall be deemed to be defective in design \n     or in manufacture or no motor vehicle fuel that contains \n     renewable fuel shall be deemed to be defective in design and \n     manufacture.\n\n  To my mind, it is unwise public policy for us to be writing into law \nthis kind of exception to the general tort laws that we operate under \nin the country. We do not know enough, frankly. We do not know what the \nscientific and health experts are going to find when they fully \ninvestigate the impact of tripling the use of ethanol on the air that \nwe breathe and the water we drink.\n  I certainly hope they will find there is no harmful health effect \nfrom it, but to say we are going to prohibit anyone from recovering if \nthey are damaged from the design or manufacture of any of these \nrenewable fuels I think is a big mistake.\n  I compliment the Senator from California. I support her amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment by my \ncolleague from California to strke the so-called ``safe harbor \nprovision'' in the amendment offered by the majority leader that would \nshield ethanol producers and refiners from any liability if the fuel \nadditive harms the environment or public health.\n  Candidly, I find this ``safe harbor provision'' astounding.\n  I believe it is egregious public policy to mandate ethanol into our \nfuel supply in the first place--and even worse to provide complete \nliability protection to the fuel additive before scientific and health \nexperts can fully investigate the impact of tripling ethanol on the air \nwe breathe and the water we drink.\n  This is exactly the mistake we made with MTBE. Over the past several \nyears, we have learned that MTBE has contaminated our water and may be \na human carcinogen.\n  As exemplified by our Nation's experience with MTBE, there can be \nsevere environmental and health repercussions when we mandate the use \nof any one fuel additive.\n  Last fall a California jury found there was ``clear and convincing \nevidence'' that three major oil companies acted ``with malice'' by \npolluting ground water at Lake Tahoe with MTBE because the gasoline \nthey sold was ``defective in design'' and there was failure to warn of \nits pollution hazard. After a 5-month trial, Shell Oil and Lyondell \nChemical Company were found guilty of withholding information on the \ndangers of MTBE. The firms settled with the South Lake Tahoe Water \nDistrict for $69 million.\n  This case demonstrates why we cannot surrender the rights of citizens \nto hold polluters accountable for harm they inflict.\n  How can the Senate favor exempting the ethanol industry from this \nkind of wrongdoing? I urge my colleagues to take a look at the so-\ncalled ``safe harbor'' provision that will give the ethanol industry \nunprecedented protection against consumers and communities that may \nseek legal redress against the harm ethanol may cause.\n  Our amendment would strike this ridiculous exemption.\n  If we do not strike this provision, polluters will receive \nunprecedented protection from damage to public health or the \nenvironment.\n  If we do not strike this provision, what incentive will there be for \nethanol manufacturers and refiners to make their products as safe as \npossible and thoroughly test their long-term effects?\n  If we do not strike this provision, how else can we hold \nmanufacturers accountable when fuel additives cause harm?\n  Mandating ethanol into our fuel supply raises serious health and \nenvironmental concerns. What effect will an ethanol mandate have on our \nenvironment? What are the health risks?\n  Although the scientific opinion is not unanimous, evidence suggests \nthat; one, reformulated gasoline with ethanol produces more smog \npollution than reformulated gas without it; and, two, ethanol enables \nthe toxic chemicals in gasoline to break apart and seep further into \ngroundwater even faster than conventional gasoline.\n  Ethanol is often made out to be an ideal ``renewable fuel'' giving \noff fewer emissions. Yet, on balance, ethanol can be a cause of more \nair pollution because it produces smog in the summer months. Smog is a \npowerful respiratory irritant that affects large segments of the \npopulation. It has an especially pernicious effect on the elderly, \nchildren, and individuals with existing respiratory problems such as \nasthma.\n  Just last week the American Lung Association named California the \nsmoggiest state by listing nine counties and six metropolitan areas in \nCalifornia as having the worst conditions.\n  A 1999 report from the National Academy of Sciences found, ``the use \nof commonly available oxygenates [like ethanol] in [Reformulated \nGasoline] has little impact on improving ozone air quality and has some \ndisadvantages. Moreover, some data suggest that oxygenates can lead to \nhigher Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions.'' Nitrogen Oxides are \nknown to cause smog.\n  The American Lung Association report also noted that half of \nAmericans are living in counties with unhealthy smog levels. Why would \nwe want to take the chance of increasing these unhealthy smog levels by \nmandating billions of unnecessary gallons of ethanol into our fuel \nsupply?\n  Thus, ethanol can be both good and bad for air quality. To me it \nwould make sense to maximize the advantages of ethanol, while \nminimizing the disadvantages. This is exactly why States should have \nflexibility to decide what goes into their gasoline in order to meet \nclean air standards, and ethanol should not be mandated--certainly not \nat this level. And if we are\n\n[[Page S7429]]\n\nmandating it, why exempt manufacturers and refiners from their legal \nresponsibility to provide a safe product?\n  Evidence also suggests that ethanol accelerates the ability of toxins \nfound in gasoline to seep into our groundwater supplies. The EPA Blue \nRibbon Panel on Oxygenates found ethanol ``may retard biodegradation \nand increase movement of benzene and other hydrocarbons around leaking \ntanks.''\n  And according to a report by the State of California entitled \n``Health and Environmental Assessment of the Use of Ethanol as a Fuel \nOxygenate,'' there are valid questions about the impact of ethanol on \nground and surface water. An analysis in the report found there will be \na 20 percent increase in public drinking water wells contaminated with \nbenzene if a significant amount of ethanol is used. Benzene is a known \nhuman carcinogen.\n  At a hearing held on the House side last year, Professor Gordon \nRausser of UC Berkeley commented on the potential harm of ethanol on \ngroundwater. Professor Rausser testified:\n\n     when gasoline that contains ethanol is released into \n     groundwater, the resulting benzene plumes can be longer and \n     more persistent than plumes resulting from releases of \n     conventional gasoline. Research suggests that the presence of \n     ethanol in gasoline will delay the degradation of benzene and \n     will lengthen the benzene plumes by between 25 percent and \n     100 percent.\n\n  This evidence on the potential harm of ethanol is extraordinarily \ntroubling.\n  I am at a loss to understand why the Senate would support sweeping \nliability protection for fuel producers. Taking away the ability of \nfamilies and communities to seek redress for the harm caused by fuel \nadditives is NOT something I believe this Senate should be doing.\n  Let me read part of a letter sent by California Attorney General Bill \nLockyer opposing the ethanol safe harbor provision. Lockyer writes:\n\n       Congress should not enact the current safeharbor \n     provisions, which could be construed as granting oil \n     companies a very broad immunity. As exemplified by MTBE, \n     there can be dire consequences from the use of defective fuel \n     additives.\n\n  Lockyer continues:\n\n       If there is a defect with a particular fuel, the oil \n     companies should be held accountable under the common law \n     principles for using such a fuel. In addition, by including \n     fuels and not just renewable fuels, this section has a \n     extraordinarily broad reach. There is no reason to add \n     immunity for a fuel just because one drop of renewable fuel \n     is added to that fuel. For as long as automobiles have been \n     used, oil companies have been subject to common law product \n     liability rules. There is no need to change these fundamental \n     principles.\n\n  We need to protect the basic rights American families enjoy remain in \nplace to keep our air and water safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to protect our \ncommunities from harm caused by fuel additives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this debate is winding down and my \ncolleagues are here to offer other amendments. I am going to finish \nshortly.\n  At this point in the debate, we ought to get real about what this is. \nThere are certain matters that are right in society and there are \ncertain matters that are wrong. It is not right to give special \nprotection to one particular manufacturing group in this country that \nno one else gets. In a way, it is a subsidy given to those people \nbecause if there is a problem in the future with ethanol, guess who is \ngoing to pick up the tab? Guess who is going to pay the bill? Not the \npeople who caused the problem but the taxpayers. That is wrong.\n  If we had a wonderful history, if we did not have communities in \ntrouble because of MTBE and other additives we thought would be great, \nit would be different.\n  I see my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, is in the Chamber \nfor another amendment. The Citizens for a Future New Hampshire support \nthe Boxer amendment because they do not want to be left holding the bag \nif something happens.\n  There is right and there is wrong. This issue, to me, is very clear: \nIt is right to protect the people; it is wrong to give a special \ninterest waiver to a particular manufacturer.\n  There is private special interest and there is public interest--\ntaxpayers versus those who would pollute.\n  Finally, when my colleagues say they are only banning one type of \noption for citizens who are injured, namely effective product \nliability, that is all they are doing. People can still use the \nnuisance claim and the negligence claim and all of these other claims.\n\n  I hope they know they are forgetting recent history where there was a \ncourt case on MTBE, also an additive to gasoline, and what did the \ncourt say? The nuisance claim, denied; the negligence claim, denied. \nThe only claim that could hold up, the only claim that could save the \ntaxpayers of Lake Tahoe, who had a mess with MTBE, was defective \nproduct liability.\n  My colleagues stand up and say that is the only thing we are doing. \nThey called it a narrow safe harbor. Well, it is an enormous safe \nharbor because it is the only place people can go to get recompense if \nethanol turns out to be a problem.\n  My colleague from Missouri says there is a study in this underlying \nbill. Well, I am glad there is a study, but he is ignoring the fact \nthat there has already been a study in 1999 by EPA's blue ribbon panel, \nand this is what they said: Ethanol is extremely soluble in water and \nwould spread if leaked into the environment. It may further spread \nplumes of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and ethanol may \ninhibit the breakdown of these toxic materials.\n  It says it may inhibit. That means it may be a problem. If my \ncolleagues, in their zeal to have ethanol in every single State in this \ncountry--and, by the way, it will be--and if they are so sure it is \nsafe, then why on Earth are they saying ethanol should get special \ntreatment, and why do they close down the door on the only area where \npeople have found they have a chance to get cleanup money from the \npolluters? The answer is, they do not know if it is safe.\n  We hope it is safe. We hoped MTBE would be safe, and it has poisoned \nhundreds of wells in this country. Hundreds of water systems have shut \ndown because of MTBE. And if it was not for the product liability claim \nbeing open to citizens, who would have to clean up the mess? Not the \ncompanies that caused it but the taxpayers in those areas.\n  So it seems to me, if I might use the word ``disingenuous,'' to say \nthat ethanol is 100 percent safe, but we want a safe harbor so no one \ncan sue if something goes wrong.\n  I was not born yesterday. That is obvious. I know when somebody says \nthey have the safest product in the world but give me special \nprotection so that no one can ever sue me, my antenna goes up, just as \na person with common sense, and I say that is not right.\n  Researchers say that more ground water wells will experience \ncontamination from MTBE and benzene, which is a carcinogen, if ethanol \nleaks into water supply, and there are the questions about the impact \nof ethanol on sensitive populations, our children.\n  Now, there is not one Senator who does not want to protect kids. Come \non. We know that. Most of us are parents. A lot of us are grandparents. \nWe are aunts, we are uncles. We want to protect our children and we \nwant to protect the Nation's children. How can we close our eyes, then, \nto what we are about to do if we do not agree to this Boxer amendment? \nWhat we are doing is saying that the makers of this product do not have \nto worry about a thing in terms of harming our kids.\n  Our kids, because of the developmental stage they are in--they are \ngrowing, they are changing, their hormones are starting--they are very \nsensitive to contaminants. We know that. That is why I wrote the \nChildren's Environmental Protection Act, and parts of it have been \npassed by the Senate. I am so proud of it. Is it not better to say up \nfront to a manufacturer--any manufacturer--if they harm children, we \ncan take them to court and they are going to have to clean up the mess \nand clean up their product?\n\n  Oh, no, not if they are making ethanol. They are going to have \nspecial exemption. It breaks my heart to see us do this. I figure I \nwill lose this amendment only because we tried it once before and we \ndid lose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from California \nher time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for one additional minute, to \nclose.\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So there are unanswered questions surrounding ethanol. \nThere are unanswered questions according to the EPA special panel in \n1999, and all the Senator from California is saying to her colleagues \nis this: Just make sure this product, which is going to be a new \nproduct in several States, that it does not have special advantages so \nthat if something happens, the makers of the product do not get off \nscott-free. That is not right. It is un-American. It is not fair. It is \nan unfunded mandate on our communities.\n  I was happy to hear Senator Bond say he does not support a waiver for \nMTBE--good for him--because we need to strip that out of the House \nbill. But this is a new day. This is a new additive, and we should hold \nit to the same responsibility as we hold all other additives, all other \nproducts. Because if MTBE had this waiver, communities all over this \ncountry would be in trouble.\n  I thank my colleagues very much for listening to me. I feel very \nstrongly about this. I hope we will have a good ``aye'' vote.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays, and also ask the amendment be set aside \nfor a vote at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: May I ask the \nmanagers of the bill approximately what time they expect to be voting \non the Boxer amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At this point it looks as if we are not going to vote \non anything until about 3, and the Boxer amendment would be second or \nthird in line.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is fine. I say to my friend, could I have 1 minute \nat that point, and a minute on the other side, to explain the \namendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Unless the Senator wants to seek that consent at this \npoint, there is no such arrangement.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that 2 minutes \nhas already been provided in the unanimous consent agreement, so the \nSenator will have that 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the consent of the minority, I make \nthe following unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that--\nI withhold until the minority whip is present, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, now I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 \ntoday the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Schumer amendment \nNo. 853, to be followed immediately by a vote in relation to the Boxer \namendment No. 856, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Boxer \namendment No. 854; provided further that following those votes the \nSenate proceed immediately to a vote on the adoption of amendment No. \n850, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, also for the information of Senators, I have \nspoken to the two managers of the bill. There are a number of people \nwho are ready to offer amendments. The Republican manager of the bill \nhas an amendment waiting to go. We also have a very important amendment \non which there has been an agreement on the time for that amendment. We \nwould want that set up for early next week. It is one of the most \nimportant amendments in this whole bill.\n  But we are not going to be able to move forward until 3:30 on \nanything, until the two leaders announce to the floor managers that \nthere has been something worked out on the amendment originally offered \nby the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln.\n  It is my understanding that there has been work done to arrive at a \npoint where that matter can be disposed of, but until that is done, we \nare not going to move forward on anything other than these.\n  As I indicated, the two leaders may even be talking as we speak. \nUntil we hear from them, we will be happy to fill in this time, until \n3:30, with the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, or whatever \nthe two managers think is appropriate. But until then, we are not going \nto agree to set it aside to move to anything else.\n  So we have no problem talking about the bill or amendments that may \nbe offered. But until the matter involving the child tax credit is \nworked out with the two leaders, we are not going to move forward on \nthis bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For the information of the Senate, I might indicate \nthat the second of the Boxer amendments, which had been listed in the \nunanimous consent, is probably not going to require a rollcall vote but \nwill be adopted by voice. Immediately after that, the underlying \nethanol amendment will be voted on, and a rollcall vote is being \nrequired on that.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, the manager of the bill, intends when \nappropriate, when matters have been agreed on between the leadership, \nthat we can proceed to offer an Indian amendment, which I think then \nwould be followed by a second-degree amendment by the Senator from New \nMexico, the minority manager of the bill.\n\n  We are also pursuing with a degree of vigor an effort to see if we \ncannot get Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy to agree to work out the \nLIHEAP portion of this bill. There are two amendments there. If they \nare able to work that out, that will put us in a position where we will \ndispose of that entire matter sometime this afternoon, hopefully. It \nseems they are very close to working that out, if the Senator is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, let me indicate my best \ninformation is they are still insisting that we not deal with LIHEAP in \nthis legislation, which is of course not my position. I think we should \ndeal with it.\n  Accordingly, I would not agree to just a sense of the Senate on that \nsubject, which is their preference, as I understand it.\n  I hope we can persuade them otherwise. If not, then we will have to \nhave a vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In any event, I am pursuing them so that there will be \na vote. Sooner or later we would like to dispose of it. If they insist, \nthey can have a vote on the first part of theirs. If they win or lose, \nthat leaves you in a position of whether you have the amendment on this \nbill or not, depending upon the disposition of the first, the amendment \nthat precedes it, both of which have been set aside by consent and are \npending action by the Senate.\n  I see my friend Senator Wyden on the floor. I know we had been \ntalking about a proposed agreement with reference to a matter on \nnuclear power. Let me suggest to the Senator, we are in accord as to \nthat. We will enter into it but not at this point. We are examining the \nlanguage carefully. But you have our assurance that at an appropriate \ntime today that agreement will be entered into and then we will be \nready to have a very important vote sometime on the day of Tuesday with \nreference to nuclear power, with you being a proponent of a motion to \nstrike.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I could just respond, Senator Sununu and \nI will be in the Chamber talking in a bit more detail. I always \nappreciate the graciousness of the chairman of the committee in working \nwith me. I think we are going to get an agreement.\n\n[[Page S7431]]\n\nThere are probably a lot more Senators who will want to speak on this \nthan first estimated.\n  So the Senate knows, originally Senator Sununu and I were prepared to \noffer an amendment to strike the $16 billion for nuclear subsidies. The \namendment is supported strongly by the Taxpayers Union, but at the \nrequest of the chairman of the committee, that vote will be put over \nuntil next week.\n  I am very hopeful that we will be able to get a consent agreement \nbefore long to have this debate. This is a significant exposure for \ntaxpayers. It is not a question of whether someone is pro-nuclear or \nanti-nuclear. The Congressional Budget Office has said that there is at \nleast a 50-percent risk of failure with respect to these facilities. \nThe Congressional Research Service has indicated the taxpayers will be \non the hook for in the vicinity of $16 billion.\n  What I worry about is what happened in our part of the country. Four \nout of five facilities were never built. In this case, if the \nCongressional Budget Office is right and you have over a 50-percent \nrisk of failure at these facilities, this will be a huge exposure for \ntaxpayers.\n  I tell Senators there is no other source of energy in this \nlegislation which gets a direct subsidy for building a facility.\n  I am going to try to find a way to reach a procedural accommodation \nwith the chairman of the committee. I am a personal friend, and I want \nto accommodate him. I hope we will be able do that.\n  This is a very significant taxpayer issue for the Senate. It is not a \nquestion of whether someone is pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear. In my own \ninimitable way, I have managed to make both sides mad over my career in \npublic service. But it is a taxpayer issue of enormous importance.\n  I hope Senators will read what the Congressional Budget Office and \nthe Congressional Research Service have had to say about this. The \nCongressional Budget Office reports that there is more than a 50-\npercent risk of failure with respect to these facilities, if \nsubsidized. The Congressional Research Service has talked about a $16 \nbillion subsidy.\n  I would point out that this is even too rich for the blood of the \nother body. The other body has not talked about anything like this.\n  We will work with the chairman of the committee. Senator Sununu and I \nwill be coming to the floor before long as well so that we can begin to \nlay out the bipartisan support we have with Senator Bingaman, the \nranking minority member, Senator Ensign, and others.\n  I would just tell the chairman of the committee that I think there \nare probably more Senators who want to discuss this than we thought. We \nalready have some indication that 90 minutes equally divided with an \nup-or-down vote may not be enough. It is my intention to work with the \nchairman of the committee, the ranking minority member, and others to \ntry to work out this unanimous consent so we can have that done \nexpeditiously.\n  I point out that this Senator and the Senator from New Hampshire were \nasked to come today to have our amendment brought up. We felt pretty \ngood about it. We know there is going to be an awful lot of back and \nforth with Senators between now and the time we vote Tuesday.\n  I ask that Senators look at the Congressional Budget Office report \nand the Congressional Research Service report over the next few days as \nthe discussions go on and off the floor.\n  I look forward to working this out in terms of procedure with the \nchairman of the committee probably over the next hour or so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we will have a great deal of time to \ndiscuss what I believe is the most important issue for America's \nfuture; that is, are we going to have an alternate source of energy for \nelectricity, aside and apart from coal and natural gas?\n  I believe the time has come. We ought to set in motion the \nauthorization--not the approval, not the appropriations, but the \nauthorization--to start down the path that says the United States may \nbe ready to build a nuclear powerplant. The arguments that have just \nbeen made in anticipation of the agreement are not exactly as such. \nThis bill says America should have an opportunity to have a variety of \nenergy sources. We have provided subsidies for coal so that coal can be \nmade clean and delivered to our people as clean as possible. That is \nsubsidized. We have an enormous tax subsidy for wind and energy. In \nfact, it is so big and so current that there will be windmills built \nall over this country, and the amount is a direct tax credit. It is not \nsomething that may happen. Every time one of those windmills is built, \nthe tax credit will apply and money will be used in large quantities.\n  In addition, we are talking about whether nuclear powerplants are \nbeing built today. For instance, General Electric nuclear powerplants \nare being designed and built in Taiwan right now at a cost--believe it \nor not, and which we will show here to the Senate--that belies all of \nthe information that is submitted by the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich we believe is speculative. It will be shown that they are \nconstructing these nuclear powerplants at $1,250 a kilowatt. That means \nthey are perilously close today to producing nuclear powerplants that \nwill be competitive with natural gas in the United States.\n  We are not asking the Senate for any of this to happen. We are saying \nthat, as a matter of policy, we should put in the Energy bill the \nopportunity for this to happen. We will go into great detail as to the \nconditions, how it will happen, how it won't happen, and who has to \napprove and who has to disapprove.\n  We think before we are finished, we will have convinced a majority of \nSenators that the time has come to give a rebirth to this alternative \nsource so that if, as a matter of fact, in the next decade or so the \nneed arises, we will be ready, willing, and able to move ahead.\n  Having said that, I have just indicated nothing else is going to \nhappen in the Senate until sometime around 3 o'clock or 3:30. We will \ntry to get our unanimous consent agreement sometime this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to be very brief. In fact, we are \ngoing to get an agreement with the Senator from New Mexico to work out \nthe process for considering nuclear subsidies.\n  I just want to make sure Senators are clear with respect to what the \nsubsidy is all about. The Senator from New Mexico, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee, said wind is going to get vast amounts of \nsubsidies. I wanted to point out to the chairman that if wind farms \nproduce power, they get a tax credit for the energy they produce. But \nwind farms do not get any subsidy to build a facility.\n  What is unique about the $16 billion exposure for taxpayers is only \none energy source, under this legislation, gets a subsidy to build a \nfacility. That has troubled the National Taxpayers Union. That is why \nthey have been a strong supporter of the Wyden-Sununu amendment. This \nis not going to be about whether you are pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear. \nThis is about whether Senators want to put at risk the taxpayers of the \ncountry for the prospect that the Congressional Budget Office has said \nhas a 50-percent or higher failure with respect to constructing these \nfacilities.\n  We will have more to say about the bipartisan Wyden-Sununu amendment \nbefore long, but I wrap up this part of the discussion by simply \nsaying, again, I hope Senators will look at what the Congressional \nBudget Office and the Congressional Research Service have had to say \nabout that. Those are reports that lay out, in a frank and objective \nway, what the risk is for taxpayers. I hope Senators will review it \ncarefully.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the submission of the \nresolution are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on \nSubmitted Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7432]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently debating S. 14.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is the pending question before the Senate, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Frist-Daschle \namendment No. 850.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, is the Senate operating under any time control at the \nmoment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time control. There is no time \nagreement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have one final question. Has the Pastore \nrule expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Pastore rule expired 5 seconds ago.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n\n             Iraq's WMD Intelligence: Where is the Outrage?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with each passing day, the questions \nconcerning and surrounding Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction \ntake on added urgency. Where are the massive stockpiles of VX, mustard, \nand other nerve agents that we were told Iraq was hoarding? Where are \nthe thousands of liters of botulinim toxin? Wasn't it the looming \nthreat to America posed by these weapons that propelled the United \nStates into war with Iraq? Isn't this the reason American military \npersonnel were called upon to risk their lives in mortal combat?\n  On March 17, in his final speech to the American people before \nordering the invasion of Iraq, President Bush took one last opportunity \nto bolster his case for war. The centerpiece of his argument was the \nsame message he brought to the United Nations months before, and the \nsame message he hammered home at every opportunity in the intervening \nmonths, namely that Saddam Hussein had failed to destroy Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction and thus presented an imminent danger to the \nAmerican people. ``Intelligence gathered by this and other governments \nleaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal \nsome of the most lethal weapons ever devised,'' the President said.\n  Now, nearly 2 months after the fall of Baghdad, the United States has \nyet to find any physical evidence of those lethal weapons. Could they \nbe buried underground or are they somehow camouflaged in plain sight? \nHave they been shipped outside of the country? Do they actually exist? \nThe questions are mounting. What started weeks ago as a restless murmur \nthroughout Iraq has intensified into a worldwide cacophony of \nconfusion.\n  The fundamental question that is nagging at many is this: How \nreliable were the claims of this President and key members of his \nadministration that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction posed a clear \nand imminent threat to the United States, such a grave threat that \nimmediate war was the only recourse?\n  Lawmakers, who were assured before the war that weapons of mass \ndestruction would be found in Iraq, and many of whom voted--now get \nthis--to give this administration a sweeping grant of authority to wage \nwar based upon those assurances, have now been placed in the \nuncomfortable position of wondering if they were misled. The media is \nratcheting up the demand for answers: Could it be that the intelligence \nwas wrong, or could it be that the facts were manipulated a little \nhere, a little there? These are very serious and grave questions, and \nthey require immediate answers. We cannot--and must not--brush such \nquestions aside. We owe the people of this country an answer. Those \npeople who are listening, who are watching this Chamber, and every \nMember of this body ought to be demanding answers.\n  I am encouraged that the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence \nCommittees are planning to investigate the credibility of the \nintelligence that was used to build the case for war against Iraq. We \nneed a thorough, open, gloves-off investigation of this matter, and we \nneed it quickly. The credibility of the President and his \nadministration hangs in the balance. We must not trifle with the \npeople's trust by foot-dragging.\n  What amazes me is that the President himself is not clamoring for an \ninvestigation. It is his integrity, President Bush's integrity, that is \non the line. It is his truthfulness that is being questioned. It is his \nleadership that has come under scrutiny. And yet he has raised no \nquestion that I have heard. He has expressed no curiosity about the \nstrange turn of events in Iraq. He has expressed no anger at the \npossibility that he might have been misled by people in his own \nadministration. How is it that the President, who was so adamant about \nthe dangers of WMD, has expressed no concern over the whereabouts of \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq?\n  Indeed, instead of leading the charge to uncover the discrepancy \nbetween what we were told before the war and what we have found--or \nfailed to find--since the war, the White House is circling the wagons \nand scoffing at the notion that anyone in the administration \nexaggerated the threat from Iraq.\n  In an interview with Polish television last week, President Bush \nnoted that two trailers were found in Iraq that U.S. intelligence \nofficials believe are mobile biological weapons production labs, \nalthough no trace of chemical or biological material was found in the \ntrailers. ``We found the weapons of mass destruction,'' the President \nwas quoted as saying. But certainly he cannot be satisfied with such \nmeager evidence.\n  At the CIA, Director George Tenet released a terse statement the \nother day defending the intelligence his agency provided on Iraq. ``The \nintegrity of our process was maintained throughout and any suggestion \nto the contrary is simply wrong,'' he said. How can he be so absolutely \nsure?\n  At the Pentagon, Doug Feith, the Undersecretary of Defense for \npolicy, held a rare press conference this week to deny reports that a \nhigh-level intelligence cell in the Defense Department doctored data \nand pressured the CIA to strengthen the case for war. ``I know of no \npressure. I can't rule out what other people may have perceived. Who \nknows what people perceive,'' he said. Is this administration not at \nall concerned about the perception of deception? The perception is \nthere.\n  And Secretary of State Powell, who presented the U.S. case against \nIraq to the United Nations last February, strenuously defended his \npresentation in an interview this week and denied any erosion in the \nadministration's credibility. ``Everybody knows that Iraq had weapons \nof mass destruction,'' he said. Should he not be more concerned than \nthat about U.S. claims before the United Nations?\n  And yet . . . and yet . . . the questions continue to grow, and the \ndoubts are beginning to drown out the assurances. For every insistence \nfrom Washington that the weapons of mass destruction case against Iraq \nis sound comes a counterpoint from the field--another dry hole, another \ndead end.\n  As the top Marine general in Iraq was recently quoted as saying, ``It \nwas a surprise to me then, it remains a surprise to me now, that we \nhave not uncovered weapons, as you say, in some of the forward \ndispersal sites. Again, believe me, it's not for lack of trying. We've \nbeen to virtually every ammunition supply point between the Kuwaiti \nborder and Baghdad, but they're simply not there.''\n  Who are the American people to believe? What are we to think? Even \nthough I opposed the war against Iraq because I believe that the \ndoctrine of preemption is a flawed and dangerous instrument of foreign \npolicy, I did believe that Saddam Hussein possessed some chemical and \nbiological weapons capability. But I did not believe that he presented \nan imminent threat to the United States as indeed he did not.\n  Such weapons may eventually turn up. I said so weeks ago; they may \neventually turn up. But my greater fear is that the belligerent stance \nof the United States may have convinced Saddam Hussein to sell or \ndisperse his weapons to dark forces outside of Iraq. Shouldn't this \nadministration be equally alarmed if they really believed that Saddam \nhad such dangerous capabilities?\n  The administration took steps to protect the oil facilities in Iraq \nfrom being damaged and set on fire. The administration took \nextraordinary steps\n\n[[Page S7433]]\n\nto do that. Why did it not take equally extraordinary steps to protect \nchemical, biological, radiological, nuclear weapons, possibly, from \nbeing looted, from being stolen, from being taken away by those who \nwould sell them, possibly, to terrorists?\n  Saddam Hussein is missing. Osama bin Laden is missing. Iraq's weapons \nof mass destruction are missing. And the President's mild claims that \nwe are ``on the look'' do not comfort me. There ought to be an army of \nUN inspectors combing the countryside in Iraq or searching for evidence \nof disbursement of these weapons right now. Why are we waiting? Is \nthere fear of the unknown or fear of the truth?\n  This nation--and, indeed, the world--was led into war with Iraq on \nthe grounds that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and posed \nan imminent threat to the United States and to the global community. As \nthe President said in his March 17 address to the Nation, ``The danger \nis clear: using chemical, biological or, one day, nuclear weapons, \nobtained with the help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their \nstated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of \ninnocent people in our country, or any other.''\n  That fear may still be valid, but I wonder how the war with Iraq has \nreally mitigated the threat from terrorists. As the recent attack in \nSaudi Arabia proved, terrorism is alive and well and unaffected by the \nsituation in Iraq.\n  Meanwhile, the President seems oblivious to the controversy swirling \nabout the justification for the invasion of Iraq. Our Nation's \ncredibility before the world is at stake. While his administration digs \nin to defend the status quo, Members of Congress are questioning the \ncredibility of the intelligence and the public case made by this \nadministration on which the war with Iraq was based. Members of the \nmedia, Members of the fourth estate, are openly challenging whether \nAmerica's intelligence agencies were simply wrong or were callously \nmanipulated. Vice President Cheney's numerous visits to the CIA are \nbeing portrayed by some intelligence professionals as ``pressure.'' And \nthe American people are wondering, once again, what is going on in the \ndark shadows of Washington.\n  It is time that we had some answers. It is time that the American \npeople were given some answers. It is time that the administration \nstepped up its acts to reassure the American people that the horrific \nweapons that the administration told us threatened the world's safety \nhave not fallen into terrorist hands. It is time that the President \nleveled with the American people. It is time that the President of the \nUnited States demanded that we get to the bottom of this matter and to \nfollow every lead, regardless of where that lead goes.\n  We have waged a costly war against Iraq. American fighting men and \nwomen are still dying in Iraq. We have prevailed. But we are still \nlosing, as I said, still losing American lives in that nation. And the \ntroubled situation there is far from settled. American troops will \nlikely be needed there for months, many months--even years. Billions of \nAmerican tax dollars will continue to be needed to rebuild that \ncountry. I only hope that we have not won the war only to lose the \npeace. Until we have determined the fate of Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction, or determined that they, in fact, did not exist, we cannot \nrest, we cannot claim victory.\n\n  Iraq's weapons of mass destruction remain a mystery, an enigma, a \nconundrum. What are they, where are they, how dangerous are they? Or \nwere they a manufactured excuse by an administration eager to seize a \ncountry? It is time these questions were answered. It is time--past \ntime--for the administration to level with the American people, and it \nis time for the President of the United States to demand an accounting \nfrom his own administration as to exactly how our Nation was led down \nsuch a twisted path to war. His credibility and the credibility of this \nNation is at stake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I understand we are on energy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. THOMAS. We need to talk a little bit about energy. I think that \nis what we are on. That is what we are doing this week. I must confess, \nI am a little disappointed that we seem to get off on other things that \nare unrelated when it seems to me that doing something with an energy \npolicy to try and look ahead in this country as to where we need to be \non energy is among the most important things that we could possibly do.\n  I understand there are different views about how you do that, and \nthat it is legitimate to talk about those, but I do feel badly when we \nmove off on something that isn't related when we are trying to get this \ndone. I think it is important that we do it. We are obviously ready to \nmove on to health care and Medicare and pharmaceuticals the week after \nnext. But we have been over this now. Last year we worked very hard \ntrying to do something with energy. We passed it here. I think the \nprocess that was used was not conducive to a successful finish and, \nindeed, we didn't have one. But this year we went through the \ncommittee. We have already discussed all these issues. We have argued \nback and forth.\n  Obviously, not everyone agrees, but I think it is hard not to agree \nthat energy is one of the things that affects most of us more than \nalmost anything else that we can do here. It affects whether we have \nlights. It affects whether we have heat. It affects whether we have an \nopportunity to use our automobile. And, more importantly, it has a \ngreat deal to do with security for this country. So I really feel \nstrongly that we should get on with it. We should come up with an \nenergy policy out of the Senate. We should go into conference committee \nwith the House.\n  Remember, one of the first things that the President and the Vice \nPresident did when they came into office was to outline an energy \npolicy recognizing how important that is. Since that time, we have, of \ncourse, had more and more unrest and more and more war and terrorism in \nthe Middle East. We have allowed ourselves to get into a position where \n60 percent of our oil comes in on imports. We are that dependent, which \nis very risky. We have seen it move up and down and have different \neffects over the country when different things happen with regard to \nenergy. Yet we seem kind of lackadaisical about trying to deal with it \nin terms of policy.\n  Let me emphasize that is what we are talking about here is a policy. \nIn my view, a policy normally indicates that you are trying to look \nahead at what you think the situation ought to be in the future with \nregard to that issue, what it means to your family and to your \ncommunity and to the country, to try and get a vision of where we want \nto be in 10 or 15 years with respect to energy. And having established \na policy of that kind, obviously, then it becomes much easier and more \neffective and more useful to measure the things we do in the interim as \nto how they affect the accomplishment and the realization of that \nvision and policy that we have seen.\n  I must confess that I am a little concerned from time to time that \nvision is not always something that has a very high priority in the \nSenate, and that really ought to be our major concern--seeing what we \ncan do here to accommodate reaching certain goals in the future.\n  So we are talking here about an energy policy that has been drafted, \na rather general, wide energy policy that I think is very important. We \nare talking in this policy about conservation, about ways to save on \nthe amount of energy we have and the needs we have. We are talking \nabout finding alternatives so that we can have access to different \nkinds of energy than we have had in the past. We are talking about \nresearch so that we can do things such as have more clean coal, so we \nhave better air quality with respect to generating electricity. We are \ntalking about the possibility of converting some of our fossil fuels to \nthings such as hydrogen so that we are able to move them about easier, \nable to have a cleaner environment. And we are able to do all of these \nthings.\n\n[[Page S7434]]\n\n  Of course, very important among all of these is to increase domestic \nproduction. We have great opportunities for production in this country. \nMuch of it lies in the West. I happen to be from the West. Our State is \n50 percent owned by the Federal Government. Many of these resources are \non those Federal lands. Now, we have to do that carefully so that we \nhave a balance between protecting the environment, on the one hand, and \nusing the resources for energy, or whatever, on the other hand. We can \ndo that. It is our responsibility to be particularly careful. We have \nthe largest resource of fossil fuel for this country in the future, \nwhich is coal. We have an opportunity to do a great deal with coal. We \nmet this morning in the Environment Committee on finding new ways to \nset standards for SO2, and for other air quality standards, including \nmercury. We can do those things.\n  That is what part of this bill is about--moving us forward in being \nable to produce energy and, at the same time, protect the environment, \nwhich all of us want to do. But we need to move forward to be able to \ndo that. We need to have easier access to public lands and multiple-use \nlands, and have all the other uses as well for energy extraction. \nCertainly, we won't want to use some lands for that. We will set them \naside as wilderness and special use. We have more wilderness in Wyoming \nthan in any other State in the country--except perhaps Alaska.\n  In any event, these are the kinds of issues with which we are faced. \nThey are not insurmountable. As a matter of fact, they are problems to \nwhich we have the solution, but we seem hesitant to move forward and \nget this job behind us. So I hope we will.\n  We have to modernize our infrastructure. Many things have changed. It \nis not as if energy production remains the same over the years. In \nyears past, in the matter of electricity, you had a distribution area \nwhere an electric company generated the electricity for everybody. Now \nwe are finding more and more that we generate electricity one place and \nthe market is somewhere else. So you have to have transmission. We can \nfind more efficient ways for transmission with the kind of research \nthat we do and take the same transmission line and make some changes in \nit, and it has much more capacity. But you have to move to do that.\n\n  We find that almost all the generation plants built in the last \nseveral years are oil fueled. The fact is, if you really want to look \nat the future, there are many more uses for oil than for coal. We ought \nto be using coal for the generation of electricity and oil and gas for \nother kinds of functions. That makes a lot of sense. But we fail to set \nthe incentives to cause ourselves to be able to do that.\n  After all of our needs for electricity, we find that absent hydro, \nwhich makes it about 7 percent, the renewables represent only 3 percent \nof our electric supply. People keep talking about renewables. The fact \nis that until we do some more research, making them more efficient, \nthey are not going to be able to have a significant impact. But there \nis a possibility of doing that. That is what this policy is all about. \nThat is what we need to be doing, is moving forward to find some ways \nfor transmission and to do those kinds of things.\n  We really have a lot of opportunities to move forward, and I think we \ncan do that. As I said, I come from a place where we have probably the \nrichest source of coal. We provide about 14 percent of the coal now of \nthe United States. We are seventh in oil production and fifth in gas \nproduction. Those are challenges. And there is really kind of an \nexciting opportunity to do some more with hydrogen. Take coal and \nmanufacturing hydrogen, which can be used for cars and homes and for \nmany things--probably the cleanest energy we have talked about.\n  There are some opportunities to do a better job with nuclear power. \nWe have States in which about 30 percent of the energy is produced by \nnuclear power. We have to be able to do more work and research, \nparticularly on waste--probably the cleanest resource for the \nproduction of electricity.\n  I am simply trying to say that I understand there are different views \nabout how some of these things are done. Obviously, that is legitimate \nand we ought to talk about that. But we ought to move forward and get \nthe idea that this matter of energy policy is one of the most important \nthings we can do. We have done something on taxes, and we are going to \ndo something on health care. If we can do something on energy as well, \nwe will have one of the most productive periods we have had for a long \ntime. We have a great opportunity to do that.\n  So I certainly urge that we take a long look at what we are doing and \nfind a way to move forward. Everyone should be given the opportunity to \nput in their amendments. That is fine. But you cannot keep waiting for \ndays and days to get all the amendments in. We have been talking about \nthis for several weeks, yet we keep hearing, ``We have not drafted our \namendment yet.'' If you are serious about an amendment, get it drafted \nand get it out there. Let's deal with it and move forward in \naccomplishing the goal we have before us, which is a great opportunity \nto move forward in this country economically, to create jobs, and to do \nmore for security and make our life better over a period of time, which \nis something we all seek to do.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments in this \ndebate on the Energy bill to talk about an amendment that my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Wyden and I will offer next week. He is the lead \nsponsor on the amendment. I certainly hope we can win strong bipartisan \nsupport for what will be an effort to make this Energy bill better, to \nimprove it, and improve it in a way that does justice for the taxpayers \nby eliminating what I think is an inappropriate and unnecessary subsidy \nfor the energy industry in general, and for the nuclear power industry \nin particular.\n  Our amendment will strike one small section of the bill. It is a \nsection that provides federally backed loan guarantees for new nuclear \npowerplant construction.\n  I strongly believe we should have a diversified energy supply in this \ncountry. We should have competitive energy markets, and nuclear power \nis a very important part of that mix. Nuclear power has proven itself \ntime and again. It has been cost effective and environmentally sound. \nWe have worked through tough, but important, legislation to deal with \nthe nuclear waste issue in the last session of Congress. In my own \nState of New Hampshire, we have a powerplant at Seabrook that has had \nan outstanding record, an excellent record for both efficiency and \nsafety, and it continues to generate a very substantial portion of the \nelectricity used not just in New Hampshire but throughout New England.\n  At the same time, nuclear power, like coal-fired electricity or gas-\nfired power, wind, solar, or hydroelectric power ought to be competing \nin the marketplace on a level playing field. However, there is a \nprovision in this Energy bill that provides Federal loan guarantees to \npay for up to half the cost of as many as six new nuclear powerplants. \nThat is a pretty significant financial commitment, and a level of \nsupport will have to be made by the taxpayers of the United States.\n  If we look at the estimated cost of six plants--perhaps $3 billion \nper plant, maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more--and take a \nlook at half the cost of the plant in the Federal guarantee, we could \nconceivably be looking at a long-term cost of $10 billion or $15 \nbillion. That is a cost that American taxpayers should not be asked to \nbear. That is one of the reasons Senator Wyden and I are offering our \namendment.\n  A second concern is the simple precedent this would set: providing \nFederal loan guarantees for any private powerplant construction. Again, \nmy concern is not directed at the fact that the loan guarantees are for \nnuclear powerplants, or for large powerplants. It is about private \nplant production. If it were gas-fired plants, coal-fired plants, or \nnew hydroelectric plants for which we were giving Federal guarantees, I \nwould have the same concerns. We are setting a bad precedent in public \npolicy when we offer this kind of tax subsidy.\n\n[[Page S7435]]\n\n  We have to ask time and again, Are we being fair to the taxpayers? \nAre we being fair to the marketplace? I do not believe we are. I think \nthis kind of a program, this kind of a tax subsidy would distort our \nenergy markets and would distort the performance of our capital markets \nwhere private companies go out to borrow week after week, month after \nmonth, and year after year.\n\n  We need an energy policy in this country that promotes a strong \ndiverse supply of energy and promotes competition. Sometimes that means \nmaking sure the Federal Government treads very lightly in the \nmarketplace. This provision in the bill does not do that by any \nstretch.\n  The amendment we will offer is a commonsense amendment, and in the \nlong run, our energy markets and even our nuclear power industry will \nbe better served by striking this unnecessary subsidy. If we are going \nto have a healthy and strong nuclear power industry, what that really \nmeans is we have to have commonsense regulations. We need to work hard \nto streamline and to extend some of the relicensing capabilities so \nthose plants that have performed well can continue to operate for an \nextended period of time. And, of course, we need to deal with the issue \nof nuclear waste, which we have begun to do through our efforts last \nyear, and which I support.\n  The amendment that will be offered by Senator Wyden and me is an \namendment that has support from the National Taxpayers Union, from \nCitizens Against Government Waste, and a number of groups that have \nquite a reputation for looking out for taxpayer interest.\n  It also has support from a number of environmental groups, including \nthe League of Conservation Voters and USPIRG, groups that have tried to \nlook out for environmental interests that raise concerns for them as \nwell.\n  It is a broad coalition of groups coming at this from different \nperspectives, but all recognize this section of the bill is not good \npublic policy, this is not the right kind of approach if we want to \nhave competitive energy markets, and it certainly is not the right kind \nof approach for taxpayers.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for working with me on this amendment. We are \nworking on an agreement that will allow us to bring this amendment \nforward on Tuesday with at least 2 hours of debate and an up-or-down \nvote on the amendment.\n  I thank Chairman Domenici for working with us on that agreement and \nallowing us to get this important amendment to the floor, give us a \nvote, and see if we can save the taxpayers a lot of money and help \nimprove this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, the Senator from New \nHampshire has said it very well. I will offer just a couple of \nadditional remarks. It is clear there is going to be an effort, as this \nis discussed in the Senate, to simply make this an ``Are you for \nnuclear power or are you against nuclear power?'' issue. I think that \nwould be very unfortunate.\n  I said earlier when we began to discuss this, I have inimitable \nabilities that over the years have managed to make both sides of the \nnuclear power debate unhappy with me. In a sense, I hope we can do as \nSenator Sununu has done, which is to keep the focus on the taxpayer \nquestion. I urge Senators, in particular, as they make up their minds \non this issue to look at two important reports. The Congressional \nBudget Office report and the report done by the Congressional Research \nService are particularly illuminating in that the Congressional Budget \nOffice report talks about how, in their judgment, there is a more than \n50-percent probability that these plants will not be successful, that \nthey will fail. And the Congressional Research Service, in their \nanalysis, indicates if that is the case, taxpayers would be on the hook \nfor in the vicinity of $16 billion.\n  In my part of the world, this is not exactly an abstract issue. In \nfact, with the WPPSS debacle, which was the largest municipal bond \nfailure in the country's history, four out of the five facilities were \nnot, in fact, even built, and the people in my region and many \ninvestors, of course, were on the hook.\n  If the scenario of the Congressional Budget Office were to come to \npass, all of our constituents--all of them--would, in effect, be \nexposed to these very significant costs.\n  That is why Senator Sununu and I are going to try our best, between \nnow and the Tuesday vote, to make sure that for us this is first and \nforemost a taxpayers' issue.\n  To try to drive that point home, we had a discussion about how this \naffects other aspects of energy development. If this provision stays in \nthe bill, in other words the amendment that the Senator from New \nHampshire and I are offering is unsuccessful, nuclear energy would be \nthe only part of this field that would get a direct subsidy for \nconstructing a facility.\n  For example, the distinguished chairman of the committee, who has \nbeen very gracious to the two of us in terms of working on process and \nall of the issues towards getting this offered, talked at some length \nabout wind and talked about subsidies for wind. Well, in fact, when \nwind is produced, there are various credits and incentives, which I \nguess are very appropriate, but there is no subsidy for constructing \nany other facility under this legislation other than in the nuclear \narea.\n  In fact, right now there is nothing preventing any utility from going \nforward with a nuclear project simply by going to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission and getting a license to build the plant.\n  Let me repeat that. Anybody who wants to build a nuclear powerplant \nin this country simply has to go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nand get the license. They can do that if they satisfy the safety \nstandards.\n  The issue, as propounded by Senator Sununu and myself, is whether or \nnot there should be these very large subsidies; whether or not the \ntaxpayer should be exposed, in the vicinity of $16 billion, with \nrespect to building these plants.\n  I do not think this is an issue about whether one is for or against \nnuclear power, and that is why the National Taxpayers Union and a host \nof other organizations that have been watchdogs for taxpayers have made \nthis a priority item. In their letter to me, they took the position \nthat they are neither for nor against nuclear power. They say that \nexplicitly in the letter. What they and a number of other taxpayer \nwatchdogs are concerned about is the $16 billion exposure for taxpayers \nthat is contained in this provision.\n  So I am very pleased that before long we will be able to enter into a \nconsent agreement for an up-or-down vote on Tuesday on the Wyden-Sununu \nlegislation. I think the chairman of the Energy Committee will be \nleading us in that discussion with respect to a UC before too long.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is still in the Chamber, and I thank \nhim for all of his involvement in this. He has a long record of being a \ntaxpayer watchdog, and that was, in fact, the special reason why I \nthought it was so important for the two of us to try to do this \ntogether.\n  I am sure between now and Tuesday, as this is discussed, to some \nextent some will try to make this into a referendum on whether one is \nfor or against nuclear power. I will be doing my best to try to make \nsure that it is a taxpayers' issue. That is central and critical to me, \nand I look forward to the discussion that we will have on Tuesday. We \nshould have a UC ready to go before long. I thank Chairman Domenici for \nhis willingness to work out the procedure on it, and I am particularly \ngrateful to my cosponsor, Senator Sununu.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am quite sure that before we are \nfinished--if we finish, and I hope we will--the Senate and those who \nare interested in energy policy will hear a lot about the various kinds \nof energy that are provided, as a matter of policy, in this Energy \nbill.\n  I am having a lot of difficulty understanding the Senate these days. \nI regret to say that almost every amendment we talk about some Senator \nis unable to be present. It is either they had to leave early or they \nhad a previous engagement or there is something else they had to do. So \nit seems as if we cannot get the amendments done. But the Democrats are \ngoing to help us try to convince Senators that\n\n[[Page S7436]]\n\nthey ought to start to list their amendments soon so we will have some \nidea, sooner rather than later, the extent of amendments we are going \nto have on this bill.\n  On the issue of nuclear power, before we are finished with this \ndebate, we will lay before the Senate what the Energy Committee, in its \nmarkup of this bill, did so as to make sure the United States had an \narray of energy sources during the next 10, 20, and 30 years.\n  We have tax credits for solar energy. We have tax credits for wind \nenergy. The Senator argues that is different. Well, maybe we ought to \nchange and have just plain tax credits for nuclear power. Maybe there \nwould be no objection to it. Perhaps we could convert what we thought \nwas a better way to do this to some kind of a tax credit, which would \nmean that if they produced, and only if they produced, would they get \nany credit.\n  What we did in the instance of nuclear power was to say if the \nSecretary of Energy, at some time, finds that the United States needs a \nnuclear powerplant because it needs a diversity of energy or it needs \nit because there is some clean air problem, then to a creditworthy \napplicant, a creditworthy builder, of a nuclear powerplant, they may \nsubsidize half the cost with a guaranteed loan.\n  Now, one can talk about that in terms of how much that is going to \ncost. The Senator from New Mexico assumes we look at all of these from \nthe standpoint of the benefits, what are the benefits to America?\n  Twelve years ago, this Senator started looking at nuclear power. With \nthe passage of each year, as I studied it and wrote about it and \nthought about it, I became more embarrassed and more ashamed of what \nthe United States of America had done with this superb technology that \nwe had invented, that was being used in the world and that we had set \non the shelf because a few people frightened us to death.\n  Do people know that today two nuclear powerplants are being built in \nTaiwan? They are building a modern, General Electric design. Guess what \nthey tell us the cost is going to be. In fact, I believe we will \nintroduce a letter next week during the argument. The costs will be \nvery close to the equivalent costs of what we are now paying to build \nnatural gas burned, natural gas fed, powerplants. Who would have \nthought it?\n  What has happened is, since natural gas is the singular source of \nenergy, the cost is skyrocketing because there is no competition. We \nintend there to be competition, not only from nuclear but we have ample \nmoney in this bill for great research in coal, too. We have over $2 \nbillion in research for clean coal. It does not produce any coal. It \njust says do the research to try to make technology work.\n  What we have done overall for the first time in the last 20 years is \nto say, let us develop a nuclear policy for the greatest nation on \nEarth and let us show the world that we have not abandoned the safest \nway to produce energy, electricity for people in the world. Let us show \nthat we are not abandoning that. Let us show that we are going to lead \nagain. And so there is a three-pronged policy. The Price-Anderson Act, \nwhich makes it possible for the private sector to be involved, is made \npermanent.\n\n  This bill says, let's build a demonstration project in the State of \nIdaho, a brandnew concept, so we will build a nuclear powerplant that \nwill be passive. By passive, we mean we will prove it cannot burn. \nThere are people who speculate a nuclear powerplant can burn. They have \nspoken of its burning its way through the earth. This new powerplant \nwill be physically made so it is passive. It will produce high enough \ntemperatures so you can produce hydrogen for the new hydrogen economy \nwe are looking at.\n  America is close to being able to build a nuclear powerplant again, \nlike they are being built in Taiwan, like they have been built year \nafter year in France. France produces 80 percent of its electricity \nfrom nuclear power. They do not run around frightened to death of \ntechnology like the United States. If anyone wants to see France's \nnuclear waste, they will take you to a gymnasium. You can walk into the \ngymnasium, like walking into a school, and walk on a glass floor. One \nmight ask, where is the waste? You are walking on it. It is \nencapsulated for 50 years at least, and nothing can happen to it while \nthey figure out what to do with it.\n  What does the greatest nation on Earth do? We sit paralyzed, waiting \naround for something to happen in Nevada. I am sure we will hear that \nargument before we finish the debate next Tuesday. We know that is an \nengineering issue that will be solved.\n  What we do not know: Will the United States continue to remain \ndependent upon natural gas almost exclusively or will we say it may be \ntime for American companies to build one or two nuclear powerplants? We \nunderstand they are very close. They have experienced litigation and \nother impediments. It is hard to get over the hurdle, over the hump. We \nhave asked, what would it take to start a couple of them? What a day, \nwhen America starts a couple new nuclear powerplants. We would be \nentering an era of cheap electricity, available to everyone, poor \ncountries and rich countries. Guess what. There will be no pollution \nproblem. The ambient air will be affected zero.\n  We knew it was worth the effort to get America going again regarding \nits strength and power as the inventor of the safest energy ever \nproduced by mankind to this point. We could have put in tax credits: If \nyou produce something, we will give you a tax credit. Then our friends \nwould not be making the argument; you are giving them something before \nthey produce. We chose what we thought was most simple and least \nexpensive to the Federal Government, saying, if necessary, you can give \nthem half the costs in a loan guarantee, to get us going again.\n  That is the whole issue. Should we do that or should we not do that? \nBefore we are finished, the Senate will understand, in spite of it \nhaving difficulty with this Energy bill--we cannot seem to get people \nto focus on the Energy bill--but they will understand the significance \nof this issue. They will understand that the fear regarding nuclear \npower and nuclear fuel rods is about nothing but a red herring. They \nare nothing that engineering competence cannot handle.\n  I close this opening argument on nuclear power and whether or not it \nis safe by saying to everyone listening or worrying about nuclear power \nversus the other power in America, there are over 100 American Navy \nvessels on the high seas of the world with engines that are nuclear \npowerplants. Nuclear powerplants run battleships, run aircraft \ncarriers. They have fuel rods in them. They carry them everywhere on \nthe seas. They are at every port in the free world, save one in New \nZealand because New Zealand has an agreement against it. They are so \nsafe, there are boats and ships all around the world that have nuclear \npowerplants on board, with nuclear waste sitting right there in the \nhulls of the ships.\n\n  When you add all that, it is the safest way to produce energy for the \nworld in the future. Our package includes the research facility we will \nbuild in the State of my good friend who is sitting on my right. We say \nto our executive branch, in the event you think it is necessary, you \ncan issue a loan agreement for half the cost of a nuclear powerplant to \nget it going.\n  I understand there are those who will just add up costs under the \nworst of circumstances. I would rather add up all the pluses and take a \nrisk that is worthwhile. If ever there was a risk that was worthwhile, \nit is a plain and simple risk to revive nuclear power in America for \nAmerica and for the world. That is what is at issue in this bill.\n  Those who argue not to gamble any money on this will not raise a \npinky on spending $1.6 billion to research hydrogen, for a new hydrogen \neconomy. It may not work. It may be thrown away. But it is in this bill \nto start the idea of engines that are going to use the new fuel. We are \nspending that money. We are not guaranteeing it. We are spending it. We \nare not guaranteeing General Motors. We are saying, enter into a \npartnership. We will spend some money. We hope it works.\n  This is an issue of risk. When you look at the other kinds of fuels, \nall of which we promote, none of which we shortchange, will we say \nAmerica is a coal country, spend money to make the coal clean so that \nthe ambient air of America is, indeed, clean? And spend plenty of it. \nWe say, build windmills\n\n[[Page S7437]]\n\nand give huge credits for them to such an extent that there may be too \nmany of them built in the next decade; we have to pass an national \nordinance so they will not build them too close to some of our cities \nbecause there will be so many of them when this bill is passed with the \nsubsidy included, the tax subsidy that will be attached. Geothermal--\nthere are plenty of subsidies. Every kind of energy you can imagine, we \nhave said: Help it move along. At the same time, we have put into a \npackage that rare opportunity for the United States to face up to the \nfact that, although we invented nuclear power, we hid from it. Others \ndidn't. It is time we come back and revisit it. It is time that, as a \npackage, coupled with all the other policies, we take a little risk in \nterms of its future, for the future of the world.\n\n  Mr. President, I have a series of remarks that I delivered on the \nnuclear subject on October 31, 1977, at Harvard University, which \nsummarizes my views to that point. I ask unanimous consent that they be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         A New Nuclear Paradigm\n\n                     (By Senator Pete V. Domenici)\n\n       Earlier this week, I spent substantial time on the subjects \n     of nuclear non-proliferation, the proposed Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty, nuclear waste policies, and nuclear weapons \n     design issues. The forums for these discussions were open and \n     closed hearings of two major sub-committees of the United \n     States Senate, a breakfast where two Cabinet secretaries \n     joined 10 United States Senators, and private discussions \n     with specialists in these fields.\n       During the week before, I spent time on the question of \n     whether or not a 1,200 foot road should be built in a \n     National Monument, a monument whose enabling legislation I \n     authored almost a decade ago.\n       Without demeaning any person's sense of perspective, I have \n     to not to you today that for every person who attended the \n     nuclear hearings, 50 attended the road hearings. And, for \n     every inch of newspaper coverage the nuclear matters \n     attracted, the road attracted 50 inches.\n       Strategic national issues just don't command a large \n     audience. In no area has this been more evident during these \n     last 25 years than in the critical and interrelated public \n     policy questions involving energy, growth, and the role of \n     nuclear technologies. As we leave the 20th Century, arguably \n     the American Century, and head for a new millennium, we truly \n     need to confront these strategic issues with careful logic \n     and sound science.\n       We live in the dominant economic, military, and cultural \n     entity in the world. Our principles of government and \n     economics are increasingly becoming the principles of the \n     world.\n       There are no secrets to our success, and there is no \n     guarantee that, in the coming century, we will be the \n     principal beneficiary of the seeds we have sown. There is \n     competition in the world and serious strategic issues facing \n     the United States cannot be overlooked.\n       The United States--like the rest of the industrialized \n     world--is aging rapidly as our birth rates decline. Between \n     1995 and the year 2030, the number of people in the United \n     States over age 65 will double from 34 million to 68 million. \n     Just to maintain our standard of living, we need dramatic \n     increases in productivity as a larger fraction of our \n     population drops out of the workforce.\n       By 2030, 30 percent of the population of the industrialized \n     nations will be over 60. The rest of the world--the countries \n     that today are ``unindustrialized''--will have only 16 \n     percent of their population over age 60 and will be ready to \n     boom.\n       As those nations build economies modeled after ours, there \n     will be intense competition for the resources that underpin \n     modern economies.\n       When it comes to energy, we have a serious, strategic \n     problem. The United States currently consumes 25 percent of \n     the world's energy production. However, developing countries \n     are on track to increase their energy consumption by 48 \n     percent between 1992 and 2010.\n       The United States currently produces and imports raw energy \n     resources worth over $150 billion per year. Approximately $50 \n     billion of that is imported oil or natural gas. We then \n     process that material into energy feedstocks such as \n     gasoline. Those feedstocks, the energy we consume in our \n     cars, factories, and electric plants, are worth $505 \n     billion per year.\n       So, while we debate defense policy every year, we don't \n     debate energy policy, even though it already costs us twice \n     as much as our defense, other countries' consumption is \n     growing dramatically, and energy shortages are likely to be a \n     prime driver of future military challenges.\n       When I came to the Senate a quarter of a century ago, we \n     debated our dependence on foreign sources of energy. We \n     discussed energy independence, but we largely decided not to \n     talk about nuclear policy options in public.\n       At the same time, the anti-nuclear movement conducted their \n     campaign in a way that was tremendously appealing to mass \n     media. Scientists, used to the peer-reviewed ways of \n     scientific discourse, were unprepared to counter. They lost \n     the debate.\n       Serious discussion about the role of nuclear energy in \n     world stability, energy independence, and national security \n     retreated into academia or classified sessions.\n       Today, it is extraordinarily difficult to conduct a debate \n     on nuclear issues. Usually, the only thing produced is nasty \n     political fallout.\n       I am going to bring back to the market place of ideas a \n     more forthright discussion of nuclear policy.\n       My objective tonight is not to talk about talking about a \n     policy. I am going to make some policy proposals. Tomorrow \n     there are sessions on energy policy and nuclear \n     proliferation. I'll give them something to talk about.\n       I am going to tell you that we made some bad decisions in \n     the past that we have to change. Then I will tell you about \n     some decisions we need to make now.\n       First, we need to recognize that the premises underpinning \n     some of our nuclear policy decisions are wrong. In 1977, \n     President Carter halted all U.S. efforts to reprocess spent \n     nuclear fuel and develop mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) for our \n     civilian reactors on the grounds that the plutonium could be \n     diverted and eventually transformed into bombs. He argued \n     that the United States should halt its reprocessing program \n     as an example to other countries in the hope that they would \n     follow suit.\n       The premise of the decision was wrong. Other countries do \n     not follow the example of the United States if we make a \n     decision that other countries view as economically or \n     technically unsound. France, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia \n     all now have MOX fuel programs.\n       This failure to address an incorrect premise has harmed our \n     efforts to deal with spent nuclear fuel and the disposition \n     of excess weapons material, as well as our ability to \n     influence international reactor issues.\n       I'll cite another example. We regulate exposure to low \n     levels of radiation using a so-called ``linear no-threshold'' \n     model, the premise of which is that there is no ``safe'' \n     level of exposure.\n       Our model forces us to regulate radiation to levels \n     approaching 1 percent of natural background despite the fact \n     that natural background can vary by 50 percent within the \n     United States.\n       On the other hand, many scientists think that living cells, \n     after millions of years of exposure to naturally occurring \n     radiation, have adapted such that low levels of radiation \n     cause very little if any harm. In fact, there are some \n     studies that suggest exactly the opposite is true--that low \n     doses of radiation may even improve health.\n       The truth is important. We spend over $5 billion each year \n     to clean contaminated DOE sites to levels below 5 percent of \n     background.\n       In this year's Energy and Water Appropriations Act, we \n     initiated a ten year program to understands how radiation \n     affects genomes and cells so that we can really understand \n     how radiation affects living organisms. For the first time, \n     we will develop radiation protection standards that are based \n     on actual risk.\n       Let me cite another bad decision. You may recall that \n     earlier this year, Hudson Foods recalled 25 million pounds of \n     beef, some of which was contaminated by E. Coli. The \n     Administration proposed tougher penalties and mandatory \n     recalls that cost millions.\n       What you may not know is that the E. Coli bacteria can be \n     killed by irradiating beef products. The irradiation has no \n     effect on the beef. The FDA does not allow the process to be \n     used on beef, even though it is allowed for poultry, pork, \n     fruit and vegetables, largely because of opposition from some \n     consumer groups that question its safety.\n       But there is no scientific evidence of danger. In fact, \n     when the decision is left up to scientists, they opt for \n     irradiation--the food that goes into space with our \n     astronauts is irradiated.\n       I've talked about bad past decisions that haunt us today. \n     Now I want to talk about decisions we need to make today.\n       The President has outlined a program to stabilize the U.S. \n     production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at \n     1990 levels by some time between 2008 and 2012. \n     Unfortunately, the President's goals are not achievable \n     without seriously impacting our economy.\n       Our national laboratories have studied the issue. Their \n     report indicates that to get to the President's goals we \n     would have to impose a $50/ton carbon tax. That would result \n     in an increase of 12.5 cents/gallon for gas and 1.5 cents/\n     kilowatt-hour for electricity--almost a doubling of the \n     current cost of coal or natural gas-generated electricity.\n       What the President should have said is that we need nuclear \n     energy to meet his goal. After all, in 1996, nuclear power \n     plants prevented the emission of 147 million metric tons of \n     carbon, 2.5 million tons of nitrogen oxides, and 5 million \n     tons of sulfur dioxide. Our electric utilities' emissions of \n     those greenhouse gases were 25 percent lower than they would \n     have been if fossil fuels had been used instead of nuclear \n     energy.\n       Ironically, the technology we are relying on to achieve \n     these results is over twenty years old. We have developed the \n     next generation of nuclear power plants--which have\n\n[[Page S7438]]\n\n     been certified by the NRC and are now being sold overseas. \n     They are even safer than our current models. Better yet, we \n     have technologies under development like passively safe \n     reactors, lead-bismuth reactors, and advanced liquid metal \n     reactors that generate less waste and are proliferation \n     resistant.\n       An excellent report by Dr. John Holdren for the President's \n     Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, calls for a \n     sharply enhanced national effort. It urges a ``properly \n     focused R&D effort to see if the problems plaguing fission \n     energy can be overcome--economics, safety, waste, and \n     proliferation.'' I have long urged the conclusion of this \n     report--that we dramatically increase spending in these areas \n     for reasons ranging from reactor safety to non-proliferation.\n       I have not overlooked that nuclear waste issues loom as a \n     roadblock to increased nuclear utilization. I will return to \n     that subject.\n       For now, let me turn from nuclear power to nuclear weapons \n     issues.\n       Our current stockpile is set by bilateral agreements with \n     Russia. Bilateral agreements make sense if we are certain who \n     our future nuclear adversary will be and are useful to force \n     a transparent build-down within Russia. But I will warn you \n     that our next nuclear adversary may not be Russia--we do not \n     want to find ourselves limited by a treaty with Russia in a \n     conflict with another entity.\n       We need to decide what stockpile levels we really need for \n     our own best interests to deal with any future adversary.\n       For that reason, I suggest that, within the limits imposed \n     by START II, the United States move away from further treaty \n     imposed limitations and move to what I call a ``threat-based \n     stockpile.''\n       Based upon the threat I perceive right now, I think our \n     stockpile could be reduced. We need to challenge our military \n     planners to identify the minimum necessary stockpile size.\n       At the same time, as our stockpile is reduced and we are \n     precluded from testing, we have to increase our confidence in \n     the integrity of the remaining stockpile and our ability \n     to reconstitute if the threat changes. Programs like \n     science-based stockpile stewardship must be nurtured and \n     supported carefully.\n       As we seriously review stockpile size, we should also \n     consider stepping back from the nuclear cliff by de-alerting \n     and carefully reexamining the necessity of the ground-based \n     log of the nuclear triad.\n       Costs certainly aren't the primary driver for our stockpile \n     size, but if some of the actions I've discussed were taken, \n     I'b bet that as a bonus we'd see major budget savings. Now we \n     spend about $30 billion each year supporting the triad.\n       Earlier I discussed the need to revisit some incorrect \n     premises that caused us to make bad decisions in the past. I \n     said that one of them, regarding reprocessing and MOX fuel, \n     is ham-stringing our efforts to permanently dismantle nuclear \n     weapons.\n       The dismantlement of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons \n     in Russia and the United States has left both countries with \n     large inventories of perfectly machined classified components \n     that could allow each country to rapidly rebuild its nuclear \n     arsenals.\n       Both countries should set a goal of converting those excess \n     inventories into non-weapon shapes as quickly as possible. \n     The more permanent those transformations and the more \n     verification that can accompany the conversion of that \n     material, the better.\n       Technical solutions exist. Pits can be transformed into \n     non-weapons shapes and weapon material can be burned in \n     reactors as MOX fuel, which by the way is what the National \n     Academy of Sciences has recommended. However, the proposal to \n     dispose of weapons plutonium as MOX runs into that old \n     premise that MOX is bad despite its widespread use by our \n     allies.\n       MOX is the best technical solution. I challenge you to \n     develop a proposal that brings the economics of the MOX fuel \n     cycle together with the need to dispose of weapons grade \n     plutonium. Ideally, incentives can be developed to speed \n     Russians materials conversion while reducing the cost of the \n     U.S. effort. The idea for the U.S. Russian HEU Agreement \n     originated at MIT, and I know that Harvard does not like to \n     be upstaged.\n       I said earlier that I would not advocate increased use of \n     nuclear and ignore the nuclear waste problem. The path we've \n     been following on Yucca Mountain sure isn't leading anywhere \n     very fast. I'm about ready to reexamine the whole premise for \n     Yucca Mountain.\n       We're on a course to bury all our spent nuclear fuel, \n     despite the fact that a spent nuclear fuel rod still has 60-\n     75% of its energy content--and despite the fact that \n     Nevadeans need to be convinced that the material will not \n     create a hazard for over 100,000 years.\n       Our decision to ban reprocessing forced us to a repository \n     solution. Meanwhile, many other nations think it is dumb to \n     just bury the energy-rich spent fuel and are reprocessing.\n       I propose we go somewhere between reprocessing and \n     permanent disposal by using interim storage to keep our \n     options open. Incidentally, 65 Senators agreed with the \n     important of interim storage, but the Administration has only \n     threatened to veto any such progress and has shown no \n     willingness to discuss alternatives.\n       Let me highlight one attractive option. A group from \n     several of our largest companies, using technologies \n     developed at three of our national laboratories and from \n     Russian institutes and their nuclear navy, discussed with me \n     an approach to use that waste for electrical generation. They \n     use an accelerator, not a reactor, so there is never any \n     critical assembly. There is minimal processing, but carefully \n     done so that weapons-grade materials are never separated out \n     and so that international verification can be used. And when \n     they get done, only a little material goes into a \n     repository--but now the half lives are changed so that it's a \n     hazard for perhaps 300 years a far cry from 100,000 years. It \n     sure would be easier to get acceptance of a 300 year, rather \n     than a 100,000 year, hazard, especially when the 300 year \n     case is also providing a source of clean electricity. This \n     approach, called Accelerator Transmutation of Waste, is an \n     area I want to see investigated aggressively.\n       I still haven't touched on all the issues imbedded in \n     maximizing our nation's benefit from nuclear technologies, \n     and I can't do that without a much longer speech.\n       For example, I haven't discussed the increasingly desperate \n     need in the country for low level waste facilities like Ward \n     Valley in California. In California, important medical and \n     research procedures are at risk because the Administration \n     continues to block the State government from fulfilling their \n     responsibilities to care for low level waste.\n       And I haven't touched on the tremendous window of \n     opportunity that we now have in the Former Soviet Union to \n     expand programs that protect fissile material from moving \n     onto the black market or to shift the activities of former \n     Soviet weapons scientists onto commercial projects. Along \n     with Senators Nunn and Lugar, I've led the charge for these \n     programs. Those are programs a foreign aid, I believe they \n     are sadly mistaken.\n       We are realizing some of the benefits of nuclear \n     technologies today, but only a fraction of what we could \n     realize--\n       Nuclear weapons, for all their horror, brought to an end 50 \n     years of world-wide wars in which 60 million people died.\n       Nuclear power is providing about 20% of our electricity \n     needs now and many of our citizens enjoy healthier longer \n     lives through improved medical procedures that depend on \n     nuclear process.\n       But we aren't tapping the full potential of the nucleus for \n     additional benefits. In the process, we are short-changing \n     our citizens.\n       I hope in these remarks that I have succeeded in raising \n     your awareness of the opportunities that our nation should be \n     seizing to secure a better future for our citizens through \n     careful reevaluation of many ill-conceived fears, policies \n     and decisions that have seriously constrained our use of \n     nuclear technologies.\n       Today I announce my intention to lead a new dialogue with \n     serious discussion about the full range of nuclear \n     technologies. I intend to provide national leadership to \n     overcome barriers.\n       While some may continue to lament that the nuclear genie is \n     out of his proverbial bottle, I'm ready to focus on \n     harnessing that genie as effectively and fully as possible, \n     for the largest set of benefits for our citizens.\n       I challenge all of you to join me in this dialogue to help \n     secure these benefits.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers and the two sponsors of the \namendment, the Wyden-Sununu amendment, agreed that I ask for this \nunanimous consent, and I will do so: That on Tuesday, when the Senate \nconsiders the Wyden-Sununu amendment relating to commercial nuclear \nplants, there be 120 minutes equally divided in the usual form; \nprovided further that no amendments to the amendment or the language \nproposed to be stricken be in order prior to the vote in relation to \nthe amendment; and if the amendment is not disposed of, the amendment \nremain debatable and amendable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We are also very close to working something out on the \nmatter that has been holding up the Energy bill today, and that is the \nchild tax credit. We are within minutes of being able to enter into an \nagreement on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have arrived at a time and a defined \nperiod for debate on the Wyden amendment to subtitle B of this act. I \nthink it is critical that we bring this issue to the forefront and make \na decision on it.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Energy Committee, \nhas done an excellent job in the last 20 minutes outlining the dynamics \nof this major piece of legislation for our country and the kinds of \nissues embodied in it that are so critical to all of us as we debate \nthe general issue of energy and this particular subtitle that relates \nto\n\n[[Page S7439]]\n\nthe development of new technology but, more importantly, the deployment \nof the concept of new reactor design into actual producing reactors in \nthe United States. The Senator from New Mexico is so accurate in his \noverall review of where we are as a nation with energy or the absence \nthereof.\n  My colleague from Oregon and I live in the Pacific Northwest, where \nhydro is dominant as a part of our energy-producing capability. Even \nthat marvelous, clean resource today is under attack. Why? Because it \nimpounds rivers to produce hydro, and by impounding rivers, it changes \nthe character of those rivers. Certain interest groups want those \nrivers, in large part, by some estimation, to be freed. So they wanted \nto reshape hydro. In all instances, it has reduced the overall \nproductive capability of hydro facilities.\n  We have frustration in a variety of other areas. The Senator from New \nMexico outlined our problem with burning coal under the Clean Air Act, \nand the ambient air as a result of that, and the cost now being driven \nagainst retrofitting and new coal-burning designs to produce energy.\n  That is in part--not in total but in part--what has developed a \nwillingness on the part of our country, I believe, to renew our nuclear \noption and possibly to renew it under a new design concept, under a \npassive reactor design concept that the Senator from New Mexico has \ntalked about.\n  Passive reactor design means, simply, one that reacts on its own when \ncertain conditions arise. The human factor doesn't necessarily have to \nbe there to start throwing switches and making adjustments because \nthose kinds of things happen automatically. We believe our engineering \ntalent in this country is now capable of that kind of design \ndevelopment. In doing that design, we would couple with it an \nelectrolysis process that would make the reactor itself so much more \nefficient that it would run at peak load at all times, as reactors \nshould in performing best.\n  But power demand isn't always constant. When you can switch that load \nto development of hydrogen fuels, through the electrolysis process, and \nthen convert it back to use within a power grid, you make for \nphenomenal efficiencies and the cost of production goes down \ndramatically.\n  In doing that, in bringing back to this country an abundant source of \nelectrical energy and a reliable supply to our grid system--a system we \nare working to improve today through the development of regional \ntransmission authorities and a variety of other things that tie us \ntogether--we found out a few years ago in the Pacific Northwest that it \nhas certain liabilities. If the energy in the system itself in other \nparts of the grid isn't abundant, and it starts pulling power from us \nand forcing our power rates up, it can be a problem. Where it is \nproduced with an abundance in the system and the system is fully \ninterrelated and interconnected all can generally benefit.\n  As a result of bringing some of these new concepts on line, where we \nare actively subsidizing other areas of production, we thought it was \nreasonable to bring to the floor of the Senate a similar concept, to \ntake some of the risk out of new design development for the commercial \nside, and to do so in a way that our country has always done--to use \npublic resources to advance certain technological causes and, out of \nthose causes and their development, to generate phenomenal consumer \nbenefits.\n  There is no greater consumer benefit in this country today than \nreliable, high-quality electrical energy at reasonable prices. Our \nworld runs on it. Our world's wealth depends on it. This country's \nworkforce depends on it.\n  What we have brought to the floor in this Energy bill is not a hunt \nand a pick. It is not a political decision versus another political \ndecision. That is not the case. It is not green versus nongreen. That \nis not the case.\n  What the chairman of the Energy Committee has said in this bill, and \nwhat the committee itself has said, is that all energy is good energy \nas long as it meets certain standards, and as long as it fits within \nour environmental context, we ought to promote it and we ought to \nadvance it.\n  That is exactly what this bill does. As the Senator from New Mexico \ncharacterized it a few moments ago, we have enough credit in this bill \nto put windmills about anywhere they want to go, or are allowed to go, \nto produce energy.\n  Some would say that is great, we don't need anything else.\n  Oh, yes, we do. The reason we do is you can put a windmill everywhere \nyou can in the air sheds that can produce wind energy, and you can only \nget up to about 2 percent of total demand. That is about it.\n\n  But we ought to do it because it is clean and it is renewable and it \nis the right thing to do. But what we are already finding out in my \nState of Idaho that has a couple of wind sheds that fit, if this bill \npasses, interest groups are stepping up and saying: Oh, I don't think \nwe want that windmill there; that is a spike-tail grouse habitat; there \nare some Indian artifacts there and we certainly don't want them \ndamaged. And we don't.\n  What I am suggesting is in these most desirable of wind sheds for \nwindmills, there is going to be somebody stepping up and saying ``not \nhere.'' And they are right. They probably won't go there.\n  That is public land, by the way, not private land. On some private \nland, the same argument will occur. Simply, they don't want in their \nbackyard a machine that goes whomp, whomp, whomp and produces \nelectricity. Something about the sound disturbs their sleep. As a \nresult, my guess is some city ordinance will soon suggest, ``not in my \nbackyard.''\n  But there are some backyards where we can put wind machines and we \nwill and we already have and we ought to promote it and we ought not to \nbe selective, and we are subsidizing them by a tax credit. You bet we \nare.\n  We are going to pass that provision. That is the right and the \nappropriate thing to do.\n  We have subsidized in most instances, in one form or another, through \na tax credit or through an easing of regulation or through the ability \nto site on Federal lands, energy projects, historically, because our \ncountry, our Government, this Senate for well over 100 years has said: \nThe best thing we can do for this country to make it grow, to make it \nprosper, and to make it abundant to the working men and women of \nAmerica is a reasonable and available energy supply in whatever form \nthe marketplace takes.\n  We also know we can shape the market a bit by a subsidy, by a tax \ncredit, and we also do that.\n  We are going to do some wind. We are going to do some solar in here. \nWe hope we do clean coal technology. Certainly the coal-producing \nStates of our country want to keep producing coal, and they should. We \nshould use it, and we will.\n  There is a provision in here on which Senator Bingaman and I disagree \na little; that is, on the relicensing of hydro. We think it ought to be \nrelicensed and environmentally positive. When we can retrofit it and \nshape it, we ought to do so as we relicense it into the next century. \nBut hydro produces a nice chunk of power in this country today. We are \ngoing to relicense over 200 facilities in the next decade. That \nrepresents about 15 million American homes and 30 million megawatts of \npower. Any reduction in that productive capability means we have to \nproduce that power somewhere else.\n  Some of those old plants, when relicensed and retrofitted, may lose \nsome of their productive capability in the licensing process. We ought \nto have new supplies coming on line.\n  Several years ago, this Senate became involved in a very serious \ndebate over an issue that we call climate change. We became involved as \na nation internationally in this debate because we thought it was the \nright thing to do. We knew our global environment was heating, or \nappeared to be heating, faster than it had in the past, and we didn't \nknow why. Some argued it was the emission of greenhouse gases which \ncreated a greenhouse effect around our globe which was largely a \nproduct of the burning of hydrocarbons and that we ought to do \nsomething about it.\n  Many of us were very concerned that if we didn't have the right \nmodeling and the right measurement and the right facts to make those \ndecisions, we would shape public policy and head it in a direction that \nwas not appropriate and would allocate billions of dollars of\n\n[[Page S7440]]\n\nnew resources that might put tens of thousands of people out of work if \nwe did it wrong. At the same time, there has been and there remains a \nnagging concern as to the reality of this particular situation \nglobally, environmentally. Or is it simply the natural characteristic \nof the changing world and evolving changing world?\n  We have known down through geologic time that this world has heated \nand cooled and heated and cooled. Is it the natural cycle? We didn't \nknow that. But out of all of it, we generally grew to believe that the \nless emission into the atmosphere the better off we would be.\n  This bill embodies that general philosophy--that clean energy and \nclean fuels are better, that we ought to advance them, that we ought to \nsubsidize them where necessary, and that we ought to plot them through \nthe public policy which we debate here on the floor today. Out of all \nof that, we knew one thing: Energy generated by nuclear-fueled \ngenerating systems was clean with no emissions. It is the cleanest \nsource in the country other than hydro with no emissions.\n  As a result of that, there was no question that the popularity of \nthat consensus began to grow. Other nations around the world were using \nit. The senior Senator from New Mexico spoke of France and their use of \nit. Japan, a nation once very fearful of the atom, now builds almost a \nreactor a year coming on line to produce--what? Power for its citizens, \npower for its economy, and power for its workforce. We once led the \nworld in that technology. But we fell dramatically behind over the last \nthree decades because there was a public perception fueled by some and \nfeared by some that the nuclear-generating facilities of our country \nwere not safe. Yet they have this phenomenal history of safe operation.\n\n  Through the course of all of this, and as the facilities aged, as \nthey were relicensed and retrofitted, guess what happened over the \ncourse of the last few years. As we spiked in our power demands at the \npeak of the economy in the late 1990s and as electrical prices went \nthrough the roof, the cost of operating reactors was stable; it was \nconstant. They became the least cost producers of electricity of any \ngenerating capacity in the country other than existing hydro. The world \nbegan to react in a favorable way to that.\n  All of that became a part of the production of the legislation before \nus now--to once again get this great country back into the business of \nthe research and development of new reactor systems that not only are \nin every way perceived to be safer and cleaner in the sense of waste \nproduction at end of the game, but would do something else for our \ncountry in a way that we think is the right direction; that is, the \ndevelopment of hydrogen to fuel the next generation of surface \ntransportation and to start growing our economy into an age of \nhydrogen-fueled systems, fuel cells, generating electricity, turning \nthe wheels of automobiles, trucks, and other forms of transportation; \nand, on a case-by-case basis, the potential of a fuel cell to light a \nhome, to fuel and light a given industry by having one of those on \nlocation. We believe all of those things are possible.\n  What I hope is that the Senate will agree with us that it is now time \nto lead in all aspects of energy production in this country instead of \nnibbling around the edges selectively and politically determining what \nought to be and what ought not to be because one individual thinks this \nway is better than another.\n  I have dealt with the energy issue all of my political life. While at \none time I will honestly admit I was selective, I am no longer that. I \nsupport it all. I am voting for wind. I am voting for clean coal. I \nwant to develop a responsible relicensing system for hydro. I am \nsupporting nuclear development and nuclear growth. I am supporting oil \nproduction. Why? I don't want future generations of this country to be \nfuel-starved and victim to the politics of a region of the world which \nis unstable because this Senate didn't have the wisdom to produce when \nit could have and create incentives and maximum energy production for \nour country.\n  That is what this bill is about. The Senator from Oregon chooses to \nbe selective for a moment in time. I wish he wouldn't be. I understand \nwhy he is. I think he is wrong.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would be happy to yield in just a moment.\n  I think the Senator from Oregon is wrong on this issue. I think it is \na form of selectivity as it relates to our willingness as a country to \nuse public resources in the advancement of all forms of energy \nresources as the kind that is offered by the committee to, once a new \nreactor design is developed, allow for loan guarantees to guarantee up \nto about 8,400 megawatts of electrical development through nuclear \nreactor construction.\n  I would be happy to yield to my colleague from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my good friend for yielding. I listened patiently \nto him and to the chairman of the committee raising the concern that in \nsome way the opponents of the subsidies are engaging in scare tactics, \nred herrings, and the like. This is not a red herring. This is a dollar \nand cents issue.\n  I was curious whether the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho was \naware that the Congressional Budget Office ``considers the risk of \ndefault on such a loan guarantee to be very high, well over 50 \npercent.''\n  Is the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho aware of that? I would \nbe curious about his reaction because to me--and as the Senator from \nNew Mexico said--this is about risk. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas given us an objective, nonpartisan assessment of risk here. They \nconsider ``the risk of default on such a loan guarantee to be very \nhigh, well over 50 percent''--coupled with the Congressional Research \nService memo indicating the exposure is $16 billion. Is the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho aware of that? I would be curious what \nthe distinguished Senator's reaction to that is.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for bringing up that \nissue. There are red herrings. Maybe some of them are blue and some of \nthem are green, as we debate these issues. I don't know what a red \nherring really is here.\n  I do know that when you sit a group of economists or accountants down \nand say, project backwards over the last 20 years or 30 years as it \nrelates to the cost of developing nuclear reactors, and/or their \nfailure--and out in the Pacific Northwest we had some that were funded \nand then brought down because the economy and the politics would not \naccept them--if you do that, you might get to a 50-percent risk factor.\n  If you project forward to a new concept design that is under a new \nNuclear Regulatory Commission licensing process that meets the demand \nof the electrical systems, that is a cleaner process, that drives down \nthe cost--and my colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico talked \nabout the new concepts in Taiwan; one of them may well be built here--\nmy guess is they did not factor that in. Because those are all things \nyou and I, as Senators, will insist upon and do over the next decade, \nand that when we do that, the risk factors come down dramatically.\n  But this is what the Senator from Oregon and I need to look at. You \ncame to the Congress how many years ago?\n  Mr. WYDEN. We were both young; in 1980.\n  Mr. CRAIG. In 1980. In 1980, the United States was about 35-percent \ndependent on foreign hydrocarbons, foreign oil. Now, there were some \nfolks out there saying: Boy, if we don't get busy here, we could \nsomeday be 40-percent dependent.\n  Well, they were right. We did not get busy. In fact, we increasingly \nrestricted the ability to refine and the ability to discover and the \nability to produce, and by 1984 or 1985, we were at 45 percent. And \nthat kept going on.\n  What is the risk factor there? We know what the risk factor is. The \nrisk factor is, we did not do anything and we are now over 50-percent \ndependent, and in some instances as high as 65 percent, give or take, \ndependent on foreign oil sources.\n  You see what has happened at the pump. I don't know what you or I \nwere paying for gas in 1980 but it was well under $1 a gallon. Now we \nare paying $1.55, $1.60 a gallon for regular fuel. The average \nhousehold is spending a great deal more on energy today than it did in \n1980. We did not develop a policy. We did quite the opposite. We began \nto restrict the ability to produce, whether or not it was hydrocarbons.\n\n[[Page S7441]]\n\n  We have not brought on line a nuclear reactor, fire-generating system \nfor the purpose of electrical production in the last 10 or 12 years. \nOne got started under construction, and, of course, as we know in the \nPacific Northwest, we actually stopped construction on some.\n  Are there risks? You bet. There is no zero-sum game here. There isn't \nanything you or I could possibly legislate. But there is a reality; the \nreality is that energy prices in Oregon shot through the roof in the \nlast 3 years and the energy prices in Idaho went up dramatically. The \ncost of living in the State of Oregon and the economy of the State of \nOregon reeled under the hit, as is true of the State of Idaho. I am \nnot, anymore, going to stand here and be selective on the production of \nand the future opportunity to produce energy for this country because I \nwant to get your State's economy moving and my State's economy moving.\n  (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for yet another question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague.\n  Again, the Senator from Idaho has been critical of the Congressional \nBudget Office report, saying that perhaps they did not look forward; \nthey just looked backward. I would urge my colleagues to look at the \nreport because the report does, in fact, look to 2011 and the future, \nand that is what the Congressional Budget Office did make their \njudgment on, where they said there was a risk of default that was well \nover 50 percent.\n  But my question to my colleague is whether my colleague thinks it is \nrelevant about who assumes risk with respect to energy production. \nBecause he is absolutely right, there are no foolproof guarantees in \nlife. There is no question there is risk. Here, however, I see the \ntaxpayer being at risk. The taxpayer is on the hook for $16 billion.\n  I thought it was interesting that the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee talked about the credits for production.\n  Well, the fact is, when you get a credit for production, the producer \nis largely at risk because in order to get the break, you have to \nproduce something. There is no tax credit, I say to my colleagues, for \nfailing to produce a successful wind venture. You get the credit if \nyour wind venture is successful.\n  My understanding is that here, with the subsidy, the person who \nassumes the risk is the taxpayer, not the producer. I was wondering if \nthe distinguished Senator from Idaho thinks it is relevant with respect \nto who takes the risk. This Senator does because the taxpayer is on the \nhook rather than those who produce. I am curious of the reaction of the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am pleased the Senator brought this issue forward \nbecause you and I live in an environment in the Pacific Northwest that \nwas substantially subsidized by American taxpayers to produce a massive \nelectrical system known as the Bonneville Power Administration--direct \nappropriations of hundreds of millions of dollars to build a hydro \nsystem in the Snake and Columbia watersheds and in other places. These \nwere not loan guarantees. They were just outright expenditures to be \npaid back. They have been paid back over a long period of time, and we \nare continuing to pay them back.\n  So the American taxpayer, to our benefit, has always been on the hook \nin the Pacific Northwest for the production of energy. In fact, you and \nI worked to just get some borrowing capability for Bonneville to expand \nits transmission system--a big chunk of money. We fought for that, and \nwe should have. Why? Because it will generally benefit the Pacific \nNorthwest. It is not a loan guarantee. It is an outright appropriation \nto be paid back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to comment on what the distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Wyden, just raised, and say to my good friend, the \nCongressional Budget Office is wrong almost every way it turns.\n  First, it uses forecast figures on plant costs of $2,300 per \nkilowatt. The right number is $1,250 per kilowatt. How do I know? There \nare two being built in Taiwan right now that General Electric \ndesigned--brand spanking new. They came to our office. I don't know if \nthey had time to come and see you, I say to the Senator, but they \nbrought with them their experts and told us those plants will cost not \n$2,300 per kilowatt but, rather, $1,250 per kilowatt. That is about \nhalf, as this Senator sees it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So they are half wrong right up front in terms of their \nassessment.\n  Furthermore, the bill itself says that if this section that is being \ndebated is ever used, the Secretary will evaluate the creditworthiness \nof any new project under this program. So they are already wrong by \nhalf on the cost.\n  Then I would ask, Does the Congressional Budget Office really believe \nthe Secretary will approve a significant risk? If he approves a \nsignificant risk, he would be in violation--direct conflict--of the law \nthat we are discussing that he would be acting on that the CBO assumes \nwill cost this extraordinary amount and impose this extraordinary risk.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments and his responses. I am quite \nsure the Congressional Budget Office, as this Senator knows--I have \nonly worked with it for the sum total of 26 years on all kinds of \nissues--I believe there is no subject they are more wrong on than their \nestimates of the cost of matters nuclear. First of all, they assume \nthat everything that has gone wrong in the past is going to go wrong \nagain, while the world is out there proving that such is not the case, \nwhile we are saying only under very limited circumstances would you \never use these sections to begin with, which would eliminate part of \ntheir reasoning, which would just leave the scene and would not even be \napplicable as they attempt to make the risk estimate.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the full Energy \nCommittee and the primary author of this legislation for making what \nare extremely important clarifying points in relation to the Wyden \namendment that would strike this provision of subtitle (b) as it \nrelates to the deployment of new nuclear plants.\n  In another life, I once studied real estate and had a real estate \nlicense. I know when you try to assess the value of a piece of \nproperty, you do what is called a comparable appraisal. You find other \nproperties that are comparable in size, productive capability, if it is \na house in square footage, in age, in all of those features. You say \nthat in the marketplace, this house is worth about so much because the \ncomparables, one that has recently sold that is like it or near like \nit, cost about this much.\n  When it comes to our ability to project the cost of a nuclear \npowerplant in construction in 2011, there are no U.S. comparables. We \nare talking about all kinds of new things. We are talking about a new \ndesign, a GEN-IV passive reactor design. What size are we talking \nabout, 600-, 800-, 1,000-megawatt plant? Under what kind of regulatory \nauthority? Has the license been developed and what are the \npeculiarities, the particulars, the specifications within the license? \nWe don't know that. You cannot effectively project.\n  What you can do is exactly what this subtitle does. It gives the \nSecretary of Energy authority to examine, to make a determination based \non fixed criteria that we have placed in the law to protect the public \nresource. We are going to make the assumption in 2011 that the \nSecretary of Energy and his or her staff are bright, talented, clear-\nthinking people who will have to operate under the law. The reason they \nwill have to operate under the law? Because if this is a loan \nguarantee, it becomes a part of their budget, it becomes scored, and \nthe Congress of the United States has to appropriate the money or at \nleast offset it because it is a guarantee in the market.\n  That is how it works. I am not going to be here then, more than \nlikely, and others of my colleagues will not. But we will have written \ninto law the right kind of public policy to protect the citizens' \nresource, his or her tax money. So the ultimate question is, Does this \nportion of the title as it relates to nuclear energy fit for the \nfuture? Is it the way we get this industry started again, obviously \ndealing with the provision in the law that creates a liability shield \nas it relates to Price\n\n[[Page S7442]]\n\nAnderson, as a new design concept that we think is the right design, \nthe safer design, the cleaner design, the more efficient design, and \nthe reality of a future energy source? And have we created the right \nincentive to move us into the production of electricity from nuclear-\nfueled powerplants of the future?\n\n  That is what this subtitle is all about. That is why it is important. \nI don't know that the detail of it has been written, or I should say \nread or understood specifically. It is very clear. It is very short. \nThe requirements are particularly important. Let me read them:\n  Subsection (b), Requirements:\n\n       Approved criteria for financial assistance shall include \n     the creditworthiness of the project--\n\n  that is, the responsibility of the Secretary and his or her team to \nmake those determinations--\n\n     the extent to which financial assistance would encourage \n     public-private partnerships and attract private sector \n     investment, the likelihood that financial assistance would \n     hasten commencement of the project, and any other criteria \n     the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate.\n\n  That is a totally open-ended clause that says the Secretary can, in \nfact, develop more findings if necessary to protect the safety and the \nsecurity of this kind of loan guarantee.\n\n       The Secretary, under the confidentiality provision, shall \n     protect the confidentiality of any information that is \n     certified by the project developer to be commercially \n     sensitive. The full faith and credit of all financial \n     assistance provided by the Secretary under this subtitle \n     shall be a guaranteed obligation of the United States backed \n     by its full faith and credit.\n\n  That is fairly boilerplate language. What that says is very clear. If \nthe Secretary makes that determination, that becomes a part of a \ndecision that the Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee in \nthe Senate then deal with. This is not locking in the money. This is \nsimply authorizing the ability of the Secretary in the future to move \nin a direction that the Congress can make a decision on. That is what \nthis provision is all about.\n  I believe, we believe, and that is why the Energy Committee in a \nbipartisan way brought this to the floor for the whole Senate's \nconsideration, because we think it is the right thing to do. It is the \nright thing to look forward, not just a year from now or 2 but 30 and \n40 and 50 years from now and say that we have developed a public policy \nthat will produce the kind of energy that a growing, expanding U.S. \neconomy needs, that it is of high quality, and that it fuels our \nfactories, lights our homes, cools our homes, and in the new age of \ntechnology it keeps the Internet humming, by then probably such a \nwireless communication system that it keeps, if you will, cyberspace \nvibrating.\n  A couple of years ago I had the opportunity to visit China, a huge \nnation, a nation that is expanding by leaps and bounds, a nation that \nis pushing all sides of development and technology. My wife and I had \nthe opportunity to stay in a beautiful hotel in Shanghai, a state-of-\nthe-art hotel. In this city of Washington, DC, it would probably be \ncalled at least a four-star hotel, absolutely a marvelous facility. \nWhen we got to our room, the finest of facilities, there were all kinds \nof places to plug in your computer. It was wired for the state of the \nart. But it had a problem. The power kept going out. The lights kept \nblinking. The air-conditioning kept shutting off and turning on.\n  The problem that beautiful, new, state-of-the-art hotel had that made \nit nearly impossible to plug your computer in and go online and, with \nyour e-mail, talk to the United States is that China doesn't have a \npower grid.\n  China doesn't have adequate electrical power. China has developed its \nelectrical resources on a city-by-city, county-by-county basis. They \nare now striving ahead at a phenomenal cost to create a national power \ngrid to tie themselves together because they know that to compete with \nus, to put their people to work, and to hopefully some day generate a \nlifestyle comparable to ours, and an economy comparable to ours, they \nhave to have a power system that is reliable, stable, productive, and \nthat is connected.\n  No matter how beautiful the building, no matter how high-tech the \nfacility, if it is not turned on, if it is not wired in, if it is not \nlit up, it doesn't work. Boy, have we learned that in this country. \nCalifornia has learned that in the last couple of years.\n  If all goes well, I am going to be in the heart of the Silicon Valley \non Saturday. I will tell you what the conversation is going to be about \nwith some of the high-tech producers down there: Is the Energy bill \ngoing to pass? Are you going to get us back into the business of \nproducing energy? We are large consumers of it and we need a high-\nquality, stable supply of energy that doesn't blink, shut off, or put \nour production at risk. If you are building chips in a high-tech \nfactory today, known as a FAB, and the power blinks, you lose the whole \nproduction. You may lose millions of dollars in a blink of the power \nconnection. So high-quality, stable power is extremely valuable, and if \nit is not priced right, if it is not competitive, and somewhere else in \nthe world they can provide that high-quality power that is priced \ndifferently and in the competitive market, the great tragedy of our \neconomy today in a world environment is that the chips will go \nelsewhere.\n  That is one of many examples that can be used. That is why, finally, \nwhen President George W. Bush was elected and came to town, his first \npriority, among so many, was to assign the Vice President to assemble \nas many bright thinkers in the energy field as he could and to produce \nfor us, the Congress, a challenge--a national energy policy and a list \nof criteria that we ought to develop in the form of public policy for \nthis country. There were well over a hundred points in that proposal. \nTwo-thirds of them have already been implemented by rule and regulation \nby the Secretary of Energy and other agencies of our Government to get \nthis country back on line and producing energy. But about 30 percent of \nthem, or 30-plus, are not. They have to be legislated. It requires new \npublic policy to fully implement what our President envisions as a \nnational priority, what America envisions as a national priority, and \nwhat I trust the Senate of the United States clearly understands to be \na national priority.\n  We tried mightily in the last year or so. The politics, for a variety \nof reasons, would not allow us to get there. There are factors not in \nthis bill today that were in the bill of a year ago that are highly \ncontroversial. There are some changes in this bill. But it was crafted \nin the committee of authorization. It was voted on piece by piece. It \ndoes have a new bipartisan base of support, and we believe it is the \nkind of energy policy on which we can work out our differences with the \nHouse and put on the President's desk and two decades from now look \nback and say we did the right thing for our country, the right thing \nfor young people today who will be in that labor force 10, 15 years \nfrom now, who will demand and require an abundant supply of high-\nquality energy that is environmentally sound and at a reasonable price \nfor their homes, for their recreation, but, most importantly, for their \nwork site, for the job they are going to seek. That is why this \nlegislation is so important.\n\n  We may differ and we are going to have more amendments to come, but I \nhope our leader and the minority leader recognize the high priority we \nhave here and give us the time to debate this thoroughly and \nresponsibly and deal with all of the amendments that are necessary to \nget us to that point where we can vote up or down and let the American \npeople clearly understand that the Senate of the United States does \nsupport a national energy policy, and that the one we have, in the form \nof S. 14, is a quantum leap forward into America's future of an \nabundant energy and a robust economy.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senate will be in order. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is still not in order. It is a \ncomplicated amendment. I would like to be able to explain it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 90 seconds I want to tell you why this \namendment is so important. I offer it on behalf of myself and Senator \nDurbin, a strong supporter of ethanol, Senators Leahy, Feinstein, \nClinton, Jeffords, and Lautenberg.\n  My amendment simply removes the safe harbor provision in the bill, \nwhich treats ethanol like no other fuel, giving consumers and \ncommunities no legal recourse if it turns out that the water is \npolluted or the air is polluted or people get sick from this increased \namount of ethanol. Believe me, I hope ethanol is totally safe. But no \none is sure. Just read the 1999 blue ribbon EPA panel. They raise some \nserious questions. Of course, the ethanol manufacturers say ethanol is \n100 percent completely safe. Then I ask why they demand this safe \nharbor provision. Look at what happened to the last gasoline additive \nwe promoted, MTBE. This is the cost to our people because of MTBE \npollution: $29 billion. My friends, if we had had the same safe harbor \nfor MTBE as some of us are seeking for ethanol, this would not have \nfallen completely on your taxpayers and your communities. I call this \nan unfunded mandate.\n\n  People who oppose this say they only are putting forward a very \nnarrow safe harbor. They say everyone will have a lot of ways to go. \nBut the truth is that defective product liability is the only remedy. \nThe courts have said no to negligence and no to nuisance. The only \nclaim they have is defective product liability.\n  All we do is say treat ethanol as we do any other additive.\n  I urge an aye vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, what we are doing here is not giving our \nstamp of approval on ethanol. We are not mandating. The vast majority \nof Members here feel more strongly about this than I do.\n  I know the Senator from California would not deliberately mislead \nyou. What she is saying is just flat wrong.\n  I keep hearing it over and over again: If a safe harbor provision is \nenacted into law, No. 1, citizens will not be able to take refiners to \ncourt under our court system; and, No. 2, any possible ethanol \ncontamination that happens in the future wouldn't get cleaned up.\n  It just isn't true. Even with the enactment of the safe harbor \nprovisions, if a plaintiff makes his case--that is a very significant \npart of this--there are just a few court theories that could be used in \nenvironmental cases: Trespass, not affected by safe harbor; nuisance, \nnot affected by safe harbor; negligence, not affected by safe harbor; \nbreach of implied warrant, not affected by safe harbor; breach of \nexpress warranty, not affected by safe harbor.\n  As far as cleanups are concerned, if there were a spill, here are \nsome examples of environmental laws that are on the books right now \nthat would take care of the problem and are not affected by safe \nharbor: No. 1, Resource Conservation Recovery; No. 2, Clean Water Act; \nNo. 3, Oil Pollution Act; No. 4, Superfund; and it goes on and on.\n  Neither of these assertions is true. They would be able to have their \nday in court, and at the same time we have adequate laws in the court \nsystem and environmental laws to accommodate any cleanup that would \ntake place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment. The yeas and nays were \npreviously ordered on the amendment, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 854\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided before \na vote on the second Boxer amendment.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the Boxer-Lugar-\nCantwell amendment, which encourages production of agricultural residue \nethanol, is going to be accepted by a voice vote with a promise to \nfight for it in conference.\n  Our amendment says that if you produce ethanol from the residue of \nagricultural crops, you get a special incentive. So if your State grows \ncorn, rice, sugar, apples, wheat, oats, barley, and other crops high in \nfructose, this amendment would help your farmers, your rural \ncommunities, and your States meet the ethanol mandate. Again, it simply \ngives an incentive to produce ethanol from agricultural residue.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \naccepting the amendment. I am happy to take it by voice vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 854) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered \nby the majority and minority leaders, Mr. Frist and Mr. Daschle, on \nrenewable motor fuels. Others may support this amendment for different \nreasons, but I support the amendment because of its potential to \nincrease motor fuels supply, especially in the Federal reformulated \nfuels, or RFG, program. This amendment includes provisions that I, and \nmy Wisconsin House colleagues, Congressman Paul Ryan and Mark Green, \nhave long advocated to address supply shortages that the Midwest has \nexperienced in recent years.\n  This amendment makes significant changes to the Clean Air Act motor \nfuels programs that will increase the supply of cleaner fuels \nnationwide. It bans methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, which is no \nlonger used in my home State of Wisconsin. MTBE, as others will likely \ndiscuss in detail, is a reformulated gasoline additive that has \ncontaminated drinking water supplies nationwide.\n  The amendment also contains a mandate to increase the supply of \nethanol to 5 billion barrels by 2012 both to replace MTBE as an \noxygenate in reformulated gasoline and to reduce our dependence upon \nforeign oil. It also would allow Governors the ability to increase \nreformulated gasoline supply by opting their entire State into the \nreformulated fuels program, and increasing the market demand for RFG in \ntheir State.\n  The amendment also has a provision to increase the amount of \nreformulated gasoline by reducing the number of boutique fuel blends. \nThe bill reduces the number of Federal reformulated fuel blends by \ncreating a single set of standards. This would broaden the supply from \nwhich Wisconsin could draw in times of tight supply.\n  If enacted, this amendment would improve fungibility of RFG \nnationwide, by standardizing volatile organic compound, VOC, reduction \nrequirements. In practice, when combined with the renewable fuels \nmandate, this would enable States like Wisconsin that use Federal RFG \nto draw on supplies of Federal RFG from other areas, such as St. Louis \nand Detroit, if necessary. The ability to rely on other sources of RFG \nis especially important when sudden supply shortages arise due to \nunexpected events such as refinery fires or breakdowns which the \nMidwest has also experienced in recent years.\n  This amendment is important because, at present, southeastern \nWisconsin cannot draw on RFG from other areas because the Chicago/\nWisconsin RFG formula is not used elsewhere in the country. This \namendment would help address this boutique fuel problem by bringing \nother areas that use Federal RFG in line and standardizing VOC \nreduction requirements and requirements for the production of renewable \nfuels such as ethanol--the Chicago/Wisconsin area is the only part of \nthe country that uses solely ethanol in its blend of RFG.\n  As the use of ethanol blended RFG becomes more widespread, supply \nproblems will become easier to address. This benefits Wisconsin drivers \nbecause easing supply shortages will help put an end to severe price \nspikes, and drivers nationwide by continuing to supply them with RFG \nthat meets Federal Clean Air Act standards in light of State bans on \nMTBE.\n  So far, Mr. President, in light of military conflict in the Middle \nEast, we have been lucky that we have avoided significant increases in \ngas prices so far this year. But, for folks in Wisconsin, the thought \nof another approaching summer unfortunately dredges up memories of the \nhigh gas prices that have plagued our families in recent years. The \nSenate must take preventative action today to make sure gas prices stay \nunder control, and our this amendment will help do that. By scrapping \nthe multiple Federal fuel blend requirements and replacing them with a \nmore simplified, streamlined system, this measure will work to make gas \nsupplies more stable and keep prices at the pump within reason. This is \na good amendment, and it deserves the support of the Senate.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \naddress the Frist-Daschle amendment and the Energy bill in general.\n  Now, do I think there is a way to soundly and responsibly increase \nour use of alternative fuels? Sure. Do I think that we should increase \nour use of alternative fuels? You bet. I am just not convinced that the \nprovision we are considering today is the best way to make that happen. \nAnd I am not convinced that it is the best way to make that happen for \na State such as New York.\n  I think that an Energy bill has the potential to be a win for us not \njust on energy and the environment but also on economic development and \njob creation. An Energy bill could truly be an engine for developing \nnew technologies, manufacturing new products, building new facilities, \nand with all of that--creating new jobs, while at the same time \nincreasing our energy security and improving the quality of our \nenvironment.\n  I commend my colleagues Senators Domenici and Bingaman, for their \nefforts in bringing this bill to the floor. They have worked arduously \nto tackle many complicated and controversial issues.\n  But with all due respect to my colleagues, in many cases, I am afraid \nthat this bill unfortunately still falls far short--in terms of energy \npolicy, environmental policy, and economic policy. We need a \ncomprehensive and balanced energy policy that strengthens our energy \nsecurity, safeguards consumers, protects the environment, spurs \neconomic development, and create jobs.\n  Yet this bill does not truly harness our potential for greater energy \nefficiency and for newer, cleaner sources of energy. It too often looks \nto the past to try to solve the energy challenges of the present and \nturns a blind eye to all that our energy future could be.\n  For example, it looks to possible oil and gas resources on the Outer \nContinental Shelf--areas of the ocean that have been under drilling \nmoratoria for years in an effort to preserve precious ocean and coastal \nresources and the coastal tourism economies of a number of our States.\n  It also apparently requires an inventory of oil and gas resources on \nFederal lands, as well as an inventory of restrictions or impediments \nto development of those resources. Now my colleagues in New York and I \nhave been fighting for years to protect the Finger Lakes National \nForest from drilling, and so I have a difficult time with provisions \nlike this.\n  The bill permanently extends the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory\n\n[[Page S7445]]\n\nCommission to indemnify nuclear powerplants against liability for \nnuclear accidents under the Price-Anderson Act, and provides other \nsubstantial subsidies to the nuclear power industry. Yet the bill does \nnot do enough to increase the diversity of our energy supply, which \nwould also create new business and economic growth opportunities.\n  I am pleased that the bill contains provisions related to the \nincreased use of fuel cells and hydrogen fuel because this is a key \nexample of how we can be working to increase our energy security, while \nalso improving the environment and creating jobs. And it is places like \nUpstate New York, where we have many companies and universities doing \nexciting work in this area, which will emerge as world leaders in his \ntechnology. That is why I have joined with Senator Dorgan, Senator \nLieberman, and others in supporting legislation that would go even \nfurther than the bill we are currently debating in supporting fuel \ncells. And that is in part why, when we debated the renewable fuel \nprovisions in the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, \nSenator Boxer and I fought to include provisions that would provide \nFederal support for the construction of waste-to-ethanol plants and \nother cellulosic biomass ethanol production facilities.\n  Because these projects would help States such as ours produce more \nrenewable fuel--produce fuel from waste products, which would therefore \nalso help the environment--and at the same time produce more jobs as \nwell.\n  We are grateful for the committee's support for our amendments, and \nwe are pleased that these provisions remain in the amendment that is \nbefore us today.\n  But many of my colleagues and I still have reservations with respect \nto this amendment. That is why some have pushed to have their States \nexempted entirely from the renewable fuels requirements in this \namendment, while many others have voted to require States to \nproactively opt-in to the renewable fuels program.\n  Despite the many outstanding questions regarding the renewable fuels \nrequirements in this amendment--whether it is transportation or storage \nor other infrastructure issues, market concentration concerns, impacts \non gasoline prices for consumers at the pump, air quality impacts, you \nname it--there is a seeming unwillingness to consider even the \nslightest changes to the provisions before us--at least for some \nStates.\n  While certain States are exempted all together, other States that \nhave special considerations, such as my State of New York which has a \nState ban of MTBE that goes into effect in just a few months, which has \ncertain air quality issues, and very little existing ability to produce \nsignificant quantities of renewable fuel--our special needs go unmet.\n  With all of the concerns I have regarding the amendment before us, I \nhave even more concerns about the provisions passed by the House, which \nI believe in many respects are greatly inferior to the provisions we \nare considering here today. So that gives me even further pause in \ntaking up this issue.\n  For example, whereas the amendment before us contains a welcome and \nlong-awaited Federal phase-out of the use of MTBE over the next 4 \nyears, the House bill does not phase out MTBE at all. Even more \ndisturbing, it includes a liability safe harbor for MTBE.\n  Now, there is no question that the time has come to take action at \nthe Federal level on MTBE. New York is on the front lines of this \nbattle. We have banned MTBE use in the State as of January 1, 2004.\n  There are a number of other States that have taken action to phase \nout or limit the use of MTBE as well, including: California, Colorado, \nConnecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, \nMichigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and \nWashington. Now, those are the States that have actually passed State \nlaws. But here are a number of other States that have tried to pass \nlaws and are still trying to pass laws to phase out or ban MTBE.\n  In the absence of any Federal action, States have been forced to take \naction on their own to limit MTBE use in motor vehicle fuel because it \nhas wreaked havoc on the environment--in particular, on drinking water \nsources. Unfortunately, those State actions are now being challenged in \ncourt.\n  Yet the States are acting for good reason. New York has experienced \nfirst-hand the impact of MTBE contamination on our drinking water--\nparticularly on Long Island.\n  According to testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee offered recently by Mr. Paul Granger, superintendent of the \nPlainview Water District on Long Island, ``New York has identified some \n1970 MTBE spill sites with 430 of them on Long Island alone.''\n  That is why New York, once again out in front on the issue of MTBE, \nhas probably the toughest standard in the Nation for the amount of MTBE \nallowed in surface and ground water--10 parts per billion.\n  But according to Mr. Granger's testimony, ``At least 21 states have \nreported well closures due to MTBE groundwater contamination.'' It is \nestimated that more than 500 public drinking water wells and 45,000 \nprivate wells throughout the country are contaminated by MTBE.\n  According to testimony recently offered by the American Lung \nAssociation before the Environment and Public Works Committee, millions \nof Americans are being served by drinking water sources contaminated by \nMTBE.\n  As we are far too familiar now, the cost of cleaning up this MTBE \ncontamination are significant. According to the testimony of Mr. Craig \nPerkins, director of Environment and Public Works for the city of Santa \nMonica, CA, ``Current estimates for the total cost of nationwide MTBE \nclean-up are $30 billion and counting.'' That is why we have lawsuits \npending in New York regarding MTBE contamination of ground water, \nbecause these communities, these water suppliers, and ultimately their \ncustomers, cannot meet the financial burden of these cleanups.\n  So while having clean air to breathe is important, so is having clean \nwater to drink. We should not have to trade one for the other.\n  Phasing out the use of MTBE as a fuel additive is the right thing to \ndo from a drinking water perspective, from an overall environmental and \npublic health perspective, and from a fuels perspective. That is why \nsuch a phase-out of MTBE was recommended over 3 years ago by the EPA \nBlue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline.\n  The State-by-State approach to MTBE that we are currently operating \nunder does not work. It does not work for the markets, the refiners, or \nthe distributors to have this patchwork of States that do or do not \nallow the addition of MTBE to gasoline.\n  I am very pleased that the Frist-Daschle amendment includes such a \nphase-out but I am concerned about other provisions of this amendment \npertaining to renewable fuels, including the safe harbor provisions. I \nam deeply concerned that the House bill does not include a phase-out of \nMTBE but does provide a liability safe harbor for MTBE.\n  The reality is that we can phase out MTBE and repeal the existing 2 \npercent oxygenate requirement under the Clean Air Act while still \nensuring that we meet current clean air standards. And I support \nlegislation that will do these three things.\n  After banning MTBE and removing the oxygenate requirement, there \nwould still be an increase in the use of ethanol in this country--with \nor without the mandate we are contemplating here today.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate \namendment 850, an amendment to add a renewable fuels package to the \nenergy bill.\n  This language establishes a nationwide renewable fuels standard of 5 \nbillion gallons by 2012, repeals the Clean Air Act's oxygenate \nrequirement for reformulated gasoline and phases down the use of MTBE \nover 4 years.\n  This language has strong bipartisan support and is the result of long \nnegotiations between the Renewable Fuels Association, the National Corn \nGrowers Association, the Farm Bureau Federation, the American Petroleum \nInstitute, the Northeast states for Coordinated Air Use Management, \nNESCAUM, and the American Lung Association.\n  Passage of this ethanol language will protect our national security, \neconomy, and environment.\n\n[[Page S7446]]\n\n  The amendment that the majority leader has introduced--a compromise \nthat will triple the amount of domestically-produced ethanol used in \nAmerica--is one essential tool in reducing our dependence on imported \noil.\n  President Bush has stated repeatedly that energy security is a \ncornerstone for national security. I agree. It is crucial that we \nbecome less dependent on foreign sources of oil and look more to \ndomestic sources to meet our energy needs. Ethanol is an excellent \ndomestic source--it is a clean burning, homegrown renewable fuel that \nwe can rely on for generations to come.\n  Ethanol is also good for our Nation's economy. Tripling the use of \nrenewable fuels over the next decade will:\n  Reduce our National Trade Deficit by more than $34 billion;\n  Increase U.S. GDP by $156 billion by 2012;\n  Create more than 214,000 new jobs;\n  Expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion;\n  Save taxpayers $3 billion annually in reduced government subsidies \ndue to the creation of new markets for corn.\n  The benefits for the farm economy are even more pronounced. Ohio is \n6th in the Nation in terms of corn production and is among the highest \nin the nation in putting ethanol into gas tanks, over 40 percent of all \ngasoline sold in Ohio contains ethanol. An increase in the use of \nethanol across the Nation means an economic boost to thousands of farm \nfamilies across my State:\n  Currently, ethanol production provides 192,000 jobs and $4.5 billion \nto net farm income nationwide;\n  Passage of this amendment will increase net farm income by nearly $6 \nbillion annually;\n  Passage of this amendment will create $5.3 billion of new investment \nin renewable fuel production capacity.\n  Phasing out MTBE on a national basis will be good for our fuel \nsupply. Because refiners are under tremendous strain from having to \nmake several different gasoline blends to meet various State clean air \nrequirements--and no new refineries have been built in the last 25 \nyears--the effects of various State responses to the threat of MTBE \ncontamination--including bans and phase-outs on different schedules--\nwill add a significant burden to existing refineries. The MTBE phase-\nout provisions in this package will ensure that refiners will have less \nstress on their system and that gasoline will be more fungible \nnationwide.\n  Expanding the use of ethanol will also protect our environment by \nreducing auto emissions, which will mean cleaner air and improved \npublic health.\n  Use of ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons \nby 20 percent;\n  Ethanol also reduces emissions of particulates by 40 percent;\n  Use of ethanol RFG helped move Chicago into attainment of the federal \nozone standard, the only RFG area to see such improvement;\n  In 2002, ethanol use in the United States reduced greenhouse gas \nemissions by 4.3 million tons--the equivalent of removing more than \n630,000 vehicles from the road.\n  Our farmers can meet the ethanol standard. For 2003, the ethanol \nindustry is on pace to produce more than 2.7 billion gallons. The \namount of ethanol required under the FRS begins at 2.6 billion gallons \nin 2005. Adequate ethanol supply is simply not an issue.\n  Currently, 73 ethanol plants nationwide have the capacity to produce \nover 2.9 billion gallons annually. Further, there are ten ethanol \nplants under construction, which when completed will bring the total \ncapacity to more than 3.3 billion gallons.\n  California has been cited as a major problem area; however, all but \ntwo small refiners have already transitioned from MTBE into ethanol. \nCalifornia will use close to 700 million gallons of ethanol in 2003 \nafter consuming roughly 100 million gallons last year. The California \nEnergy Commission has concluded the transition to ethanol ``is \nprogressing without any major problems.'' The U.S. Energy Information \nAdministration found the transition went ``remarkably well.''\n  Individual States are banning the use of MTBE, but they cannot change \nthe federal RFG oxygen content requirement. The collision of these two \nelements under current law will likely lead to higher costs.\n  Under current law, California's required ethanol use in 2005 would be \n895 million gallons. Under this amendment, fuel providers supplying \nCalifornia will be required to use far less ethanol in 2005--291 \nmillion gallons. And more importantly, they will benefit from the \nbill's credit banking and trading provisions.\n  With the State MTBE ban set for January 2004, New York faces a \nsimilar situation. Under the status quo, fuel providers will be \nrequired to use 197 million gallons of ethanol in New York in 2005. \nHowever, if this amendment is enacted, refiners, blenders and importers \nwould be required to use or purchase credits for even less--111 million \ngallons of ethanol in 2005.\n  A study conducted by Mathpro, a prominent economic analysis firm, \nfound that, compared to a situation where States are banning MTBE and \nthe federal RFG oxygen content requirement is left in place, this \namendment will lower the average gasoline production cost: by about \ntwo-tenths of a cent per gallon.\n\n  In addition, this language provide safeguards. In the event that the \nRFS would severely harm the economy or the environment or would lead to \npotential supply and distribution problems, the RFS requirement could \nbe reduced or eliminated.\n  Ethanol is already blended from Alaska to Florida and from California \nto New York. Ethanol is already transported via barge, railcar, and \noceangoing vessel to markets throughout the country. The U.S. \nDepartment of Energy studied the feasibility of a 5 billion gallon per \nyear national ethanol market and found that ``no major infrastructure \nbarriers exist'' and that needed investments on an amortized, per-\ngallon basis are ``modest'' and ``present no major obstacle.''\n  Both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Congressional Budget \nOffice have recognized the benefit of the investment of the ethanol \nprogram on the overall health to the nation's economy. Recently, the \nUSDA stated the ethanol program would decrease farm program payments by \n$3 billion per year. In its analysis of this amendment, CBO stated the \nprovision would reduce direct spending by $2 billion during 2005-2013.\n  The RFS agreement includes strong anti-backsliding provisions that \nprohibit refiners from producing gasoline that increases emissions once \nthe oxygenate requirement is removed. A Governor can also petition EPA \nfor a waiver of the ethanol requirement based on supporting \ndocumentation that the ethanol waiver will increase emissions that \ncontribute to air pollution in any area of the state.\n  The fuels agreement would benefit the environment in a number of \nways:\n  reduces tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide, VOCs, and fine \nparticulates,\n  phases down MTBE over 4 years to address groundwater contamination, \nand since ethanol biodegrades quickly, it will not have the same \nproblem,\n  provides for one grade of summertime Federal RFG, which is more \nstringent,\n  increases the benefits from the Federal RFG program on air toxic \nreductions,\n  provides states in the Ozone Transport Region and enhanced \nopportunity to participate in the RFG program because of unique air \nquality problems,\n  includes provisions that require EPA to conduct a study on the \neffects on public health, air quality, and water resources of increased \nuse of potential MTBE substitutes, including ethanol.\n  The use of ethanol-blended fuels also reduces so-called greenhouse \ngas emissions by 12-19 percent compared with conventional gasoline, \naccording to Argonne National Laboratory. In fact, Argonne states \nethanol use last year in the U.S. reduced the so-called greenhouse gas \nemissions by approximately 4.3 million tons, equivalent to removing the \nannual emissions of more than 636,000 cars.\n  I also want to point out that the California Environmental Policy \nCouncil recently gave ethanol a clean bill of health and approved its \nuse as a replacement for MTBE in California gasoline.\n  A similar provision has already passed the House of Representatives \nthis year. Virtually the same agreement passed the Senate in April 2002 \nwith 69 votes.\n  The fuels agreement is supported by the American Petroleum Institute; \nthe\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\nRenewable Fuels Association; the Northeast States for Coordinated Air \nUse Management (NESCAUM); U.S. Chamber of Commerce; US Action; the \nUnion of Concerned Scientists; the Environmental and Energy Studies \nInstitute; the Governor's Ethanol Coalition; General Motors; the \nGovernors of California and New York; and all of the major agricultural \norganizations in the United States.\n  It is time to pass an ethanol bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote \nyes for America's farmers and this amendment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is important that Congress make \navailable all possible options for refiners to ensure compliance with \nthe renewable fuels standard and decrease chances for gasoline price \nand supply volatility. One such option for meeting the renewable fuels \nstandard that has shown promise is ethyl tertiary butyl ether ETBE.\n  ETBE is a High-octane, low-vapor pressure, gasoline-blending \ncomponent produced from a combination of ethanol and butane. Because \nboth of these raw materials are produced in abundance domestically, \nETBE will help expand US gasoline supplies, moderating possible \ngasoline price volatility.\n  ETBE is fully fungible with gasoline. This allows ETBE to be blended \ninto gasoline at any point in the gasoline logistical chain and \ntransported in gasoline pipelines to regions of the country where it is \nmore costly to transport and blend ethanol into gasoline. Moreover, \nETBE does not have a negative impact on gasoline vapor pressure, making \nit easier and more cost-effective to blend ETBE into gasoline--\nespecially during the summertime ozone control season when gasoline \nvapor pressure is restricted.\n  ETBE reduces more gasoline evaporative and tailpipe emissions, lowers \nair toxics and carbon monoxide, and provides 20-percent more carbon \ndioxide emission reduction than other gasoline-blending components.\n  ETBE is 75 percent less water soluble than MTBE. This means use of \nETBE substantially reduces the risks to ground water resources should \ngasoline leak from an underground storage tank. ETBE also has other \nphysical properties which make it migrate slower and shorter \ndistances--and easier to remediate--should a gasoline spill or leak \noccur.\n  I support the development of ETBE because of the benefits it provides \nfor cleaner air, enhanced gasoline supply, and the ability to transport \nthe fuel in the current infrastructure. Congress, in enacting a RFS, \nshould not do anything to preclude its use. The marketplace should be \nallowed to determine how it will meet the requirements of the RFS.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 850\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n850 as amended. There are to be 2 minutes evenly divided on the \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we yield back our time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the \noutcome.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 52, H.R. 1308; that \nimmediately upon the reporting of the bill, Senator Grassley be \nrecognized to offer a substitute amendment on behalf of himself, \nSenators Lincoln, Snowe, Baucus, and Voinovich; provided further that \nthere be 30 minutes for debate equally divided between Senators \nGrassley and Baucus or their designees prior to a vote in relation to \nthe amendment, and that no other amendments be in order; provided \nfurther that if the amendment is agreed to, the bill be read a third \ntime, and the Senate proceed to a vote on final passage of the bill as \namended.\n  Further, I ask that if the amendment is not agreed to, then H.R. 1308 \nbe placed back on the calendar and that no points of order be waived by \nthis agreement. I further ask consent that following that vote, the \nSenate then insist on its amendment, request a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair then be authorized to appoint conferees on the \npart of the Senate with a ratio of 3 to 2.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following passage of the bill, \nthe amendment to the title be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, we will \nhave further announcements later in this evening. We would expect to \nhave a final rollcall vote for the week approximately 30 or 40 minutes \nfrom now. Although we will have no more rollcall votes after that, we \nwill stay and be available to debate amendments tonight, and we will be \nin session tomorrow. We expect not to have rollcall votes tomorrow. We \nwill have further announcements later tonight with regard to the \nschedule tomorrow, as well as Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me compliment the distinguished \nmajority leader for the effort he has made to bring us to this \npoint. Were it not for his effort, we would not have accomplished what \nwe have with this unanimous consent agreement. I appreciate his \nefforts.\n\n  Let me also single out in particular the distinguished Senator from \nArkansas. Without her persistence and her effort, now weeks long, we \nwould not be here. She has spoken out with courage and conviction and \nempathy on behalf of 12 million children, 8 million families who \notherwise would be left out of tax relief. The argument that she has \nmade from the beginning has been without this legislation those \nmillions of children and those working families would get no tax relief \non July 1. The passage of this legislation today will accommodate that \nconcern, that need.\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\n  This will give us an opportunity to send the recommendation to the \nHouse. It will send a clear message to working families that we are \nserious about providing the kind of tax relief that is so necessary for \nthese families if we are going to provide it to others; that it will be \navailable. The refundable child credit assistance can be made available \nin time for tax relief provided to others as well.\n  I commend the Senator. I commend the majority leader. I thank my \ncolleagues for this agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the majority leader, would it be appropriate to \ndispose of the pending LIHEAP amendment to clear the record for the \nevening in spite of the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I assume it has been cleared by the \ndistinguished leader. I have no objection.\n  Mr. FRIST. We will proceed with that. It makes the most efficient use \nof everyone's time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have a Senator who still wants to speak on the \npending bill. I assume after the time just provided has expired, we \nwill be back for the distinguished Senator from Colorado to speak to an \namendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 841 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. For the record, under the bill, I withdraw amendment \nNo. 841.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 841) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 860 To Amendment No. 840\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I send a new second-degree amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. DOMENICI], for Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 860 to amendment No. \n     840.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee. I am pleased, colleagues, that we have \nbeen able to reach consensus on the need to include in this bill an \nincrease in the authorization level for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance (LIHEAP) program from $2 billion to $3.4 billion. With power \ncosts on the rise around this nation, it is imperative that the Senate \nact now to respond to the needs of the 85 percent of eligible families \nthat today do not receive the help they so desperately need, due to the \nperennially under-funded nature of the LIHEAP program.\n  There is another issue relevant to the LIHEAP program, however, that \nI hope the Senate will soon consider. I believe that we must address \nthe manner in which the Department of Health and Human Services--and, \nof course, the Office of Management and Budget--have traditionally \nadministered the ``contingency'' portion of the LIHEAP program. While \nthe bulk of LIHEAP dollars are distributed to states via block grants \nand in accordance with a statutory formula, Congress has also \nauthorized--and appropriated funds to--a contingency fund, designed to \n``meet the additional home energy assistance needs of one or more \nStates arising from a natural disaster or other emergency.'' This money \nis not released according to formula--but solely at the discretion of \nthe HHS Secretary.\n  Unfortunately, recent history suggests that there are problems with \nthe way the ``contingency'' portion of LIHEAP is administered. In \nessence, there seem to be widely varying eligibility rules applied to \nthe release of these contingency funds--leading to instances in which \nHHS has overlooked very real energy emergencies, including the recent \npower crisis in my home state of Washington.\n  I believe that clear rules for the release of these dollars will \nensure that, in the unfortunate event of an energy emergency, low-\nincome families will receive much-needed assistance in keeping the \nlights and the heat turned on--which is precisely what Congress intends \nwhen it appropriates money to the LIHEAP contingency fund. During mark-\nup on this bill in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Sen. \nSmith and I added language--adopted unanimously-seeking to put \nguidelines around the release of these emergency LIHEAP funds.\n  However, I understand that the distinguished Chairman, Senator Gregg, \nand Ranking Member, Senator Kennedy, intend to reauthorize the LIHEAP \nprogram in their Committee this year and examine very closely the \nadministration of these contingency funds. I believe the language that \nSenator Smith and I authored would go a long way toward adding clarity \nto the process, and I would be exceptionally pleased to work with the \nChairman on this and other proposals to reform the LIHEAP emergency \nprogram to ensure it is as responsive as possible to the very real \nneeds of low-income Americans.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Washington for her comments. I \nagree that the manner in which LIHEAP contingency funds are distributed \nshould be examined. I would be happy to work with the Senator on this \nimportant matter as the H.E.L.P. Committee works towards \nreauthorization of this program in the coming months.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I also believe the Senator from Washington makes a very \ngood point about the administration of LIHEAP emergency funds. I too \nwould be happy to work with the Senator on including language to \naddress her concerns when the Committee debates LIHEAP reauthorization \nlater this year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the second-degree \namendment be adopted and the underlying first-degree amendment No. 840, \nas amended, be agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask consent following the disposition of \nthe unanimous consent agreement dealing with the child tax credit, the \nSenator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, be recognized to speak on LIHEAP. \nShe\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\nwanted to speak before the vote but this would be fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Five minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Probably 10 minutes. I am sure she can complete a statement \nin 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Campbell has been waiting for a long time. He \nhas an amendment on the underlying bill.\n  Mr. REID. She can speak after he offers his amendment. He will not \nspeak that long.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is all right.\n  Mr. REID. How long will you speak?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I am going to speak for 15 or 18 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. She has waited around here all day to speak on LIHEAP. Why \nnot limit her time to 5 minutes; that should be adequate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 860) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 841), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003\n\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am very delighted to offer this amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Lugar, and Senator Cantwell. I think it is quite a pro-ethanol amendment because what we are trying to do here is encourage the development of ethanol that is produced from agricultural residues.\n\tThis amendment will, in fact, promote the production of agricultural residue ethanol. I want to tell my colleagues why this is important. I believe that biomass ethanol derived from agricultural residue could be a significant source of ethanol in California and also throughout the United States. Every State has agricultural waste, including those producing corn.\n\tI hope my colleagues who have the production of corn, wheat, sugarcane, rice, barley, beets, or oats in their States will realize this amendment is very important to them. I also believe the use of agricultural residue ethanol will make it easier for many of our States--certainly for California--to meet an ethanol mandate without price spikes and gasoline shortages as it increases the flexibility that the country has to meet this mandate.\n\tWhat is agricultural residue ethanol? I am sure if people are watching, they are thinking: This cannot be interesting. To me, it is very interesting because it is fuel made from the fibrous portion of plants, as is ethanol, but it differs from conventional ethanol in the following significant ways.\n\tFirst, the manufacturing process does not consume fossil fuels but rather uses plant byproducts and waste to create the energy to run the process. So, in a time in our history when we are trying to lessen our dependence on fossil fuel, I think this amendment is quite an important statement for us to make. I am very proud that Senator Lugar agrees because he is someone with much experience in this area.\n\tSecond, the raw material does not compete as a food source for humans and is available today based on existing farm practices.\n\tThird, it uses existing waste products, thus decreasing disposal needs.\n\tEthanol made from agricultural residue, such as rice, wheat straw, and sugarcane waste, can be locally produced and does not require that corn and other commodities be grown just to make ethanol.\n\tWhat we are talking about is using the residue, not growing food just to produce ethanol at a time when we are throwing food away because we have an overabundance in many of these areas. And, then we have been very energy inefficient by using the fossil fuel to develop the ethanol. What we are saying is the waste of agricultural materials is going to be put to good use.\n\tIs this a pie-in-the-sky idea? No, it is not. In 1999, Sacramento Valley produced enough rice straw waste--500,000 tons of which is burned in the field--to produce 100 million gallons of agricultural residue ethanol.\n\tBy putting these agricultural wastes to good use, converting them into energy resources, agricultural ethanol residue production reduces landfill disposal and open-air burning. We are using the waste we otherwise would dispose of either by burning, which dirties the air, or throwing it into a landfill. This will improve air quality and water quality.\n\tFurther, agricultural residue ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by more than 90 percent compared to gasoline. I reiterate, agricultural residue ethanol reduces greenhouse gases by more than 90 percent compared to gasoline. And it also creates markets for unused agricultural products that are generally expensive to dispose of. Agricultural residue ethanol can give our farmers and our rural communities enhanced economic security.\n\tWe clearly know that as a new technology, agricultural residue ethanol faces an uphill struggle to break into the ethanol market.\n\tRight now we know, when we look at the marketplace, that there is much room to grow here if we look at the numbers. We only have a very small number of gallons that are being derived from anything other than corn. So we have a chance. This, again, is not a pie-in-the-sky idea.\n\n\tCurrently, the only commercial facility is the Iogen facility in Canada which converts wheat straw into fermentable sugar and the sugar into bioethanol. Iogen Corporation's goal is to produce 180,000 gallons of ethanol annually. I believe we should promote these types of facilities in the United States of America. Our amendment, I believe, will ensure this.\n\tWe provide in our amendment more incentives for this type of agricultural residue ethanol production in the United States of America. As this mandate hits my State of California, and other States, where they have to spend a lot of money to bring that ethanol into to the State, it is going to be very cost competitive to import this type of ethanol from Canada. Why do we want to do that when we have the ability, if we have wheat, corn, beets, oats, barley, or rice, to name a few? We can do this in our country, and we can have a whole new industry. We can make ethanol more affordable to those of us who live in States far away from the Midwest.\n\tIn the underlying bill, there is a 1.5-gallon credit for numerous types of biomass ethanol. This means that a gallon of biomass ethanol counts as 1.5 gallons in meeting the bill's mandate. So there is a little incentive to use biomass ethanol, and I am very proud of that because we worked hard on that issue in our committee.\n\tWhat we want to do, it seems to me, is increase that credit to 2.5 gallons if the ethanol is made from agricultural residues. The fact is that agricultural residues provide us with an amazing opportunity and a promising opportunity to produce ethanol that has the potential of providing many economic and environmental benefits.\n\tWe are very pleased to offer this amendment. Right now, up to this point, we have seen amendments that people have viewed as anti-ethanol. This is an amendment that should bring us together. It should unite us because there are so many other crops that could be used--and, by the way, are going to be used--but we want to incentivize those agricultural crops.\n\tThat is what our amendment does. Senator Lugar, Senator Cantwell, and I are very pleased to offer this amendment. We are very hopeful it will be adopted. We are very hopeful we will not have opposition.\n\tMr. President, I retain the remainder of my time and yield the floor. I also suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada does not control the time.\n\tMr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call I will call for shortly be charged equally to both sides.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the quorum call will be charged equally to both sides.\n\tMr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I note the presence of the Senator from California who has just offered an amendment which expands the substances that can be used for ethanol conversion. I am willing to accept the amendment. I favor the amendment. I understand the distinguished minority manager would like to speak on the subject at this point.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\tMr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from California on this amendment. It substantially improves this portion of the bill and does provide additional opportunity for developing ethanol from these other sources. It is good environmental policy. It is good energy policy. I very much support the amendment.\n\tAs I understand it, most of those people who looked at this agreed to it. I agree with my colleague from New Mexico that this is an amendment we should agree to unanimously in the Senate and we should maintain it in conference, insisting on it in our discussions with the House.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I cannot thank enough both of my colleagues, my friends, from New Mexico, Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman.\n\tI want to make sure Senators understand exactly what we do. We increase the credit to 2.5 gallons if the ethanol is made from agricultural residue. It is giving an incentive to our farmers who produce rice, wheat, barley, oats, sugar beets, and others, an incentive to use the waste.\n\tI was going to have a rollcall vote on this, but given the assurances of Senators Domenici and Bingaman, who have stated very clearly and have told me they will not drop this amendment in conference--can I rely on that commitment? I ask both my friends one more time.\n\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Yes, I say to the Senator, I will do my very best. I indicated that to you and I will do my very best. I make that commitment to you.\n\tMrs. BOXER. You will do your very best?\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Meaning you will not drop it in conference, which is what you told me?\n\tMr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n\tMrs. BOXER. And my other friend, my ranking member, has made the same pledge?\n\tMr. BINGAMAN. Let me respond, to the extent I am persuasive in the conference, I will commit to keeping this provision in the law.\n\tMrs. BOXER. I see the Democratic leader is on the Senate floor. It would be a wonderful thing if he could speak out on this amendment as well. We have both Senators from New Mexico, and Senator Lugar. I am trying not to put the Senate through a rollcall vote. If I have these strong commitments, it will make me feel a lot better about it. I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\tMr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me thank the Senator from California for her efforts to improve upon this legislation. I have indicated to her privately that I support the amendment. I would support it if there were a rollcall vote.\n\tThe fact that Dick Lugar, the initial cosponsor of this legislation when we introduced it several years ago, is a proud sponsor of this amendment is some indication of the degree to which the ethanol community and those of us who support this proposal would be supporting her amendment.\n\tAs my colleagues from New Mexico, both the chairman and the ranking member, have noted, there is no reason, when we get into conference, this should not remain intact as part of the Energy bill.\n\tIt is a good amendment. It provides even more opportunities to meet the targets set out in this legislation.\n\tSo I would do all I could as Democratic leader to ensure that at the end of the day, when this legislation comes back in the form of a conference report, we will continue to see the Boxer amendment integrally a part of the bill itself and a part of this amendment.\n\tAgain, let me congratulate her, thank her, and indicate I will be very supportive.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Daschle. I know he is working endless hours to get this amendment finished. I think this enhances the amendment, I really do. I am very grateful.\n\tBefore I ask for a voice vote, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMrs. BOXER. How much time remains?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8 minutes remaining to the Senator from California.\n\tMrs. BOXER. I yield 6 minutes to my colleague from Washington, Senator Cantwell.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\tMs. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for her hard work on this amendment. I am glad to join Senator Lugar and Senator Boxer as a cosponsor of this amendment. Senator Boxer has spent an invaluable amount of time on the whole ethanol debate, but I think the amendment she offers this morning goes a long way in adding diversity and efficiency to our ethanol plan. It seems my colleagues are enthusiastic about supporting this in the overall energy package.\n\tI rise to support the Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment. As we have heard, this amendment would increase from 1.5 gallons to 2.5 gallons the credit available to refiners who choose to use ethanol derived from certain types of biomass to meet the requirement of our renewable fuels standard. Senator Boxer did an excellent job, giving us all a lesson in biomass 101 as it relates to ethanol and the products that could be used as part of this biomass requirement.\n\tThis amendment ensures that as we strive to reduce our reliance on foreign oil, displacing it with home-grown products that provide both environmental benefits and economic stimulus to our nation's rural communities, we also develop the renewable fuels diversity that is the hallmark of what I think is a good energy policy.\n\tMy colleagues may have been told this, or they may learn it now for the first time, but it was in 1925 that Henry Ford told the New York Times that ethanol was ``the fuel of the future.'' But while 90 percent of the ethanol produced in this Nation today was derived from corn, Henry Ford's vision was much broader. He said:\n\n       The fuel of the future is going to come from apples, weeds \n     and sawdust--almost anything. There is fuel in every bit of \n     vegetable matter that can be fermented.\n\n\tThat is what he told the Times back in that period.\n\tThis amendment attempts to move forward on that vision. I believe it is logical, and I believe Senator Boxer and Senator Lugar are right on target in providing leadership on this issue.\n\tWhile today the ethanol that is derived from corn more or less dominates the renewable fuels market, this is not the circumstance for every State in our country. The State of Washington, for example, is much more a producer of wheat, which would hold significant promise as a potential source for the biomass ethanol.\n\tDespite the promise of these alternatives, the technology for producing ethanol from these sources such as wheat and straw and other agricultural products has lagged behind for a number of reasons. Yet by providing appropriate incentives today with this amendment, and promoting research and development, we can move this forward on a cost-competitive basis.\n\tThe Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment would increase the renewable fuels standard credit for one specific type of material, the agricultural residues such as wheat or rice or straw, from that 1.5 to 2.5, reflecting what is really a recent DOE analysis on what we should achieve.\n\tSo moving forward on these incentives for development of ethanol production is simply a matter of good public policy. I say this for four or five reasons.\n\tWe get the environmental benefits from this, we get the potential energy gains, we get the long-term cost impacts of having fuel diversity, and, of course, we get the spread of economic benefits to all of our Nation's agricultural communities.\n\tIn our State of Washington, there is much going on in this area. There are many farmers who have come together in a variety of ways to join in thinking about ethanol production. With the construction of one 40-million-gallon plant, the State of Washington could become entirely ethanol self-sufficient. According to a study conducted by our State university, such a plan would have a significant economic impact, particularly in our rural communities in the eastern part of Washington.\n\tA single 40-million-gallon production plant could create 104 direct jobs and about 300 indirect jobs. Local communities could see an economic benefit, according to the study, of about $19 million per year with a statewide benefit of somewhere between $20 million and $30 million per year. With the construction of these various plants, Washington State could reach self-sufficiency and could, under the fuels standard proposal here today, become a supplier to other Western States.\n\tThe State of Washington and agricultural communities want to help meet the renewable fuels standard. They want to join with Senators Frist and Daschle in their proposal. But we don't have the corn or the abundance to make that happen. So we want to see this diversity. In fact, a recent Washington State University extension program concluded that we could produce 200 million gallons per year in ethanol if we had improvement in technologies and diversification of resources.\n\tIn conclusion, to help this become reality, a broad coalition of Washington agricultural and environmentalist interests have banded together. They helped pass this package in our State legislature with a variety of tax incentives and broad production of biofuels. These bills were signed by our Governor last month and they have our State moving forward on this agenda.\n\tThe Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment adds a Federal dimension to these efforts. This provision reflects good public policy from the Federal Government and good energy policy, and helps those States that are further away from ethanol diversity to participate in our national energy goal.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Talent). The Senator from California.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have a couple of minutes remaining. I know we are going to set our amendment aside.\n\tI wanted to close this debate again by thanking Senator Lugar for his leadership, Senator Cantwell for her leadership, and both Senators from New Mexico as well as Senator Daschle for their help.\n\tI think any Senator who has corn in their State, wheat in their State, sugarcane in their State, rice, barley, beets, oats, apples, or any fructose-rich product is going to be very happy with this amendment.\n\tIn order to use the agricultural residue and make it into ethanol, it is going to require a little incentive. Although the underlying bill has a slight incentive, experts tell us it is not enough to really move forward on this very good way to make ethanol. I think it will really help those States that are far away from the Midwest.\n\tBy the way, it does not hurt any State because corn will still be used.\n\tI yield the floor. I thank my colleagues very much.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set aside.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to setting it aside.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is set aside.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 856 to Amendment No. 850\n\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. \n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n     Jeffords, and Mr. Lautenberg, proposes an amendment numbered \n     856 to amendment No. 850.\n\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe amendment is as follows:\n(Purpose: To provide for equal liability treatment of vehicle fuels and \n                            fuel additives)\n\n       Beginning on page 18, strike line 16 and all that follows \n     through page 19, line 17, and insert the following:\n       ``(p) Renewable Fuels Safe Harbor.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of Federal or State law, a renewable fuel \n     used or intended to be used as a motor vehicle fuel, or any \n     motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuel, shall be \n     subject to liability standards that are not less protective \n     of human health, welfare, and the environment than any other \n     motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive.''.\n\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think for anyone in this Chamber who cares about the health and safety of people--I know that is every one of us--this amendment is very important.\n\tA waiver of liability is in this underlying bill for renewable fuels. My amendment to the renewable fuels portion of this Energy bill will ensure that all motor vehicle fuels and fuel additives are held to the same liability standards by striking the safe harbor and adding the following language. This is the language of my amendment:\n\tNotwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a renewable fuel used or intended to be used as a motor vehicle fuel, or any motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuel, shall be subject to liability standards that are not less protective of human health, welfare, and the environment than any other motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive.\n\tIs this not a fair idea? As we go into this whole new production of ethanol, be it derived from corn or be it derived from agricultural residues or municipal waste or wherever we wind up getting it, renewable fuel should be subject to the same liability standards as any other motor vehicle fuel.\n\tWe have expenses in this area--where we have added MTBE, for example, to fuel. We found out later it was very dangerous. It hurt a lot of our communities. I will get into that later.\n\tThe safe harbor language in this underlying bill waives all product liability design defect claims, including the failure to warn the people. Any claim that has not been filed by the date of enactment of this section will be forever barred.\n\tWe should not be doing this. We don't know all the impacts of what we are doing today. Why would we give a safe harbor to ethanol or various refiners of ethanol?\n\tI have to say to those who will oppose me--and there will be many, and I know that, and I accept that--if ethanol is so safe--I pray it is; maybe it is, by the way--if it is so safe, why have the companies involved in its production transferred this liability provision in the bill? I think anytime someone says my product is 100 percent safe, but give me a waiver from liability, protect me from a lawsuit if something happens--you have to say who wins and who loses in this situation. Requests for this kind of special interest free pass require a very close look. And I hope we will take a look.\n\tThe interests behind this bill have gotten a loophole that eliminates a big chunk of the liability they would have under the law if they damaged the public health or the environment. The exemption language in the bill raises a red flag right away. It begins:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or state \n     law. . . .\n\n\tMr. President, you and I have been around here long enough to know that when we start off with ``notwithstanding any other provision of Federal law,'' the public is going to be losing rights.\n\tThe bill goes on to say that ``Renewable fuel--ethanol cannot be found to be defectively designed or manufactured.''\n\tImagine, the bill says ``Renewable fuels cannot be found to be defectively designed or manufactured.''\n\tCompliance with laws and regulations is not necessary for getting the liability waiver. There is only a limited compliance requirement under the Clean Air Act.\n\tAgain, we all pray and hope that there will be no danger from widespread use of ethanol. The liability exemption, however, is dangerous because there are many unanswered questions about ethanol. We know there are real benefits to it, such as fewer carbon monoxide and toxic air emissions, but there are questions about adverse effects.\n\tAccording to EPA's ``1999 Blue Ribbon Panel Report on Oxygenates in Gasoline,'' ethanol is extremely soluble in water and would spread into the environment. It may further spread plumes of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene because ethanol may inhibit the breakdown of these toxic materials.\n\n\tThis isn't Senator Boxer talking. This isn't the people who want this amendment talking. This isn't environmental groups talking. This isn't the American Lung Association talking or anybody else. This is EPA's 1999 Blue Ribbon Panel Report on Oxygenates in Gasoline.\n\tStudies demonstrate that ethanol increases the size and migration of benzene plumes. Researchers say more ground water wells will experience contamination from MTBE and benzene, a known carcinogen, if ethanol leaks into water supplies. There are also questions about the impact of ethanol on sensitive populations, such as children. We already know we have seen in our children more and more problems lately, more and more problems because they are so much more sensitive to pollutants in the environment.\n\tQuestions surrounding ethanol's effect on public health and the environment should be answered before Congress grants a broad waiver from liability for its harmful effects. We should err on the side of caution and we should err on the side of protecting the taxpayers.\n\tSupporters of this liability exemption argue that immunity from product liability design defect claims is not so broad. They are going to tell you we keep every other claim in place but we only will limit product liability design defect claims. But this ignores the fact that product defect claims are the clearest way to hold accountable manufacturers whose products cause injury to public health or the environment. Litigation in California involving drinking water contaminated by MTBE rests on claims that MTBE was defective in design. In a landmark case, decided in April 2000, a San Francisco jury found that, based on the theory that MTBE is a defective product, several major oil companies are legally responsible for the environmental harm to Lake Tahoe's ground water. The jury found that many of these same oil companies acted with malice because they were aware of the dangers but withheld information.\n\tSo here you go, Mr. President. You can see it, a jury of our peers--not Senators, not people behind a microphone--found out that the product MTBE, which is an additive to gasoline, as is ethanol, was defective in design. The verdict came forward based on the product liability issue.\n\tIn that case, the oil companies knew the risks of MTBE. They did not warn anyone and--guess what--Lake Tahoe could have gotten stuck with a $45 million cleanup bill. If it was not able to sue under the defective product claim, that $45 million would have to come from the taxpayers who live in Lake Tahoe. Let's see what the MTBE cleanup cost would be. According to recent estimates, it would cost $29 billion to clean up MTBE. MTBE, an additive to gasoline--when it was added, everyone stood up and said: Oh, it is safe. It is wonderful. It will clean up the air. It did. But it polluted the water. People can't drink the water.\n\tIf you ever smelled water that is contaminated by MTBE, you would know no one could drink it. It has a foul odor and it is yellow in color. This is what it is going to cost. If we waive the liability for the companies that make MTBE, guess who gets stuck with the $29 billion bill. The taxpayers, instead of the people who made that product. That is not right.\n\tBy the way, in the House version of this bill, they not only give a safe harbor to ethanol, they give it to MTBE, which is a total, complete outrage. I hope everyone understands that. It is in the House bill. I am happy it isn't in the Senate bill. I hope we can get rid of it in the conference.\n\n\tCompanies are responsible for this, not the taxpayers.\n\tNow, this is the issue. Again, people will stand up and say: Oh, we are only waiving this very small area in liability law. They say: Product liability design defect is all we are waiving.\n\tWell, let's look at what the judge said in the MTBE case. He threw out the negligence claim. He said that did not apply. He threw out the nuisance claim. He said that did not apply. The only thing that applied was defective product liability--and that is what my colleagues are going to waive for the makers of renewable fuels.\n\tMy colleagues, please listen to me. I know you want to have an ethanol bill. Bless your heart. Go for it. But do not waive liability for the manufacturers of ethanol because someday it could come back to haunt you.\n\tIf ethanol is so safe, you do not need to do this. It makes no sense.\n\tYou talk to my colleagues: Ethanol is safe. It has been out there since the 1970s. It is safe, it is safe, it is safe. I guess maybe they have not read the 1999 special EPA Blue Ribbon Report, which says: Danger, maybe there is a problem. But for them to waive defective product liability and to say that is the only thing they are waiving, when it is the only thing the courts have said is an opportunity, makes no sense at all.\n\tI had one of my colleagues come up to me yesterday and say: Well, Senator Boxer, you voted for a safe harbor in the Y2K bill when the computer companies had to do a very quick fix on computers. I say to my friends, I did that. That only happens once in 1,000 years, and there is no direct impact on health and safety. So let's not confuse one safe harbor and another safe harbor.\n\tSo, clearly, we know this is kind of a shuck and a jive situation: Oh, we are only going to throw out one little part of liability law. But guess what. It is the only one that works. We do not want communities to be left holding the bag if there is a problem in the future because that is a pretty heavy bag for the local community and the local taxpayers to pick up--its cleanup costs, its possible health problems and its water pollution and possible air pollution.\n\tI am going to get to the issue that the supporters will raise: That this is a mandate and, therefore, the suppliers deserve this liability exemption.\n\tCongress regularly mandates that manufacturers meet a variety of guidelines and requirements, but we do not exempt all manufacturers from State and Federal product liability design defect laws.\n\tWhen gasoline leaks today, there is no loophole. The polluter pays, despite the fact that Congress regulates gasoline. Congress mandated the installation of airbags in automobiles, made them mandatory. Congress said: You must have airbags. You remember that battle. The automobile companies said: We don't want them. (Of course, now they are saying they are happy to have them.) But, in any case, we mandated them. But if there is a problem with airbags, we did not give a liability waiver to the automobile companies. If that product is defective, the product is defective and people have to be held accountable and responsible.\n\tI thought that was what we stood for in the Senate. We talk about accountability. We talk about responsibility. We talk about people taking responsibility for their actions, and yet we are going to give some of the biggest companies in the world a waiver from liability. Shame on us if we do this. It is not as if we did not have experience before, doing it with MTBE. It is not as if we do not know that the cost to clean up MTBE is in the tens of billions of dollars. If the companies were off the hook, it would be the local taxpayers who have to pay.\n\tAgain, supporters of this liability loophole claim ethanol is safe so no one needs to worry about this liability exemption. So, again, I ask a question--a rhetorical question--if you are not worried about any ill-effects from ethanol, why are you fighting me so hard on this? Why not join hands with me and say we are going to treat ethanol like we treat every other product?\n\tI, again, want to read the language I have added in this amendment which I hope will be adopted:\n\tNotwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, a renewable fuel used or intended to be used as a motor vehicle fuel, or any motor vehicle fuel containing renewable fuels, shall be subject to liability standards that are not less protective of human health, welfare, and the environment than any other motor vehicle fuel or fuel additive.\n\tThat is all I am saying. I am not holding ethanol to a different standard. I just spoke in support of ethanol made from agricultural residues. I think those folks have to meet safety standards, and one way to make sure they do is to not take away their liability. Ethanol should be subject to liability standards as strong as any other fuel additive. No more, no less. We are not making it any harsher. We are not making it any easier on them. We should not shift the burden of cleaning up problems caused by ethanol to our local communities, our mayors, our city council people, our Governors, and the rest.\n\tNo public policy is served by immunizing the refiners and chemical companies from responsibility in the future if it turns out that this was a problem and they knew it, and they didn't tell anyone about it.\n\tHow much time remains on my side, Mr. President?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes 23 seconds.\n\tMrs. BOXER. I will take another couple minutes. Then I will reserve the remainder and allow my colleagues to argue this case.\n\tLet me tell you who is on my side. Who is on the side of making sure that we don't give the safe harbor liability waiver for renewable fuels? Many local and State governments, water utilities support my amendment, public health, consumer and environmental organizations. These include the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies; the American Water Works Association, which together represent water systems serving 180 million Americans across the country. Do you know why they are with me on this? They may be stuck cleaning up the water supply. They can't afford it. This is almost like putting an unfunded mandate on local people if, in fact, there are problems with ethanol. And that is why the American Water Works Association is for my amendment.\n\tContinuing the list of those who oppose the liability waiver: Association of California Water Agencies; National Association of Water Companies; South Tahoe Public Utility District. Do you know why they are for it? Because they know if they didn't have the chance to sue on this, they would have to bear the cleanup responsibility from MTBE contamination. The City of Santa Monica and Orange County Water District likewise know the effect that ground water contamination can have. They are with me.\n\tHow about these groups? American Lung Association is for the amendment; American Public Health Association; California Clean Water Action; Citizens for a Future New Hampshire, Cahaba River Society; Citizen's Environmental Coalition; Clean Water Action; the Consumer Federation of America; Environmental Defense; Ecology Center; Environmental Working Group; Friends of the Earth; League of Conservation Voters; Mono Lake Committee; National Sludge Alliance; the Natural Resources Defense Council; the New Jersey Coalition Against Tonics; the New Jersey Environmental Federation; Physicians for Social Responsibility; the Sierra Club; Rivers Unlimited; Spring Lake Park Groundwater Guardians; and U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n\tThat is just a partial list of the folks out there who are saying to Senators: Please, if you are going to move ahead with a new product like this--it is not a new product, but it is certainly going to be a product that is going to now be ubiquitous across the country--if you are going to do this, then make sure you take every caution and every protection not to waive the protections the American people now have from a defective product.\n\tAnd, once more, just let's be clear on this. There are no other ways for communities to recover costs if this turns out to be a mistake. Negligence, out the window; nuisance, out the window. It is defective product liability the courts have said is the only way people can go. \n\tI reserve the remainder of my time.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has about 10 minutes 4 seconds remaining. Who seeks recognition?\n\tThe Senator from Oklahoma.\n\tMr. INHOFE. Mr. President, to respond to the question asked by the distinguished Senator from California, why are we fighting it? One of the biggest problems is, you get in this quagmire of lawsuits and nothing ever gets done in terms of cleanup. This is something we have been fighting for a long time.\n\tThis is going to be a more brief statement than it was going to be before because right now we have a very significant piece of legislation before the committee I chair on the clear skies legislation, which is the most far-reaching reduction in powerplant pollutions in the history of clean air. So it is very significant, and I do have to get back.\n\tI have stated on many occasions my concern about the fact that this country does not have a comprehensive energy policy. I have also criticized Republicans and Democrats alike. We didn't get a comprehensive energy policy in the Reagan administration or the first Bush administration or the Clinton administration. We are going to get one with this. That is why this is so significant.\n\tAs Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said, it is a serious strategic issue. This is a national security issue.\n\tThe amendment we are talking about, the underlying bill, the Frist-Daschle-Inhofe amendment, represents a compromise on a lot of contentious issues. As with all compromises, there are provisions I like and I don't like. I am afraid there is a lot of misinformation being circulated about the safe harbor provision. Time and time again, we hear if the safe harbor provision is enacted into law, first, citizens cannot take refiners to court under our tort system; and, second, any responsible ethanol contamination that happens in the future would not get cleaned up. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n\tFirst, let me address the statement that any tort claim that has not been filed by the date of enactment of this section will be forever barred. Even with the enactment of the safe harbor provision, if a plaintiff makes a case, here are just a few tort theories that can be used in environmental cases: Trespass, trespass is not affected by safe harbor; nuisance, not affected by safe harbor; negligence, not affected; breach of implied warranty, not affected by safe harbor; a breach of express warranty, not affected by safe harbor. Safe harbor does not affect any of these tort theories.\n\tIn fact, ethanol has been approved by the EPA as a fuel additive. Now Congress is mandating the use of ethanol. So the Federal Government has given ethanol its stamp of approval and now Congress is mandating it. How can we now say that refiners and blenders are open to suits for claims that the ``product has design or manufacturing defects''? Design defect claims actually hamper cleanups by interfering with regulatory agencies. Regulatory agency oversight--Federal, State, and local--is frustrated by the product liability claims because these agencies lose control of the remedy process. These agencies are supposed to be in control of the remedy process. That answers the question asked, Why are we concerned about this? We want to get these things cleaned up.\n\tWhen product liability claims are permitted, the plaintiff's motive becomes recovery of a large money judgment rather than a judgment mandating a remedy to be performed by the party who released the gasoline. Very often, the only thing getting cleaned up are the trial lawyers' mansions purchased with the spoils of these settlements. In fact, a recent report from the Council of Economic Advisors found that using the tort system in this way ``is extremely inefficient, returning only 20 cents of the tort cost dollar for that purpose.''\n\tNow, I would like to address the rumors that sites will not get cleaned up or that polluters will not pay. The Safe Harbor provisions--in no way--affects liability, and therefore, cleanups under any Federal or State environmental law. Any statement to the contrary is false. Enforcement of these laws is by the authorized Federal agency and States. If there were a spill, here are some examples of environmental laws that offer cleanup and liability provisions:\n  1. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA); 2. Clean Water Act; 3. Oil Pollution Act (OPA); 4. Superfund. Generally speaking, Congress intended that oil spills be cleaned up by the Oil Pollution Act. However, the Inhofe Amendment to last Congress' Brownfields bill signed into law by the President is taking hug strides in cleaning up nearly 250,000 petroleum contaminated sites, such as abandon gas stations.\n\tNo. 5, Natural Resource Damages (NRD), under the Oil Pollution Act, Superfund, and the Clean Water Act.\n\tSo as you can see, there are enormous protections through the tort system as well as through environmental laws. Again, I ask my colleagues to oppose the Boxer amendment and support the motion to table.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\tMr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield to me for about 1 minute?\n\tMr. BOND. I am happy to accommodate my colleague.\n\tMr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I know the Senator is prepared to speak against the Boxer amendment, as his colleague just did. I, too, have come to the floor to speak against the Boxer amendment.\n\tThe underlying Frist-Daschle amendment creates a narrow prospective safe harbor from liability for defect in design or manufacture of a renewable fuel. There is no liability protection for MTBE in the underlying amendment. I oppose the Boxer amendment. Many colleagues in the Senate feel strongly in opposition, I believe, and we will be able to defeat this amendment.\n\tAnd, to qualify for the limited protection that is in the underlying amendment, a renewable fuel must be evaluated by EPA for toxicity, carcinogenicity, air quality impacts, and water quality impacts, and must be used in compliance with any restrictions imposed by EPA.\n\tFurther, the burden of cleanup for environmental contamination would not be shifted.\n\tThat is, the safe harbor provision that is in the RFS amendment would not affect liability under Federal and state environmental laws, and therefore would not affect response, remediation and clean-up.\n\tLet me make this point clear: the underlying provision would not affect in any way a company's legal responsibility to clean up the contamination of any groundwater by gasoline, regardless of whether it contained oxygenates or additives of any kind.\n\tIn addition, the safe harbor provision for renewable fuels does not affect liability under other tort law provisions, including negligence, trespass, and nuisance, and it does not prevent the award of compensatory or punitive damages.\n\tImportantly, defective product liability cases only make up 0.002 percent of all civil cases filed each year according to the National Center for State Courts.\n\tFinally, an amendment to change or strike the safe harbor provision would destroy this long-standing renewable fuels agreement, and result in the status quo and no national phaseout of MTBE, which has contaminated some groundwater supplies.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\tMr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his fine statement. Really, the fact that we are here today in a bipartisan effort reflects the good work that has gone on. After intense negotiations between the ethanol and oil industries, agriculture, the environmental community, consumer groups, and the States, we have a historic agreement that is embodied in the Frist-Daschle bill which will provide for significant growth in the renewable fuels industries, including ethanol and biodiesel.\n\tIndustry has been working for months to implement these recommendations that are protective of the environment, provide refiners with increased flexibility, and provide agriculture with certain growth in market opportunities for ethanol and biodiesel. Certainly, the occupant of the chair, who is from Missouri, knows how great the growth of the ethanol and biodiesel industry is in our State, as farmers are coming together in cooperatives to build facilities to meet the need for this clean, renewable fuel. These are tremendous opportunities for improving our environment, reducing our dependence upon foreign oil, and providing a strong economic base for rural America.\n\tThe key provisions of the bipartisan agreement, I think most people know, are:\n\tA Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) in which part of our nation's fuel supply, growing to 5 billion gallons by 2012, is provided by renewable, domestic fuels; eliminating the Federal reformulated gasoline, RFG, 2.0 wt. percent oxygen requirement; phasing down the use of MTBE in the U.S. gasoline market over 4 years; and protecting the air quality gains of the reformulated gasoline program.\n\tThese provisions will increase U.S. fuels supplies, promote more U.S.-sourced energy, protect the environment, and stimulate rural economic development through increased production and use of domestic, renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.\n\tThe historic fuels agreement contained in the Reliable Fuels Act, S. 791, provides for a gradual phase-in of the use of renewable fuels, beginning with 2.6 billion gallons in 2005 and growing to 5 billion gallons in 2012. Some have expressed concerns regarding the bill's renewable fuels ``safe harbor provision,'' arguing it provides ``sweeping liability exemptions for damage to public health or the environment resulting from renewable fuels or their use in conventional gasoline.'' This is a clear misrepresentation of the provision.\n\tThe safe harbor provision is intended to offer some protection to refiners that are required to use renewable fuels under this bill. It is aimed at as yet unknown and undeveloped renewable fuels, not ethanol. Ethanol has been used in the U.S. safely and effectively for more than 20 years. But without some limited safe harbor, refiners may be reluctant to commercialize new fuels that may otherwise qualify for this program.\n\tEthanol has received a clean bill of health. According to a report on ethanol's health and environmental fate completed by Cambridge Environmental, Inc., no health threat is expected from increased ethanol use. The report concludes exposure to ethanol vapors coming from ethanol-blended gasoline is very unlikely to have adverse health consequences. Importantly, after an exhaustive study of ethanol's impact on health, air quality and water resources, the California Environmental Policy Council awarded ethanol a clean bill of health.\n\tEthanol is rapidly biodegraded in surface water, groundwater and soil. Ethanol is a safe biodegradable and renewable fuel that does not harm drinking water resources. A recent study by Surbec Environmental concluded that ethanol poses no threat to surface water and ground water According to the report, ethanol is a naturally occurring substance produced during the fermentation of organic matter and can be expected to biodegrade rapidly in essentially all environments.\n\tThe safe harbor provision is very limited. It applies only to claims that a renewable fuel is defective in design or manufacture. These requirements include both compliance with requests for information about a fuel's public health and environmental effects and compliance with any regulations adopted by the EPA. If these requirements are not met, the safe harbor protection does not apply and liability will be determined under otherwise applicable law. This provision does not affect claims based on the wrongful release of a renewable fuel into the environment. Anyone harmed by a release of that kind would retain all the rights he has under current law.\n\tSafeguards are provided for in the bill. The legislation requires EPA to conduct studies of the long-term health and environmental effects of renewable fuels. Under this bill, the Administrator has the authority to control or even prohibit the sale of renewable fuels that may adversely affect air or water quality or the public health. There is no safe harbor if the Administrator's rules are violated.\n\tA vote for the amendment may disrupt the historic agreement. The bipartisan compromise on fuels issues in S. 791 represents a carefully crafted agreement among the oil industry, ethanol producers, agriculture groups, and environmental and public health interests, including the American Lung Association, the Union of Concerned Scientists and Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, NESCAUM, among others. An amendment to change or strike the safe harbor provision would effectively dissolve the agreement, resulting in the status quo and continued MTBE use.\n\tMTBE use is a problem. MTBE has been shown to be harmful, and MTBE must be phased out and replaced by the other renewable, benign oxygenate--ethanol.\n\tI will just say generally, on all of these amendments designed to attack ethanol, there are tremendous economic benefits of this renewable fuel standard.\n\tTripling the use of renewable fuels will have a significant positive impact on both the farm and overall economy, while significantly reducing our foreign imports.\n\tAccording to an economic analysis of the legislation completed by AUS consultants, over the next decade RFS would reduce the Nation's trade deficit by more than $34 billion in 1996 dollars, increase U.S. gross domestic product by $156 billion by 2012, create more than 214,000 new jobs throughout the entire economy, expand household income by an additional $51.7 billion, increase net farm income by nearly $6 billion per year, create $5.3 billion of new investment in renewable fuel production capacity, and displace more than 1.6 billion barrels of imported oil.\n\tOne other canard that is often raised against ethanol is that it is not a positive energy balance. Energy balance refers to the energy contact of ethanol minus the fossil energy used to produce it. In 2002, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Argonne National Laboratories concluded that ethanol contains 34 percent more energy than is used in the production process, including the energy used to grow and harvest the grain, process the grain into ethanol, and to transport the ethanol to gasoline terminals for distribution.\n\tAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, ethanol produced from biomass generates 6.8 Btu for every Btu of fossil energy consumed. The production of reformulated gasoline without ethanol generates only .79 Btu for every Btu of fossil energy consumed. Therefore, producing ethanol produces roughly eight times more Btu than using energy-produced reformulated gasoline. And it achieves a net gain in a more desirable form of energy. It provides clean environmental benefits.\n\tWith the war we face on terrorism, we have to be more concerned about U.S. energy. We need to reduce imported oil. We can develop and supply that oil from our rich farmlands. It will increase the availability of U.S. fuel supplies while easing an overburdened refining industry. No new oil refineries have been built in the U.S. since 1976, but 68 ethanol production facilities have been built during that time.\n\tAs ethanol and biodiesel are blended with gasoline and diesel after the refining process, they directly increase domestic fuel capacity. Blending 10-percent ethanol in a gallon of gas provides an additional 10-percent volume to the transportation fuel market, easing the oil refinery sector that is operating at capacity.\n\tThe environmental benefits have already been discussed. It can reduce global warming. In 2002, ethanol use in the U.S. reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4.3 million tons, the equivalent of removing more than 636,000 vehicles from the road.\n\tThere is a long list of organizations that are supporting the fuels agreement. Rather than take the time of my colleagues to read those, I ask unanimous consent that this list of organizations supporting the fuel agreement before us today be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n       American Farm Bureau Federation, American Petroleum \n     Institute, Renewable Fuels Association, National Corn Growers \n     Association, National Farmers Union, Northeast States for \n     Coordinated Air Use Management, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \n     National Biodiesel Board, American Bioenergy Association, \n     American Coalition for Ethanol, American Corn Growers \n     Association, American Lung Association, American Soybean \n     Association, Bluewater Network, California Farmers Union, \n     California Renewable Fuels \n     Partnership, Citizens Committee to Complete the Refuge, Clean \n     Energy Now (Greenpeace), Clean Fuels Development Coalition, \n     Climate Solutions, Cook Inlet Keeper, County of Ventura \n     Public Works Department, Earth Island Journal, Environmental \n     and Energy Study Institute, Ethanol Producers and Consumers, \n     General Biomass Company, Governors' Ethanol Coalition, \n     Illinois Student Environmental Network, Institute for \n     Agriculture & Trade Policy, Institute for Local Self-\n     Reliance, International Marine Mammal Project, Kettle Range \n     Conservation Group, Kinergy Resources, Mangrove Action \n     Project, Masada Resource Group, National Grain Sorghum \n     Producers, New River Foundation, New Uses Council, Northwoods \n     Conservation Association, Oceanic Resource Foundation, Oregon \n     Environmental Council, Pacific Biodiversity Institute, Plumas \n     Corporation, Renewable Energy Action Project, Save Our \n     Shores, Soybean Producers of America, The Brower Fund, The \n     Minnesota Project, Tides Foundation, Union of Concerned \n     Scientists, Waste Action Project, Waterkeeper Alliance, West \n     Coast People's Energy Co-op, and Women Involved in Farm \n     Economics.\n\tMr. BOND. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and, just for good measure, I urge them to oppose all of the other amendments which seem to be targeted at ethanol. The manager of the bill, Senator Domenici, has pointed out that we see many attacks coming on ethanol. I ask my colleagues to continue to support ethanol and reject this and the other amendments.\n\tI thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes remaining.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to yield a couple of minutes to my friend from New Mexico. Before I do, I wish to point out that I consider this an ethanol-friendly amendment because I believe there will be much more confidence in ethanol as an additive to our gasoline if people know there are no special waivers of liability, that this fuel will have to be subjected to the same rigorous standards in a court of law should something go wrong.\n\tI do not envision this as an unfriendly amendment, although I know some of my colleagues feel otherwise.\n\tIt is my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\tMr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for offering the amendment. I do support the amendment.\n\tThe general rule which has served us well in this country is that if you design or manufacture a product that proves to be defective and that product then injures someone, you can be held liable. That has allowed us to protect the health and safety of the American people. It is a substantial protection for all of us.\n\tThis safe harbor provision that the Senator from California wants to strike says:\n\n       No renewable fuel shall be deemed to be defective in design \n     or in manufacture or no motor vehicle fuel that contains \n     renewable fuel shall be deemed to be defective in design and \n     manufacture.\n\n\tTo my mind, it is unwise public policy for us to be writing into law this kind of exception to the general tort laws that we operate under in the country. We do not know enough, frankly. We do not know what the scientific and health experts are going to find when they fully investigate the impact of tripling the use of ethanol on the air that we breathe and the water we drink.\n\tI certainly hope they will find there is no harmful health effect from it, but to say we are going to prohibit anyone from recovering if they are damaged from the design or manufacture of any of these renewable fuels I think is a big mistake.\n\tI compliment the Senator from California. I support her amendment. I yield the floor.\n\tMrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment by my colleague from California to strke the so-called ``safe harbor provision'' in the amendment offered by the majority leader that would shield ethanol producers and refiners from any liability if the fuel additive harms the environment or public health.\n\tCandidly, I find this ``safe harbor provision'' astounding.\n\tI believe it is egregious public policy to mandate ethanol into our fuel supply in the first place--and even worse to provide complete liability protection to the fuel additive before scientific and health experts can fully investigate the impact of tripling ethanol on the air we breathe and the water we drink.\n\tThis is exactly the mistake we made with MTBE. Over the past several years, we have learned that MTBE has contaminated our water and may be a human carcinogen.\n\tAs exemplified by our Nation's experience with MTBE, there can be severe environmental and health repercussions when we mandate the use of any one fuel additive.\n\tLast fall a California jury found there was ``clear and convincing evidence'' that three major oil companies acted ``with malice'' by polluting ground water at Lake Tahoe with MTBE because the gasoline they sold was ``defective in design'' and there was failure to warn of its pollution hazard. After a 5-month trial, Shell Oil and Lyondell Chemical Company were found guilty of withholding information on the dangers of MTBE. The firms settled with the South Lake Tahoe Water District for $69 million.\n\tThis case demonstrates why we cannot surrender the rights of citizens to hold polluters accountable for harm they inflict.\n\tHow can the Senate favor exempting the ethanol industry from this kind of wrongdoing? I urge my colleagues to take a look at the so-called ``safe harbor'' provision that will give the ethanol industry unprecedented protection against consumers and communities that may seek legal redress against the harm ethanol may cause.\n\tOur amendment would strike this ridiculous exemption.\n\tIf we do not strike this provision, polluters will receive unprecedented protection from damage to public health or the environment.\n\tIf we do not strike this provision, what incentive will there be for ethanol manufacturers and refiners to make their products as safe as possible and thoroughly test their long-term effects?\n\tIf we do not strike this provision, how else can we hold manufacturers accountable when fuel additives cause harm?\n\tMandating ethanol into our fuel supply raises serious health and environmental concerns. What effect will an ethanol mandate have on our environment? What are the health risks?\n\tAlthough the scientific opinion is not unanimous, evidence suggests that; one, reformulated gasoline with ethanol produces more smog pollution than reformulated gas without it; and, two, ethanol enables the toxic chemicals in gasoline to break apart and seep further into groundwater even faster than conventional gasoline.\n\tEthanol is often made out to be an ideal ``renewable fuel'' giving off fewer emissions. Yet, on balance, ethanol can be a cause of more air pollution because it produces smog in the summer months. Smog is a powerful respiratory irritant that affects large segments of the population. It has an especially pernicious effect on the elderly, children, and individuals with existing respiratory problems such as asthma.\n\tJust last week the American Lung Association named California the smoggiest state by listing nine counties and six metropolitan areas in California as having the worst conditions.\n\tA 1999 report from the National Academy of Sciences found, ``the use of commonly available oxygenates [like ethanol] in [Reformulated Gasoline] has little impact on improving ozone air quality and has some disadvantages. Moreover, some data suggest that oxygenates can lead to higher Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emissions.'' Nitrogen Oxides are known to cause smog.\n\tThe American Lung Association report also noted that half of Americans are living in counties with unhealthy smog levels. Why would we want to take the chance of increasing these unhealthy smog levels by mandating billions of unnecessary gallons of ethanol into our fuel supply?\n\tThus, ethanol can be both good and bad for air quality. To me it would make sense to maximize the advantages of ethanol, while minimizing the disadvantages. This is exactly why States should have flexibility to decide what goes into their gasoline in order to meet clean air standards, and ethanol should not be mandated--certainly not at this level. And if we are mandating it, why exempt manufacturers and refiners from their legal responsibility to provide a safe product?\n\tEvidence also suggests that ethanol accelerates the ability of toxins found in gasoline to seep into our groundwater supplies. The EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates found ethanol ``may retard biodegradation and increase movement of benzene and other hydrocarbons around leaking tanks.''\n\tAnd according to a report by the State of California entitled ``Health and Environmental Assessment of the Use of Ethanol as a Fuel Oxygenate,'' there are valid questions about the impact of ethanol on ground and surface water. An analysis in the report found there will be a 20 percent increase in public drinking water wells contaminated with benzene if a significant amount of ethanol is used. Benzene is a known human carcinogen.\n\tAt a hearing held on the House side last year, Professor Gordon Rausser of UC Berkeley commented on the potential harm of ethanol on groundwater. Professor Rausser testified:\n\n     when gasoline that contains ethanol is released into \n     groundwater, the resulting benzene plumes can be longer and \n     more persistent than plumes resulting from releases of \n     conventional gasoline. Research suggests that the presence of \n     ethanol in gasoline will delay the degradation of benzene and \n     will lengthen the benzene plumes by between 25 percent and \n     100 percent.\n\n\tThis evidence on the potential harm of ethanol is extraordinarily troubling.\n\tI am at a loss to understand why the Senate would support sweeping liability protection for fuel producers. Taking away the ability of families and communities to seek redress for the harm caused by fuel additives is NOT something I believe this Senate should be doing.\n\tLet me read part of a letter sent by California Attorney General Bill Lockyer opposing the ethanol safe harbor provision. Lockyer writes:\n\n       Congress should not enact the current safeharbor \n     provisions, which could be construed as granting oil \n     companies a very broad immunity. As exemplified by MTBE, \n     there can be dire consequences from the use of defective fuel \n     additives.\n\n\tLockyer continues:\n\n       If there is a defect with a particular fuel, the oil \n     companies should be held accountable under the common law \n     principles for using such a fuel. In addition, by including \n     fuels and not just renewable fuels, this section has a \n     extraordinarily broad reach. There is no reason to add \n     immunity for a fuel just because one drop of renewable fuel \n     is added to that fuel. For as long as automobiles have been \n     used, oil companies have been subject to common law product \n     liability rules. There is no need to change these fundamental \n     principles.\n\n\tWe need to protect the basic rights American families enjoy remain in place to keep our air and water safe.\n\tI urge my colleagues to support this amendment to protect our communities from harm caused by fuel additives.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this debate is winding down and my colleagues are here to offer other amendments. I am going to finish shortly.\n\tAt this point in the debate, we ought to get real about what this is. There are certain matters that are right in society and there are certain matters that are wrong. It is not right to give special protection to one particular manufacturing group in this country that no one else gets. In a way, it is a subsidy given to those people because if there is a problem in the future with ethanol, guess who is going to pick up the tab? Guess who is going to pay the bill? Not the people who caused the problem but the taxpayers. That is wrong.\n\tIf we had a wonderful history, if we did not have communities in trouble because of MTBE and other additives we thought would be great, it would be different.\n\tI see my friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, is in the Chamber for another amendment. The Citizens for a Future New Hampshire support the Boxer amendment because they do not want to be left holding the bag if something happens.\n\tThere is right and there is wrong. This issue, to me, is very clear: It is right to protect the people; it is wrong to give a special interest waiver to a particular manufacturer.\n\tThere is private special interest and there is public interest--taxpayers versus those who would pollute.\n\tFinally, when my colleagues say they are only banning one type of option for citizens who are injured, namely effective product liability, that is all they are doing. People can still use the nuisance claim and the negligence claim and all of these other claims.\n\n\tI hope they know they are forgetting recent history where there was a court case on MTBE, also an additive to gasoline, and what did the court say? The nuisance claim, denied; the negligence claim, denied. The only claim that could hold up, the only claim that could save the taxpayers of Lake Tahoe, who had a mess with MTBE, was defective product liability.\n\tMy colleagues stand up and say that is the only thing we are doing. They called it a narrow safe harbor. Well, it is an enormous safe harbor because it is the only place people can go to get recompense if ethanol turns out to be a problem.\n\tMy colleague from Missouri says there is a study in this underlying bill. Well, I am glad there is a study, but he is ignoring the fact that there has already been a study in 1999 by EPA's blue ribbon panel, and this is what they said: Ethanol is extremely soluble in water and would spread if leaked into the environment. It may further spread plumes of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and ethanol may inhibit the breakdown of these toxic materials.\n\tIt says it may inhibit. That means it may be a problem. If my colleagues, in their zeal to have ethanol in every single State in this country--and, by the way, it will be--and if they are so sure it is safe, then why on Earth are they saying ethanol should get special treatment, and why do they close down the door on the only area where people have found they have a chance to get cleanup money from the polluters? The answer is, they do not know if it is safe.\n\tWe hope it is safe. We hoped MTBE would be safe, and it has poisoned hundreds of wells in this country. Hundreds of water systems have shut down because of MTBE. And if it was not for the product liability claim being open to citizens, who would have to clean up the mess? Not the companies that caused it but the taxpayers in those areas.\n\tSo it seems to me, if I might use the word ``disingenuous,'' to say that ethanol is 100 percent safe, but we want a safe harbor so no one can sue if something goes wrong.\n\tI was not born yesterday. That is obvious. I know when somebody says they have the safest product in the world but give me special protection so that no one can ever sue me, my antenna goes up, just as a person with common sense, and I say that is not right.\n\tResearchers say that more ground water wells will experience contamination from MTBE and benzene, which is a carcinogen, if ethanol leaks into water supply, and there are the questions about the impact of ethanol on sensitive populations, our children.\n\tNow, there is not one Senator who does not want to protect kids. Come on. We know that. Most of us are parents. A lot of us are grandparents. We are aunts, we are uncles. We want to protect our children and we want to protect the Nation's children. How can we close our eyes, then, to what we are about to do if we do not agree to this Boxer amendment? What we are doing is saying that the makers of this product do not have to worry about a thing in terms of harming our kids.\n\tOur kids, because of the developmental stage they are in--they are growing, they are changing, their hormones are starting--they are very sensitive to contaminants. We know that. That is why I wrote the Children's Environmental Protection Act, and parts of it have been passed by the Senate. I am so proud of it. Is it not better to say up front to a manufacturer--any manufacturer--if they harm children, we can take them to court and they are going to have to clean up the mess and clean up their product?\n\n\tOh, no, not if they are making ethanol. They are going to have special exemption. It breaks my heart to see us do this. I figure I will lose this amendment only because we tried it once before and we did lose it.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator from California her time has expired.\n\tMrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for one additional minute, to close. \n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMrs. BOXER. So there are unanswered questions surrounding ethanol. There are unanswered questions according to the EPA special panel in 1999, and all the Senator from California is saying to her colleagues is this: Just make sure this product, which is going to be a new product in several States, that it does not have special advantages so that if something happens, the makers of the product do not get off scott-free. That is not right. It is un-American. It is not fair. It is an unfunded mandate on our communities.\n\tI was happy to hear Senator Bond say he does not support a waiver for MTBE--good for him--because we need to strip that out of the House bill. But this is a new day. This is a new additive, and we should hold it to the same responsibility as we hold all other additives, all other products. Because if MTBE had this waiver, communities all over this country would be in trouble.\n\tI thank my colleagues very much for listening to me. I feel very strongly about this. I hope we will have a good ``aye'' vote.\n\tI ask for the yeas and nays, and also ask the amendment be set aside for a vote at a later time.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\tThere appears to be a sufficient second.\n\tThe yeas and nays were ordered.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President: May I ask the managers of the bill approximately what time they expect to be voting on the Boxer amendment?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. At this point it looks as if we are not going to vote on anything until about 3, and the Boxer amendment would be second or third in line.\n\tMrs. BOXER. That is fine. I say to my friend, could I have 1 minute at that point, and a minute on the other side, to explain the amendment?\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Unless the Senator wants to seek that consent at this point, there is no such arrangement.\n\tMrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent at this point.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that 2 minutes has already been provided in the unanimous consent agreement, so the Senator will have that 1 minute.\n\tMrs. BOXER. I yield the floor.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham of South Carolina). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the consent of the minority, I make the following unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that--I withhold until the minority whip is present, Mr. President.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, now I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 today the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to the Schumer amendment No. 853, to be followed immediately by a vote in relation to the Boxer amendment No. 856, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Boxer amendment No. 854; provided further that following those votes the Senate proceed immediately to a vote on the adoption of amendment No. 850, without further intervening action or debate.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe Senator from Nevada.\n\tMr. REID. Mr. President, also for the information of Senators, I have spoken to the two managers of the bill. There are a number of people who are ready to offer amendments. The Republican manager of the bill has an amendment waiting to go. We also have a very important amendment on which there has been an agreement on the time for that amendment. We would want that set up for early next week. It is one of the most important amendments in this whole bill.\n\tBut we are not going to be able to move forward until 3:30 on anything, until the two leaders announce to the floor managers that there has been something worked out on the amendment originally offered by the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln.\n\tIt is my understanding that there has been work done to arrive at a point where that matter can be disposed of, but until that is done, we are not going to move forward on anything other than these.\n\tAs I indicated, the two leaders may even be talking as we speak. Until we hear from them, we will be happy to fill in this time, until 3:30, with the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, or whatever the two managers think is appropriate. But until then, we are not going to agree to set it aside to move to anything else.\n\tSo we have no problem talking about the bill or amendments that may be offered. But until the matter involving the child tax credit is worked out with the two leaders, we are not going to move forward on this bill.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. For the information of the Senate, I might indicate that the second of the Boxer amendments, which had been listed in the unanimous consent, is probably not going to require a rollcall vote but will be adopted by voice. Immediately after that, the underlying ethanol amendment will be voted on, and a rollcall vote is being required on that.\n\tThe Senator from New Mexico, the manager of the bill, intends when appropriate, when matters have been agreed on between the leadership, that we can proceed to offer an Indian amendment, which I think then would be followed by a second-degree amendment by the Senator from New Mexico, the minority manager of the bill.\n\n\tWe are also pursuing with a degree of vigor an effort to see if we cannot get Senator Gregg and Senator Kennedy to agree to work out the LIHEAP portion of this bill. There are two amendments there. If they are able to work that out, that will put us in a position where we will dispose of that entire matter sometime this afternoon, hopefully. It seems they are very close to working that out, if the Senator is.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\tMr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, let me indicate my best information is they are still insisting that we not deal with LIHEAP in this legislation, which is of course not my position. I think we should deal with it.\n\tAccordingly, I would not agree to just a sense of the Senate on that subject, which is their preference, as I understand it.\n\tI hope we can persuade them otherwise. If not, then we will have to have a vote.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. In any event, I am pursuing them so that there will be a vote. Sooner or later we would like to dispose of it. If they insist, they can have a vote on the first part of theirs. If they win or lose, that leaves you in a position of whether you have the amendment on this bill or not, depending upon the disposition of the first, the amendment that precedes it, both of which have been set aside by consent and are pending action by the Senate.\n\tI see my friend Senator Wyden on the floor. I know we had been talking about a proposed agreement with reference to a matter on nuclear power. Let me suggest to the Senator, we are in accord as to that. We will enter into it but not at this point. We are examining the language carefully. But you have our assurance that at an appropriate time today that agreement will be entered into and then we will be ready to have a very important vote sometime on the day of Tuesday with reference to nuclear power, with you being a proponent of a motion to strike.\n\tMr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I could just respond, Senator Sununu and I will be in the Chamber talking in a bit more detail. I always appreciate the graciousness of the chairman of the committee in working with me. I think we are going to get an agreement. There are probably a lot more Senators who will want to speak on this than first estimated.\n\tSo the Senate knows, originally Senator Sununu and I were prepared to offer an amendment to strike the $16 billion for nuclear subsidies. The amendment is supported strongly by the Taxpayers Union, but at the request of the chairman of the committee, that vote will be put over until next week.\n\tI am very hopeful that we will be able to get a consent agreement before long to have this debate. This is a significant exposure for taxpayers. It is not a question of whether someone is pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear. The Congressional Budget Office has said that there is at least a 50-percent risk of failure with respect to these facilities. The Congressional Research Service has indicated the taxpayers will be on the hook for in the vicinity of $16 billion.\n\tWhat I worry about is what happened in our part of the country. Four out of five facilities were never built. In this case, if the Congressional Budget Office is right and you have over a 50-percent risk of failure at these facilities, this will be a huge exposure for taxpayers.\n\tI tell Senators there is no other source of energy in this legislation which gets a direct subsidy for building a facility.\n\tI am going to try to find a way to reach a procedural accommodation with the chairman of the committee. I am a personal friend, and I want to accommodate him. I hope we will be able do that.\n\tThis is a very significant taxpayer issue for the Senate. It is not a question of whether someone is pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear. In my own inimitable way, I have managed to make both sides mad over my career in public service. But it is a taxpayer issue of enormous importance.\n\tI hope Senators will read what the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service have had to say about this. The Congressional Budget Office reports that there is more than a 50-percent risk of failure with respect to these facilities, if subsidized. The Congressional Research Service has talked about a $16 billion subsidy.\n\tI would point out that this is even too rich for the blood of the other body. The other body has not talked about anything like this.\n\tWe will work with the chairman of the committee. Senator Sununu and I will be coming to the floor before long as well so that we can begin to lay out the bipartisan support we have with Senator Bingaman, the ranking minority member, Senator Ensign, and others.\n\tI would just tell the chairman of the committee that I think there are probably more Senators who want to discuss this than we thought. We already have some indication that 90 minutes equally divided with an up-or-down vote may not be enough. It is my intention to work with the chairman of the committee, the ranking minority member, and others to try to work out this unanimous consent so we can have that done expeditiously.\n\tI point out that this Senator and the Senator from New Hampshire were asked to come today to have our amendment brought up. We felt pretty good about it. We know there is going to be an awful lot of back and forth with Senators between now and the time we vote Tuesday.\n\tI ask that Senators look at the Congressional Budget Office report and the Congressional Research Service report over the next few days as the discussions go on and off the floor.\n\tI look forward to working this out in terms of procedure with the chairman of the committee probably over the next hour or so.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we will have a great deal of time to discuss what I believe is the most important issue for America's future; that is, are we going to have an alternate source of energy for electricity, aside and apart from coal and natural gas?\n\tI believe the time has come. We ought to set in motion the authorization--not the approval, not the appropriations, but the authorization--to start down the path that says the United States may be ready to build a nuclear powerplant. The arguments that have just been made in anticipation of the agreement are not exactly as such. This bill says America should have an opportunity to have a variety of energy sources. We have provided subsidies for coal so that coal can be made clean and delivered to our people as clean as possible. That is subsidized. We have an enormous tax subsidy for wind and energy. In fact, it is so big and so current that there will be windmills built all over this country, and the amount is a direct tax credit. It is not something that may happen. Every time one of those windmills is built, the tax credit will apply and money will be used in large quantities.\n\tIn addition, we are talking about whether nuclear powerplants are being built today. For instance, General Electric nuclear powerplants are being designed and built in Taiwan right now at a cost--believe it or not, and which we will show here to the Senate--that belies all of the information that is submitted by the Congressional Budget Office, which we believe is speculative. It will be shown that they are constructing these nuclear powerplants at $1,250 a kilowatt. That means they are perilously close today to producing nuclear powerplants that will be competitive with natural gas in the United States.\n\tWe are not asking the Senate for any of this to happen. We are saying that, as a matter of policy, we should put in the Energy bill the opportunity for this to happen. We will go into great detail as to the conditions, how it will happen, how it won't happen, and who has to approve and who has to disapprove.\n\tWe think before we are finished, we will have convinced a majority of Senators that the time has come to give a rebirth to this alternative source so that if, as a matter of fact, in the next decade or so the need arises, we will be ready, willing, and able to move ahead.\n\tHaving said that, I have just indicated nothing else is going to happen in the Senate until sometime around 3 o'clock or 3:30. We will try to get our unanimous consent agreement sometime this afternoon.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tMr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to be very brief. In fact, we are going to get an agreement with the Senator from New Mexico to work out the process for considering nuclear subsidies.\n\tI just want to make sure Senators are clear with respect to what the subsidy is all about. The Senator from New Mexico, the distinguished chairman of the committee, said wind is going to get vast amounts of subsidies. I wanted to point out to the chairman that if wind farms produce power, they get a tax credit for the energy they produce. But wind farms do not get any subsidy to build a facility.\n\tWhat is unique about the $16 billion exposure for taxpayers is only one energy source, under this legislation, gets a subsidy to build a facility. That has troubled the National Taxpayers Union. That is why they have been a strong supporter of the Wyden-Sununu amendment. This is not going to be about whether you are pro-nuclear or anti-nuclear. This is about whether Senators want to put at risk the taxpayers of the country for the prospect that the Congressional Budget Office has said has a 50-percent or higher failure with respect to constructing these facilities.\n\tWe will have more to say about the bipartisan Wyden-Sununu amendment before long, but I wrap up this part of the discussion by simply saying, again, I hope Senators will look at what the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service have had to say about that. Those are reports that lay out, in a frank and objective way, what the risk is for taxpayers. I hope Senators will review it carefully.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\tMr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to speak for 15 minutes as in morning business.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Akaka pertaining to the submission of the resolution are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Submitted Resolutions.'')\n\tMr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll. \n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sununu). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is currently debating S. 14.\n\tMr. BYRD. What is the pending question before the Senate, Mr. President?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Frist-Daschle amendment No. 850.\n\tMr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n\tMr. President, is the Senate operating under any time control at the moment?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time control. There is no time agreement.\n\tMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have one final question. Has the Pastore rule expired?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Pastore rule expired 5 seconds ago.\n\tMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n\n             Iraq's WMD Intelligence: Where is the Outrage?\n\n\tMr. BYRD. Mr. President, with each passing day, the questions concerning and surrounding Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction take on added urgency. Where are the massive stockpiles of VX, mustard, and other nerve agents that we were told Iraq was hoarding? Where are the thousands of liters of botulinim toxin? Wasn't it the looming threat to America posed by these weapons that propelled the United States into war with Iraq? Isn't this the reason American military personnel were called upon to risk their lives in mortal combat?\n\tOn March 17, in his final speech to the American people before ordering the invasion of Iraq, President Bush took one last opportunity to bolster his case for war. The centerpiece of his argument was the same message he brought to the United Nations months before, and the same message he hammered home at every opportunity in the intervening months, namely that Saddam Hussein had failed to destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and thus presented an imminent danger to the American people. ``Intelligence gathered by this and other governments leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised,'' the President said.\n\tNow, nearly 2 months after the fall of Baghdad, the United States has yet to find any physical evidence of those lethal weapons. Could they be buried underground or are they somehow camouflaged in plain sight? Have they been shipped outside of the country? Do they actually exist? The questions are mounting. What started weeks ago as a restless murmur throughout Iraq has intensified into a worldwide cacophony of confusion.\n\tThe fundamental question that is nagging at many is this: How reliable were the claims of this President and key members of his administration that Iraq's weapons of mass destruction posed a clear and imminent threat to the United States, such a grave threat that immediate war was the only recourse?\n\tLawmakers, who were assured before the war that weapons of mass destruction would be found in Iraq, and many of whom voted--now get this--to give this administration a sweeping grant of authority to wage war based upon those assurances, have now been placed in the uncomfortable position of wondering if they were misled. The media is ratcheting up the demand for answers: Could it be that the intelligence was wrong, or could it be that the facts were manipulated a little here, a little there? These are very serious and grave questions, and they require immediate answers. We cannot--and must not--brush such questions aside. We owe the people of this country an answer. Those people who are listening, who are watching this Chamber, and every Member of this body ought to be demanding answers.\n\tI am encouraged that the Senate Armed Services and Intelligence Committees are planning to investigate the credibility of the intelligence that was used to build the case for war against Iraq. We need a thorough, open, gloves-off investigation of this matter, and we need it quickly. The credibility of the President and his administration hangs in the balance. We must not trifle with the people's trust by foot-dragging.\n\tWhat amazes me is that the President himself is not clamoring for an investigation. It is his integrity, President Bush's integrity, that is on the line. It is his truthfulness that is being questioned. It is his leadership that has come under scrutiny. And yet he has raised no question that I have heard. He has expressed no curiosity about the strange turn of events in Iraq. He has expressed no anger at the possibility that he might have been misled by people in his own administration. How is it that the President, who was so adamant about the dangers of WMD, has expressed no concern over the whereabouts of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?\n\tIndeed, instead of leading the charge to uncover the discrepancy between what we were told before the war and what we have found--or failed to find--since the war, the White House is circling the wagons and scoffing at the notion that anyone in the administration exaggerated the threat from Iraq.\n\tIn an interview with Polish television last week, President Bush noted that two trailers were found in Iraq that U.S. intelligence officials believe are mobile biological weapons production labs, although no trace of chemical or biological material was found in the trailers. ``We found the weapons of mass destruction,'' the President was quoted as saying. But certainly he cannot be satisfied with such meager evidence.\n\tAt the CIA, Director George Tenet released a terse statement the other day defending the intelligence his agency provided on Iraq. ``The integrity of our process was maintained throughout and any suggestion to the contrary is simply wrong,'' he said. How can he be so absolutely sure?\n\tAt the Pentagon, Doug Feith, the Undersecretary of Defense for policy, held a rare press conference this week to deny reports that a high-level intelligence cell in the Defense Department doctored data and pressured the CIA to strengthen the case for war. ``I know of no pressure. I can't rule out what other people may have perceived. Who knows what people perceive,'' he said. Is this administration not at all concerned about the perception of deception? The perception is there.\n\tAnd Secretary of State Powell, who presented the U.S. case against Iraq to the United Nations last February, strenuously defended his presentation in an interview this week and denied any erosion in the administration's credibility. ``Everybody knows that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction,'' he said. Should he not be more concerned than that about U.S. claims before the United Nations?\n\tAnd yet . . . and yet . . . the questions continue to grow, and the doubts are beginning to drown out the assurances. For every insistence from Washington that the weapons of mass destruction case against Iraq is sound comes a counterpoint from the field--another dry hole, another dead end.\n\tAs the top Marine general in Iraq was recently quoted as saying, ``It was a surprise to me then, it remains a surprise to me now, that we have not uncovered weapons, as you say, in some of the forward dispersal sites. Again, believe me, it's not for lack of trying. We've been to virtually every ammunition supply point between the Kuwaiti border and Baghdad, but they're simply not there.''\n\tWho are the American people to believe? What are we to think? Even though I opposed the war against Iraq because I believe that the doctrine of preemption is a flawed and dangerous instrument of foreign policy, I did believe that Saddam Hussein possessed some chemical and biological weapons capability. But I did not believe that he presented an imminent threat to the United States as indeed he did not.\n\tSuch weapons may eventually turn up. I said so weeks ago; they may eventually turn up. But my greater fear is that the belligerent stance of the United States may have convinced Saddam Hussein to sell or disperse his weapons to dark forces outside of Iraq. Shouldn't this administration be equally alarmed if they really believed that Saddam had such dangerous capabilities?\n\tThe administration took steps to protect the oil facilities in Iraq from being damaged and set on fire. The administration took extraordinary steps to do that. Why did it not take equally extraordinary steps to protect chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear weapons, possibly, from being looted, from being stolen, from being taken away by those who would sell them, possibly, to terrorists?\n\tSaddam Hussein is missing. Osama bin Laden is missing. Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are missing. And the President's mild claims that we are ``on the look'' do not comfort me. There ought to be an army of UN inspectors combing the countryside in Iraq or searching for evidence of disbursement of these weapons right now. Why are we waiting? Is there fear of the unknown or fear of the truth?\n\tThis nation--and, indeed, the world--was led into war with Iraq on the grounds that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and posed an imminent threat to the United States and to the global community. As the President said in his March 17 address to the Nation, ``The danger is clear: using chemical, biological or, one day, nuclear weapons, obtained with the help of Iraq, the terrorists could fulfill their stated ambitions and kill thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country, or any other.''\n\tThat fear may still be valid, but I wonder how the war with Iraq has really mitigated the threat from terrorists. As the recent attack in Saudi Arabia proved, terrorism is alive and well and unaffected by the situation in Iraq.\n\tMeanwhile, the President seems oblivious to the controversy swirling about the justification for the invasion of Iraq. Our Nation's credibility before the world is at stake. While his administration digs in to defend the status quo, Members of Congress are questioning the credibility of the intelligence and the public case made by this administration on which the war with Iraq was based. Members of the media, Members of the fourth estate, are openly challenging whether America's intelligence agencies were simply wrong or were callously manipulated. Vice President Cheney's numerous visits to the CIA are being portrayed by some intelligence professionals as ``pressure.'' And the American people are wondering, once again, what is going on in the dark shadows of Washington.\n\tIt is time that we had some answers. It is time that the American people were given some answers. It is time that the administration stepped up its acts to reassure the American people that the horrific weapons that the administration told us threatened the world's safety have not fallen into terrorist hands. It is time that the President leveled with the American people. It is time that the President of the United States demanded that we get to the bottom of this matter and to follow every lead, regardless of where that lead goes.\n\tWe have waged a costly war against Iraq. American fighting men and women are still dying in Iraq. We have prevailed. But we are still losing, as I said, still losing American lives in that nation. And the troubled situation there is far from settled. American troops will likely be needed there for months, many months--even years. Billions of American tax dollars will continue to be needed to rebuild that country. I only hope that we have not won the war only to lose the peace. Until we have determined the fate of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, or determined that they, in fact, did not exist, we cannot rest, we cannot claim victory.\n\n\tIraq's weapons of mass destruction remain a mystery, an enigma, a conundrum. What are they, where are they, how dangerous are they? Or were they a manufactured excuse by an administration eager to seize a country? It is time these questions were answered. It is time--past time--for the administration to level with the American people, and it is time for the President of the United States to demand an accounting from his own administration as to exactly how our Nation was led down such a twisted path to war. His credibility and the credibility of this Nation is at stake.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I understand we are on energy.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\tMr. THOMAS. We need to talk a little bit about energy. I think that is what we are on. That is what we are doing this week. I must confess, I am a little disappointed that we seem to get off on other things that are unrelated when it seems to me that doing something with an energy policy to try and look ahead in this country as to where we need to be on energy is among the most important things that we could possibly do.\n\tI understand there are different views about how you do that, and that it is legitimate to talk about those, but I do feel badly when we move off on something that isn't related when we are trying to get this done. I think it is important that we do it. We are obviously ready to move on to health care and Medicare and pharmaceuticals the week after next. But we have been over this now. Last year we worked very hard trying to do something with energy. We passed it here. I think the process that was used was not conducive to a successful finish and, indeed, we didn't have one. But this year we went through the committee. We have already discussed all these issues. We have argued back and forth.\n\tObviously, not everyone agrees, but I think it is hard not to agree that energy is one of the things that affects most of us more than almost anything else that we can do here. It affects whether we have lights. It affects whether we have heat. It affects whether we have an opportunity to use our automobile. And, more importantly, it has a great deal to do with security for this country. So I really feel strongly that we should get on with it. We should come up with an energy policy out of the Senate. We should go into conference committee with the House.\n\tRemember, one of the first things that the President and the Vice President did when they came into office was to outline an energy policy recognizing how important that is. Since that time, we have, of course, had more and more unrest and more and more war and terrorism in the Middle East. We have allowed ourselves to get into a position where 60 percent of our oil comes in on imports. We are that dependent, which is very risky. We have seen it move up and down and have different effects over the country when different things happen with regard to energy. Yet we seem kind of lackadaisical about trying to deal with it in terms of policy.\n\tLet me emphasize that is what we are talking about here is a policy. In my view, a policy normally indicates that you are trying to look ahead at what you think the situation ought to be in the future with regard to that issue, what it means to your family and to your community and to the country, to try and get a vision of where we want to be in 10 or 15 years with respect to energy. And having established a policy of that kind, obviously, then it becomes much easier and more effective and more useful to measure the things we do in the interim as to how they affect the accomplishment and the realization of that vision and policy that we have seen.\n\tI must confess that I am a little concerned from time to time that vision is not always something that has a very high priority in the Senate, and that really ought to be our major concern--seeing what we can do here to accommodate reaching certain goals in the future.\n\tSo we are talking here about an energy policy that has been drafted, a rather general, wide energy policy that I think is very important. We are talking in this policy about conservation, about ways to save on the amount of energy we have and the needs we have. We are talking about finding alternatives so that we can have access to different kinds of energy than we have had in the past. We are talking about research so that we can do things such as have more clean coal, so we have better air quality with respect to generating electricity. We are talking about the possibility of converting some of our fossil fuels to things such as hydrogen so that we are able to move them about easier, able to have a cleaner environment. And we are able to do all of these things. \n\tOf course, very important among all of these is to increase domestic production. We have great opportunities for production in this country. Much of it lies in the West. I happen to be from the West. Our State is 50 percent owned by the Federal Government. Many of these resources are on those Federal lands. Now, we have to do that carefully so that we have a balance between protecting the environment, on the one hand, and using the resources for energy, or whatever, on the other hand. We can do that. It is our responsibility to be particularly careful. We have the largest resource of fossil fuel for this country in the future, which is coal. We have an opportunity to do a great deal with coal. We met this morning in the Environment Committee on finding new ways to set standards for SO2, and for other air quality standards, including mercury. We can do those things.\n\tThat is what part of this bill is about--moving us forward in being able to produce energy and, at the same time, protect the environment, which all of us want to do. But we need to move forward to be able to do that. We need to have easier access to public lands and multiple-use lands, and have all the other uses as well for energy extraction. Certainly, we won't want to use some lands for that. We will set them aside as wilderness and special use. We have more wilderness in Wyoming than in any other State in the country--except perhaps Alaska.\n\tIn any event, these are the kinds of issues with which we are faced. They are not insurmountable. As a matter of fact, they are problems to which we have the solution, but we seem hesitant to move forward and get this job behind us. So I hope we will.\n\tWe have to modernize our infrastructure. Many things have changed. It is not as if energy production remains the same over the years. In years past, in the matter of electricity, you had a distribution area where an electric company generated the electricity for everybody. Now we are finding more and more that we generate electricity one place and the market is somewhere else. So you have to have transmission. We can find more efficient ways for transmission with the kind of research that we do and take the same transmission line and make some changes in it, and it has much more capacity. But you have to move to do that.\n\n\tWe find that almost all the generation plants built in the last several years are oil fueled. The fact is, if you really want to look at the future, there are many more uses for oil than for coal. We ought to be using coal for the generation of electricity and oil and gas for other kinds of functions. That makes a lot of sense. But we fail to set the incentives to cause ourselves to be able to do that.\n\tAfter all of our needs for electricity, we find that absent hydro, which makes it about 7 percent, the renewables represent only 3 percent of our electric supply. People keep talking about renewables. The fact is that until we do some more research, making them more efficient, they are not going to be able to have a significant impact. But there is a possibility of doing that. That is what this policy is all about. That is what we need to be doing, is moving forward to find some ways for transmission and to do those kinds of things.\n\tWe really have a lot of opportunities to move forward, and I think we can do that. As I said, I come from a place where we have probably the richest source of coal. We provide about 14 percent of the coal now of the United States. We are seventh in oil production and fifth in gas production. Those are challenges. And there is really kind of an exciting opportunity to do some more with hydrogen. Take coal and manufacturing hydrogen, which can be used for cars and homes and for many things--probably the cleanest energy we have talked about.\n\tThere are some opportunities to do a better job with nuclear power. We have States in which about 30 percent of the energy is produced by nuclear power. We have to be able to do more work and research, particularly on waste--probably the cleanest resource for the production of electricity.\n\tI am simply trying to say that I understand there are different views about how some of these things are done. Obviously, that is legitimate and we ought to talk about that. But we ought to move forward and get the idea that this matter of energy policy is one of the most important things we can do. We have done something on taxes, and we are going to do something on health care. If we can do something on energy as well, we will have one of the most productive periods we have had for a long time. We have a great opportunity to do that.\n\tSo I certainly urge that we take a long look at what we are doing and find a way to move forward. Everyone should be given the opportunity to put in their amendments. That is fine. But you cannot keep waiting for days and days to get all the amendments in. We have been talking about this for several weeks, yet we keep hearing, ``We have not drafted our amendment yet.'' If you are serious about an amendment, get it drafted and get it out there. Let's deal with it and move forward in accomplishing the goal we have before us, which is a great opportunity to move forward in this country economically, to create jobs, and to do more for security and make our life better over a period of time, which is something we all seek to do.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Alexander). The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. SUNUNU. Mr. President, I wish to take a few moments in this debate on the Energy bill to talk about an amendment that my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden and I will offer next week. He is the lead sponsor on the amendment. I certainly hope we can win strong bipartisan support for what will be an effort to make this Energy bill better, to improve it, and improve it in a way that does justice for the taxpayers by eliminating what I think is an inappropriate and unnecessary subsidy for the energy industry in general, and for the nuclear power industry in particular.\n\tOur amendment will strike one small section of the bill. It is a section that provides federally backed loan guarantees for new nuclear powerplant construction.\n\tI strongly believe we should have a diversified energy supply in this country. We should have competitive energy markets, and nuclear power is a very important part of that mix. Nuclear power has proven itself time and again. It has been cost effective and environmentally sound. We have worked through tough, but important, legislation to deal with the nuclear waste issue in the last session of Congress. In my own State of New Hampshire, we have a powerplant at Seabrook that has had an outstanding record, an excellent record for both efficiency and safety, and it continues to generate a very substantial portion of the electricity used not just in New Hampshire but throughout New England.\n\tAt the same time, nuclear power, like coal-fired electricity or gas-fired power, wind, solar, or hydroelectric power ought to be competing in the marketplace on a level playing field. However, there is a provision in this Energy bill that provides Federal loan guarantees to pay for up to half the cost of as many as six new nuclear powerplants. That is a pretty significant financial commitment, and a level of support will have to be made by the taxpayers of the United States.\n\tIf we look at the estimated cost of six plants--perhaps $3 billion per plant, maybe a little bit less, maybe a little bit more--and take a look at half the cost of the plant in the Federal guarantee, we could conceivably be looking at a long-term cost of $10 billion or $15 billion. That is a cost that American taxpayers should not be asked to bear. That is one of the reasons Senator Wyden and I are offering our amendment.\n\tA second concern is the simple precedent this would set: providing Federal loan guarantees for any private powerplant construction. Again, my concern is not directed at the fact that the loan guarantees are for nuclear powerplants, or for large powerplants. It is about private plant production. If it were gas-fired plants, coal-fired plants, or new hydroelectric plants for which we were giving Federal guarantees, I would have the same concerns. We are setting a bad precedent in public policy when we offer this kind of tax subsidy. \n\tWe have to ask time and again, Are we being fair to the taxpayers? Are we being fair to the marketplace? I do not believe we are. I think this kind of a program, this kind of a tax subsidy would distort our energy markets and would distort the performance of our capital markets where private companies go out to borrow week after week, month after month, and year after year.\n\n\tWe need an energy policy in this country that promotes a strong diverse supply of energy and promotes competition. Sometimes that means making sure the Federal Government treads very lightly in the marketplace. This provision in the bill does not do that by any stretch.\n\tThe amendment we will offer is a commonsense amendment, and in the long run, our energy markets and even our nuclear power industry will be better served by striking this unnecessary subsidy. If we are going to have a healthy and strong nuclear power industry, what that really means is we have to have commonsense regulations. We need to work hard to streamline and to extend some of the relicensing capabilities so those plants that have performed well can continue to operate for an extended period of time. And, of course, we need to deal with the issue of nuclear waste, which we have begun to do through our efforts last year, and which I support.\n\tThe amendment that will be offered by Senator Wyden and me is an amendment that has support from the National Taxpayers Union, from Citizens Against Government Waste, and a number of groups that have quite a reputation for looking out for taxpayer interest.\n\tIt also has support from a number of environmental groups, including the League of Conservation Voters and USPIRG, groups that have tried to look out for environmental interests that raise concerns for them as well.\n\tIt is a broad coalition of groups coming at this from different perspectives, but all recognize this section of the bill is not good public policy, this is not the right kind of approach if we want to have competitive energy markets, and it certainly is not the right kind of approach for taxpayers.\n\tI thank Senator Wyden for working with me on this amendment. We are working on an agreement that will allow us to bring this amendment forward on Tuesday with at least 2 hours of debate and an up-or-down vote on the amendment.\n\tI thank Chairman Domenici for working with us on that agreement and allowing us to get this important amendment to the floor, give us a vote, and see if we can save the taxpayers a lot of money and help improve this bill.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\tMr. WYDEN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire has said it very well. I will offer just a couple of additional remarks. It is clear there is going to be an effort, as this is discussed in the Senate, to simply make this an ``Are you for nuclear power or are you against nuclear power?'' issue. I think that would be very unfortunate.\n\tI said earlier when we began to discuss this, I have inimitable abilities that over the years have managed to make both sides of the nuclear power debate unhappy with me. In a sense, I hope we can do as Senator Sununu has done, which is to keep the focus on the taxpayer question. I urge Senators, in particular, as they make up their minds on this issue to look at two important reports. The Congressional Budget Office report and the report done by the Congressional Research Service are particularly illuminating in that the Congressional Budget Office report talks about how, in their judgment, there is a more than 50-percent probability that these plants will not be successful, that they will fail. And the Congressional Research Service, in their analysis, indicates if that is the case, taxpayers would be on the hook for in the vicinity of $16 billion.\n\tIn my part of the world, this is not exactly an abstract issue. In fact, with the WPPSS debacle, which was the largest municipal bond failure in the country's history, four out of the five facilities were not, in fact, even built, and the people in my region and many investors, of course, were on the hook.\n\tIf the scenario of the Congressional Budget Office were to come to pass, all of our constituents--all of them--would, in effect, be exposed to these very significant costs.\n\tThat is why Senator Sununu and I are going to try our best, between now and the Tuesday vote, to make sure that for us this is first and foremost a taxpayers' issue.\n\tTo try to drive that point home, we had a discussion about how this affects other aspects of energy development. If this provision stays in the bill, in other words the amendment that the Senator from New Hampshire and I are offering is unsuccessful, nuclear energy would be the only part of this field that would get a direct subsidy for constructing a facility.\n\tFor example, the distinguished chairman of the committee, who has been very gracious to the two of us in terms of working on process and all of the issues towards getting this offered, talked at some length about wind and talked about subsidies for wind. Well, in fact, when wind is produced, there are various credits and incentives, which I guess are very appropriate, but there is no subsidy for constructing any other facility under this legislation other than in the nuclear area.\n\tIn fact, right now there is nothing preventing any utility from going forward with a nuclear project simply by going to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and getting a license to build the plant.\n\tLet me repeat that. Anybody who wants to build a nuclear powerplant in this country simply has to go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and get the license. They can do that if they satisfy the safety standards.\n\tThe issue, as propounded by Senator Sununu and myself, is whether or not there should be these very large subsidies; whether or not the taxpayer should be exposed, in the vicinity of $16 billion, with respect to building these plants.\n\tI do not think this is an issue about whether one is for or against nuclear power, and that is why the National Taxpayers Union and a host of other organizations that have been watchdogs for taxpayers have made this a priority item. In their letter to me, they took the position that they are neither for nor against nuclear power. They say that explicitly in the letter. What they and a number of other taxpayer watchdogs are concerned about is the $16 billion exposure for taxpayers that is contained in this provision.\n\tSo I am very pleased that before long we will be able to enter into a consent agreement for an up-or-down vote on Tuesday on the Wyden-Sununu legislation. I think the chairman of the Energy Committee will be leading us in that discussion with respect to a UC before too long.\n\tThe Senator from New Hampshire is still in the Chamber, and I thank him for all of his involvement in this. He has a long record of being a taxpayer watchdog, and that was, in fact, the special reason why I thought it was so important for the two of us to try to do this together.\n\tI am sure between now and Tuesday, as this is discussed, to some extent some will try to make this into a referendum on whether one is for or against nuclear power. I will be doing my best to try to make sure that it is a taxpayers' issue. That is central and critical to me, and I look forward to the discussion that we will have on Tuesday. We should have a UC ready to go before long. I thank Chairman Domenici for his willingness to work out the procedure on it, and I am particularly grateful to my cosponsor, Senator Sununu.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am quite sure that before we are finished--if we finish, and I hope we will--the Senate and those who are interested in energy policy will hear a lot about the various kinds of energy that are provided, as a matter of policy, in this Energy bill.\n\tI am having a lot of difficulty understanding the Senate these days. I regret to say that almost every amendment we talk about some Senator is unable to be present. It is either they had to leave early or they had a previous engagement or there is something else they had to do. So it seems as if we cannot get the amendments done. But the Democrats are going to help us try to convince Senators that they ought to start to list their amendments soon so we will have some idea, sooner rather than later, the extent of amendments we are going to have on this bill.\n\tOn the issue of nuclear power, before we are finished with this debate, we will lay before the Senate what the Energy Committee, in its markup of this bill, did so as to make sure the United States had an array of energy sources during the next 10, 20, and 30 years.\n\tWe have tax credits for solar energy. We have tax credits for wind energy. The Senator argues that is different. Well, maybe we ought to change and have just plain tax credits for nuclear power. Maybe there would be no objection to it. Perhaps we could convert what we thought was a better way to do this to some kind of a tax credit, which would mean that if they produced, and only if they produced, would they get any credit.\n\tWhat we did in the instance of nuclear power was to say if the Secretary of Energy, at some time, finds that the United States needs a nuclear powerplant because it needs a diversity of energy or it needs it because there is some clean air problem, then to a creditworthy applicant, a creditworthy builder, of a nuclear powerplant, they may subsidize half the cost with a guaranteed loan.\n\tNow, one can talk about that in terms of how much that is going to cost. The Senator from New Mexico assumes we look at all of these from the standpoint of the benefits, what are the benefits to America?\n\tTwelve years ago, this Senator started looking at nuclear power. With the passage of each year, as I studied it and wrote about it and thought about it, I became more embarrassed and more ashamed of what the United States of America had done with this superb technology that we had invented, that was being used in the world and that we had set on the shelf because a few people frightened us to death.\n\tDo people know that today two nuclear powerplants are being built in Taiwan? They are building a modern, General Electric design. Guess what they tell us the cost is going to be. In fact, I believe we will introduce a letter next week during the argument. The costs will be very close to the equivalent costs of what we are now paying to build natural gas burned, natural gas fed, powerplants. Who would have thought it?\n\tWhat has happened is, since natural gas is the singular source of energy, the cost is skyrocketing because there is no competition. We intend there to be competition, not only from nuclear but we have ample money in this bill for great research in coal, too. We have over $2 billion in research for clean coal. It does not produce any coal. It just says do the research to try to make technology work.\n\tWhat we have done overall for the first time in the last 20 years is to say, let us develop a nuclear policy for the greatest nation on Earth and let us show the world that we have not abandoned the safest way to produce energy, electricity for people in the world. Let us show that we are not abandoning that. Let us show that we are going to lead again. And so there is a three-pronged policy. The Price-Anderson Act, which makes it possible for the private sector to be involved, is made permanent.\n\n\tThis bill says, let's build a demonstration project in the State of Idaho, a brandnew concept, so we will build a nuclear powerplant that will be passive. By passive, we mean we will prove it cannot burn. There are people who speculate a nuclear powerplant can burn. They have spoken of its burning its way through the earth. This new powerplant will be physically made so it is passive. It will produce high enough temperatures so you can produce hydrogen for the new hydrogen economy we are looking at.\n\tAmerica is close to being able to build a nuclear powerplant again, like they are being built in Taiwan, like they have been built year after year in France. France produces 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power. They do not run around frightened to death of technology like the United States. If anyone wants to see France's nuclear waste, they will take you to a gymnasium. You can walk into the gymnasium, like walking into a school, and walk on a glass floor. One might ask, where is the waste? You are walking on it. It is encapsulated for 50 years at least, and nothing can happen to it while they figure out what to do with it.\n\tWhat does the greatest nation on Earth do? We sit paralyzed, waiting around for something to happen in Nevada. I am sure we will hear that argument before we finish the debate next Tuesday. We know that is an engineering issue that will be solved.\n\tWhat we do not know: Will the United States continue to remain dependent upon natural gas almost exclusively or will we say it may be time for American companies to build one or two nuclear powerplants? We understand they are very close. They have experienced litigation and other impediments. It is hard to get over the hurdle, over the hump. We have asked, what would it take to start a couple of them? What a day, when America starts a couple new nuclear powerplants. We would be entering an era of cheap electricity, available to everyone, poor countries and rich countries. Guess what. There will be no pollution problem. The ambient air will be affected zero.\n\tWe knew it was worth the effort to get America going again regarding its strength and power as the inventor of the safest energy ever produced by mankind to this point. We could have put in tax credits: If you produce something, we will give you a tax credit. Then our friends would not be making the argument; you are giving them something before they produce. We chose what we thought was most simple and least expensive to the Federal Government, saying, if necessary, you can give them half the costs in a loan guarantee, to get us going again.\n\tThat is the whole issue. Should we do that or should we not do that? Before we are finished, the Senate will understand, in spite of it having difficulty with this Energy bill--we cannot seem to get people to focus on the Energy bill--but they will understand the significance of this issue. They will understand that the fear regarding nuclear power and nuclear fuel rods is about nothing but a red herring. They are nothing that engineering competence cannot handle.\n\tI close this opening argument on nuclear power and whether or not it is safe by saying to everyone listening or worrying about nuclear power versus the other power in America, there are over 100 American Navy vessels on the high seas of the world with engines that are nuclear powerplants. Nuclear powerplants run battleships, run aircraft carriers. They have fuel rods in them. They carry them everywhere on the seas. They are at every port in the free world, save one in New Zealand because New Zealand has an agreement against it. They are so safe, there are boats and ships all around the world that have nuclear powerplants on board, with nuclear waste sitting right there in the hulls of the ships.\n\n\tWhen you add all that, it is the safest way to produce energy for the world in the future. Our package includes the research facility we will build in the State of my good friend who is sitting on my right. We say to our executive branch, in the event you think it is necessary, you can issue a loan agreement for half the cost of a nuclear powerplant to get it going.\n\tI understand there are those who will just add up costs under the worst of circumstances. I would rather add up all the pluses and take a risk that is worthwhile. If ever there was a risk that was worthwhile, it is a plain and simple risk to revive nuclear power in America for America and for the world. That is what is at issue in this bill.\n\tThose who argue not to gamble any money on this will not raise a pinky on spending $1.6 billion to research hydrogen, for a new hydrogen economy. It may not work. It may be thrown away. But it is in this bill to start the idea of engines that are going to use the new fuel. We are spending that money. We are not guaranteeing it. We are spending it. We are not guaranteeing General Motors. We are saying, enter into a partnership. We will spend some money. We hope it works.\n\tThis is an issue of risk. When you look at the other kinds of fuels, all of which we promote, none of which we shortchange, will we say America is a coal country, spend money to make the coal clean so that the ambient air of America is, indeed, clean? And spend plenty of it. We say, build windmills and give huge credits for them to such an extent that there may be too many of them built in the next decade; we have to pass an national ordinance so they will not build them too close to some of our cities because there will be so many of them when this bill is passed with the subsidy included, the tax subsidy that will be attached. Geothermal--there are plenty of subsidies. Every kind of energy you can imagine, we have said: Help it move along. At the same time, we have put into a package that rare opportunity for the United States to face up to the fact that, although we invented nuclear power, we hid from it. Others didn't. It is time we come back and revisit it. It is time that, as a package, coupled with all the other policies, we take a little risk in terms of its future, for the future of the world.\n\n\tMr. President, I have a series of remarks that I delivered on the nuclear subject on October 31, 1977, at Harvard University, which summarizes my views to that point. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                         A New Nuclear Paradigm\n\n                     (By Senator Pete V. Domenici)\n\n       Earlier this week, I spent substantial time on the subjects \n     of nuclear non-proliferation, the proposed Comprehensive Test \n     Ban Treaty, nuclear waste policies, and nuclear weapons \n     design issues. The forums for these discussions were open and \n     closed hearings of two major sub-committees of the United \n     States Senate, a breakfast where two Cabinet secretaries \n     joined 10 United States Senators, and private discussions \n     with specialists in these fields.\n       During the week before, I spent time on the question of \n     whether or not a 1,200 foot road should be built in a \n     National Monument, a monument whose enabling legislation I \n     authored almost a decade ago.\n       Without demeaning any person's sense of perspective, I have \n     to not to you today that for every person who attended the \n     nuclear hearings, 50 attended the road hearings. And, for \n     every inch of newspaper coverage the nuclear matters \n     attracted, the road attracted 50 inches.\n       Strategic national issues just don't command a large \n     audience. In no area has this been more evident during these \n     last 25 years than in the critical and interrelated public \n     policy questions involving energy, growth, and the role of \n     nuclear technologies. As we leave the 20th Century, arguably \n     the American Century, and head for a new millennium, we truly \n     need to confront these strategic issues with careful logic \n     and sound science.\n       We live in the dominant economic, military, and cultural \n     entity in the world. Our principles of government and \n     economics are increasingly becoming the principles of the \n     world.\n       There are no secrets to our success, and there is no \n     guarantee that, in the coming century, we will be the \n     principal beneficiary of the seeds we have sown. There is \n     competition in the world and serious strategic issues facing \n     the United States cannot be overlooked.\n       The United States--like the rest of the industrialized \n     world--is aging rapidly as our birth rates decline. Between \n     1995 and the year 2030, the number of people in the United \n     States over age 65 will double from 34 million to 68 million. \n     Just to maintain our standard of living, we need dramatic \n     increases in productivity as a larger fraction of our \n     population drops out of the workforce.\n       By 2030, 30 percent of the population of the industrialized \n     nations will be over 60. The rest of the world--the countries \n     that today are ``unindustrialized''--will have only 16 \n     percent of their population over age 60 and will be ready to \n     boom.\n       As those nations build economies modeled after ours, there \n     will be intense competition for the resources that underpin \n     modern economies.\n       When it comes to energy, we have a serious, strategic \n     problem. The United States currently consumes 25 percent of \n     the world's energy production. However, developing countries \n     are on track to increase their energy consumption by 48 \n     percent between 1992 and 2010.\n       The United States currently produces and imports raw energy \n     resources worth over $150 billion per year. Approximately $50 \n     billion of that is imported oil or natural gas. We then \n     process that material into energy feedstocks such as \n     gasoline. Those feedstocks, the energy we consume in our \n     cars, factories, and electric plants, are worth $505 \n     billion per year.\n       So, while we debate defense policy every year, we don't \n     debate energy policy, even though it already costs us twice \n     as much as our defense, other countries' consumption is \n     growing dramatically, and energy shortages are likely to be a \n     prime driver of future military challenges.\n       When I came to the Senate a quarter of a century ago, we \n     debated our dependence on foreign sources of energy. We \n     discussed energy independence, but we largely decided not to \n     talk about nuclear policy options in public.\n       At the same time, the anti-nuclear movement conducted their \n     campaign in a way that was tremendously appealing to mass \n     media. Scientists, used to the peer-reviewed ways of \n     scientific discourse, were unprepared to counter. They lost \n     the debate.\n       Serious discussion about the role of nuclear energy in \n     world stability, energy independence, and national security \n     retreated into academia or classified sessions.\n       Today, it is extraordinarily difficult to conduct a debate \n     on nuclear issues. Usually, the only thing produced is nasty \n     political fallout.\n       I am going to bring back to the market place of ideas a \n     more forthright discussion of nuclear policy.\n       My objective tonight is not to talk about talking about a \n     policy. I am going to make some policy proposals. Tomorrow \n     there are sessions on energy policy and nuclear \n     proliferation. I'll give them something to talk about.\n       I am going to tell you that we made some bad decisions in \n     the past that we have to change. Then I will tell you about \n     some decisions we need to make now.\n       First, we need to recognize that the premises underpinning \n     some of our nuclear policy decisions are wrong. In 1977, \n     President Carter halted all U.S. efforts to reprocess spent \n     nuclear fuel and develop mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) for our \n     civilian reactors on the grounds that the plutonium could be \n     diverted and eventually transformed into bombs. He argued \n     that the United States should halt its reprocessing program \n     as an example to other countries in the hope that they would \n     follow suit.\n       The premise of the decision was wrong. Other countries do \n     not follow the example of the United States if we make a \n     decision that other countries view as economically or \n     technically unsound. France, Great Britain, Japan, and Russia \n     all now have MOX fuel programs.\n       This failure to address an incorrect premise has harmed our \n     efforts to deal with spent nuclear fuel and the disposition \n     of excess weapons material, as well as our ability to \n     influence international reactor issues.\n       I'll cite another example. We regulate exposure to low \n     levels of radiation using a so-called ``linear no-threshold'' \n     model, the premise of which is that there is no ``safe'' \n     level of exposure.\n       Our model forces us to regulate radiation to levels \n     approaching 1 percent of natural background despite the fact \n     that natural background can vary by 50 percent within the \n     United States.\n       On the other hand, many scientists think that living cells, \n     after millions of years of exposure to naturally occurring \n     radiation, have adapted such that low levels of radiation \n     cause very little if any harm. In fact, there are some \n     studies that suggest exactly the opposite is true--that low \n     doses of radiation may even improve health.\n       The truth is important. We spend over $5 billion each year \n     to clean contaminated DOE sites to levels below 5 percent of \n     background.\n       In this year's Energy and Water Appropriations Act, we \n     initiated a ten year program to understands how radiation \n     affects genomes and cells so that we can really understand \n     how radiation affects living organisms. For the first time, \n     we will develop radiation protection standards that are based \n     on actual risk.\n       Let me cite another bad decision. You may recall that \n     earlier this year, Hudson Foods recalled 25 million pounds of \n     beef, some of which was contaminated by E. Coli. The \n     Administration proposed tougher penalties and mandatory \n     recalls that cost millions.\n       What you may not know is that the E. Coli bacteria can be \n     killed by irradiating beef products. The irradiation has no \n     effect on the beef. The FDA does not allow the process to be \n     used on beef, even though it is allowed for poultry, pork, \n     fruit and vegetables, largely because of opposition from some \n     consumer groups that question its safety.\n       But there is no scientific evidence of danger. In fact, \n     when the decision is left up to scientists, they opt for \n     irradiation--the food that goes into space with our \n     astronauts is irradiated.\n       I've talked about bad past decisions that haunt us today. \n     Now I want to talk about decisions we need to make today.\n       The President has outlined a program to stabilize the U.S. \n     production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases at \n     1990 levels by some time between 2008 and 2012. \n     Unfortunately, the President's goals are not achievable \n     without seriously impacting our economy.\n       Our national laboratories have studied the issue. Their \n     report indicates that to get to the President's goals we \n     would have to impose a $50/ton carbon tax. That would result \n     in an increase of 12.5 cents/gallon for gas and 1.5 cents/\n     kilowatt-hour for electricity--almost a doubling of the \n     current cost of coal or natural gas-generated electricity.\n       What the President should have said is that we need nuclear \n     energy to meet his goal. After all, in 1996, nuclear power \n     plants prevented the emission of 147 million metric tons of \n     carbon, 2.5 million tons of nitrogen oxides, and 5 million \n     tons of sulfur dioxide. Our electric utilities' emissions of \n     those greenhouse gases were 25 percent lower than they would \n     have been if fossil fuels had been used instead of nuclear \n     energy.\n       Ironically, the technology we are relying on to achieve \n     these results is over twenty years old. We have developed the \n     next generation of nuclear power plants--which have \n     been certified by the NRC and are now being sold overseas. \n     They are even safer than our current models. Better yet, we \n     have technologies under development like passively safe \n     reactors, lead-bismuth reactors, and advanced liquid metal \n     reactors that generate less waste and are proliferation \n     resistant.\n       An excellent report by Dr. John Holdren for the President's \n     Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, calls for a \n     sharply enhanced national effort. It urges a ``properly \n     focused R&D effort to see if the problems plaguing fission \n     energy can be overcome--economics, safety, waste, and \n     proliferation.'' I have long urged the conclusion of this \n     report--that we dramatically increase spending in these areas \n     for reasons ranging from reactor safety to non-proliferation.\n       I have not overlooked that nuclear waste issues loom as a \n     roadblock to increased nuclear utilization. I will return to \n     that subject.\n       For now, let me turn from nuclear power to nuclear weapons \n     issues.\n       Our current stockpile is set by bilateral agreements with \n     Russia. Bilateral agreements make sense if we are certain who \n     our future nuclear adversary will be and are useful to force \n     a transparent build-down within Russia. But I will warn you \n     that our next nuclear adversary may not be Russia--we do not \n     want to find ourselves limited by a treaty with Russia in a \n     conflict with another entity.\n       We need to decide what stockpile levels we really need for \n     our own best interests to deal with any future adversary.\n       For that reason, I suggest that, within the limits imposed \n     by START II, the United States move away from further treaty \n     imposed limitations and move to what I call a ``threat-based \n     stockpile.''\n       Based upon the threat I perceive right now, I think our \n     stockpile could be reduced. We need to challenge our military \n     planners to identify the minimum necessary stockpile size.\n       At the same time, as our stockpile is reduced and we are \n     precluded from testing, we have to increase our confidence in \n     the integrity of the remaining stockpile and our ability \n     to reconstitute if the threat changes. Programs like \n     science-based stockpile stewardship must be nurtured and \n     supported carefully.\n       As we seriously review stockpile size, we should also \n     consider stepping back from the nuclear cliff by de-alerting \n     and carefully reexamining the necessity of the ground-based \n     log of the nuclear triad.\n       Costs certainly aren't the primary driver for our stockpile \n     size, but if some of the actions I've discussed were taken, \n     I'b bet that as a bonus we'd see major budget savings. Now we \n     spend about $30 billion each year supporting the triad.\n       Earlier I discussed the need to revisit some incorrect \n     premises that caused us to make bad decisions in the past. I \n     said that one of them, regarding reprocessing and MOX fuel, \n     is ham-stringing our efforts to permanently dismantle nuclear \n     weapons.\n       The dismantlement of tens of thousands of nuclear weapons \n     in Russia and the United States has left both countries with \n     large inventories of perfectly machined classified components \n     that could allow each country to rapidly rebuild its nuclear \n     arsenals.\n       Both countries should set a goal of converting those excess \n     inventories into non-weapon shapes as quickly as possible. \n     The more permanent those transformations and the more \n     verification that can accompany the conversion of that \n     material, the better.\n       Technical solutions exist. Pits can be transformed into \n     non-weapons shapes and weapon material can be burned in \n     reactors as MOX fuel, which by the way is what the National \n     Academy of Sciences has recommended. However, the proposal to \n     dispose of weapons plutonium as MOX runs into that old \n     premise that MOX is bad despite its widespread use by our \n     allies.\n       MOX is the best technical solution. I challenge you to \n     develop a proposal that brings the economics of the MOX fuel \n     cycle together with the need to dispose of weapons grade \n     plutonium. Ideally, incentives can be developed to speed \n     Russians materials conversion while reducing the cost of the \n     U.S. effort. The idea for the U.S. Russian HEU Agreement \n     originated at MIT, and I know that Harvard does not like to \n     be upstaged.\n       I said earlier that I would not advocate increased use of \n     nuclear and ignore the nuclear waste problem. The path we've \n     been following on Yucca Mountain sure isn't leading anywhere \n     very fast. I'm about ready to reexamine the whole premise for \n     Yucca Mountain.\n       We're on a course to bury all our spent nuclear fuel, \n     despite the fact that a spent nuclear fuel rod still has 60-\n     75% of its energy content--and despite the fact that \n     Nevadeans need to be convinced that the material will not \n     create a hazard for over 100,000 years.\n       Our decision to ban reprocessing forced us to a repository \n     solution. Meanwhile, many other nations think it is dumb to \n     just bury the energy-rich spent fuel and are reprocessing.\n       I propose we go somewhere between reprocessing and \n     permanent disposal by using interim storage to keep our \n     options open. Incidentally, 65 Senators agreed with the \n     important of interim storage, but the Administration has only \n     threatened to veto any such progress and has shown no \n     willingness to discuss alternatives.\n       Let me highlight one attractive option. A group from \n     several of our largest companies, using technologies \n     developed at three of our national laboratories and from \n     Russian institutes and their nuclear navy, discussed with me \n     an approach to use that waste for electrical generation. They \n     use an accelerator, not a reactor, so there is never any \n     critical assembly. There is minimal processing, but carefully \n     done so that weapons-grade materials are never separated out \n     and so that international verification can be used. And when \n     they get done, only a little material goes into a \n     repository--but now the half lives are changed so that it's a \n     hazard for perhaps 300 years a far cry from 100,000 years. It \n     sure would be easier to get acceptance of a 300 year, rather \n     than a 100,000 year, hazard, especially when the 300 year \n     case is also providing a source of clean electricity. This \n     approach, called Accelerator Transmutation of Waste, is an \n     area I want to see investigated aggressively.\n       I still haven't touched on all the issues imbedded in \n     maximizing our nation's benefit from nuclear technologies, \n     and I can't do that without a much longer speech.\n       For example, I haven't discussed the increasingly desperate \n     need in the country for low level waste facilities like Ward \n     Valley in California. In California, important medical and \n     research procedures are at risk because the Administration \n     continues to block the State government from fulfilling their \n     responsibilities to care for low level waste.\n       And I haven't touched on the tremendous window of \n     opportunity that we now have in the Former Soviet Union to \n     expand programs that protect fissile material from moving \n     onto the black market or to shift the activities of former \n     Soviet weapons scientists onto commercial projects. Along \n     with Senators Nunn and Lugar, I've led the charge for these \n     programs. Those are programs a foreign aid, I believe they \n     are sadly mistaken.\n       We are realizing some of the benefits of nuclear \n     technologies today, but only a fraction of what we could \n     realize--\n       Nuclear weapons, for all their horror, brought to an end 50 \n     years of world-wide wars in which 60 million people died.\n       Nuclear power is providing about 20% of our electricity \n     needs now and many of our citizens enjoy healthier longer \n     lives through improved medical procedures that depend on \n     nuclear process.\n       But we aren't tapping the full potential of the nucleus for \n     additional benefits. In the process, we are short-changing \n     our citizens.\n       I hope in these remarks that I have succeeded in raising \n     your awareness of the opportunities that our nation should be \n     seizing to secure a better future for our citizens through \n     careful reevaluation of many ill-conceived fears, policies \n     and decisions that have seriously constrained our use of \n     nuclear technologies.\n       Today I announce my intention to lead a new dialogue with \n     serious discussion about the full range of nuclear \n     technologies. I intend to provide national leadership to \n     overcome barriers.\n       While some may continue to lament that the nuclear genie is \n     out of his proverbial bottle, I'm ready to focus on \n     harnessing that genie as effectively and fully as possible, \n     for the largest set of benefits for our citizens.\n       I challenge all of you to join me in this dialogue to help \n     secure these benefits.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\tMr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers and the two sponsors of the amendment, the Wyden-Sununu amendment, agreed that I ask for this unanimous consent, and I will do so: That on Tuesday, when the Senate considers the Wyden-Sununu amendment relating to commercial nuclear plants, there be 120 minutes equally divided in the usual form; provided further that no amendments to the amendment or the language proposed to be stricken be in order prior to the vote in relation to the amendment; and if the amendment is not disposed of, the amendment remain debatable and amendable.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\tMr. DOMENICI. There is no objection.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. REID. We are also very close to working something out on the matter that has been holding up the Energy bill today, and that is the child tax credit. We are within minutes of being able to enter into an agreement on that.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\tMr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we have arrived at a time and a defined period for debate on the Wyden amendment to subtitle B of this act. I think it is critical that we bring this issue to the forefront and make a decision on it.\n\tThe Senator from New Mexico, the chairman of the Energy Committee, has done an excellent job in the last 20 minutes outlining the dynamics of this major piece of legislation for our country and the kinds of issues embodied in it that are so critical to all of us as we debate the general issue of energy and this particular subtitle that relates to the development of new technology but, more importantly, the deployment of the concept of new reactor design into actual producing reactors in the United States. The Senator from New Mexico is so accurate in his overall review of where we are as a nation with energy or the absence thereof.\n\tMy colleague from Oregon and I live in the Pacific Northwest, where hydro is dominant as a part of our energy-producing capability. Even that marvelous, clean resource today is under attack. Why? Because it impounds rivers to produce hydro, and by impounding rivers, it changes the character of those rivers. Certain interest groups want those rivers, in large part, by some estimation, to be freed. So they wanted to reshape hydro. In all instances, it has reduced the overall productive capability of hydro facilities.\n\tWe have frustration in a variety of other areas. The Senator from New Mexico outlined our problem with burning coal under the Clean Air Act, and the ambient air as a result of that, and the cost now being driven against retrofitting and new coal-burning designs to produce energy.\n\tThat is in part--not in total but in part--what has developed a willingness on the part of our country, I believe, to renew our nuclear option and possibly to renew it under a new design concept, under a passive reactor design concept that the Senator from New Mexico has talked about.\n\tPassive reactor design means, simply, one that reacts on its own when certain conditions arise. The human factor doesn't necessarily have to be there to start throwing switches and making adjustments because those kinds of things happen automatically. We believe our engineering talent in this country is now capable of that kind of design development. In doing that design, we would couple with it an electrolysis process that would make the reactor itself so much more efficient that it would run at peak load at all times, as reactors should in performing best.\n\tBut power demand isn't always constant. When you can switch that load to development of hydrogen fuels, through the electrolysis process, and then convert it back to use within a power grid, you make for phenomenal efficiencies and the cost of production goes down dramatically.\n\tIn doing that, in bringing back to this country an abundant source of electrical energy and a reliable supply to our grid system--a system we are working to improve today through the development of regional transmission authorities and a variety of other things that tie us together--we found out a few years ago in the Pacific Northwest that it has certain liabilities. If the energy in the system itself in other parts of the grid isn't abundant, and it starts pulling power from us and forcing our power rates up, it can be a problem. Where it is produced with an abundance in the system and the system is fully interrelated and interconnected all can generally benefit.\n\tAs a result of bringing some of these new concepts on line, where we are actively subsidizing other areas of production, we thought it was reasonable to bring to the floor of the Senate a similar concept, to take some of the risk out of new design development for the commercial side, and to do so in a way that our country has always done--to use public resources to advance certain technological causes and, out of those causes and their development, to generate phenomenal consumer benefits.\n\tThere is no greater consumer benefit in this country today than reliable, high-quality electrical energy at reasonable prices. Our world runs on it. Our world's wealth depends on it. This country's workforce depends on it.\n\tWhat we have brought to the floor in this Energy bill is not a hunt and a pick. It is not a political decision versus another political decision. That is not the case. It is not green versus nongreen. That is not the case.\n\tWhat the chairman of the Energy Committee has said in this bill, and what the committee itself has said, is that all energy is good energy as long as it meets certain standards, and as long as it fits within our environmental context, we ought to promote it and we ought to advance it.\n\tThat is exactly what this bill does. As the Senator from New Mexico characterized it a few moments ago, we have enough credit in this bill to put windmills about anywhere they want to go, or are allowed to go, to produce energy.\n\tSome would say that is great, we don't need anything else.\n\tOh, yes, we do. The reason we do is you can put a windmill everywhere you can in the air sheds that can produce wind energy, and you can only get up to about 2 percent of total demand. That is about it.\n\n\tBut we ought to do it because it is clean and it is renewable and it is the right thing to do. But what we are already finding out in my State of Idaho that has a couple of wind sheds that fit, if this bill passes, interest groups are stepping up and saying: Oh, I don't think we want that windmill there; that is a spike-tail grouse habitat; there are some Indian artifacts there and we certainly don't want them damaged. And we don't.\n\tWhat I am suggesting is in these most desirable of wind sheds for windmills, there is going to be somebody stepping up and saying ``not here.'' And they are right. They probably won't go there.\n\tThat is public land, by the way, not private land. On some private land, the same argument will occur. Simply, they don't want in their backyard a machine that goes whomp, whomp, whomp and produces electricity. Something about the sound disturbs their sleep. As a result, my guess is some city ordinance will soon suggest, ``not in my backyard.''\n\tBut there are some backyards where we can put wind machines and we will and we already have and we ought to promote it and we ought not to be selective, and we are subsidizing them by a tax credit. You bet we are.\n\tWe are going to pass that provision. That is the right and the appropriate thing to do.\n\tWe have subsidized in most instances, in one form or another, through a tax credit or through an easing of regulation or through the ability to site on Federal lands, energy projects, historically, because our country, our Government, this Senate for well over 100 years has said: The best thing we can do for this country to make it grow, to make it prosper, and to make it abundant to the working men and women of America is a reasonable and available energy supply in whatever form the marketplace takes.\n\tWe also know we can shape the market a bit by a subsidy, by a tax credit, and we also do that.\n\tWe are going to do some wind. We are going to do some solar in here. We hope we do clean coal technology. Certainly the coal-producing States of our country want to keep producing coal, and they should. We should use it, and we will.\n\tThere is a provision in here on which Senator Bingaman and I disagree a little; that is, on the relicensing of hydro. We think it ought to be relicensed and environmentally positive. When we can retrofit it and shape it, we ought to do so as we relicense it into the next century. But hydro produces a nice chunk of power in this country today. We are going to relicense over 200 facilities in the next decade. That represents about 15 million American homes and 30 million megawatts of power. Any reduction in that productive capability means we have to produce that power somewhere else.\n\tSome of those old plants, when relicensed and retrofitted, may lose some of their productive capability in the licensing process. We ought to have new supplies coming on line.\n\tSeveral years ago, this Senate became involved in a very serious debate over an issue that we call climate change. We became involved as a nation internationally in this debate because we thought it was the right thing to do. We knew our global environment was heating, or appeared to be heating, faster than it had in the past, and we didn't know why. Some argued it was the emission of greenhouse gases which created a greenhouse effect around our globe which was largely a product of the burning of hydrocarbons and that we ought to do something about it.\n\tMany of us were very concerned that if we didn't have the right modeling and the right measurement and the right facts to make those decisions, we would shape public policy and head it in a direction that was not appropriate and would allocate billions of dollars of new resources that might put tens of thousands of people out of work if we did it wrong. At the same time, there has been and there remains a nagging concern as to the reality of this particular situation globally, environmentally. Or is it simply the natural characteristic of the changing world and evolving changing world?\n\tWe have known down through geologic time that this world has heated and cooled and heated and cooled. Is it the natural cycle? We didn't know that. But out of all of it, we generally grew to believe that the less emission into the atmosphere the better off we would be.\n\tThis bill embodies that general philosophy--that clean energy and clean fuels are better, that we ought to advance them, that we ought to subsidize them where necessary, and that we ought to plot them through the public policy which we debate here on the floor today. Out of all of that, we knew one thing: Energy generated by nuclear-fueled generating systems was clean with no emissions. It is the cleanest source in the country other than hydro with no emissions.\n\tAs a result of that, there was no question that the popularity of that consensus began to grow. Other nations around the world were using it. The senior Senator from New Mexico spoke of France and their use of it. Japan, a nation once very fearful of the atom, now builds almost a reactor a year coming on line to produce--what? Power for its citizens, power for its economy, and power for its workforce. We once led the world in that technology. But we fell dramatically behind over the last three decades because there was a public perception fueled by some and feared by some that the nuclear-generating facilities of our country were not safe. Yet they have this phenomenal history of safe operation.\n\n\tThrough the course of all of this, and as the facilities aged, as they were relicensed and retrofitted, guess what happened over the course of the last few years. As we spiked in our power demands at the peak of the economy in the late 1990s and as electrical prices went through the roof, the cost of operating reactors was stable; it was constant. They became the least cost producers of electricity of any generating capacity in the country other than existing hydro. The world began to react in a favorable way to that.\n\tAll of that became a part of the production of the legislation before us now--to once again get this great country back into the business of the research and development of new reactor systems that not only are in every way perceived to be safer and cleaner in the sense of waste production at end of the game, but would do something else for our country in a way that we think is the right direction; that is, the development of hydrogen to fuel the next generation of surface transportation and to start growing our economy into an age of hydrogen-fueled systems, fuel cells, generating electricity, turning the wheels of automobiles, trucks, and other forms of transportation; and, on a case-by-case basis, the potential of a fuel cell to light a home, to fuel and light a given industry by having one of those on location. We believe all of those things are possible.\n\tWhat I hope is that the Senate will agree with us that it is now time to lead in all aspects of energy production in this country instead of nibbling around the edges selectively and politically determining what ought to be and what ought not to be because one individual thinks this way is better than another.\n\tI have dealt with the energy issue all of my political life. While at one time I will honestly admit I was selective, I am no longer that. I support it all. I am voting for wind. I am voting for clean coal. I want to develop a responsible relicensing system for hydro. I am supporting nuclear development and nuclear growth. I am supporting oil production. Why? I don't want future generations of this country to be fuel-starved and victim to the politics of a region of the world which is unstable because this Senate didn't have the wisdom to produce when it could have and create incentives and maximum energy production for our country.\n\tThat is what this bill is about. The Senator from Oregon chooses to be selective for a moment in time. I wish he wouldn't be. I understand why he is. I think he is wrong.\n\tMr. WYDEN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n\tMr. CRAIG. I would be happy to yield in just a moment.\n\tI think the Senator from Oregon is wrong on this issue. I think it is a form of selectivity as it relates to our willingness as a country to use public resources in the advancement of all forms of energy resources as the kind that is offered by the committee to, once a new reactor design is developed, allow for loan guarantees to guarantee up to about 8,400 megawatts of electrical development through nuclear reactor construction.\n\tI would be happy to yield to my colleague from Oregon.\n\tMr. WYDEN. I thank my good friend for yielding. I listened patiently to him and to the chairman of the committee raising the concern that in some way the opponents of the subsidies are engaging in scare tactics, red herrings, and the like. This is not a red herring. This is a dollar and cents issue.\n\tI was curious whether the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho was aware that the Congressional Budget Office ``considers the risk of default on such a loan guarantee to be very high, well over 50 percent.''\n\tIs the distinguished senior Senator from Idaho aware of that? I would be curious about his reaction because to me--and as the Senator from New Mexico said--this is about risk. The Congressional Budget Office has given us an objective, nonpartisan assessment of risk here. They consider ``the risk of default on such a loan guarantee to be very high, well over 50 percent''--coupled with the Congressional Research Service memo indicating the exposure is $16 billion. Is the distinguished Senator from Idaho aware of that? I would be curious what the distinguished Senator's reaction to that is.\n\tMr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for bringing up that issue. There are red herrings. Maybe some of them are blue and some of them are green, as we debate these issues. I don't know what a red herring really is here.\n\tI do know that when you sit a group of economists or accountants down and say, project backwards over the last 20 years or 30 years as it relates to the cost of developing nuclear reactors, and/or their failure--and out in the Pacific Northwest we had some that were funded and then brought down because the economy and the politics would not accept them--if you do that, you might get to a 50-percent risk factor.\n\tIf you project forward to a new concept design that is under a new Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing process that meets the demand of the electrical systems, that is a cleaner process, that drives down the cost--and my colleague, the senior Senator from New Mexico talked about the new concepts in Taiwan; one of them may well be built here--my guess is they did not factor that in. Because those are all things you and I, as Senators, will insist upon and do over the next decade, and that when we do that, the risk factors come down dramatically.\n\tBut this is what the Senator from Oregon and I need to look at. You came to the Congress how many years ago?\n\tMr. WYDEN. We were both young; in 1980.\n\tMr. CRAIG. In 1980. In 1980, the United States was about 35-percent dependent on foreign hydrocarbons, foreign oil. Now, there were some folks out there saying: Boy, if we don't get busy here, we could someday be 40-percent dependent.\n\tWell, they were right. We did not get busy. In fact, we increasingly restricted the ability to refine and the ability to discover and the ability to produce, and by 1984 or 1985, we were at 45 percent. And that kept going on.\n\tWhat is the risk factor there? We know what the risk factor is. The risk factor is, we did not do anything and we are now over 50-percent dependent, and in some instances as high as 65 percent, give or take, dependent on foreign oil sources.\n\tYou see what has happened at the pump. I don't know what you or I were paying for gas in 1980 but it was well under $1 a gallon. Now we are paying $1.55, $1.60 a gallon for regular fuel. The average household is spending a great deal more on energy today than it did in 1980. We did not develop a policy. We did quite the opposite. We began to restrict the ability to produce, whether or not it was hydrocarbons. \n\tWe have not brought on line a nuclear reactor, fire-generating system for the purpose of electrical production in the last 10 or 12 years. One got started under construction, and, of course, as we know in the Pacific Northwest, we actually stopped construction on some.\n\tAre there risks? You bet. There is no zero-sum game here. There isn't anything you or I could possibly legislate. But there is a reality; the reality is that energy prices in Oregon shot through the roof in the last 3 years and the energy prices in Idaho went up dramatically. The cost of living in the State of Oregon and the economy of the State of Oregon reeled under the hit, as is true of the State of Idaho. I am not, anymore, going to stand here and be selective on the production of and the future opportunity to produce energy for this country because I want to get your State's economy moving and my State's economy moving.\n  (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.)\n\tMr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for yet another question?\n\tMr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n\tMr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague.\n\tAgain, the Senator from Idaho has been critical of the Congressional Budget Office report, saying that perhaps they did not look forward; they just looked backward. I would urge my colleagues to look at the report because the report does, in fact, look to 2011 and the future, and that is what the Congressional Budget Office did make their judgment on, where they said there was a risk of default that was well over 50 percent.\n\tBut my question to my colleague is whether my colleague thinks it is relevant about who assumes risk with respect to energy production. Because he is absolutely right, there are no foolproof guarantees in life. There is no question there is risk. Here, however, I see the taxpayer being at risk. The taxpayer is on the hook for $16 billion.\n\tI thought it was interesting that the distinguished chairman of the committee talked about the credits for production.\n\tWell, the fact is, when you get a credit for production, the producer is largely at risk because in order to get the break, you have to produce something. There is no tax credit, I say to my colleagues, for failing to produce a successful wind venture. You get the credit if your wind venture is successful.\n\tMy understanding is that here, with the subsidy, the person who assumes the risk is the taxpayer, not the producer. I was wondering if the distinguished Senator from Idaho thinks it is relevant with respect to who takes the risk. This Senator does because the taxpayer is on the hook rather than those who produce. I am curious of the reaction of the distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n\tMr. CRAIG. I am pleased the Senator brought this issue forward because you and I live in an environment in the Pacific Northwest that was substantially subsidized by American taxpayers to produce a massive electrical system known as the Bonneville Power Administration--direct appropriations of hundreds of millions of dollars to build a hydro system in the Snake and Columbia watersheds and in other places. These were not loan guarantees. They were just outright expenditures to be paid back. They have been paid back over a long period of time, and we are continuing to pay them back.\n\tSo the American taxpayer, to our benefit, has always been on the hook in the Pacific Northwest for the production of energy. In fact, you and I worked to just get some borrowing capability for Bonneville to expand its transmission system--a big chunk of money. We fought for that, and we should have. Why? Because it will generally benefit the Pacific Northwest. It is not a loan guarantee. It is an outright appropriation to be paid back.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n\tMr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. I would like to comment on what the distinguished Senator, Mr. Wyden, just raised, and say to my good friend, the Congressional Budget Office is wrong almost every way it turns.\n\tFirst, it uses forecast figures on plant costs of $2,300 per kilowatt. The right number is $1,250 per kilowatt. How do I know? There are two being built in Taiwan right now that General Electric designed--brand spanking new. They came to our office. I don't know if they had time to come and see you, I say to the Senator, but they brought with them their experts and told us those plants will cost not $2,300 per kilowatt but, rather, $1,250 per kilowatt. That is about half, as this Senator sees it.\n\tMr. CRAIG. Yes.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. So they are half wrong right up front in terms of their assessment.\n\tFurthermore, the bill itself says that if this section that is being debated is ever used, the Secretary will evaluate the creditworthiness of any new project under this program. So they are already wrong by half on the cost.\n\tThen I would ask, Does the Congressional Budget Office really believe the Secretary will approve a significant risk? If he approves a significant risk, he would be in violation--direct conflict--of the law that we are discussing that he would be acting on that the CBO assumes will cost this extraordinary amount and impose this extraordinary risk.\n\tI thank the Senator for his comments and his responses. I am quite sure the Congressional Budget Office, as this Senator knows--I have only worked with it for the sum total of 26 years on all kinds of issues--I believe there is no subject they are more wrong on than their estimates of the cost of matters nuclear. First of all, they assume that everything that has gone wrong in the past is going to go wrong again, while the world is out there proving that such is not the case, while we are saying only under very limited circumstances would you ever use these sections to begin with, which would eliminate part of their reasoning, which would just leave the scene and would not even be applicable as they attempt to make the risk estimate.\n\tI thank the Senator.\n\tMr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the full Energy Committee and the primary author of this legislation for making what are extremely important clarifying points in relation to the Wyden amendment that would strike this provision of subtitle (b) as it relates to the deployment of new nuclear plants.\n\tIn another life, I once studied real estate and had a real estate license. I know when you try to assess the value of a piece of property, you do what is called a comparable appraisal. You find other properties that are comparable in size, productive capability, if it is a house in square footage, in age, in all of those features. You say that in the marketplace, this house is worth about so much because the comparables, one that has recently sold that is like it or near like it, cost about this much.\n\tWhen it comes to our ability to project the cost of a nuclear powerplant in construction in 2011, there are no U.S. comparables. We are talking about all kinds of new things. We are talking about a new design, a GEN-IV passive reactor design. What size are we talking about, 600-, 800-, 1,000-megawatt plant? Under what kind of regulatory authority? Has the license been developed and what are the peculiarities, the particulars, the specifications within the license? We don't know that. You cannot effectively project.\n\tWhat you can do is exactly what this subtitle does. It gives the Secretary of Energy authority to examine, to make a determination based on fixed criteria that we have placed in the law to protect the public resource. We are going to make the assumption in 2011 that the Secretary of Energy and his or her staff are bright, talented, clear-thinking people who will have to operate under the law. The reason they will have to operate under the law? Because if this is a loan guarantee, it becomes a part of their budget, it becomes scored, and the Congress of the United States has to appropriate the money or at least offset it because it is a guarantee in the market.\n\tThat is how it works. I am not going to be here then, more than likely, and others of my colleagues will not. But we will have written into law the right kind of public policy to protect the citizens' resource, his or her tax money. So the ultimate question is, Does this portion of the title as it relates to nuclear energy fit for the future? Is it the way we get this industry started again, obviously dealing with the provision in the law that creates a liability shield as it relates to Price Anderson, as a new design concept that we think is the right design, the safer design, the cleaner design, the more efficient design, and the reality of a future energy source? And have we created the right incentive to move us into the production of electricity from nuclear-fueled powerplants of the future?\n\n\tThat is what this subtitle is all about. That is why it is important. I don't know that the detail of it has been written, or I should say read or understood specifically. It is very clear. It is very short. The requirements are particularly important. Let me read them:\n\tSubsection (b), Requirements:\n\n       Approved criteria for financial assistance shall include \n     the creditworthiness of the project--\n\n  that is, the responsibility of the Secretary and his or her team to make those determinations--\n\n     the extent to which financial assistance would encourage \n     public-private partnerships and attract private sector \n     investment, the likelihood that financial assistance would \n     hasten commencement of the project, and any other criteria \n     the Secretary deems necessary or appropriate.\n\n\tThat is a totally open-ended clause that says the Secretary can, in fact, develop more findings if necessary to protect the safety and the security of this kind of loan guarantee.\n\n       The Secretary, under the confidentiality provision, shall \n     protect the confidentiality of any information that is \n     certified by the project developer to be commercially \n     sensitive. The full faith and credit of all financial \n     assistance provided by the Secretary under this subtitle \n     shall be a guaranteed obligation of the United States backed \n     by its full faith and credit.\n\n\tThat is fairly boilerplate language. What that says is very clear. If the Secretary makes that determination, that becomes a part of a decision that the Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee in the Senate then deal with. This is not locking in the money. This is simply authorizing the ability of the Secretary in the future to move in a direction that the Congress can make a decision on. That is what this provision is all about.\n\tI believe, we believe, and that is why the Energy Committee in a bipartisan way brought this to the floor for the whole Senate's consideration, because we think it is the right thing to do. It is the right thing to look forward, not just a year from now or 2 but 30 and 40 and 50 years from now and say that we have developed a public policy that will produce the kind of energy that a growing, expanding U.S. economy needs, that it is of high quality, and that it fuels our factories, lights our homes, cools our homes, and in the new age of technology it keeps the Internet humming, by then probably such a wireless communication system that it keeps, if you will, cyberspace vibrating.\n\tA couple of years ago I had the opportunity to visit China, a huge nation, a nation that is expanding by leaps and bounds, a nation that is pushing all sides of development and technology. My wife and I had the opportunity to stay in a beautiful hotel in Shanghai, a state-of-the-art hotel. In this city of Washington, DC, it would probably be called at least a four-star hotel, absolutely a marvelous facility. When we got to our room, the finest of facilities, there were all kinds of places to plug in your computer. It was wired for the state of the art. But it had a problem. The power kept going out. The lights kept blinking. The air-conditioning kept shutting off and turning on.\n\tThe problem that beautiful, new, state-of-the-art hotel had that made it nearly impossible to plug your computer in and go online and, with your e-mail, talk to the United States is that China doesn't have a power grid.\n\tChina doesn't have adequate electrical power. China has developed its electrical resources on a city-by-city, county-by-county basis. They are now striving ahead at a phenomenal cost to create a national power grid to tie themselves together because they know that to compete with us, to put their people to work, and to hopefully some day generate a lifestyle comparable to ours, and an economy comparable to ours, they have to have a power system that is reliable, stable, productive, and that is connected.\n\tNo matter how beautiful the building, no matter how high-tech the facility, if it is not turned on, if it is not wired in, if it is not lit up, it doesn't work. Boy, have we learned that in this country. California has learned that in the last couple of years.\n\tIf all goes well, I am going to be in the heart of the Silicon Valley on Saturday. I will tell you what the conversation is going to be about with some of the high-tech producers down there: Is the Energy bill going to pass? Are you going to get us back into the business of producing energy? We are large consumers of it and we need a high-quality, stable supply of energy that doesn't blink, shut off, or put our production at risk. If you are building chips in a high-tech factory today, known as a FAB, and the power blinks, you lose the whole production. You may lose millions of dollars in a blink of the power connection. So high-quality, stable power is extremely valuable, and if it is not priced right, if it is not competitive, and somewhere else in the world they can provide that high-quality power that is priced differently and in the competitive market, the great tragedy of our economy today in a world environment is that the chips will go elsewhere.\n\tThat is one of many examples that can be used. That is why, finally, when President George W. Bush was elected and came to town, his first priority, among so many, was to assign the Vice President to assemble as many bright thinkers in the energy field as he could and to produce for us, the Congress, a challenge--a national energy policy and a list of criteria that we ought to develop in the form of public policy for this country. There were well over a hundred points in that proposal. Two-thirds of them have already been implemented by rule and regulation by the Secretary of Energy and other agencies of our Government to get this country back on line and producing energy. But about 30 percent of them, or 30-plus, are not. They have to be legislated. It requires new public policy to fully implement what our President envisions as a national priority, what America envisions as a national priority, and what I trust the Senate of the United States clearly understands to be a national priority.\n\tWe tried mightily in the last year or so. The politics, for a variety of reasons, would not allow us to get there. There are factors not in this bill today that were in the bill of a year ago that are highly controversial. There are some changes in this bill. But it was crafted in the committee of authorization. It was voted on piece by piece. It does have a new bipartisan base of support, and we believe it is the kind of energy policy on which we can work out our differences with the House and put on the President's desk and two decades from now look back and say we did the right thing for our country, the right thing for young people today who will be in that labor force 10, 15 years from now, who will demand and require an abundant supply of high-quality energy that is environmentally sound and at a reasonable price for their homes, for their recreation, but, most importantly, for their work site, for the job they are going to seek. That is why this legislation is so important.\n\n\tWe may differ and we are going to have more amendments to come, but I hope our leader and the minority leader recognize the high priority we have here and give us the time to debate this thoroughly and responsibly and deal with all of the amendments that are necessary to get us to that point where we can vote up or down and let the American people clearly understand that the Senate of the United States does support a national energy policy, and that the one we have, in the form of S. 14, is a quantum leap forward into America's future of an abundant energy and a robust economy.\n\tI yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Democratic whip.\n\tMr. REID. I have cleared this with the Republican manager of the bill. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from California have 90 seconds to speak on the next amendment and the opposition have 90 seconds, an extra 30 seconds on each side.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe Senate will be in order. The Senator from California.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is still not in order. It is a complicated amendment. I would like to be able to explain it.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please be in order.\n\tThe Senator from California.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 90 seconds I want to tell you why this amendment is so important. I offer it on behalf of myself and Senator Durbin, a strong supporter of ethanol, Senators Leahy, Feinstein, Clinton, Jeffords, and Lautenberg.\n\tMy amendment simply removes the safe harbor provision in the bill, which treats ethanol like no other fuel, giving consumers and communities no legal recourse if it turns out that the water is polluted or the air is polluted or people get sick from this increased amount of ethanol. Believe me, I hope ethanol is totally safe. But no one is sure. Just read the 1999 blue ribbon EPA panel. They raise some serious questions. Of course, the ethanol manufacturers say ethanol is 100 percent completely safe. Then I ask why they demand this safe harbor provision. Look at what happened to the last gasoline additive we promoted, MTBE. This is the cost to our people because of MTBE pollution: $29 billion. My friends, if we had had the same safe harbor for MTBE as some of us are seeking for ethanol, this would not have fallen completely on your taxpayers and your communities. I call this an unfunded mandate.\n\n\tPeople who oppose this say they only are putting forward a very narrow safe harbor. They say everyone will have a lot of ways to go. But the truth is that defective product liability is the only remedy. The courts have said no to negligence and no to nuisance. The only claim they have is defective product liability.\n\tAll we do is say treat ethanol as we do any other additive.\n\tI urge an aye vote.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\tThe Senator from Oklahoma.\n\tMr. INHOFE. Mr. President, what we are doing here is not giving our stamp of approval on ethanol. We are not mandating. The vast majority of Members here feel more strongly about this than I do.\n\tI know the Senator from California would not deliberately mislead you. What she is saying is just flat wrong.\n\tI keep hearing it over and over again: If a safe harbor provision is enacted into law, No. 1, citizens will not be able to take refiners to court under our court system; and, No. 2, any possible ethanol contamination that happens in the future wouldn't get cleaned up.\n\tIt just isn't true. Even with the enactment of the safe harbor provisions, if a plaintiff makes his case--that is a very significant part of this--there are just a few court theories that could be used in environmental cases: Trespass, not affected by safe harbor; nuisance, not affected by safe harbor; negligence, not affected by safe harbor; breach of implied warrant, not affected by safe harbor; breach of express warranty, not affected by safe harbor.\n\tAs far as cleanups are concerned, if there were a spill, here are some examples of environmental laws that are on the books right now that would take care of the problem and are not affected by safe harbor: No. 1, Resource Conservation Recovery; No. 2, Clean Water Act; No. 3, Oil Pollution Act; No. 4, Superfund; and it goes on and on.\n\tNeither of these assertions is true. They would be able to have their day in court, and at the same time we have adequate laws in the court system and environmental laws to accommodate any cleanup that would take place.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\tThe question is on agreeing to the amendment.

I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 854\n\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes evenly divided before a vote on the second Boxer amendment.\n\tThe Senator from California.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to say that the Boxer-Lugar-Cantwell amendment, which encourages production of agricultural residue ethanol, is going to be accepted by a voice vote with a promise to fight for it in conference.\n\tOur amendment says that if you produce ethanol from the residue of agricultural crops, you get a special incentive. So if your State grows corn, rice, sugar, apples, wheat, oats, barley, and other crops high in fructose, this amendment would help your farmers, your rural communities, and your States meet the ethanol mandate. Again, it simply gives an incentive to produce ethanol from agricultural residue.\n\tI am grateful to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for accepting the amendment. I am happy to take it by voice vote.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n\tThe amendment (No. 854) was agreed to.\n\tMrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\tThe motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\tMr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by the majority and minority leaders, Mr. Frist and Mr. Daschle, on renewable motor fuels. Others may support this amendment for different reasons, but I support the amendment because of its potential to increase motor fuels supply, especially in the Federal reformulated fuels, or RFG, program. This amendment includes provisions that I, and my Wisconsin House colleagues, Congressman Paul Ryan and Mark Green, have long advocated to address supply shortages that the Midwest has experienced in recent years.\n\tThis amendment makes significant changes to the Clean Air Act motor fuels programs that will increase the supply of cleaner fuels nationwide. It bans methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, which is no longer used in my home State of Wisconsin. MTBE, as others will likely discuss in detail, is a reformulated gasoline additive that has contaminated drinking water supplies nationwide.\n\tThe amendment also contains a mandate to increase the supply of ethanol to 5 billion barrels by 2012 both to replace MTBE as an oxygenate in reformulated gasoline and to reduce our dependence upon foreign oil. It also would allow Governors the ability to increase reformulated gasoline supply by opting their entire State into the reformulated fuels program, and increasing the market demand for RFG in their State.\n\tThe amendment also has a provision to increase the amount of reformulated gasoline by reducing the number of boutique fuel blends. The bill reduces the number of Federal reformulated fuel blends by creating a single set of standards. This would broaden the supply from which Wisconsin could draw in times of tight supply.\n\tIf enacted, this amendment would improve fungibility of RFG nationwide, by standardizing volatile organic compound, VOC, reduction requirements. In practice, when combined with the renewable fuels mandate, this would enable States like Wisconsin that use Federal RFG to draw on supplies of Federal RFG from other areas, such as St. Louis and Detroit, if necessary. The ability to rely on other sources of RFG is especially important when sudden supply shortages arise due to unexpected events such as refinery fires or breakdowns which the Midwest has also experienced in recent years.\n\tThis amendment is important because, at present, southeastern Wisconsin cannot draw on RFG from other areas because the Chicago/Wisconsin RFG formula is not used elsewhere in the country. This amendment would help address this boutique fuel problem by bringing other areas that use Federal RFG in line and standardizing VOC reduction requirements and requirements for the production of renewable fuels such as ethanol--the Chicago/Wisconsin area is the only part of the country that uses solely ethanol in its blend of RFG.\n\tAs the use of ethanol blended RFG becomes more widespread, supply problems will become easier to address. This benefits Wisconsin drivers because easing supply shortages will help put an end to severe price spikes, and drivers nationwide by continuing to supply them with RFG that meets Federal Clean Air Act standards in light of State bans on MTBE.\n\tSo far, Mr. President, in light of military conflict in the Middle East, we have been lucky that we have avoided significant increases in gas prices so far this year. But, for folks in Wisconsin, the thought of another approaching summer unfortunately dredges up memories of the high gas prices that have plagued our families in recent years. The Senate must take preventative action today to make sure gas prices stay under control, and our this amendment will help do that. By scrapping the multiple Federal fuel blend requirements and replacing them with a more simplified, streamlined system, this measure will work to make gas supplies more stable and keep prices at the pump within reason. This is a good amendment, and it deserves the support of the Senate.\n\tMrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to address the Frist-Daschle amendment and the Energy bill in general.\n\tNow, do I think there is a way to soundly and responsibly increase our use of alternative fuels? Sure. Do I think that we should increase our use of alternative fuels? You bet. I am just not convinced that the provision we are considering today is the best way to make that happen. And I am not convinced that it is the best way to make that happen for a State such as New York.\n\tI think that an Energy bill has the potential to be a win for us not just on energy and the environment but also on economic development and job creation. An Energy bill could truly be an engine for developing new technologies, manufacturing new products, building new facilities, and with all of that--creating new jobs, while at the same time increasing our energy security and improving the quality of our environment.\n\tI commend my colleagues Senators Domenici and Bingaman, for their efforts in bringing this bill to the floor. They have worked arduously to tackle many complicated and controversial issues.\n\tBut with all due respect to my colleagues, in many cases, I am afraid that this bill unfortunately still falls far short--in terms of energy policy, environmental policy, and economic policy. We need a comprehensive and balanced energy policy that strengthens our energy security, safeguards consumers, protects the environment, spurs economic development, and create jobs.\n\tYet this bill does not truly harness our potential for greater energy efficiency and for newer, cleaner sources of energy. It too often looks to the past to try to solve the energy challenges of the present and turns a blind eye to all that our energy future could be.\n\tFor example, it looks to possible oil and gas resources on the Outer Continental Shelf--areas of the ocean that have been under drilling moratoria for years in an effort to preserve precious ocean and coastal resources and the coastal tourism economies of a number of our States.\n\tIt also apparently requires an inventory of oil and gas resources on Federal lands, as well as an inventory of restrictions or impediments to development of those resources. Now my colleagues in New York and I have been fighting for years to protect the Finger Lakes National Forest from drilling, and so I have a difficult time with provisions like this.\n\tThe bill permanently extends the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to indemnify nuclear powerplants against liability for nuclear accidents under the Price-Anderson Act, and provides other substantial subsidies to the nuclear power industry. Yet the bill does not do enough to increase the diversity of our energy supply, which would also create new business and economic growth opportunities.\n\tI am pleased that the bill contains provisions related to the increased use of fuel cells and hydrogen fuel because this is a key example of how we can be working to increase our energy security, while also improving the environment and creating jobs. And it is places like Upstate New York, where we have many companies and universities doing exciting work in this area, which will emerge as world leaders in his technology. That is why I have joined with Senator Dorgan, Senator Lieberman, and others in supporting legislation that would go even further than the bill we are currently debating in supporting fuel cells. And that is in part why, when we debated the renewable fuel provisions in the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, Senator Boxer and I fought to include provisions that would provide Federal support for the construction of waste-to-ethanol plants and other cellulosic biomass ethanol production facilities.\n\tBecause these projects would help States such as ours produce more renewable fuel--produce fuel from waste products, which would therefore also help the environment--and at the same time produce more jobs as well.\n\tWe are grateful for the committee's support for our amendments, and we are pleased that these provisions remain in the amendment that is before us today.\n\tBut many of my colleagues and I still have reservations with respect to this amendment. That is why some have pushed to have their States exempted entirely from the renewable fuels requirements in this amendment, while many others have voted to require States to proactively opt-in to the renewable fuels program.\n\tDespite the many outstanding questions regarding the renewable fuels requirements in this amendment--whether it is transportation or storage or other infrastructure issues, market concentration concerns, impacts on gasoline prices for consumers at the pump, air quality impacts, you name it--there is a seeming unwillingness to consider even the slightest changes to the provisions before us--at least for some States.\n\tWhile certain States are exempted all together, other States that have special considerations, such as my State of New York which has a State ban of MTBE that goes into effect in just a few months, which has certain air quality issues, and very little existing ability to produce significant quantities of renewable fuel--our special needs go unmet.\n\tWith all of the concerns I have regarding the amendment before us, I have even more concerns about the provisions passed by the House, which I believe in many respects are greatly inferior to the provisions we are considering here today. So that gives me even further pause in taking up this issue.\n\tFor example, whereas the amendment before us contains a welcome and long-awaited Federal phase-out of the use of MTBE over the next 4 years, the House bill does not phase out MTBE at all. Even more disturbing, it includes a liability safe harbor for MTBE.\n\tNow, there is no question that the time has come to take action at the Federal level on MTBE. New York is on the front lines of this battle. We have banned MTBE use in the State as of January 1, 2004.\n\tThere are a number of other States that have taken action to phase out or limit the use of MTBE as well, including: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, and Washington. Now, those are the States that have actually passed State laws. But here are a number of other States that have tried to pass laws and are still trying to pass laws to phase out or ban MTBE.\n\tIn the absence of any Federal action, States have been forced to take action on their own to limit MTBE use in motor vehicle fuel because it has wreaked havoc on the environment--in particular, on drinking water sources. Unfortunately, those State actions are now being challenged in court.\n\tYet the States are acting for good reason. New York has experienced first-hand the impact of MTBE contamination on our drinking water--particularly on Long Island.\n\tAccording to testimony before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee offered recently by Mr. Paul Granger, superintendent of the Plainview Water District on Long Island, ``New York has identified some 1970 MTBE spill sites with 430 of them on Long Island alone.''\n\tThat is why New York, once again out in front on the issue of MTBE, has probably the toughest standard in the Nation for the amount of MTBE allowed in surface and ground water--10 parts per billion.\n\tBut according to Mr. Granger's testimony, ``At least 21 states have reported well closures due to MTBE groundwater contamination.'' It is estimated that more than 500 public drinking water wells and 45,000 private wells throughout the country are contaminated by MTBE.\n\tAccording to testimony recently offered by the American Lung Association before the Environment and Public Works Committee, millions of Americans are being served by drinking water sources contaminated by MTBE.\n\tAs we are far too familiar now, the cost of cleaning up this MTBE contamination are significant. According to the testimony of Mr. Craig Perkins, director of Environment and Public Works for the city of Santa Monica, CA, ``Current estimates for the total cost of nationwide MTBE clean-up are $30 billion and counting.'' That is why we have lawsuits pending in New York regarding MTBE contamination of ground water, because these communities, these water suppliers, and ultimately their customers, cannot meet the financial burden of these cleanups.\n\tSo while having clean air to breathe is important, so is having clean water to drink. We should not have to trade one for the other.\n\tPhasing out the use of MTBE as a fuel additive is the right thing to do from a drinking water perspective, from an overall environmental and public health perspective, and from a fuels perspective. That is why such a phase-out of MTBE was recommended over 3 years ago by the EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline.\n\tThe State-by-State approach to MTBE that we are currently operating under does not work. It does not work for the markets, the refiners, or the distributors to have this patchwork of States that do or do not allow the addition of MTBE to gasoline.\n\tI am very pleased that the Frist-Daschle amendment includes such a phase-out but I am concerned about other provisions of this amendment pertaining to renewable fuels, including the safe harbor provisions. I am deeply concerned that the House bill does not include a phase-out of MTBE but does provide a liability safe harbor for MTBE.\n\tThe reality is that we can phase out MTBE and repeal the existing 2 percent oxygenate requirement under the Clean Air Act while still ensuring that we meet current clean air standards. And I support legislation that will do these three things.\n\tAfter banning MTBE and removing the oxygenate requirement, there would still be an increase in the use of ethanol in this country--with or without the mandate we are contemplating here today.\n\tMr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate amendment 850, an amendment to add a renewable fuels package to the energy bill.\n\tThis language establishes a nationwide renewable fuels standard of 5 billion gallons by 2012, repeals the Clean Air Act's oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline and phases down the use of MTBE over 4 years.\n\tThis language has strong bipartisan support and is the result of long negotiations between the Renewable Fuels Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the Farm Bureau Federation, the American Petroleum Institute, the Northeast states for Coordinated Air Use Management, NESCAUM, and the American Lung Association.\n\tPassage of this ethanol language will protect our national security, economy, and environment. \n\tThe amendment that the majority leader has introduced--a compromise that will triple the amount of domestically-produced ethanol used in America--is one essential tool in reducing our dependence on imported oil.\n\tPresident Bush has stated repeatedly that energy security is a cornerstone for national security. I agree. It is crucial that we become less dependent on foreign sources of oil and look more to domestic sources to meet our energy needs. Ethanol is an excellent domestic source--it is a clean burning, homegrown renewable fuel that we can rely on for generations to come.\n\tEthanol is also good for our Nation's economy. Tripling the use of renewable fuels over the next decade will:\n\tReduce our National Trade Deficit by more than $34 billion;\n\tIncrease U.S. GDP by $156 billion by 2012;\n\tCreate more than 214,000 new jobs;\n\tExpand household income by an additional $51.7 billion;\n\tSave taxpayers $3 billion annually in reduced government subsidies due to the creation of new markets for corn.\n\tThe benefits for the farm economy are even more pronounced. Ohio is 6th in the Nation in terms of corn production and is among the highest in the nation in putting ethanol into gas tanks, over 40 percent of all gasoline sold in Ohio contains ethanol. An increase in the use of ethanol across the Nation means an economic boost to thousands of farm families across my State:\n\tCurrently, ethanol production provides 192,000 jobs and $4.5 billion to net farm income nationwide;\n\tPassage of this amendment will increase net farm income by nearly $6 billion annually;\n\tPassage of this amendment will create $5.3 billion of new investment in renewable fuel production capacity.\n\tPhasing out MTBE on a national basis will be good for our fuel supply. Because refiners are under tremendous strain from having to make several different gasoline blends to meet various State clean air requirements--and no new refineries have been built in the last 25 years--the effects of various State responses to the threat of MTBE contamination--including bans and phase-outs on different schedules--will add a significant burden to existing refineries. The MTBE phase-out provisions in this package will ensure that refiners will have less stress on their system and that gasoline will be more fungible nationwide.\n\tExpanding the use of ethanol will also protect our environment by reducing auto emissions, which will mean cleaner air and improved public health.\n\tUse of ethanol reduces emissions of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons by 20 percent;\n\tEthanol also reduces emissions of particulates by 40 percent;\n\tUse of ethanol RFG helped move Chicago into attainment of the federal ozone standard, the only RFG area to see such improvement;\n\tIn 2002, ethanol use in the United States reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 4.3 million tons--the equivalent of removing more than 630,000 vehicles from the road.\n\tOur farmers can meet the ethanol standard. For 2003, the ethanol industry is on pace to produce more than 2.7 billion gallons. The amount of ethanol required under the FRS begins at 2.6 billion gallons in 2005. Adequate ethanol supply is simply not an issue.\n\tCurrently, 73 ethanol plants nationwide have the capacity to produce over 2.9 billion gallons annually. Further, there are ten ethanol plants under construction, which when completed will bring the total capacity to more than 3.3 billion gallons.\n\tCalifornia has been cited as a major problem area; however, all but two small refiners have already transitioned from MTBE into ethanol. California will use close to 700 million gallons of ethanol in 2003 after consuming roughly 100 million gallons last year. The California Energy Commission has concluded the transition to ethanol ``is progressing without any major problems.'' The U.S. Energy Information Administration found the transition went ``remarkably well.''\n\tIndividual States are banning the use of MTBE, but they cannot change the federal RFG oxygen content requirement. The collision of these two elements under current law will likely lead to higher costs.\n\tUnder current law, California's required ethanol use in 2005 would be 895 million gallons. Under this amendment, fuel providers supplying California will be required to use far less ethanol in 2005--291 million gallons. And more importantly, they will benefit from the bill's credit banking and trading provisions.\n\tWith the State MTBE ban set for January 2004, New York faces a similar situation. Under the status quo, fuel providers will be required to use 197 million gallons of ethanol in New York in 2005. However, if this amendment is enacted, refiners, blenders and importers would be required to use or purchase credits for even less--111 million gallons of ethanol in 2005.\n\tA study conducted by Mathpro, a prominent economic analysis firm, found that, compared to a situation where States are banning MTBE and the federal RFG oxygen content requirement is left in place, this amendment will lower the average gasoline production cost: by about two-tenths of a cent per gallon.\n\n\tIn addition, this language provide safeguards. In the event that the RFS would severely harm the economy or the environment or would lead to potential supply and distribution problems, the RFS requirement could be reduced or eliminated.\n\tEthanol is already blended from Alaska to Florida and from California to New York. Ethanol is already transported via barge, railcar, and oceangoing vessel to markets throughout the country. The U.S. Department of Energy studied the feasibility of a 5 billion gallon per year national ethanol market and found that ``no major infrastructure barriers exist'' and that needed investments on an amortized, per-gallon basis are ``modest'' and ``present no major obstacle.''\n\tBoth the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Congressional Budget Office have recognized the benefit of the investment of the ethanol program on the overall health to the nation's economy. Recently, the USDA stated the ethanol program would decrease farm program payments by $3 billion per year. In its analysis of this amendment, CBO stated the provision would reduce direct spending by $2 billion during 2005-2013.\n\tThe RFS agreement includes strong anti-backsliding provisions that prohibit refiners from producing gasoline that increases emissions once the oxygenate requirement is removed. A Governor can also petition EPA for a waiver of the ethanol requirement based on supporting documentation that the ethanol waiver will increase emissions that contribute to air pollution in any area of the state.\n\tThe fuels agreement would benefit the environment in a number of ways:\n  reduces tailpipe emissions of carbon monoxide, VOCs, and fine particulates,\n  phases down MTBE over 4 years to address groundwater contamination, and since ethanol biodegrades quickly, it will not have the same problem,\n  provides for one grade of summertime Federal RFG, which is more stringent,\n  increases the benefits from the Federal RFG program on air toxic reductions,\n  provides states in the Ozone Transport Region and enhanced opportunity to participate in the RFG program because of unique air quality problems,\n  includes provisions that require EPA to conduct a study on the effects on public health, air quality, and water resources of increased use of potential MTBE substitutes, including ethanol.\n\tThe use of ethanol-blended fuels also reduces so-called greenhouse gas emissions by 12-19 percent compared with conventional gasoline, according to Argonne National Laboratory. In fact, Argonne states ethanol use last year in the U.S. reduced the so-called greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 4.3 million tons, equivalent to removing the annual emissions of more than 636,000 cars.\n\tI also want to point out that the California Environmental Policy Council recently gave ethanol a clean bill of health and approved its use as a replacement for MTBE in California gasoline.\n\tA similar provision has already passed the House of Representatives this year. Virtually the same agreement passed the Senate in April 2002 with 69 votes.\n\tThe fuels agreement is supported by the American Petroleum Institute; the Renewable Fuels Association; the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management (NESCAUM); U.S. Chamber of Commerce; US Action; the Union of Concerned Scientists; the Environmental and Energy Studies Institute; the Governor's Ethanol Coalition; General Motors; the Governors of California and New York; and all of the major agricultural organizations in the United States.\n\tIt is time to pass an ethanol bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote yes for America's farmers and this amendment.\n\tMr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is important that Congress make available all possible options for refiners to ensure compliance with the renewable fuels standard and decrease chances for gasoline price and supply volatility. One such option for meeting the renewable fuels standard that has shown promise is ethyl tertiary butyl ether ETBE.\n\tETBE is a High-octane, low-vapor pressure, gasoline-blending component produced from a combination of ethanol and butane. Because both of these raw materials are produced in abundance domestically, ETBE will help expand US gasoline supplies, moderating possible gasoline price volatility.\n\tETBE is fully fungible with gasoline. This allows ETBE to be blended into gasoline at any point in the gasoline logistical chain and transported in gasoline pipelines to regions of the country where it is more costly to transport and blend ethanol into gasoline. Moreover, ETBE does not have a negative impact on gasoline vapor pressure, making it easier and more cost-effective to blend ETBE into gasoline--especially during the summertime ozone control season when gasoline vapor pressure is restricted.\n\tETBE reduces more gasoline evaporative and tailpipe emissions, lowers air toxics and carbon monoxide, and provides 20-percent more carbon dioxide emission reduction than other gasoline-blending components.\n\tETBE is 75 percent less water soluble than MTBE. This means use of ETBE substantially reduces the risks to ground water resources should gasoline leak from an underground storage tank. ETBE also has other physical properties which make it migrate slower and shorter distances--and easier to remediate--should a gasoline spill or leak occur.\n\tI support the development of ETBE because of the benefits it provides for cleaner air, enhanced gasoline supply, and the ability to transport the fuel in the current infrastructure. Congress, in enacting a RFS, should not do anything to preclude its use. The marketplace should be allowed to determine how it will meet the requirements of the RFS.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 850\n\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 850 as amended. There are to be 2 minutes evenly divided on the amendment.\n\tMr. REID. Mr. President, we yield back our time.\n\tMr. DOMENICI.

The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n\tMr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 209, I voted no. It was my intention to vote aye. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to change my vote since it will not affect the outcome.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\tMr. FRIST. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\tThe motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 1308\n\n\tMr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 52, H.R. 1308; that immediately upon the reporting of the bill, Senator Grassley be recognized to offer a substitute amendment on behalf of himself, Senators Lincoln, Snowe, Baucus, and Voinovich; provided further that there be 30 minutes for debate equally divided between Senators Grassley and Baucus or their designees prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, and that no other amendments be in order; provided further that if the amendment is agreed to, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on final passage of the bill as amended.\n\tFurther, I ask that if the amendment is not agreed to, then H.R. 1308 be placed back on the calendar and that no points of order be waived by this agreement. I further ask consent that following that vote, the Senate then insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair then be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate with a ratio of 3 to 2.\n\tFinally, I ask unanimous consent that following passage of the bill, the amendment to the title be agreed to.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. FRIST. Mr. President, for the benefit of my colleagues, we will have further announcements later in this evening. We would expect to have a final rollcall vote for the week approximately 30 or 40 minutes from now. Although we will have no more rollcall votes after that, we will stay and be available to debate amendments tonight, and we will be in session tomorrow. We expect not to have rollcall votes tomorrow. We will have further announcements later tonight with regard to the schedule tomorrow, as well as Monday.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n\tMr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me compliment the distinguished majority leader for the effort he has made to bring us to this point. Were it not for his effort, we would not have accomplished what we have with this unanimous consent agreement. I appreciate his efforts.\n\n\tLet me also single out in particular the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. Without her persistence and her effort, now weeks long, we would not be here. She has spoken out with courage and conviction and empathy on behalf of 12 million children, 8 million families who otherwise would be left out of tax relief. The argument that she has made from the beginning has been without this legislation those millions of children and those working families would get no tax relief on July 1. The passage of this legislation today will accommodate that concern, that need. \n\tThis will give us an opportunity to send the recommendation to the House. It will send a clear message to working families that we are serious about providing the kind of tax relief that is so necessary for these families if we are going to provide it to others; that it will be available. The refundable child credit assistance can be made available in time for tax relief provided to others as well.\n\tI commend the Senator. I commend the majority leader. I thank my colleagues for this agreement.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. I ask the majority leader, would it be appropriate to dispose of the pending LIHEAP amendment to clear the record for the evening in spite of the unanimous consent request?\n\tMr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I assume it has been cleared by the distinguished leader. I have no objection.\n\tMr. FRIST. We will proceed with that. It makes the most efficient use of everyone's time.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. We have a Senator who still wants to speak on the pending bill. I assume after the time just provided has expired, we will be back for the distinguished Senator from Colorado to speak to an amendment; is that correct?\n\tMr. FRIST. Yes.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 841 Withdrawn\n\n\tMr. DOMENICI. For the record, under the bill, I withdraw amendment No. 841.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe amendment (No. 841) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 860 To Amendment No. 840\n\n\tMr. DOMENICI. I send a new second-degree amendment to the desk on behalf of Senator Bingaman.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\tThe legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. DOMENICI], for Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 860 to amendment No. \n     840.\n\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reauthorize LIHEAP, Weatherization assistance, and State \n                            Energy Programs)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n\n                    TITLE XII--STATE ENERGY PROGRAMS\n\n     SEC. 1201.

Mr. President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. I am pleased, colleagues, that we have been able to reach consensus on the need to include in this bill an increase in the authorization level for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) program from $2 billion to $3.4 billion. With power costs on the rise around this nation, it is imperative that the Senate act now to respond to the needs of the 85 percent of eligible families that today do not receive the help they so desperately need, due to the perennially under-funded nature of the LIHEAP program.\n\tThere is another issue relevant to the LIHEAP program, however, that I hope the Senate will soon consider. I believe that we must address the manner in which the Department of Health and Human Services--and, of course, the Office of Management and Budget--have traditionally administered the ``contingency'' portion of the LIHEAP program. While the bulk of LIHEAP dollars are distributed to states via block grants and in accordance with a statutory formula, Congress has also authorized--and appropriated funds to--a contingency fund, designed to ``meet the additional home energy assistance needs of one or more States arising from a natural disaster or other emergency.'' This money is not released according to formula--but solely at the discretion of the HHS Secretary.\n\tUnfortunately, recent history suggests that there are problems with the way the ``contingency'' portion of LIHEAP is administered. In essence, there seem to be widely varying eligibility rules applied to the release of these contingency funds--leading to instances in which HHS has overlooked very real energy emergencies, including the recent power crisis in my home state of Washington.\n\tI believe that clear rules for the release of these dollars will ensure that, in the unfortunate event of an energy emergency, low-income families will receive much-needed assistance in keeping the lights and the heat turned on--which is precisely what Congress intends when it appropriates money to the LIHEAP contingency fund. During mark-up on this bill in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Sen. Smith and I added language--adopted unanimously-seeking to put guidelines around the release of these emergency LIHEAP funds.\n\tHowever, I understand that the distinguished Chairman, Senator Gregg, and Ranking Member, Senator Kennedy, intend to reauthorize the LIHEAP program in their Committee this year and examine very closely the administration of these contingency funds. I believe the language that Senator Smith and I authored would go a long way toward adding clarity to the process, and I would be exceptionally pleased to work with the Chairman on this and other proposals to reform the LIHEAP emergency program to ensure it is as responsive as possible to the very real needs of low-income Americans.\n\tMr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Washington for her comments. I agree that the manner in which LIHEAP contingency funds are distributed should be examined. I would be happy to work with the Senator on this important matter as the H.E.L.P. Committee works towards reauthorization of this program in the coming months.\n\tMr. KENNEDY. I also believe the Senator from Washington makes a very good point about the administration of LIHEAP emergency funds. I too would be happy to work with the Senator on including language to address her concerns when the Committee debates LIHEAP reauthorization later this year.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the second-degree amendment be adopted and the underlying first-degree amendment No. 840, as amended, be agreed to.\n\tMr. REID. Mr. President, I ask consent following the disposition of the unanimous consent agreement dealing with the child tax credit, the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, be recognized to speak on LIHEAP. She wanted to speak before the vote but this would be fine.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Five minutes?\n\tMr. REID. Probably 10 minutes. I am sure she can complete a statement in 10 minutes.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Senator Campbell has been waiting for a long time. He has an amendment on the underlying bill.\n\tMr. REID. She can speak after he offers his amendment. He will not speak that long.\n\tMr. CAMPBELL. That is all right.\n\tMr. REID. How long will you speak?\n\tMr. CAMPBELL. I am going to speak for 15 or 18 minutes.\n\tMr. REID. She has waited around here all day to speak on LIHEAP. Why not limit her time to 5 minutes; that should be adequate.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe amendment (No. 860) was agreed to.\n\tThe amendment (No. 841), as amended, was agreed to.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n\tMr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\tThe motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Harry Reid", "Barbara Boxer", "Pete V.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport H.R. 1308.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1308) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to end certain abusive tax practices, to provide tax \n     relief and simplification, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 862\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Grassley], for himself, Mrs. \n     Lincoln, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Murkowski, \n     Mr. Warner, Mr. Stevens, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 862.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am pleased to join my distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, in the agreement we have reached on the child tax \ncredit. I wish to take a minute to fill in my colleagues on how we are \nat this place at this time on another tax bill.\n  In the Finance Committee in the year 2001, Senator Snowe and Senator \nLincoln added a refundable formula to enhance the child tax credit. \nThis provision lasted through conference. The formula was increased to \n15 percent in 2005. President Bush proposed to accelerate the $1,000 \ntax credit amount but did not accelerate the refundability formula.\n  In the Finance Committee, we accelerated the refundability formula. \nUnfortunately, that provision was dropped in conference. At that \ndisappointing moment and at times since, I have indicated that I would \nlike to revive that formula. I was joined by several Finance Committee \nmembers and both leaders in attempting to resolve this problem.\n  I am pleased to say this agreement moves the ball on the marriage \npenalty and the child tax credit. The relief is small but a start in \naddressing yet another marriage penalty.\n  I applaud Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for her steadfast interest in \nresolving this other marriage penalty provision.\n  Finally, our agreement is offset with an extension of customs fees, \nuser fees. I urge the House to respond on our action today.\n  I would like to get the bill to the President. This will ensure that \nlow-income families get the checks we expect to get out in the next few \nmonths that are related to the tax bill that the President signed last \nweek. Without this additional provision we are working on now, we would \nhave families who get an increase in the child credit of $400 per child \nget a check this summer, but we would not get checks to people who are \nentitled to the usual refundability because it was not extended.\n  I would like to do a lot more on the child tax credit. Families \nshould be able to rely on permanent tax relief. That is what the bill I \nintroduced did--not this compromise before the Senate. That is close to \nwhat the Senate growth bill did. That is what we should do in the \nupcoming process on this legislation.\n  I hope we resolve the refundability formula. We address the marriage \npenalty and the child tax credit and we make progress on the longer \nterm child tax credit. We simplify the definition of a child. This last \nmeasure is the principal recommended simplification of the Tax Code for \nindividuals. This recommendation comes from the Joint Committee on \nTaxation and the Treasury Department and is something that should have \nbeen done a long time ago.\n  Today we make some major progress on simplifying the Tax Code. Of \ncourse, we need to do a lot more. This is what we do as we try to move \nforward on various pieces of legislation from the Finance Committee.\n  In this bill we are also going to help those serving in the Armed \nForces overseas. Because some of their remuneration is not considered \nincome, they would not benefit from the child tax refund the same way \nas other people who are not in a war zone. We ought to change that and \ndo change it so everybody is treated fairly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, is it correct that the order provides for \n30 minutes equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas. I might \nadd, she is the prime mover of this bill. She is the one who made that \nhappen. We are deeply indebted to her.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I give special thanks to my colleague \nfrom Montana. There are many people to thank today for moving forward \nin the right direction, recognizing the working families of this \ncountry. I thank Chairman Grassley, who worked tirelessly with us, as \nwell as the ranking member, Senator Baucus; certainly the leadership on \nboth sides, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, who have both been \nwilling to work with all of us to come together on this agreement.\n  I would also like to say a very special thanks to my colleague, \nSenator Olympia Snowe from Maine, who has been a wonderful colleague \nand certainly someone who has worked equally as hard as I have on this \nissue. I am very pleased to have worked with her, both now as well as \nin the past.\n  If people can go back as far as 2001, they will remember in that 2001 \ntax bill Senator Snowe and I worked hard to bring about the \nrefundability of the child tax credit, recognizing and understanding \nworking Americans all across this country, trying to raise their \nfamilies, were in need of the kind of assistance that refundable child \ntax credit would bring to them. I am very pleased and honored to have \nworked with her in the great work she has done in this effort.\n  I am certainly pleased that we have reached this agreement to restore \nthe advanced refundability for the child credit, for the hard work \nSenator Grassley has done in bringing about the uniform definition of a \n``child'' in the Tax Code. To bring about those kinds of reforms are \nnot easy steps. I think it is one of our first monumental moves in the \nright direction in which Senator Grassley will lead us in other reforms \nin the Tax Code.\n  Certainly this agreement is the culmination of years of effort. I \nwould like to recognize, however, and emphasize particularly the fact \nthat we are helping working parents and working families. I know there \nare some critics out there who have referred to these provisions as \nwelfare. I just find that description so disheartening, since we are \ntalking about 200,000 military families, hundreds of firefighters, and \nteachers, and other hard-working Americans. I don't think of them, or \nview them, as welfare recipients. I don't think they think of \nthemselves that way.\n  These are taxpayers. They are hard-working families who pay sales \ntax, both State and local. They have payroll taxes that come out of \ntheir checks. They pay excise tax, and in\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\nmany of our rural States that is an awful lot when they travel for \nmiles to get from their homes to their jobs.\n  It is so important for all of us to recognize that these taxes these \nindividuals are paying are in equal proportion, many times, to many of \nthe other people in different income and tax brackets, but these are \ntaxes that never see cuts. Rarely do we see a cut in a sales tax or in \nthe payroll tax, certainly, or in the State and local sales tax. In the \nexcise taxes? We don't see cuts in these areas.\n  Therefore, it is so important that we provide the kind of assistance \nwe can for these working families, to make sure they are going to be \nable to help stimulate this economy and certainly to help strengthen \nour country.\n\n  The news reports that followed the passage of the tax bill noted that \nfamilies do receive a check of $400 in July. But they did neglect to \nmention those 12 million children who would not get those checks. I am \nso pleased that today we are recognizing it is not only an important \nissue to deal with, providing these 12 million children the kind of \nresources they need in their families to grow strong, to learn the \nvalues we want them to learn, to become good citizens and leaders and \nworkers in this great Nation, but we are also recognizing the fairness \nof this issue in a timely way.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the House in that they have that same \nopportunity to recognize this is a timely issue. If we want these \nworking families to have that same benefit, to be able to receive that \ntax credit, that child benefit credit in the same timely way that other \nindividuals will receive that tax relief, then we have to do it \nimmediately. We do have to move forward quickly.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the House to really take to heart the \nimmediacy of this issue and help us move it forward quickly. The \npassage of this provision today is the first step in ensuring those 12 \nmillion children will also get that $400 check, or whatever check they \nare entitled to--and it might be more--in July, at the same time others \ndo. Time is definitely of the essence. I call on the Members of the \nother body to act quickly on this bill and ensure that all of our \nworking families will benefit.\n  The uniform definition of the child, as I mentioned, through Chairman \nGrassley's efforts and certainly those of many others, Senator Hatch \nand Senator Baucus, is a great inclusion in this measure.\n  In short, this is a targeted tax provision to help working families. \nIt is what I have argued since we began this round of tax discussions \nin January, and I hope we can continue in that vein.\n  People ask, why is it so important? For me, that question is a very \neasy one to answer. Nearly half of the taxpayers in Arkansas have \nadjusted gross incomes of less than $20,000. Arkansas families were \namong some of the hardest hit when the refundable portion of the child \ncredit was stripped from the bill. That is why it is important to me. \nIt was important enough to bring up this issue and certainly to \nreaddress something that did not happen in that original tax bill.\n  Mr. President, 76,000 Arkansas families, 132,000 Arkansas children, \nwere left behind in that final tax bill when it was signed. If that is \nnot reason enough for me to cause a ruckus or to be persistent, I don't \nknow what is. I appreciate the accolades from my colleagues, but really \nwhat is more important--I think it is essential that we recognize, when \nwe take actions such as the recent tax bill, there is a lot of \nimportance in the details. We have to recognize that when we do not pay \nattention to the details, there are many individuals who get left \nbehind, who are not going to receive those benefits. This is one of \nthose cases.\n  I say to my colleagues, this is not about trying to create more debt \nfor these children who will also inherit that debt later on; this is \nabout taking something we could have done and we didn't, taking \nsomething we could do better, acknowledging it, and moving forward with \nthe actions that will create that better circumstance for working \nfamilies.\n\n  That is why I have been working so hard these past few weeks--and for \nthe last 3 years--recognizing what it means to the families in \nArkansas.\n  It is also important for all of us in the Senate, and in the \nCongress, as we move forward on very important legislation, such as the \ntax bill that was just signed into law, to put ourselves in the shoes \nof these families. We talk about raising our families. We talk about \nraising our children. We talk about what it takes to create a family \natmosphere that is focused on values, that is focused on good manners, \nis focused on compassion and being part of a community, reaching out to \none another. It means, too, that each of us has to recognize all of our \nfamilies are faced with different circumstances, whether it is military \npersonnel stationed in Iraq and leaving a wife and two children at \nhome; whether it is a schoolteacher or a firefighter; whether it is a \npolice officer, many of whom fall into this category that was left \nout--these who make $10,500 to $26,625. That doesn't seem to be a \ncategory that would include that many, but it does. These are essential \npeople in our communities, those who are protecting us from fire and \nfrom criminal activity, those who are teaching our children, those who \nare stationed abroad and protecting our very freedoms. So it is so \ncritical we put ourselves in their shoes and better understand what it \nis they are doing for their families.\n  I have to say I have a good opportunity because when I take care of \nmy family, I try to stop and think: Are there other mothers out there \ndoing the same thing I am? Is it any different for a mother who is in \nthe Senate than it is for a mother who is making $20,000, when you go \nto the store and you have to spend that week's paycheck on blue jeans \nand tennis shoes, a set of tires to make your automobile safe to get \nyour children to and from school or yourself to and from work? There is \nnot a lot of difference, regardless of who you are. Giving these \nindividuals the ability to take care of those family needs is critical.\n  We have not even talked about the aspect of how this can be a \nstimulative partner in what this overall tax bill was meant to do. It \nwas meant to stimulate the economy. Why do we want to stimulate the \neconomy anyway? We want to stimulate the economy because we want to \nstrengthen our country, because we believe in this country and we \nbelieve in what makes up this country. There is no better place to \nlook, in order to do that, than the American family.\n  So I praise my colleagues today for recognizing that there are a \nworld of families out there we can help today--mothers and fathers, \nworking hard, playing by the rules at their jobs. They are not eligible \nfor these credits unless they are working, unless they are bringing \nhome earnings, and unless they have children.\n  There is a whole group of individuals we could help here by giving \nthem the opportunity to give something back to their country in \nstrengthening this economy. Who else is going to be there to purchase \nthe majority of items that will spur our economy and spur those \ncompanies that need to be driven?\n  In conclusion, I applaud all of my colleagues. This has been a \nunified effort among many people to try to do the right thing. I think, \nafter all, that is what we are here in the Senate to do--the right \nthing on behalf of the working families of this great Nation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Oklahoma 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to vote against this \namendment.\n  I want to state a few things. I would like to correct the Record and \nstate a few facts. I have heard some people say this provision was \nstripped out of a provision in the tax bill and it therefore left low-\nincome people without any benefits from President Bush's tax cut. That \nis factually inaccurate. The fact is that in the year 2001 we passed a \ntax bill, and many of the people who complained mostly about this \nprovision voted against the 2001 bill and the 2003 bill. Now they come \nback and say: You didn't do enough in this one category.\n  We did a lot for low-income people. We reduced the tax rate from 15 \npercent to 10 percent. And we did it retroactively, well after we \npassed the bill.\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\nWe reduced that rate by a third--15 percent to 10 percent--and did it \nretroactively. We reduced every other rate on the books by 1 percentage \npoint. I just mention that. We did a lot.\n  We increased the standard deduction by 20 percent. We increased the \nchild tax credit from $500 to $1,000. It was $600. In the 2003 bill \nwhich the President just signed, we made it $1,000. That benefits \nfamilies. It disproportionally benefits low-income people. We took \nmillions of people off the tax rolls. They didn't have to pay taxes as \na result of the fact that we reduced rates. And we passed tax credits. \nAfter we passed tax credits, millions of people who were taxpayers were \nno longer taxpayers.\n\n  Then we get into the issue of refundability. We already have an \nunearned income tax credit, which is one of the most plagued, \ninaccurate programs we have in the Federal Government. It is about a \n$30 billion-a-year program. Its error rate is in the 20-some-odd \npercent range. About a fourth of it is in error. There is a lot of \nfraud. There are a lot of inaccuracies. People claim children they \ndon't have so they can get a bigger refund. Maybe some of it was \ninaccurate and maybe some if it was on purpose.\n  Some people say the Bush tax cut didn't benefit low-income families. \nThat is factually incorrect. Let me give you an example. Before the \nBush tax cut, if you had a low-income couple and both made minimum wage \nwith a combined income of $21,000, they had personal exemptions--\ntalking about, let us say, a family of four--$12,200; a standard \ndeduction of $7,900; their taxable income is $850 at 15 percent tax; \ntheir income tax was $128; and for their earned income credit, we would \nwrite a check for $2,888. They received a net income tax refund of \n$2,761. Somebody said they pay payroll taxes. Yes, they could. That is \na total of $1,607. So they received $1,154 after they paid income taxes \nand payroll taxes.\n  That was before President Bush's 2001 or 2003 tax bill passed. After \nthe bills we just passed, they will receive a net refund in excess of \nincome taxes and Social Security taxes of $2,332. That is a 102-percent \nincrease. That is what the Government is writing them a check for. That \nis the amount left over after they paid income taxes and payroll taxes.\n  The question we are now really debating is, Do we want to have the \nFederal Government write bigger checks, and have bigger negative income \ntaxes? Do we want to try to make the Income Tax Code more progressive? \nUsually when they say that, they mean lower income people pay a greater \npercentage.\n  Under present law, the upper 5 percent of the income tax bracket pay \n50 percent of the tax; the lower 50 percent of the income tax bracket \npay 5 percent of the tax. Yet some people say that is not progressive \nenough; that we need to have Uncle Sam write bigger checks to people \neven in multiples of their payroll taxes and income taxes combined--not \nequal to, not balancing out payroll taxes, but we want to write them in \nmultiples.\n  Part of this amendment says let us increase the refundability far in \nexcess of payroll and income taxes. I don't support that theory. That \nwas in fact in the 2001 bill. Part of the tax bill we agreed to said we \nwould have a percentage. The child tax credit would be refundable--10 \npercent. And, oh yes, in the year 2005, we would make that 15 percent.\n  The amendment on which we are going to vote would accelerate that \nreduction to 15 percent immediately. That would probably happen. It \ncould have happened. It actually passed the Finance Committee and \npassed the floor of the Senate. Had we had greater support for the \nbill, it could have been in the conference report.\n  I hope before final passage, we can make the child credit permanent. \nI hope when the bill comes back from conference, we will make permanent \na $1,000 tax credit for all individuals. Then we can make this change \nin addition.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the information titled ``Family of Four \nWith Two Minimum Wage Workers'' be printed in the Record, along with \nthe ``Child Credit/EIC Effect on Tax Burden'' information.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              FAMILY OF FOUR WITH TWO MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          PRE-2001 BUSH TAX CUT\n \nWages.......................................................    $21,000\nPersonal exemptions.........................................

Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Texas 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am certainly going to support this \nbill and this vehicle. But I did hold it up for a few hours because I \nam concerned that we are not able to put marriage penalty relief in a \npermanent position on this bill. However, I have an agreement with the \nmajority leader that he will bring it up this year. Working with the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee, and hopefully with the ranking \nmember, we must fix the marriage penalty.\n  What we have today is a situation in which we relieve the marriage \npenalty for 2 years, then for 4 years it comes back, then 2 years later \nit goes away, and then it comes back for good. This is outrageous. Our \nmarried couples do not need a rubber band; they need a Band-Aid. They \nneed to be able to know that when they get married, it is not going to \ncost them $1,200 a year.\n  Two Navy lieutenants will lose more than $1,500 a year if the \nmarriage penalty goes away in 2 years; two Army warrant officers will \nlose $852 a year. This is not right. I have the commitment from \nleadership that we will take up a bill this year that fixes this \ninequity, and I hope there will be a bipartisan effort. We cannot let \npeople be unsure about their marriage penalty relief.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and ask \nhim if he will work with me to ensure that we take this up this year so \nwe can get on and fix the child tax credit. Next on the agenda I hope \nwill be marriage penalty relief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I was a party to the conversation with \nthe majority leader and the Senator from Texas. She has accurately \nstated what was discussed at that meeting. I will try my darnedest to \nfulfill it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate it very much. \nWe will have marriage penalty relief permanent this year. And we will \nhave child tax credit relief permanent, I hope, in the very near \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Maine 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Grassley for all of his \nefforts and endeavors to move quickly to address this omission in the \ngrowth package that passed the U.S. Congress recently. I appreciate the \nfact that he has worked hard to assist us in reaching an agreement on \nthis vital issue.\n  I also express my appreciation to the Senator from Montana, Mr. \nBaucus, in making the difference in bridging all of the efforts to \nreach this decision today in passing this legislation.\n  I especially thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, who has been a \nchampion in this fight, both in the Senate Finance Committee on this \nissue and also on the refundability issue back in the 2001 tax cut, in \nwhich we included a refundable provision for the child tax credit. She \ncertainly has been a strong ally and supporter, and I appreciate all of \nthe efforts she has been involved in to make sure this accelerated \nrefundability is a reality.\n  I am pleased to have worked with all of my colleagues on this issue. \nI know it was not easy. There are differences on both sides with \nrespect to some of these issues. But I think in the final analysis we \nare addressing an inequity that existed in the tax package that we \npassed in the Congress a few weeks ago. I think this agreement \nultimately closes the fairness gap in economic relief for working \nAmerican families. It ensures that 6.5 million families who were left \nout of the jobs and growth package enacted this year will now benefit \nfrom the child tax credit. And by acting so quickly, it will also \nensure that these families will share in the rebate checks that \nqualifying families will receive in August under the growth package as \nwell.\n  This means 12 million children in low-income families will have the \nbenefit of tax relief under the growth package. I think this is vitally \nimportant in redressing this wrong, in making sure we provide the kind \nof tax relief they deserve.\n  Now, I heard here that working families don't shoulder the burden in \nthe Federal Tax Code, but that isn't true. They do pay taxes. They pay \npayroll taxes. In fact, payroll taxes have become an inordinate burden \non working families.\n  The agreement ensures that 6.5 million low-income families who would \nhave been left out of the jobs and growth packages enacted this month \nwill now benefit from the child tax credit. And by acting quickly, it \nensures these families will also share in the rebate checks qualifying \nfamilies will receive in August under the growth package.\n  This agreement would not have been possible without the tenacious \nleadership of Senate Majority Leader Frist, and Minority Leader \nDaschle, who kept negotiations on track so the Senate could complete \nwork this week. So I deeply appreciate their efforts.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, who has been a tireless \nchampion in this fight. From the time I first offered the refundable \nchild tax credit to the 2001 tax bill, Sentor Lincoln has been a strong \nally and supporter, and we worked together again this year to include \nrefundability in the Finance Committee-passed growth package. Over the \npast week I have been proud to work with her once again to ensure \nfamilies omitted from the child credit would receive the refundable \ncredit they deserve.\n  I thank Finance Chairman Grassley, who quickly stepped forward last \nweek to address this omission from the jobs and growth package, and has \nworked so graciously with Senator Lincoln and me to achieve this \nagreement. He and Ranking Member Baucus have made the difference in \nbridging differences over this legislation, and we appreciate their \nsincere efforts.\n  Today we join to finish the job that Senator Lincoln and I started in \n2001. At the signing of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2001, which included the newly created partially \nrefundable child tax credit, I wholeheartedly agreed with the President \nwhen he remarked that:\n\n       Tax relief is a great achievement for the American people . \n     . . tax relief is an achievement for families struggling to \n     enter the middle class . . . (and) tax relief is \n     compassionate and it is now on the way.\n\n  Those are the same reasons we introduced a bill along with Senators \nJohn Warner, Jack Reed, Jim Jeffords, and others to ensure that we are \nas\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\ncompassionate today about our tax relief as we were then. This bill is \nresponsible because it is fully offset, and it makes sense because it \nbrings relief to working families while helping our economy.\n  The Lincoln-Snowe bill incorporated in this package makes the child \ntax credit refundable for families earing between $10,500 and $26,625, \nhelping 12 million children--6.5 million families--and almost 73,000 \nchildren in my home State of Maine from nearly 44,000 families, who \nwould not have received the full benefit under the original bill.\n  But that is not all--in addition to helping working families we are \nalso talking about military families, and this legislation will treat \nmembers of the military and their families more fairly as well. I know \nthat as chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner \nwas deeply concerned about omitting the one million children living in \nactive duty military and military veteran families. With this \nlegislation, those families--including 900 in Maine--will now benefit \nfrom refundability. The bottom line is, these men and women have \nsacrificed for us, they deserve the credit--the child tax credit.\n\n  Our legislation would accelerate the refundable portion of the child \ntax credit under law from 10 to 15 percent retroactive beginning \nJanuary 1 of this year. This would ensure the hardworking mothers and \nfathers of America, including members of the Armed Forces who earn less \nthan $26,000 per year, will be able to benefit from the increase in the \nchild tax credit that has just become law. It will also ensure the \nprovision of the 2001 law that directly benefits them will also be \naccelerated as the law enacted last week accelerates all of the other \nchild tax credit provisions.\n  I know some have said, this is tax relief for people who don't pay \ntaxes. To that argument, I would point out two factors. First, the \nFederal income tax--while a large share of the tax burden facing \nAmericans, are not the only taxes people pay. In fact, a larger tax \nburden on low-income workers is the payroll tax. The extent of this \nburden is exacerbated when one realizes that fully 33 percent of all \njobs in my home State, for example, do not pay a livable wage.\n  Secondly, while I believe that all families could use a helping hand \nwhen it comes to paying for the rising costs of raising a family, once \nagain, the children who would benefit from the enactment of this bill \nare children in working families--families that do pay taxes and, just \nlike everyone else in these trying economic times, these people are \nstruggling to get by.\n  Consider that, in order to be eligible for the partially refundable \ncredit, a parent needs to surpass an income threshold that is currently \nat $10,500 per year. That means that a parent needs to work more than \njust a full-time minimum wage job. However, this provision benefits \nmore than just minimum wage workers. This provision assists some of our \nyounger families. For instance, the base pay for a first-year soldier \nis $16,000 and it affects workers in our health care and social service \nsectors, where, for instance, in Maine paramedics in 2001 were only \nmaking an average of $22,000, or where our home health aides were \nmaking only an average of $18,500 per year. These people are a critical \npart of our infrastructure and they deserve tax relief too.\n  That is why I was disappointed the conferees chose to remove this \nprovision from the jobs and growth package--a provision which was \nincluded in the bill both as it passed the Finance Committee, and when \nit was passed by the Senate. Today, we have the opportunity to take a \nstep to correct this inequity.\n  This bill also addresses provisions included in Chairman Grassley's \nproposal addressing the definition of a child in the Tax Code, and in \naddressing a marriage penalty under the original bill. The ``uniform \ndefinition of a child'' consolidates five separate definitions of a \nchild in the Federal Tax Code, simplifying and clarifying the law. As a \nresult, more families will more easily qualify for the benefits they \nneed and deserve.\n  Finally, the agreement will provide relief for married couples with \nchildren by addressing a marriage penalty under the existing child \ncredit. Our agreement increases the threshold of the child tax credit \nfor couples with children to $150,000.\n  Importantly--and in keeping with the principles that have guided me \nthroughout the budget and tax process this year--our bill pays for this \ntax relief by extending customs user fees that will expire this year \nand would need to be extended anyway. And in doing so we are not \ngrowing our already ballooning national deficit. This is critical in \nensuring we do not add the debt burden on the very children that will \nbenefit from this bill.\n  Mr. President, Senate action today sends the message that relief for \nhardworking families won't take a back seat in America's tax code. It \nrepresents sound policy that Congress has already considered and \nadopted. It has the support of the White House, and I hope our \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives will take up and pass this \nagreement promptly so it can be signed into law.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the Lincoln-Snowe amendment to H.R. 1308 to reinstate the child tax \ncredit for low-income working Americans.\n  The House and the Senate went to conference on the reconciliation \nbill. For the public at large, when we talk about a reconciliation \nbill, it is kind of arcane. The House and the Senate confer to get a \nbill together, with each side presenting the views of its Members. I am \nnot sure I am making it more clear, but I want to make sure this is \nunderstood. When those conferees got together, they stripped out this \ntax credit for low-income working people. I thought that was a most \noutrageous act.\n  The Bush tax cut bill was already a handout to wealthy elites. It \nthrew token benefits to some others and virtually nothing to working \npeople. Taking out the tax credit for families earning between $10,500 \na year and $26,625 a year added outrage to an insult.\n  When the President was forced, as a result of the agreements in the \nCongress, to reduce the tax cut to $350 billion, he and the House \nRepublicans had to search for about $30 billion in ``fat'' to cut out \nof the bill to meet that target. Why didn't they slow down the \nreduction in the top rate? It is a pretty easy thing to do. What did \nthey do instead? They went after low-income working families.\n  These are people who are working at or just above minimum wage. These \nare Americans who are feeding their families by laboring in cafeterias, \ncleaning offices, working late at night, working in the factories \npacking food or making clothing, working in retail chains and small \nstores across the country--jobs that are traditionally at the low end \nof the pay scale. These people work hard and are a significant part of \nour labor force.\n  I know there are those in the administration who do not have any idea \nwhat it is like to work for low wages and try to raise a family on \nthem. I learned what it was like from my parents, who were brought here \nas child immigrants. They knew what it was like and I knew what it was \nlike because my parents were poor. They worked hard and tried to give \ntheir children an example of respect for hard work, and to hold out \nideals, even though there was little money.\n  The Lincoln-Snowe amendment is about restoring the American dream. It \nis about knowing that this country is a fair and honest place, where \nsomeone willing to work can still make a living. It is about knowing \nthat this Government and this Congress respect hard work and loyalty to \nfamilies. The Bush tax bill telegraphed a terrible shift in the message \nour Government is sending to the country. Despite the once revered view \nthat hard work pays off and breeds respect, President Bush and the \nHouse Republicans failed to support that contention to millions of \nhard-working Americans.\n  Why did they do it? Why did they drop a tax benefit that would have \nhelped almost 12 million children who have low-income working parents? \nWhy? The tax credit for hard-working minimum wage families was thrown \noverboard to make room for even more tax cuts for the highest income \nearners in our country. The cost of the tax credit to low-income \nfamilies was $3.5 billion--not an insignificant sum by any means. But \nwe could have found\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\nmore than that by nicking the reduction to the top income tax rate by \njust a little bit.\n  This is the rate the people at the top of the income scale will pay. \nWe are talking about people who make over $1 million a year. We are \ntalking about the top 1 percent of the country, households with average \nincomes over $350,000 or so. These are the people who are going to \nprofit most from the President's tax cut. We are going to reduce the \nrate, the income tax rate that they will have to pay.\n  If we only reduced that top rate to 35.3 percent instead of a flat 35 \npercent for the years 2003 through 2005, we would have saved $3.9 \nbillion, and the cost of the tax credit for low-income families is $3.5 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. But not in the context of a $350 \nbillion tax cut package; it is only 1 percent. There would have been \nmore than enough to save the child tax credit.\n  White House spokesmen repeatedly claimed that President Bush's tax \nbill would provide a tax cut for every American taxpayer. But that was \nnot true. The final bill left out 8 million working Americans and \nalmost 12 million children. The wealthy certainly got their tax cut. It \nwas approximately $90 billion in tax cuts over 10 years that will go to \n200,000 households nationwide with annual incomes of $1 million or \nmore. That is about $450,000 per household.\n  President Kennedy said, ``To govern is to choose.'' To give massive \ntax cuts to people who are already well off, and then tell hard-\nworking, low-income families, ``Sorry, there is nothing left for you,'' \nis awful. That is not a choice I want America to make.\n  Fortunately, after some gentle pressure from the media and outraged \nconstituents, the Republican majority has seen how egregious that plan \nwas and they now support the Lincoln-Snowe amendment. It is about time \nwe did something to help families who are struggling, and not just the \nfortunate few who are coasting. We have the opportunity to repair some \nof the harm caused by the President's unfair tax plan with this \namendment. I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \namendment offered today by Chairman Grassley, and to add my voice to \nthose of my colleagues who have risen today in support of it. I have \nlong been a supporter of the refundable child credit. I was a leading \nproponent of the increase in the child tax credit for low-income \nfamilies that was enacted as part of the 2001 tax bill, and I strongly \nsupported this provision when it was added to the Senate version of the \nTax Act passed last month.\n  The economic growth package the President signed into law last week \ngives tax relief to all working Americans, including low-income \nfamilies, many of whom will see a substantial reduction in their taxes. \nBut some low-income families could not receive the benefit of the \nincreased child tax credit that the package provides because the 10 \npercent earned-income threshold was not accelerated to 15 percent as \nthe Senate version of the package provided. This amendment restores the \nacceleration of that threshold as this Chamber originally provided.\n  More than 119,000 Mainers will benefit from the increase in the child \ntax credit that we approved as part of economic growth package. The \naction we take today expands the reach of this assistance to thousands \nmore hard-working Maine families. As a member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, I was keenly aware that nearly 200,000 enlisted men \nand women could claim this credit for their children if we expanded the \nguidelines. Doing so sends exactly the right message of appreciation as \nmany of them return home from fighting for the cause of freedom in \nIraq.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support Senator \nLincoln's legislation to make the recent increase in the child tax \ncredit available to more families. I thank the Senator from Arkansas \nfor her tenacious fight on behalf of America's working families. I was \ndisappointed that the tax cuts passed by this Congress last month left \nout eight million children whose parents are working everyday and \nstruggling to make ends meet. Today we will begin to correct that \ninjustice.\n  In West Virginia, there are about 57,000 children whose parents earn \nbetween $10,500 and $26,625. While these parents currently receive some \nbenefit from the child tax credit, they do not stand to get any \nadditional benefit based on last month's tax cut. For average families, \nwho don't make money from dividends or capital gains, the child tax \ncredit was the most valuable provision included in the recent tax cut \npackage. The families of 57,000 West Virginia children should not be \nleft out. Let's be clear that these families pay taxes. Payroll tax, \nsales tax, excise tax, property tax--these families are struggling to \nmake ends meet, and they are paying their fair share in tax.\n  It seems to me that families who are working hard but earning low \nwages are just the sort of families we ought to be seeking to help. \nThese parents play by the rules, but struggle to provide the same \nthings that all parents want to provide: enough food, a good home, \nschoolbooks, new shoes, perhaps a soccer uniform. In addition, we know \nthat providing additional tax relief to these families will stimulate \nthe economy, because these families are likely to immediately spend any \nadditional cash.\n  During the recent tax cut debate, the Senate was right to increase \nthe amount of the child tax credit that low-income working families \ncould receive. But during partisan negotiations to finalize that tax \nbill, these families were abandoned in order to provide more tax cuts \nto wealthy investors. One of the reasons that I opposed the recent tax \ncut package was that I could not condone a deal that provided $150 \nbillion in tax cuts to wealthy investors but dropped a provision to \nhelp our neediest working families that would cost just $3.5 billion. \nThere are a lot of pieces of that deal that I wish we would undo. I \nrealize that we won't. But at least today, by passing Senator Lincoln's \nlegislation, we will take one important step toward making those tax \ncuts more fair for America's working families.\n  The legislation before us today has a number of other important \nprovisions. It will ensure that two single parents would not lose their \nchild tax credit if they got married. The bill also simplifies the tax \ncode, something we should seek to do with every new tax law. I am \nespecially pleased that the bill includes a provision to offset the \ncost of these new tax cuts. I have serious concerns about the record \ndeficits we face, especially in light of the enormous tax cuts recently \nenacted. This bill will not add a penny to our national debt.\n  In short, this is a balanced, responsible, and fair piece of \nlegislation. While this bill does not do everything that I would like \nto do to improve the child tax credit and truly make it available to \nall low-income working families, it is still a major improvement on the \ntax cuts enacted last month. I hope that all of my colleagues will \nsupport this bill and send the message to hard working families that \nare struggling to make ends meet that we are on their side. And I ask \nall of my colleagues to encourage the House of Representatives to act \nquickly on this bill so that the President can sign it into law as soon \nas possible. Refund checks for the child tax credit increase are \nscheduled to be mailed this summer. If we act quickly we can ensure \nthat an additional 8 million families will receive checks.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Blanche \nLincoln, D-AR, and Senator Olympia Snowe, R-ME, in proposing important \nbipartisan legislation to accelerate the refundable portion of the \nchild tax credit to low-income families. As chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, I have a special obligation to look after the \nwelfare of the young men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, up to \n200,000 of whom could be eligible for and deserve this tax credit.\n  Over the past few weeks, we in Congress, have worked hard to pass the \neconomic stimulus package to promote long-term economic stability, and \nto stimulate investment and new job creation. While these provisions \nwill provide substantial relief to America's families, our work is not \nyet complete.\n  Included in the tax package were provisions to immediately increase \nthe Child Tax Credit from $600 to $1,000 an important tax reform that \nwe all support. However, the new law did not\n\n[[Page S7455]]\n\nmake the necessary technical changes in the refundability component \nwhich is necessary for certain low-income individuals to take advantage \nof the increase. I believe in providing fair and equitable tax relief \nto all Americans, especially to those raising children, our Nation's \nfuture.\n  Providing tax relief is an important bipartisan achievement. Now we \nmust build on this accomplishment by correcting this oversight and \nensure that these hard working families are not ineligible for this \nneeded benefit. The legislation I am cosponsoring will correct the \ninequity and provide low-income families, those who need it the most, \nthe full tax credit.\n  The bill accelerates the refundable part of the new $1,000 child tax \ncredit provision from 10 to 15 percent, so American families in the \n$10,500 to $26,625 income bracket, who were not included in the new tax \nlaw, would receive the same benefits as those families with children in \nother brackets.\n  The costs attributed to accelerating the child tax credit would be \noffset by closing corporate tax shelters. However, the important task \nbefore the Senate is to correct this oversight and provide these low-\nincome families with fairness and the ability to take advantage of the \nincrease in the child tax credit.\n  I am also cosponsoring related legislation introduced in the Senate \nby Finance Chairman Grassley to correct this issue and also to make the \nchild tax credit and the refundable portion of the tax credit permanent \nlaw.\n  It is my hope that we can pass either of these legislative proposals, \nor any other similar approach, to correct this inequity. We have a \nresponsibility to American families trying to care for their children, \nusing their resources as best they can, to provide fair and equal \ntreatment under the Tax Code.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 42 seconds credited to the \nSenator from Montana; 28 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the bill offered by my \ngood friend, the senior Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and my \ngood friend from Maine, Senator Snowe. Their legislation ensures that \nour military and low- and middle-income parents will receive a check \nfrom the child tax credit.\n  The legislation repairs the damage done by the majority in the tax \nbill conference. Senator Lincoln was successful in getting this \nprovision included in the $350 billion tax bill that passed the Finance \nCommittee and the Senate. But the provision was specifically stripped \nout before passage of the final version of the $350 billion tax bill.\n  Let me give you some examples of who does not benefit from the tax \nbill that was signed into law by President Bush last week.\n  First, a 24-year-old single mom with one child. She works hard every \nday to put food on the table, buy clothes for her daughter, and ensure \nadequate childcare for her daughter while she is at work.\n  She makes $15,000 a year. She pays $1,150 per year in payroll taxes. \nShe pays $1,150 in Federal taxes yet gets zero benefit from the \nrecently enacted tax bill. She will not see any check this summer.\n  Taxes are taxes. I would like to see someone tell her that her \npayroll taxes are less of a burden to her than an equal amount of \nincome taxes paid by Bill gates.\n  Senators Lincoln and Snowe fixed that problem. The fix means $225 in \nher pocket this summer.\n  She sees a big chunk of her paycheck every week getting paid to the \nGovernment. She also pays a lot of other taxes--including sales taxes, \nexcise taxes, and property taxes. She deserves equal treatment.\n  My second example illustrates the impact for military families. The \nDepartment of Defense has estimated that there are approximately \n192,000 military families who earn between $10,000 and $25,000. And \nmost of those 192,000 military families will not receive any tax relief \nfrom the $350 billion tax bill.\n  To make matters worse, the families of military personnel who are \nstationed in combat zones are really left out of the big tax cut.\n  In my second example, a Marine gunnery sergeant with 8 years service \nis stationed in Afghanistan for the last 6 months of 2002, and in Iraq \nfrom January through March of 2003. She has two children.\n  She receives an annual salary of $32,015 and hazardous duty pay of \n$150 per month. Because the income earned by our military while they \nare stationed in a combat zone is not included in taxable income, only \n$24,000 of her income is subject to tax. Under the bill that was passed \nlast week, the check she gets this summer will only be $150.\n  I am pleased that at least she will see something. But if the Lincoln \nchild tax credit had been preserved in the $350 billion tax bill, this \nMarine gunnery sergeant and her family would receive a check for $800 \nthis summer just like the President has promised to other middle-income \nfamilies. Unless we fix the problem, she will not see a dime of this.\n  The Lincoln/Snowe legislation ensures that we count a soldier's \ncombat zone compensation for purposes of the child tax credit, even \nthough that income is excluded for purposes of the income tax.\n  These examples illustrate just how unfair the tax bill was.\n  The big tax bill was not fair to working Americans or our military \npersonnel. Clearly, the benefits were skewed heavily to the elites of \nthis country.\n  One of the beauties of America is that we work to treat people \nequally. But the $350 billion tax bill did not come close to treating \nall Americans equally. Simply put, it was not fair.\n  Instead, the choice was made to lower the tax for dividend and \ncapital gain income, rather than extend the child tax credit to hard-\nworking, low-income taxpayers.\n  The bill that returned from conference--the one that was signed into \nlaw--also stripped out other provisions to provide tax relief to those \nserving our country in the armed services--those serving in Iraq, in \nAfghanistan, and all across the globe.\n  It is disturbing that we can pass this tax bill with all these \nbenefits for the elite of our country. But the conferees specifically \nstripped out a provision that would exempt $6,000 of death benefit \npayments from income for our military families.\n  And, they specifically stripped out the child tax credit provision \nthat put money into the hands of our military and lower and middle-\nincome families.\n  There is no way around it. The big tax bill was simply unfair.\n  Senators Lincoln and Snowe are giving us the chance to right one of \nthe wrongs--without increasing the deficit. Enactment of their \nlegislation ensures that 12 million children are helped.\n  Without their legislation, the families of 8 million children will \nsee absolutely no benefit from the increased child credit that was \nsigned into law last week. These families will not receive any check \nthis summer.\n  And, millions more families will see a check much smaller than the \n$400 promised.\n  In Montana, 54,000 kids--fully one-quarter of the children in \nMontana--will not benefit from the $350 billion tax bill. But the \nLincoln/Snowe legislation would get a check out--this summer--to the \nworking parents of thousands of Montana children.\n  Their legislation gets the child tax credit to millions of parents--\nwithout saddling their children with huge Government deficits--and \nwithout robbing the Social Security trust fund. They fix a $3.5 billion \nproblem, and pay for it.\n  Unfortunately, some in the Republican leadership considered using \nthis as an opportunity to spend another $130 billion in tax cuts. That \nwas their idea of a ``fix.''\n  Moreover, they did not intend to pay for these extra tax cuts. \nInstead they wanted our children and grandchildren and our Nation's \nseniors to shoulder more of the burden.\n  In the past couple of days, we have been able to reach an agreement \nto correct the wrong created with the passage of the recent tax bill. I \nstrongly support the Lincoln/Snowe child tax credit legislation. I urge \nmy colleagues to stand united to get this legislation enacted into law \nthis week. These families should not be asked to wait any longer.\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\n  They deserve to get their check this summer--just like all of the \nparents who were taken care of under the $350 billion tax bill.\n  This is the right thing to do. This is the fair thing to do. This is \nthe moral thing to do.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln. She has done \na terrific job highlighting this issue and the need for this child tax \ncredit provision.\n  Second, Senator Snowe, as I have mentioned several times, has been \ntremendous in championing this cause. And I might say, with regard to \nthe 2001 tax bill, she deserves the lion's share of the credit for the \nchild tax credit provisions that are in that bill.\n  The chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, has been, as usual, \njust his terrific self in working with the various Senators to try to \nfind an accommodation that makes sense.\n  I also thank Senator Warner who focused on the impact of this bill on \nmilitary families. In that respect, the bill will permit thousands of \nmilitary families, especially those serving in combat zones, to benefit \nfrom the child credit. Without this provision in this pending measure, \nthose military families would not get the benefit of the credit.\n  Finally--I know time is of the essence here--it is imperative that \nthe House act on this matter within 2 weeks so that the checks can get \nto the millions of families covered by this bill. Otherwise, two sets \nof checks would have to be sent out, and I think that would be the \nheight of inefficiency and a waste on the part of Uncle Sam. That would \nbe the consequence of the failure of the other body to act within 2 \nweeks. So I call on the House to act.\n  I see the Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee. I yield the rest of any time I have to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am not here to in any way suggest what went right, \nwhat went wrong. My understanding is there is a reconciliation of \nviewpoints now. We have before us the opportunity to provide for this \nchild tax credit for a category of individuals who, for reasons that I \nam certain the record explains, were preempted from the legislation.\n  Upon learning this, as others did--largely through press accounts--I \nimmediately called my distinguished chairman, Mr. Grassley; I called my \ndistinguished friend from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles; I called Mrs. \nLincoln and could not get a phone through to Montana, but I made an \neffort to try to reach you.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I beg your pardon.\n  Mr. WARNER. Rural electrification.\n  But anyway, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that the men and \nwomen of the Armed Forces--some 200,000-plus families--very much need \nthis benefit. They are the ones who have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan \nand who are all throughout the world taking risks, basically, the \nenlisted ranks.\n  I feel strongly that this great institution--the Senate--wants to be \non record that one of the reasons to go forward, hopefully, and adopt \nthe measure now pending before us is on behalf of the men and women of \nthe Armed Forces of the United States.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield back such time as I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa yield back his \nremaining time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining amount of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n862.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the clerk will report H.R. 1308.\n\tThe legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1308) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to end certain abusive tax practices, to provide tax \n     relief and simplification, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 862\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\tThe legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Grassley], for himself, Mrs. \n     Lincoln, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Murkowski, \n     Mr. Warner, Mr. Stevens, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 862.\n\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. I am pleased to join my distinguished ranking member, Senator Baucus, in the agreement we have reached on the child tax credit. I wish to take a minute to fill in my colleagues on how we are at this place at this time on another tax bill.\n\tIn the Finance Committee in the year 2001, Senator Snowe and Senator Lincoln added a refundable formula to enhance the child tax credit. This provision lasted through conference. The formula was increased to 15 percent in 2005. President Bush proposed to accelerate the $1,000 tax credit amount but did not accelerate the refundability formula.\n\tIn the Finance Committee, we accelerated the refundability formula. Unfortunately, that provision was dropped in conference. At that disappointing moment and at times since, I have indicated that I would like to revive that formula. I was joined by several Finance Committee members and both leaders in attempting to resolve this problem.\n\tI am pleased to say this agreement moves the ball on the marriage penalty and the child tax credit. The relief is small but a start in addressing yet another marriage penalty.\n\tI applaud Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison for her steadfast interest in resolving this other marriage penalty provision.\n\tFinally, our agreement is offset with an extension of customs fees, user fees. I urge the House to respond on our action today.\n\tI would like to get the bill to the President. This will ensure that low-income families get the checks we expect to get out in the next few months that are related to the tax bill that the President signed last week. Without this additional provision we are working on now, we would have families who get an increase in the child credit of $400 per child get a check this summer, but we would not get checks to people who are entitled to the usual refundability because it was not extended.\n\tI would like to do a lot more on the child tax credit. Families should be able to rely on permanent tax relief. That is what the bill I introduced did--not this compromise before the Senate. That is close to what the Senate growth bill did. That is what we should do in the upcoming process on this legislation.\n\tI hope we resolve the refundability formula. We address the marriage penalty and the child tax credit and we make progress on the longer term child tax credit. We simplify the definition of a child. This last measure is the principal recommended simplification of the Tax Code for individuals. This recommendation comes from the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department and is something that should have been done a long time ago.\n\tToday we make some major progress on simplifying the Tax Code. Of course, we need to do a lot more. This is what we do as we try to move forward on various pieces of legislation from the Finance Committee.\n\tIn this bill we are also going to help those serving in the Armed Forces overseas. Because some of their remuneration is not considered income, they would not benefit from the child tax refund the same way as other people who are not in a war zone. We ought to change that and do change it so everybody is treated fairly.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\tMr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, is it correct that the order provides for 30 minutes equally divided?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\tMr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arkansas. I might add, she is the prime mover of this bill. She is the one who made that happen. We are deeply indebted to her.\n\tMrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I give special thanks to my colleague from Montana. There are many people to thank today for moving forward in the right direction, recognizing the working families of this country. I thank Chairman Grassley, who worked tirelessly with us, as well as the ranking member, Senator Baucus; certainly the leadership on both sides, Senator Frist and Senator Daschle, who have both been willing to work with all of us to come together on this agreement.\n\tI would also like to say a very special thanks to my colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine, who has been a wonderful colleague and certainly someone who has worked equally as hard as I have on this issue. I am very pleased to have worked with her, both now as well as in the past.\n\tIf people can go back as far as 2001, they will remember in that 2001 tax bill Senator Snowe and I worked hard to bring about the refundability of the child tax credit, recognizing and understanding working Americans all across this country, trying to raise their families, were in need of the kind of assistance that refundable child tax credit would bring to them. I am very pleased and honored to have worked with her in the great work she has done in this effort.\n\tI am certainly pleased that we have reached this agreement to restore the advanced refundability for the child credit, for the hard work Senator Grassley has done in bringing about the uniform definition of a ``child'' in the Tax Code. To bring about those kinds of reforms are not easy steps. I think it is one of our first monumental moves in the right direction in which Senator Grassley will lead us in other reforms in the Tax Code.\n\tCertainly this agreement is the culmination of years of effort. I would like to recognize, however, and emphasize particularly the fact that we are helping working parents and working families. I know there are some critics out there who have referred to these provisions as welfare. I just find that description so disheartening, since we are talking about 200,000 military families, hundreds of firefighters, and teachers, and other hard-working Americans. I don't think of them, or view them, as welfare recipients. I don't think they think of themselves that way.\n\tThese are taxpayers. They are hard-working families who pay sales tax, both State and local. They have payroll taxes that come out of their checks. They pay excise tax, and in many of our rural States that is an awful lot when they travel for miles to get from their homes to their jobs.\n\tIt is so important for all of us to recognize that these taxes these individuals are paying are in equal proportion, many times, to many of the other people in different income and tax brackets, but these are taxes that never see cuts. Rarely do we see a cut in a sales tax or in the payroll tax, certainly, or in the State and local sales tax. In the excise taxes? We don't see cuts in these areas.\n\tTherefore, it is so important that we provide the kind of assistance we can for these working families, to make sure they are going to be able to help stimulate this economy and certainly to help strengthen our country.\n\n\tThe news reports that followed the passage of the tax bill noted that families do receive a check of $400 in July. But they did neglect to mention those 12 million children who would not get those checks. I am so pleased that today we are recognizing it is not only an important issue to deal with, providing these 12 million children the kind of resources they need in their families to grow strong, to learn the values we want them to learn, to become good citizens and leaders and workers in this great Nation, but we are also recognizing the fairness of this issue in a timely way.\n\tI encourage my colleagues in the House in that they have that same opportunity to recognize this is a timely issue. If we want these working families to have that same benefit, to be able to receive that tax credit, that child benefit credit in the same timely way that other individuals will receive that tax relief, then we have to do it immediately. We do have to move forward quickly.\n\tI encourage my colleagues in the House to really take to heart the immediacy of this issue and help us move it forward quickly. The passage of this provision today is the first step in ensuring those 12 million children will also get that $400 check, or whatever check they are entitled to--and it might be more--in July, at the same time others do. Time is definitely of the essence. I call on the Members of the other body to act quickly on this bill and ensure that all of our working families will benefit.\n\tThe uniform definition of the child, as I mentioned, through Chairman Grassley's efforts and certainly those of many others, Senator Hatch and Senator Baucus, is a great inclusion in this measure.\n\tIn short, this is a targeted tax provision to help working families. It is what I have argued since we began this round of tax discussions in January, and I hope we can continue in that vein.\n\tPeople ask, why is it so important? For me, that question is a very easy one to answer. Nearly half of the taxpayers in Arkansas have adjusted gross incomes of less than $20,000. Arkansas families were among some of the hardest hit when the refundable portion of the child credit was stripped from the bill. That is why it is important to me. It was important enough to bring up this issue and certainly to readdress something that did not happen in that original tax bill.\n\tMr. President, 76,000 Arkansas families, 132,000 Arkansas children, were left behind in that final tax bill when it was signed. If that is not reason enough for me to cause a ruckus or to be persistent, I don't know what is. I appreciate the accolades from my colleagues, but really what is more important--I think it is essential that we recognize, when we take actions such as the recent tax bill, there is a lot of importance in the details. We have to recognize that when we do not pay attention to the details, there are many individuals who get left behind, who are not going to receive those benefits. This is one of those cases.\n\tI say to my colleagues, this is not about trying to create more debt for these children who will also inherit that debt later on; this is about taking something we could have done and we didn't, taking something we could do better, acknowledging it, and moving forward with the actions that will create that better circumstance for working families.\n\n\tThat is why I have been working so hard these past few weeks--and for the last 3 years--recognizing what it means to the families in Arkansas.\n\tIt is also important for all of us in the Senate, and in the Congress, as we move forward on very important legislation, such as the tax bill that was just signed into law, to put ourselves in the shoes of these families. We talk about raising our families. We talk about raising our children. We talk about what it takes to create a family atmosphere that is focused on values, that is focused on good manners, is focused on compassion and being part of a community, reaching out to one another. It means, too, that each of us has to recognize all of our families are faced with different circumstances, whether it is military personnel stationed in Iraq and leaving a wife and two children at home; whether it is a schoolteacher or a firefighter; whether it is a police officer, many of whom fall into this category that was left out--these who make $10,500 to $26,625. That doesn't seem to be a category that would include that many, but it does. These are essential people in our communities, those who are protecting us from fire and from criminal activity, those who are teaching our children, those who are stationed abroad and protecting our very freedoms. So it is so critical we put ourselves in their shoes and better understand what it is they are doing for their families.\n\tI have to say I have a good opportunity because when I take care of my family, I try to stop and think: Are there other mothers out there doing the same thing I am? Is it any different for a mother who is in the Senate than it is for a mother who is making $20,000, when you go to the store and you have to spend that week's paycheck on blue jeans and tennis shoes, a set of tires to make your automobile safe to get your children to and from school or yourself to and from work? There is not a lot of difference, regardless of who you are. Giving these individuals the ability to take care of those family needs is critical.\n\tWe have not even talked about the aspect of how this can be a stimulative partner in what this overall tax bill was meant to do. It was meant to stimulate the economy. Why do we want to stimulate the economy anyway? We want to stimulate the economy because we want to strengthen our country, because we believe in this country and we believe in what makes up this country. There is no better place to look, in order to do that, than the American family.\n\tSo I praise my colleagues today for recognizing that there are a world of families out there we can help today--mothers and fathers, working hard, playing by the rules at their jobs. They are not eligible for these credits unless they are working, unless they are bringing home earnings, and unless they have children.\n\tThere is a whole group of individuals we could help here by giving them the opportunity to give something back to their country in strengthening this economy. Who else is going to be there to purchase the majority of items that will spur our economy and spur those companies that need to be driven?\n\tIn conclusion, I applaud all of my colleagues. This has been a unified effort among many people to try to do the right thing. I think, after all, that is what we are here in the Senate to do--the right thing on behalf of the working families of this great Nation.\n\tThank you, Mr. President.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Oklahoma 5 minutes.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\tMr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to vote against this amendment.\n\tI want to state a few things. I would like to correct the Record and state a few facts. I have heard some people say this provision was stripped out of a provision in the tax bill and it therefore left low-income people without any benefits from President Bush's tax cut. That is factually inaccurate. The fact is that in the year 2001 we passed a tax bill, and many of the people who complained mostly about this provision voted against the 2001 bill and the 2003 bill. Now they come back and say: You didn't do enough in this one category.\n\tWe did a lot for low-income people. We reduced the tax rate from 15 percent to 10 percent. And we did it retroactively, well after we passed the bill. We reduced that rate by a third--15 percent to 10 percent--and did it retroactively. We reduced every other rate on the books by 1 percentage point. I just mention that. We did a lot.\n\tWe increased the standard deduction by 20 percent. We increased the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000. It was $600. In the 2003 bill which the President just signed, we made it $1,000. That benefits families. It disproportionally benefits low-income people. We took millions of people off the tax rolls. They didn't have to pay taxes as a result of the fact that we reduced rates. And we passed tax credits. After we passed tax credits, millions of people who were taxpayers were no longer taxpayers.\n\n\tThen we get into the issue of refundability. We already have an unearned income tax credit, which is one of the most plagued, inaccurate programs we have in the Federal Government. It is about a $30 billion-a-year program. Its error rate is in the 20-some-odd percent range. About a fourth of it is in error. There is a lot of fraud. There are a lot of inaccuracies. People claim children they don't have so they can get a bigger refund. Maybe some of it was inaccurate and maybe some if it was on purpose.\n\tSome people say the Bush tax cut didn't benefit low-income families. That is factually incorrect. Let me give you an example. Before the Bush tax cut, if you had a low-income couple and both made minimum wage with a combined income of $21,000, they had personal exemptions--talking about, let us say, a family of four--$12,200; a standard deduction of $7,900; their taxable income is $850 at 15 percent tax; their income tax was $128; and for their earned income credit, we would write a check for $2,888. They received a net income tax refund of $2,761. Somebody said they pay payroll taxes. Yes, they could. That is a total of $1,607. So they received $1,154 after they paid income taxes and payroll taxes.\n\tThat was before President Bush's 2001 or 2003 tax bill passed. After the bills we just passed, they will receive a net refund in excess of income taxes and Social Security taxes of $2,332. That is a 102-percent increase. That is what the Government is writing them a check for. That is the amount left over after they paid income taxes and payroll taxes.\n\tThe question we are now really debating is, Do we want to have the Federal Government write bigger checks, and have bigger negative income taxes? Do we want to try to make the Income Tax Code more progressive? Usually when they say that, they mean lower income people pay a greater percentage.\n\tUnder present law, the upper 5 percent of the income tax bracket pay 50 percent of the tax; the lower 50 percent of the income tax bracket pay 5 percent of the tax. Yet some people say that is not progressive enough; that we need to have Uncle Sam write bigger checks to people even in multiples of their payroll taxes and income taxes combined--not equal to, not balancing out payroll taxes, but we want to write them in multiples.\n\tPart of this amendment says let us increase the refundability far in excess of payroll and income taxes. I don't support that theory. That was in fact in the 2001 bill. Part of the tax bill we agreed to said we would have a percentage. The child tax credit would be refundable--10 percent. And, oh yes, in the year 2005, we would make that 15 percent.\n\tThe amendment on which we are going to vote would accelerate that reduction to 15 percent immediately. That would probably happen. It could have happened. It actually passed the Finance Committee and passed the floor of the Senate. Had we had greater support for the bill, it could have been in the conference report.\n\tI hope before final passage, we can make the child credit permanent. I hope when the bill comes back from conference, we will make permanent a $1,000 tax credit for all individuals. Then we can make this change in addition.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the information titled ``Family of Four With Two Minimum Wage Workers'' be printed in the Record, along with the ``Child Credit/EIC Effect on Tax Burden'' information.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n              FAMILY OF FOUR WITH TWO MINIMUM WAGE WORKERS------------------------------------------------------------------------\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          PRE-2001 BUSH TAX CUT\n Wages.......................................................    $21,000Personal exemptions.........................................

Who yields time?\n\tMr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Texas 2 minutes.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\tMrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am certainly going to support this bill and this vehicle. But I did hold it up for a few hours because I am concerned that we are not able to put marriage penalty relief in a permanent position on this bill. However, I have an agreement with the majority leader that he will bring it up this year. Working with the distinguished chairman of the committee, and hopefully with the ranking member, we must fix the marriage penalty.\n\tWhat we have today is a situation in which we relieve the marriage penalty for 2 years, then for 4 years it comes back, then 2 years later it goes away, and then it comes back for good. This is outrageous. Our married couples do not need a rubber band; they need a Band-Aid. They need to be able to know that when they get married, it is not going to cost them $1,200 a year.\n\tTwo Navy lieutenants will lose more than $1,500 a year if the marriage penalty goes away in 2 years; two Army warrant officers will lose $852 a year. This is not right. I have the commitment from leadership that we will take up a bill this year that fixes this inequity, and I hope there will be a bipartisan effort. We cannot let people be unsure about their marriage penalty relief.\n\tI thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and ask him if he will work with me to ensure that we take this up this year so we can get on and fix the child tax credit. Next on the agenda I hope will be marriage penalty relief.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I was a party to the conversation with the majority leader and the Senator from Texas. She has accurately stated what was discussed at that meeting. I will try my darnedest to fulfill it.\n\tMrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate it very much. We will have marriage penalty relief permanent this year. And we will have child tax credit relief permanent, I hope, in the very near future.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Maine 2 minutes.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\tMs. SNOWE. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Grassley for all of his efforts and endeavors to move quickly to address this omission in the growth package that passed the U.S. Congress recently. I appreciate the fact that he has worked hard to assist us in reaching an agreement on this vital issue.\n\tI also express my appreciation to the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, in making the difference in bridging all of the efforts to reach this decision today in passing this legislation.\n\tI especially thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, who has been a champion in this fight, both in the Senate Finance Committee on this issue and also on the refundability issue back in the 2001 tax cut, in which we included a refundable provision for the child tax credit. She certainly has been a strong ally and supporter, and I appreciate all of the efforts she has been involved in to make sure this accelerated refundability is a reality.\n\tI am pleased to have worked with all of my colleagues on this issue. I know it was not easy. There are differences on both sides with respect to some of these issues. But I think in the final analysis we are addressing an inequity that existed in the tax package that we passed in the Congress a few weeks ago. I think this agreement ultimately closes the fairness gap in economic relief for working American families. It ensures that 6.5 million families who were left out of the jobs and growth package enacted this year will now benefit from the child tax credit. And by acting so quickly, it will also ensure that these families will share in the rebate checks that qualifying families will receive in August under the growth package as well.\n\tThis means 12 million children in low-income families will have the benefit of tax relief under the growth package. I think this is vitally important in redressing this wrong, in making sure we provide the kind of tax relief they deserve.\n\tNow, I heard here that working families don't shoulder the burden in the Federal Tax Code, but that isn't true. They do pay taxes. They pay payroll taxes. In fact, payroll taxes have become an inordinate burden on working families.\n\tThe agreement ensures that 6.5 million low-income families who would have been left out of the jobs and growth packages enacted this month will now benefit from the child tax credit. And by acting quickly, it ensures these families will also share in the rebate checks qualifying families will receive in August under the growth package.\n\tThis agreement would not have been possible without the tenacious leadership of Senate Majority Leader Frist, and Minority Leader Daschle, who kept negotiations on track so the Senate could complete work this week. So I deeply appreciate their efforts.\n\tI thank my colleague, Senator Lincoln, who has been a tireless champion in this fight. From the time I first offered the refundable child tax credit to the 2001 tax bill, Sentor Lincoln has been a strong ally and supporter, and we worked together again this year to include refundability in the Finance Committee-passed growth package. Over the past week I have been proud to work with her once again to ensure families omitted from the child credit would receive the refundable credit they deserve.\n\tI thank Finance Chairman Grassley, who quickly stepped forward last week to address this omission from the jobs and growth package, and has worked so graciously with Senator Lincoln and me to achieve this agreement. He and Ranking Member Baucus have made the difference in bridging differences over this legislation, and we appreciate their sincere efforts.\n\tToday we join to finish the job that Senator Lincoln and I started in 2001. At the signing of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which included the newly created partially refundable child tax credit, I wholeheartedly agreed with the President when he remarked that:\n\n       Tax relief is a great achievement for the American people . \n     . . tax relief is an achievement for families struggling to \n     enter the middle class . . . (and) tax relief is \n     compassionate and it is now on the way.\n\n\tThose are the same reasons we introduced a bill along with Senators John Warner, Jack Reed, Jim Jeffords, and others to ensure that we are as compassionate today about our tax relief as we were then. This bill is responsible because it is fully offset, and it makes sense because it brings relief to working families while helping our economy.\n\tThe Lincoln-Snowe bill incorporated in this package makes the child tax credit refundable for families earing between $10,500 and $26,625, helping 12 million children--6.5 million families--and almost 73,000 children in my home State of Maine from nearly 44,000 families, who would not have received the full benefit under the original bill.\n\tBut that is not all--in addition to helping working families we are also talking about military families, and this legislation will treat members of the military and their families more fairly as well. I know that as chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner was deeply concerned about omitting the one million children living in active duty military and military veteran families. With this legislation, those families--including 900 in Maine--will now benefit from refundability. The bottom line is, these men and women have sacrificed for us, they deserve the credit--the child tax credit.\n\n\tOur legislation would accelerate the refundable portion of the child tax credit under law from 10 to 15 percent retroactive beginning January 1 of this year. This would ensure the hardworking mothers and fathers of America, including members of the Armed Forces who earn less than $26,000 per year, will be able to benefit from the increase in the child tax credit that has just become law. It will also ensure the provision of the 2001 law that directly benefits them will also be accelerated as the law enacted last week accelerates all of the other child tax credit provisions.\n\tI know some have said, this is tax relief for people who don't pay taxes. To that argument, I would point out two factors. First, the Federal income tax--while a large share of the tax burden facing Americans, are not the only taxes people pay. In fact, a larger tax burden on low-income workers is the payroll tax. The extent of this burden is exacerbated when one realizes that fully 33 percent of all jobs in my home State, for example, do not pay a livable wage.\n\tSecondly, while I believe that all families could use a helping hand when it comes to paying for the rising costs of raising a family, once again, the children who would benefit from the enactment of this bill are children in working families--families that do pay taxes and, just like everyone else in these trying economic times, these people are struggling to get by.\n\tConsider that, in order to be eligible for the partially refundable credit, a parent needs to surpass an income threshold that is currently at $10,500 per year. That means that a parent needs to work more than just a full-time minimum wage job. However, this provision benefits more than just minimum wage workers. This provision assists some of our younger families. For instance, the base pay for a first-year soldier is $16,000 and it affects workers in our health care and social service sectors, where, for instance, in Maine paramedics in 2001 were only making an average of $22,000, or where our home health aides were making only an average of $18,500 per year. These people are a critical part of our infrastructure and they deserve tax relief too.\n\tThat is why I was disappointed the conferees chose to remove this provision from the jobs and growth package--a provision which was included in the bill both as it passed the Finance Committee, and when it was passed by the Senate. Today, we have the opportunity to take a step to correct this inequity.\n\tThis bill also addresses provisions included in Chairman Grassley's proposal addressing the definition of a child in the Tax Code, and in addressing a marriage penalty under the original bill. The ``uniform definition of a child'' consolidates five separate definitions of a child in the Federal Tax Code, simplifying and clarifying the law. As a result, more families will more easily qualify for the benefits they need and deserve.\n\tFinally, the agreement will provide relief for married couples with children by addressing a marriage penalty under the existing child credit. Our agreement increases the threshold of the child tax credit for couples with children to $150,000.\n\tImportantly--and in keeping with the principles that have guided me throughout the budget and tax process this year--our bill pays for this tax relief by extending customs user fees that will expire this year and would need to be extended anyway. And in doing so we are not growing our already ballooning national deficit. This is critical in ensuring we do not add the debt burden on the very children that will benefit from this bill.\n\tMr. President, Senate action today sends the message that relief for hardworking families won't take a back seat in America's tax code. It represents sound policy that Congress has already considered and adopted. It has the support of the White House, and I hope our colleagues in the House of Representatives will take up and pass this agreement promptly so it can be signed into law.\n\tMr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the Lincoln-Snowe amendment to H.R. 1308 to reinstate the child tax credit for low-income working Americans.\n\tThe House and the Senate went to conference on the reconciliation bill. For the public at large, when we talk about a reconciliation bill, it is kind of arcane. The House and the Senate confer to get a bill together, with each side presenting the views of its Members. I am not sure I am making it more clear, but I want to make sure this is understood. When those conferees got together, they stripped out this tax credit for low-income working people. I thought that was a most outrageous act.\n\tThe Bush tax cut bill was already a handout to wealthy elites. It threw token benefits to some others and virtually nothing to working people. Taking out the tax credit for families earning between $10,500 a year and $26,625 a year added outrage to an insult.\n\tWhen the President was forced, as a result of the agreements in the Congress, to reduce the tax cut to $350 billion, he and the House Republicans had to search for about $30 billion in ``fat'' to cut out of the bill to meet that target. Why didn't they slow down the reduction in the top rate? It is a pretty easy thing to do. What did they do instead? They went after low-income working families.\n\tThese are people who are working at or just above minimum wage. These are Americans who are feeding their families by laboring in cafeterias, cleaning offices, working late at night, working in the factories packing food or making clothing, working in retail chains and small stores across the country--jobs that are traditionally at the low end of the pay scale. These people work hard and are a significant part of our labor force.\n\tI know there are those in the administration who do not have any idea what it is like to work for low wages and try to raise a family on them. I learned what it was like from my parents, who were brought here as child immigrants. They knew what it was like and I knew what it was like because my parents were poor. They worked hard and tried to give their children an example of respect for hard work, and to hold out ideals, even though there was little money.\n\tThe Lincoln-Snowe amendment is about restoring the American dream. It is about knowing that this country is a fair and honest place, where someone willing to work can still make a living. It is about knowing that this Government and this Congress respect hard work and loyalty to families. The Bush tax bill telegraphed a terrible shift in the message our Government is sending to the country. Despite the once revered view that hard work pays off and breeds respect, President Bush and the House Republicans failed to support that contention to millions of hard-working Americans.\n\tWhy did they do it? Why did they drop a tax benefit that would have helped almost 12 million children who have low-income working parents? Why? The tax credit for hard-working minimum wage families was thrown overboard to make room for even more tax cuts for the highest income earners in our country. The cost of the tax credit to low-income families was $3.5 billion--not an insignificant sum by any means. But we could have found more than that by nicking the reduction to the top income tax rate by just a little bit.\n\tThis is the rate the people at the top of the income scale will pay. We are talking about people who make over $1 million a year. We are talking about the top 1 percent of the country, households with average incomes over $350,000 or so. These are the people who are going to profit most from the President's tax cut. We are going to reduce the rate, the income tax rate that they will have to pay.\n\tIf we only reduced that top rate to 35.3 percent instead of a flat 35 percent for the years 2003 through 2005, we would have saved $3.9 billion, and the cost of the tax credit for low-income families is $3.5 billion. That is a lot of money. But not in the context of a $350 billion tax cut package; it is only 1 percent. There would have been more than enough to save the child tax credit.\n\tWhite House spokesmen repeatedly claimed that President Bush's tax bill would provide a tax cut for every American taxpayer. But that was not true. The final bill left out 8 million working Americans and almost 12 million children. The wealthy certainly got their tax cut. It was approximately $90 billion in tax cuts over 10 years that will go to 200,000 households nationwide with annual incomes of $1 million or more. That is about $450,000 per household.\n\tPresident Kennedy said, ``To govern is to choose.'' To give massive tax cuts to people who are already well off, and then tell hard-working, low-income families, ``Sorry, there is nothing left for you,'' is awful. That is not a choice I want America to make.\n\tFortunately, after some gentle pressure from the media and outraged constituents, the Republican majority has seen how egregious that plan was and they now support the Lincoln-Snowe amendment. It is about time we did something to help families who are struggling, and not just the fortunate few who are coasting. We have the opportunity to repair some of the harm caused by the President's unfair tax plan with this amendment. I urge its adoption.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tMs. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this amendment offered today by Chairman Grassley, and to add my voice to those of my colleagues who have risen today in support of it. I have long been a supporter of the refundable child credit. I was a leading proponent of the increase in the child tax credit for low-income families that was enacted as part of the 2001 tax bill, and I strongly supported this provision when it was added to the Senate version of the Tax Act passed last month.\n\tThe economic growth package the President signed into law last week gives tax relief to all working Americans, including low-income families, many of whom will see a substantial reduction in their taxes. But some low-income families could not receive the benefit of the increased child tax credit that the package provides because the 10 percent earned-income threshold was not accelerated to 15 percent as the Senate version of the package provided. This amendment restores the acceleration of that threshold as this Chamber originally provided.\n\tMore than 119,000 Mainers will benefit from the increase in the child tax credit that we approved as part of economic growth package. The action we take today expands the reach of this assistance to thousands more hard-working Maine families. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was keenly aware that nearly 200,000 enlisted men and women could claim this credit for their children if we expanded the guidelines. Doing so sends exactly the right message of appreciation as many of them return home from fighting for the cause of freedom in Iraq.\n\tMr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support Senator Lincoln's legislation to make the recent increase in the child tax credit available to more families. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for her tenacious fight on behalf of America's working families. I was disappointed that the tax cuts passed by this Congress last month left out eight million children whose parents are working everyday and struggling to make ends meet. Today we will begin to correct that injustice.\n\tIn West Virginia, there are about 57,000 children whose parents earn between $10,500 and $26,625. While these parents currently receive some benefit from the child tax credit, they do not stand to get any additional benefit based on last month's tax cut. For average families, who don't make money from dividends or capital gains, the child tax credit was the most valuable provision included in the recent tax cut package. The families of 57,000 West Virginia children should not be left out. Let's be clear that these families pay taxes. Payroll tax, sales tax, excise tax, property tax--these families are struggling to make ends meet, and they are paying their fair share in tax.\n\tIt seems to me that families who are working hard but earning low wages are just the sort of families we ought to be seeking to help. These parents play by the rules, but struggle to provide the same things that all parents want to provide: enough food, a good home, schoolbooks, new shoes, perhaps a soccer uniform. In addition, we know that providing additional tax relief to these families will stimulate the economy, because these families are likely to immediately spend any additional cash.\n\tDuring the recent tax cut debate, the Senate was right to increase the amount of the child tax credit that low-income working families could receive. But during partisan negotiations to finalize that tax bill, these families were abandoned in order to provide more tax cuts to wealthy investors. One of the reasons that I opposed the recent tax cut package was that I could not condone a deal that provided $150 billion in tax cuts to wealthy investors but dropped a provision to help our neediest working families that would cost just $3.5 billion. There are a lot of pieces of that deal that I wish we would undo. I realize that we won't. But at least today, by passing Senator Lincoln's legislation, we will take one important step toward making those tax cuts more fair for America's working families.\n\tThe legislation before us today has a number of other important provisions. It will ensure that two single parents would not lose their child tax credit if they got married. The bill also simplifies the tax code, something we should seek to do with every new tax law. I am especially pleased that the bill includes a provision to offset the cost of these new tax cuts. I have serious concerns about the record deficits we face, especially in light of the enormous tax cuts recently enacted. This bill will not add a penny to our national debt.\n\tIn short, this is a balanced, responsible, and fair piece of legislation. While this bill does not do everything that I would like to do to improve the child tax credit and truly make it available to all low-income working families, it is still a major improvement on the tax cuts enacted last month. I hope that all of my colleagues will support this bill and send the message to hard working families that are struggling to make ends meet that we are on their side. And I ask all of my colleagues to encourage the House of Representatives to act quickly on this bill so that the President can sign it into law as soon as possible. Refund checks for the child tax credit increase are scheduled to be mailed this summer. If we act quickly we can ensure that an additional 8 million families will receive checks.\n\tMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Blanche Lincoln, D-AR, and Senator Olympia Snowe, R-ME, in proposing important bipartisan legislation to accelerate the refundable portion of the child tax credit to low-income families. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have a special obligation to look after the welfare of the young men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, up to 200,000 of whom could be eligible for and deserve this tax credit.\n\tOver the past few weeks, we in Congress, have worked hard to pass the economic stimulus package to promote long-term economic stability, and to stimulate investment and new job creation. While these provisions will provide substantial relief to America's families, our work is not yet complete.\n\tIncluded in the tax package were provisions to immediately increase the Child Tax Credit from $600 to $1,000 an important tax reform that we all support. However, the new law did not make the necessary technical changes in the refundability component which is necessary for certain low-income individuals to take advantage of the increase. I believe in providing fair and equitable tax relief to all Americans, especially to those raising children, our Nation's future.\n\tProviding tax relief is an important bipartisan achievement. Now we must build on this accomplishment by correcting this oversight and ensure that these hard working families are not ineligible for this needed benefit. The legislation I am cosponsoring will correct the inequity and provide low-income families, those who need it the most, the full tax credit.\n\tThe bill accelerates the refundable part of the new $1,000 child tax credit provision from 10 to 15 percent, so American families in the $10,500 to $26,625 income bracket, who were not included in the new tax law, would receive the same benefits as those families with children in other brackets.\n\tThe costs attributed to accelerating the child tax credit would be offset by closing corporate tax shelters. However, the important task before the Senate is to correct this oversight and provide these low-income families with fairness and the ability to take advantage of the increase in the child tax credit.\n\tI am also cosponsoring related legislation introduced in the Senate by Finance Chairman Grassley to correct this issue and also to make the child tax credit and the refundable portion of the tax credit permanent law.\n\tIt is my hope that we can pass either of these legislative proposals, or any other similar approach, to correct this inequity. We have a responsibility to American families trying to care for their children, using their resources as best they can, to provide fair and equal treatment under the Tax Code.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\tThe Senator from Montana.\n\tMr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes 42 seconds credited to the Senator from Montana; 28 seconds to the Senator from Iowa.\n\tMr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the bill offered by my good friend, the senior Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and my good friend from Maine, Senator Snowe. Their legislation ensures that our military and low- and middle-income parents will receive a check from the child tax credit.\n\tThe legislation repairs the damage done by the majority in the tax bill conference. Senator Lincoln was successful in getting this provision included in the $350 billion tax bill that passed the Finance Committee and the Senate. But the provision was specifically stripped out before passage of the final version of the $350 billion tax bill.\n\tLet me give you some examples of who does not benefit from the tax bill that was signed into law by President Bush last week.\n\tFirst, a 24-year-old single mom with one child. She works hard every day to put food on the table, buy clothes for her daughter, and ensure adequate childcare for her daughter while she is at work.\n\tShe makes $15,000 a year. She pays $1,150 per year in payroll taxes. She pays $1,150 in Federal taxes yet gets zero benefit from the recently enacted tax bill. She will not see any check this summer.\n\tTaxes are taxes. I would like to see someone tell her that her payroll taxes are less of a burden to her than an equal amount of income taxes paid by Bill gates.\n\tSenators Lincoln and Snowe fixed that problem. The fix means $225 in her pocket this summer.\n\tShe sees a big chunk of her paycheck every week getting paid to the Government. She also pays a lot of other taxes--including sales taxes, excise taxes, and property taxes. She deserves equal treatment.\n\tMy second example illustrates the impact for military families. The Department of Defense has estimated that there are approximately 192,000 military families who earn between $10,000 and $25,000. And most of those 192,000 military families will not receive any tax relief from the $350 billion tax bill.\n\tTo make matters worse, the families of military personnel who are stationed in combat zones are really left out of the big tax cut.\n\tIn my second example, a Marine gunnery sergeant with 8 years service is stationed in Afghanistan for the last 6 months of 2002, and in Iraq from January through March of 2003. She has two children.\n\tShe receives an annual salary of $32,015 and hazardous duty pay of $150 per month. Because the income earned by our military while they are stationed in a combat zone is not included in taxable income, only $24,000 of her income is subject to tax. Under the bill that was passed last week, the check she gets this summer will only be $150.\n\tI am pleased that at least she will see something. But if the Lincoln child tax credit had been preserved in the $350 billion tax bill, this Marine gunnery sergeant and her family would receive a check for $800 this summer just like the President has promised to other middle-income families. Unless we fix the problem, she will not see a dime of this.\n\tThe Lincoln/Snowe legislation ensures that we count a soldier's combat zone compensation for purposes of the child tax credit, even though that income is excluded for purposes of the income tax.\n\tThese examples illustrate just how unfair the tax bill was.\n\tThe big tax bill was not fair to working Americans or our military personnel. Clearly, the benefits were skewed heavily to the elites of this country.\n\tOne of the beauties of America is that we work to treat people equally. But the $350 billion tax bill did not come close to treating all Americans equally. Simply put, it was not fair.\n\tInstead, the choice was made to lower the tax for dividend and capital gain income, rather than extend the child tax credit to hard-working, low-income taxpayers.\n\tThe bill that returned from conference--the one that was signed into law--also stripped out other provisions to provide tax relief to those serving our country in the armed services--those serving in Iraq, in Afghanistan, and all across the globe.\n\tIt is disturbing that we can pass this tax bill with all these benefits for the elite of our country. But the conferees specifically stripped out a provision that would exempt $6,000 of death benefit payments from income for our military families.\n\tAnd, they specifically stripped out the child tax credit provision that put money into the hands of our military and lower and middle-income families.\n\tThere is no way around it. The big tax bill was simply unfair.\n\tSenators Lincoln and Snowe are giving us the chance to right one of the wrongs--without increasing the deficit. Enactment of their legislation ensures that 12 million children are helped.\n\tWithout their legislation, the families of 8 million children will see absolutely no benefit from the increased child credit that was signed into law last week. These families will not receive any check this summer.\n\tAnd, millions more families will see a check much smaller than the $400 promised.\n\tIn Montana, 54,000 kids--fully one-quarter of the children in Montana--will not benefit from the $350 billion tax bill. But the Lincoln/Snowe legislation would get a check out--this summer--to the working parents of thousands of Montana children.\n\tTheir legislation gets the child tax credit to millions of parents--without saddling their children with huge Government deficits--and without robbing the Social Security trust fund. They fix a $3.5 billion problem, and pay for it.\n\tUnfortunately, some in the Republican leadership considered using this as an opportunity to spend another $130 billion in tax cuts. That was their idea of a ``fix.''\n\tMoreover, they did not intend to pay for these extra tax cuts. Instead they wanted our children and grandchildren and our Nation's seniors to shoulder more of the burden.\n\tIn the past couple of days, we have been able to reach an agreement to correct the wrong created with the passage of the recent tax bill. I strongly support the Lincoln/Snowe child tax credit legislation. I urge my colleagues to stand united to get this legislation enacted into law this week. These families should not be asked to wait any longer. \n\tThey deserve to get their check this summer--just like all of the parents who were taken care of under the $350 billion tax bill.\n\tThis is the right thing to do. This is the fair thing to do. This is the moral thing to do.\n\tAgain, I thank the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln. She has done a terrific job highlighting this issue and the need for this child tax credit provision.\n\tSecond, Senator Snowe, as I have mentioned several times, has been tremendous in championing this cause. And I might say, with regard to the 2001 tax bill, she deserves the lion's share of the credit for the child tax credit provisions that are in that bill.\n\tThe chairman of the committee, Senator Grassley, has been, as usual, just his terrific self in working with the various Senators to try to find an accommodation that makes sense.\n\tI also thank Senator Warner who focused on the impact of this bill on military families. In that respect, the bill will permit thousands of military families, especially those serving in combat zones, to benefit from the child credit. Without this provision in this pending measure, those military families would not get the benefit of the credit.\n\tFinally--I know time is of the essence here--it is imperative that the House act on this matter within 2 weeks so that the checks can get to the millions of families covered by this bill. Otherwise, two sets of checks would have to be sent out, and I think that would be the height of inefficiency and a waste on the part of Uncle Sam. That would be the consequence of the failure of the other body to act within 2 weeks. So I call on the House to act.\n\tI see the Senator from Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I yield the rest of any time I have to him.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\tMr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n\tMr. President, I am not here to in any way suggest what went right, what went wrong. My understanding is there is a reconciliation of viewpoints now. We have before us the opportunity to provide for this child tax credit for a category of individuals who, for reasons that I am certain the record explains, were preempted from the legislation.\n\tUpon learning this, as others did--largely through press accounts--I immediately called my distinguished chairman, Mr. Grassley; I called my distinguished friend from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles; I called Mrs. Lincoln and could not get a phone through to Montana, but I made an effort to try to reach you.\n\tMr. BAUCUS. I beg your pardon.\n\tMr. WARNER. Rural electrification.\n\tBut anyway, Mr. President, I feel very strongly that the men and women of the Armed Forces--some 200,000-plus families--very much need this benefit. They are the ones who have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan and who are all throughout the world taking risks, basically, the enlisted ranks.\n\tI feel strongly that this great institution--the Senate--wants to be on record that one of the reasons to go forward, hopefully, and adopt the measure now pending before us is on behalf of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n\tI thank the Chair and I yield back such time as I might have.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\tMr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa yield back his remaining time?\n\tThe Senator from Iowa.\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield back the remaining amount of my time.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 862.\n\tMr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\tThere appears to be a sufficient second.\n\tThe clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe legislative clerk called the roll.\n\tMr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 864\n\n(Purpose: To replace ``tribal consortia'' with ``tribal energy resource \n          development organizations,'' and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 864.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, it is an indisputable fact that Indian \ncountry contains some of the richest energy resources in the America.\n  Indian lands comprise approximately 5 percent of the land area of the \nUnited States, but contains an estimated 10 percent of all energy \nreserves in the United States, including: 30 percent of known coal \ndeposits located in the western portion of the United States; 5 percent \nof known onshore oil deposits of the United States; and 10 percent of \nknown onshore natural gas deposits of the United States.\n  Coal, oil, natural gas, and other energy minerals produced from \nIndian land represent more than 10 percent of total nationwide onshore \nproduction of energy minerals.\n  Even though in one year alone over 9.3 million barrels of oil, 299 \nbillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 21 million tons of coal were \nproduced from Indian land, representing $700 million in Indian energy \nrevenue, the Department of the Interior estimates that only 25 percent \nof the oil and less than 20 percent of all natural gas reserves on \nIndian land have been fully developed.\n  It is ironic that many Indian people were forced on to the most arid, \nbarren, and least productive lands in the 1800s and now they find \nthemselves resource rich.\n  Despite what we may read in the Washington Post or the New York Times \nabout the so-called rich Indians and Indian gambling, it is also \nindisputable that Indians are the most economically deprived ethnic \ngroup in the United States. Unemployment levels are far above the \nnational average, in some cases as high as 70 percent. Per capita \nincomes are well below the national average. They have substandard \nhousing, poor health, alcohol and drug abuse, diabetes, amputations, \nand a general malaise and hopelessness, even suicide among Indian \nyoungsters.\n  In fact, in some reservations it is not uncommon to find one out of \nevery two teenage girls and one out of every three boys who attempt \nsuicide driven by despair and a dead end future. In that context, this \namendment I am offering today tries to give them some help.\n  Given the extent of the economic deprivation in Indian country and \nthe vast potential wealth residing in energy resources which could \nameliorate this deprivation, it has long been a puzzle why these \nresources have not been more fully developed.\n  The answer lies partly in the fact that energy resource development \nis by its very nature capital intensive. Most tribes do not have the \nfinancial resources to fund extensive energy projects on their own and \nso must partner with private industry, or other outside entities, by \nleasing out their energy resources for development in return for \nroyalty payments.\n  The unique legal and political relationship between the United States \nand Indian tribes sometimes makes this leasing process cumbersome.\n  As with most Indian law and policy, history plays an important part. \nTowards the end of the 19th Century, Indian tribes were forcibly \nremoved to isolated areas and reservations where it was believed they \nwould not hinder the westward expansion of a new and growing country.\n  The natural resources contained on these lands were taken into trust \nby the Federal Government to be administered for the benefit of Indian \ntribes. The ostensible reason for the trust was the belief that Indians \nwere incapable and incompetent of administering such resources, and \nwould be susceptible to land and resource predators.\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\n  By the way, that belief was prevalent with a lot of people in \nAmerican Government and led the Surgeon General at the time to issue a \nrequest to the U.S. Army that Indian skulls be sent to DC to study and \nfind out if Indians had the intelligence to own their own land. That, \nin turn, gave rise to the saying among modern Indian people that there \nare more dead Indians in Washington, DC, than live ones, because until \nthe last couple of years there were over 16,000 remains, primarily \nskulls and upper body bones, warehoused in the Smithsonian. Just a few \nyears ago, we passed a Museum of the American Indian bill, and one \nprovision of that required that the Smithsonian and other Federal \nagencies start returning those bones.\n  A legal and bureaucratic apparatus was formed to administer this \ntrust, and over a century later this apparatus remains in place in the \nInterior Department.\n  In her capacity as trustee of Indian resources, the Secretary of the \nInterior is required to examine all leases of Indian trust resources, \nto ensure that the terms of the lease benefit the tribe, and to ensure \nthat the trust asset is not wasted.\n  The Committee on Indian Affairs has been informed over the year that \nthe Secretarial approval process is often so lengthy that outside \nparties, who otherwise would like to partner with Indian tribes to \ndevelop their energy resources, are reluctant to become entangled in \nthe bureaucratic red tape that inevitably accompanies the leasing of \nTribal resources.\n  Hence, the framework that was originally designed to protect tribes \nhas become an obstacle to development of Tribal resources, in that the \nbureaucratic impediments of trust administration are now a disincentive \nto outside investors.\n  To help remedy these problems, earlier this year I, along with \nSenator Domenici, introduced the Indian Tribal Energy Development and \nSelf Determination Act of 2003 to provide assistance and encouragement \nto Indian tribes to develop their energy resources.\n  This was based really on last year's amendment to the Energy \nconference report, much of the same language. That report, of course, \ndid not emerge from the conference committee and died with the end of \nthe last Congress.\n  This assistance included:\n  The establishment of an Indian Energy Office; grants, loans, and \ntechnical assistance; capacity building; and regulatory changes to the \nrules governing the leasing of Indian lands for energy purposes.\n  At the same time, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, \nintroduced his own Indian energy bill that somewhat mirrored ours.\n  After the hearing and much debate the best of these two bills were \nmelded together into a composite bill that made up title III of the \nbill before us now.\n  The amendment I am offering today contains refinements but not major \nchanges of title III and I would like to walk through these provisions \nfor the benefit of the Members who will be reviewing the Record \ntomorrow.\n  Section 2601 contains definitions. Its standard definitions section \nprovides definitions for a number of terms including the following:\n  Director of the Office of Indian Energy Policy; Indian Tribe; and \nVertical Integration.\n  Section 2602, the Indian Tribal Energy Resource Development, \nauthorizes the Interior Secretary to provide assistance to Indian \ntribes in the form of development grants and grants for obtaining or \ndeveloping managerial capacity needed for energy purposes.\n  It provides low-interest loans to Indian tribes and tribal energy \ndevelopment organizations to promote Indian energy development.\n  Section 2602 also provides assistance to Indian Tribes for purposes \nof energy efficiency and energy conservation; as well as planning, \nconstruction, operation, maintenance of electrical generation \nfacilities on tribal lands.\n  Section 2603, the Indian Tribal Energy Resource Regulation authorizes \nthe Secretary of Interior to make grants to Indian tribes and tribal \nenergy development organizations to use, develop, administer, and \nenforce tribal laws governing the development and management of energy \nresources on their own lands.\n  This section helps tribes build the capacity, if they do not already \nhave it, to develop their resources in an effective and safe way.\n  For instance, a tribe could use these funds to develop a tribal \nenergy resource inventory; to carry out feasibility studies necessary \nto the development of energy resources; to develop and implement tribal \nlaws and technical infrastructure to protect the environment; to train \nemployees engaged in energy development and environmental protection; \nand other functions related to scientific and technical data \ndevelopment and collection.\n  Section 2604 establishes a voluntary process for those tribes that \nchoose it to help develop their energy resources.\n  Under the process, an Indian tribe must first demonstrate to the \nSecretary of Interior that it has the technical and financial capacity \nto develop and manage its own resources.\n  Once it meets this burden, the tribe can negotiate energy resource \ndevelopment leases, agreements and rights-of-way with third parties \nwithout first obtaining the Secretary's approval. This will provide \nstreamlining to the leasing process that is now burdened by an \nextensive Federal regulation I mentioned earlier.\n\n  Whether a tribe decides to avail itself of the new procedure in the \nsection or continue under the current system will be entirely at the \noption and discretion of each tribe. None is required to do so. It is \ntotally voluntary, tribe by tribe.\n  Under current law, in order to be valid, all leases, business \nagreements, and rights-of-way involving restricted land must be \nsubmitted to and approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Section \n2604 of the Campbell amendment provides tribes with the obligation of \nsubmitting to the Secretary a proposed government-to-government \nagreement, a tribal energy resources agreement, sometimes called a \nTERA--and I will continue using that word for simplicity--that will set \nforth mandatory provisions for future leases, business agreements, and \nrights-of-way involving energy development on tribal lands.\n  Along with the proposed TERA, the tribe will have to make a \ndemonstration to the Secretary that it has the experience and \nmanagerial and financial capacity to regulate and develop its own \nenergy resources. If the Secretary approves the TERA, that TERA will \ngovern future development of the tribe's energy resources. The TERA, by \nvirtue of this section, will require tribal leases and agreements to \nhave certain terms, require compliance with all applicable \nenvironmental laws, notice to the public, and consultation with the \nStates as to potential off-reservation impacts. The TERA will provide \nfor an environmental review process that will identify all significant \nimpacts, inform the public, and allow the public to comment on the \npotential environmental impacts before any lease agreement or right-of-\nway is approved.\n  The Secretary will be required to review any direct effects of an \napproval of the TERA itself under NEPA. The subsequent tribal approval \nof leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way under TERA will not \nbe subject to another review under NEPA. In other words, tribes will \nnot be exempt from NEPA. It will be front-loaded so that the \nrequirements are at the secretarial level, but if that agreement goes \nthrough, they will not have to go through the NEPA process two times.\n  The TERA will also require the Secretary to do an annual trust asset \nevaluation to modernize the tribe's energy development activities and \nallow her to reassume the responsibility over those activities if she \nfinds an imminent jeopardy of trust assets. This section gives third \nparties who have or may sustain a significant adverse environmental \nimpact as a result of the tribe's failure to comply with its TERA the \nstanding to petition the Secretary to review the tribe's activities. \nThis process both protects the tribe's status and certainly does not \nallow them to circumvent NEPA. If she finds the tribe in violation of \nTERA, she may suspend the leases or rights-of-way or suspend TERA \naltogether.\n  Section 2604 also discusses the Secretary's trust responsibility. It \nexpressly states that the section does not absolve the United States \nfrom that responsibility and expressly states that the Secretary will \ncontinue to have a trust obligation to protect a tribe when another \nparty to a lease agreement or right-of-way is in breach. It does not \naffect trust responsibility at all.\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\n  Section 2604 provides that the United States will not be liable to \nany party, including a tribe, for losses resulting in the terms of any \nlease agreements or right-of-way executed by the tribe pursuant to the \napproved TERA, which makes sense; Liability follows responsibility. If \na tribe makes the leasing decisions, it should certainly be held \nresponsible. If the United States continues to make the leasing \ndecisions, it will continue to be held responsible. If Indian self-\ndetermination means anything, it means the right of tribes to make \ntheir own decisions and their responsibility to the tribes to live with \nthose decisions.\n\n  Section 2605 deals with the Federal Power Marketing Administration. \nThis section authorizes the Bonneville Power Administration and the \nWestern Area Power Administration to encourage Indian energy \ndevelopment through a variety of means. It authorizes the power \nadministrations to purchase power from Indian tribal generators to meet \ntheir own needs or energy needs on Indian lands, and it requires that \nany such power purchase must not cost more than the prevailing market \nprice.\n  This section also authorizes the Energy Secretary to undertake a \npower allocation study with a report due within 2 years of the \nenactment of the title.\n  Section 2606 deals with Indian mineral development review. This \nsection authorizes the Interior Secretary to undertake a review of all \nactivities conducted under the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 \nand to report the results of that review to Congress. Included in the \nstudy would be recommendations for overcoming the barriers to greater \nmineral development on Indian lands, such as legal barriers, physical \nbarriers, market barriers, and others.\n  Section 2607 authorizes the Energy Secretary, in tandem with the \nInterior Secretary and the Army Corps of Engineers, to undertake a \nfeasibility study of developing a demonstration project that uses wind \nenergy generated by tribes and hydropower generated by the Army Corps \nof Engineers on the Missouri River to supply area to the Western Area \nPower Administration. A report of this study is due within 1 year of \nenactment.\n  That is the substance of this amendment. It is very important that \nthe choice of the tribes is upheld, and it certainly is whether you \nwant to participate or not.\n  For the record, I ask unanimous consent to have letters of support \nprinted in the Record, including from the National Congress of American \nIndians which has over 300 tribal members, and the Council of Energy \nResource Tribes with over 50 Members, and several letters from \nindividual tribes, including the Chickasaw and the Cherokee.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              National Congress of\n\n\n                                             American Indians,\n\n                                                     June 2, 2003.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Office \n       Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: This letter is to offer general \n     support for the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-\n     Determination Act of 2003 (Title III). Since the release of \n     your mark in April, NCAI has been working feverishly to offer \n     a solution to the concerns expressed by tribal \n     representatives. NCAI engaged in this effort so that we could \n     provide general support for this significant piece of \n     legislation once these concerns were addressed. Through this \n     collaborative process, we believe this legislation has the \n     potential to enhance economic development initiatives and \n     will be of great benefit to economic development in Indian \n     country.\n       As you may be aware, concerns were raised by a number of \n     tribes and tribal advocates regarding some provisions of the \n     Chairman's mark for this measure. We shared in their concern \n     regarding provisions that significantly limit the United \n     State's liability and release the Secretary of Interior from \n     any accountability to Indian tribes for actions that she is \n     required to undertake pursuant to the legislation. \n     Additionally, we were concerned about the definition of \n     ``tribal consortium'' which differed greatly from the \n     definition that is traditionally employed in legislation \n     affecting Indian tribes and offers federal money to non-\n     tribal entities that should be going to Indian tribes. In \n     addition to these two central concerns, we were not satisfied \n     with provisions pertaining to environmental review and we had \n     some general drafting-related issues.\n       Given these concerns, NCAI has convened several conference \n     calls with tribal representatives including the Navajo \n     Nation. Council of Energy Resources Tribes, and the \n     International Council on Utility Policy, and developed a \n     series of tribal recommendations for modifying Title III. We \n     also convened with your staff and Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee staff to discuss the tribal \n     recommendations. Thereafter, your staff held a conference \n     call for those same representatives and staffers from the \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee. Although we are \n     pleased that we were able to craft better language for the \n     trust responsibility provisions, we are still concerned with \n     some of the limitations.\n       Nonetheless, we realize that in this political climate, the \n     language as currently revised is likely the best compromise \n     that can be reached. We appreciate the effort of your staff \n     and other committee staffers to negotiate language that \n     attempts to address the tribal concerns in light of the \n     current political environment. Again, I want to underscore \n     that the tribal support comes from working with a group of \n     tribal representatives and organizations from diverse \n     perspectives, but not all perspectives. Because of this, our \n     revised version of your mark may not reflect the needs and \n     desires of all tribes who wish to utilize this legislation to \n     develop their energy resources.\n       We would like to thank you and your staff for all of their \n     hard work on this very important issue. I cannot stress \n     enough how grateful we are to your commitment to developing \n     legislative solutions to age-old problems in Indian country. \n     Title III is just one more example of how Indian tribes \n     benefit from your championship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Jacqueline Johnson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Council of Energy Resource Tribes,\n\n                                         Denver, CO, June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: On behalf of the 53 CERT member \n     Tribes, I am writing to express CERT's support for the Title \n     III Indian Energy provisions of S. 14.\n       As you know, there are some provisions in section 2604 of \n     the Title III of the bill as reported that has caused concern \n     among CERT member Tribes. Fortunately, we believe those \n     concerns have largely been addressed by language agreed to \n     between Committee staff and representatives of CERT and \n     several member Tribes. At this time, we believe we have \n     reached agreement that addresses the concerns of CERT and the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe, the Navajo Nation and the \n     Jicarilla Apache Nation. We expect you will hear from each of \n     those tribes as well.\n       CERT has agreed to language that insures that the Tribal \n     Energy Resource Agreements (TERA) process is a voluntary, \n     opt-in program for development of Tribal energy resources. We \n     have also agreed to language to be certain that the public \n     comment opportunities go to the environmental and other \n     impacts of the development and not to the terms of the \n     business agreements themselves. CERT accepts the revised \n     language that better describes the Secretary's trust duties \n     under this section. Finally, the scope of the Secretary's \n     NEPA review of the TERA is settled.\n       While drafting final language for this section has been \n     somewhat difficult, we compliment the staff of both the \n     Senate Energy Comittee and the Senate Indian Affairs \n     Committee for their dedication to resolving the remaining \n     differences between us on language relating to trust \n     protections and enviroinmental issues.\n       Again, we are pleased to support Title III with these \n     changes to section 2604 and appreciate your steadfast support \n     of the right of Indian Tribes to gain a better measure of \n     control over the development of energy resources on their own \n     lands.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  A. David Lester,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council,\n\n                                        Ignacio, CO, May 27, 2003.\n     Re: Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination \n       Act of 2003; S. 14, Title III\n     Chairman Pete V. Domenici,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici: Approximately one month ago, the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe submitted a statement of \n     conceptual, but qualified, support for the Indian Tribal \n     Energy Development and Self-Determination Act of 2003. Our \n     Tribe's activities have shown that tribal energy development \n     can provide tremendous economic development opportunities for \n     tribes while simultaneously assisting the Nation in meeting \n     its energy demands. For tribes that have demonstrated the \n     capability to represent themselves effectively in energy \n     development activities, we have long-advocated legislation \n     that would provide the option of bypassing the stifling \n     effects of the Bureau of Indian Affairs approval requirements \n     applicable to tribal leases, business agreements and rights-\n     of-way. The referenced legislation addresses this very \n     matter; however, as Section 2604 of Title III emerged from \n     the Senate Committee of Indian Affairs and the Senate \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, it contained a \n     number of provisions that were objectionable to the Indian \n     community.\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\n       Over the last month, committee staff members and \n     representatives of tribes and Indian organizations have \n     engaged in an intense dialogue about the problems in the \n     draft legislation, and, as a result of their tireless \n     efforts, proposed amendments have been developed that would \n     eliminate the problems previously identified. A list of those \n     proposed amendments is attached for references purposes. \n     Among the different matters resolved to our satisfaction have \n     been the following: (i) confirmation that Section 2604 is a \n     voluntary program available to Tribes on an opt-in/opt-out \n     basis; (ii) inclusion of pre-approval public notice and \n     comment opportunities regarding the environmental impacts of \n     a proposed tribal mineral lease, business agreement or right-\n     of-way, but preservation of the confidentiality of the \n     business terms of such documents; (iii) acceptable balancing \n     of the limitations on and ongoing responsibility of the \n     Secretary to perform trust duties associated with a \n     participating tribe's activities undertaken pursuant to this \n     legislation; and (iv) confirmation of the appropriate scope \n     of NEPA review that would be associated with the Secretary's \n     decision to approve a Tribal Energy Resource Agreement \n     (``TERA''), which is the enabling document permitting a tribe \n     to proceed with independent development of mineral leases, \n     business agreements, or rights-of-way. Again, we helped \n     develop and wholly support these amendments.\n       During the course of debate on this legislation, some have \n     suggested that Section 2604 will eliminate effective \n     environmental protection on affected tribal lands. We want to \n     assure the members of the Senate that this is not the case. \n     Energy resource development by a tribe generally carries with \n     it a deep commitment to preserving one's backyard. Tribal \n     leaders are directly accountable to their members for \n     preserving environmental resources. In the Four Corners \n     Region, it is not unusual for private landowners or BLM \n     lessees to comment enviously on the environmental diligence \n     employed by our Tribe in the development of our energy \n     resources. We renew our invitation to members of the Senate \n     to visit our Reservation and see first-hand our energy \n     resource projects.\n       In conclusion, with the referenced amendments, we strongly \n     support S. 14, Title III. We urge other members of the Senate \n     to also support this legislation, and we commend those who \n     have worked toward its development and passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Howard D. Richards, Sr.,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Native American Energy Group, LLC,\n\n                                    Ft. Washakie, WY, May 7, 2003.\n     Senator Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: Native American Energy Group (NAEG) \n     is an Indian owned company working with tribes and allottees \n     throughout the country to determine how best to develop oil \n     and gas reserves and help provide for the energy security of \n     this country while also protecting the interests of mineral \n     owners. The recent Indian provisions of the Energy Bill are a \n     big step in the right direction to accomplish positive \n     results for the Indian people of this country.\n       One of the areas of contention is the environmental area \n     with many people stating that these provisions will gut the \n     NEPA process. While this is a legitimate concern, nowhere \n     have I read or heard that this is the intent of these \n     provisions. In fact recent language in the Bill clearly \n     denotes compliance with all applicable tribal and federal \n     environmental laws. Even without this new language though my \n     understanding was always that the intent was not to gut \n     environmental laws. Tribal governments with energy resources \n     are pro-development but by the same token they are also pro-\n     environment. This may seem a dichotomy of sorts but my read \n     on this bill is that the language will strengthen tribal \n     sovereignty, develop tribal capacities and make tribal and \n     allotted oil and gas operations more accountable with less \n     impacts. In addition, the federal trust oversight will not be \n     diminished which is always a concern of tribal governments.\n       NAEG appreciates the work and coordination that goes into \n     an effort of this magnitude and you and your staff are to be \n     commended for the recent provisions as presented in the bill. \n     The history and discussions surrounding this bill recognize \n     the importance of bringing tribes into the mainstream of the \n     energy picture of this country and providing the mechanisms \n     for the technical, administrative and legislative efforts to \n     occur.\n       The research your staff has undertaken in support of this \n     bill very well explains the amounts of energy resources \n     situated on tribal and allotted lands. This largely untapped \n     resource can be a boost for this country as we seek to \n     provide jobs and diversify our economy, while helping America \n     meet its energy needs. Please share with the rest of the \n     Senate Indian Committee our support for these endeavors and \n     if there is any information we can provide to assist you in \n     your work please do not hesitate to call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Wes Martel,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Cherokee Nation,\n\n                                      Tahlequah, OK, June 2, 2003.\n     Hon.

Inouye,\n     Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman: It has come to my \n     attention that several changes have been made to Title III of \n     the Senate Energy bill. I understand that these changes will \n     reduce any risk to Tribes, and wish to offer the Cherokee \n     Nation's continued support of S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of \n     2003.\n       I thank the Committee for its hard work on this issue and \n     for incorporating tribal recommendations into the bill. Your \n     leadership is greatly appreciated.\n       Please feel free to contact my office if you have any \n     questions or comments. I may be reached at (918) 456-0671.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Chad Smith,\n     Principal Chief.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                         The Chickasaw Nation,\n\n                                            Ada, OK, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We support the inclusion of Title III, \n     as it is, in Senate Bill 14. Thoughtful development of our \n     tribal natural resources serves all Americans.\n       We are grateful for the opportunities and support Title III \n     provide to the Chickasaw Nation, and for all of Indian \n     Country, as we explore and develop our natural resources. The \n     language allows us to exercise our own progressive style in \n     development and regulation; yet, it provides for those tribes \n     which prefer the more traditional approach.\n       Having a voice in the U.S. Department of Energy will \n     highlight and expedite tribal energy issues. This is an \n     opportunity for every tribe to enter into the nation's \n     economic mainstream with the support of the federal \n     government.\n       Your help, and that of Senators Bingaman and Domenici, is \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Bill Anoatubby,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            The Mohegan Tribe,\n\n                                     Uncasville, CT, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Mohegan Tribe supports the inclusion \n     of Title III in S. 14, the Energy Policy Act of 2003. \n     Offering flexibility and support in developing natural \n     resources throughout Indian Country, Title III creates \n     opportunities in which all Indian nations can benefit. We \n     also appreciate the hard work of Senators Domenici and \n     Bingaman in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark F. Brown,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I say to my colleagues, in supporting the amendment, \nyou are not only assisting Indian tribes and the development of energy \nresources but helping the United States become less dependent on \nforeign energy which I think is the goal of all.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ENERGY POLICY ACT OF 2003--CONTINUED\n\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chambliss). The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 864\n(Purpose: To replace ``tribal consortia'' with ``tribal energy resource \n          development organizations,'' and for other purposes)\n\n\tMr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\tThe legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 864.\n\n\tMr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n\tMr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, it is an indisputable fact that Indian country contains some of the richest energy resources in the America.\n\tIndian lands comprise approximately 5 percent of the land area of the United States, but contains an estimated 10 percent of all energy reserves in the United States, including: 30 percent of known coal deposits located in the western portion of the United States; 5 percent of known onshore oil deposits of the United States; and 10 percent of known onshore natural gas deposits of the United States.\n\tCoal, oil, natural gas, and other energy minerals produced from Indian land represent more than 10 percent of total nationwide onshore production of energy minerals.\n\tEven though in one year alone over 9.3 million barrels of oil, 299 billion cubic feet of natural gas, and 21 million tons of coal were produced from Indian land, representing $700 million in Indian energy revenue, the Department of the Interior estimates that only 25 percent of the oil and less than 20 percent of all natural gas reserves on Indian land have been fully developed.\n\tIt is ironic that many Indian people were forced on to the most arid, barren, and least productive lands in the 1800s and now they find themselves resource rich.\n\tDespite what we may read in the Washington Post or the New York Times about the so-called rich Indians and Indian gambling, it is also indisputable that Indians are the most economically deprived ethnic group in the United States. Unemployment levels are far above the national average, in some cases as high as 70 percent. Per capita incomes are well below the national average. They have substandard housing, poor health, alcohol and drug abuse, diabetes, amputations, and a general malaise and hopelessness, even suicide among Indian youngsters.\n\tIn fact, in some reservations it is not uncommon to find one out of every two teenage girls and one out of every three boys who attempt suicide driven by despair and a dead end future. In that context, this amendment I am offering today tries to give them some help.\n\tGiven the extent of the economic deprivation in Indian country and the vast potential wealth residing in energy resources which could ameliorate this deprivation, it has long been a puzzle why these resources have not been more fully developed.\n\tThe answer lies partly in the fact that energy resource development is by its very nature capital intensive. Most tribes do not have the financial resources to fund extensive energy projects on their own and so must partner with private industry, or other outside entities, by leasing out their energy resources for development in return for royalty payments.\n\tThe unique legal and political relationship between the United States and Indian tribes sometimes makes this leasing process cumbersome.\n\tAs with most Indian law and policy, history plays an important part. Towards the end of the 19th Century, Indian tribes were forcibly removed to isolated areas and reservations where it was believed they would not hinder the westward expansion of a new and growing country.\n\tThe natural resources contained on these lands were taken into trust by the Federal Government to be administered for the benefit of Indian tribes. The ostensible reason for the trust was the belief that Indians were incapable and incompetent of administering such resources, and would be susceptible to land and resource predators. \n\tBy the way, that belief was prevalent with a lot of people in American Government and led the Surgeon General at the time to issue a request to the U.S. Army that Indian skulls be sent to DC to study and find out if Indians had the intelligence to own their own land. That, in turn, gave rise to the saying among modern Indian people that there are more dead Indians in Washington, DC, than live ones, because until the last couple of years there were over 16,000 remains, primarily skulls and upper body bones, warehoused in the Smithsonian. Just a few years ago, we passed a Museum of the American Indian bill, and one provision of that required that the Smithsonian and other Federal agencies start returning those bones.\n\tA legal and bureaucratic apparatus was formed to administer this trust, and over a century later this apparatus remains in place in the Interior Department.\n\tIn her capacity as trustee of Indian resources, the Secretary of the Interior is required to examine all leases of Indian trust resources, to ensure that the terms of the lease benefit the tribe, and to ensure that the trust asset is not wasted.\n\tThe Committee on Indian Affairs has been informed over the year that the Secretarial approval process is often so lengthy that outside parties, who otherwise would like to partner with Indian tribes to develop their energy resources, are reluctant to become entangled in the bureaucratic red tape that inevitably accompanies the leasing of Tribal resources.\n\tHence, the framework that was originally designed to protect tribes has become an obstacle to development of Tribal resources, in that the bureaucratic impediments of trust administration are now a disincentive to outside investors.\n\tTo help remedy these problems, earlier this year I, along with Senator Domenici, introduced the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self Determination Act of 2003 to provide assistance and encouragement to Indian tribes to develop their energy resources.\n\tThis was based really on last year's amendment to the Energy conference report, much of the same language. That report, of course, did not emerge from the conference committee and died with the end of the last Congress.\n\tThis assistance included:\n\tThe establishment of an Indian Energy Office; grants, loans, and technical assistance; capacity building; and regulatory changes to the rules governing the leasing of Indian lands for energy purposes.\n\tAt the same time, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, introduced his own Indian energy bill that somewhat mirrored ours.\n\tAfter the hearing and much debate the best of these two bills were melded together into a composite bill that made up title III of the bill before us now.\n\tThe amendment I am offering today contains refinements but not major changes of title III and I would like to walk through these provisions for the benefit of the Members who will be reviewing the Record tomorrow.\n\tSection 2601 contains definitions. Its standard definitions section provides definitions for a number of terms including the following:\n\tDirector of the Office of Indian Energy Policy; Indian Tribe; and Vertical Integration.\n\tSection 2602, the Indian Tribal Energy Resource Development, authorizes the Interior Secretary to provide assistance to Indian tribes in the form of development grants and grants for obtaining or developing managerial capacity needed for energy purposes.\n\tIt provides low-interest loans to Indian tribes and tribal energy development organizations to promote Indian energy development.\n\tSection 2602 also provides assistance to Indian Tribes for purposes of energy efficiency and energy conservation; as well as planning, construction, operation, maintenance of electrical generation facilities on tribal lands.\n\tSection 2603, the Indian Tribal Energy Resource Regulation authorizes the Secretary of Interior to make grants to Indian tribes and tribal energy development organizations to use, develop, administer, and enforce tribal laws governing the development and management of energy resources on their own lands.\n\tThis section helps tribes build the capacity, if they do not already have it, to develop their resources in an effective and safe way.\n\tFor instance, a tribe could use these funds to develop a tribal energy resource inventory; to carry out feasibility studies necessary to the development of energy resources; to develop and implement tribal laws and technical infrastructure to protect the environment; to train employees engaged in energy development and environmental protection; and other functions related to scientific and technical data development and collection.\n\tSection 2604 establishes a voluntary process for those tribes that choose it to help develop their energy resources.\n\tUnder the process, an Indian tribe must first demonstrate to the Secretary of Interior that it has the technical and financial capacity to develop and manage its own resources.\n\tOnce it meets this burden, the tribe can negotiate energy resource development leases, agreements and rights-of-way with third parties without first obtaining the Secretary's approval. This will provide streamlining to the leasing process that is now burdened by an extensive Federal regulation I mentioned earlier.\n\n\tWhether a tribe decides to avail itself of the new procedure in the section or continue under the current system will be entirely at the option and discretion of each tribe. None is required to do so. It is totally voluntary, tribe by tribe.\n\tUnder current law, in order to be valid, all leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way involving restricted land must be submitted to and approved by the Secretary of the Interior. Section 2604 of the Campbell amendment provides tribes with the obligation of submitting to the Secretary a proposed government-to-government agreement, a tribal energy resources agreement, sometimes called a TERA--and I will continue using that word for simplicity--that will set forth mandatory provisions for future leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way involving energy development on tribal lands.\n\tAlong with the proposed TERA, the tribe will have to make a demonstration to the Secretary that it has the experience and managerial and financial capacity to regulate and develop its own energy resources. If the Secretary approves the TERA, that TERA will govern future development of the tribe's energy resources. The TERA, by virtue of this section, will require tribal leases and agreements to have certain terms, require compliance with all applicable environmental laws, notice to the public, and consultation with the States as to potential off-reservation impacts. The TERA will provide for an environmental review process that will identify all significant impacts, inform the public, and allow the public to comment on the potential environmental impacts before any lease agreement or right-of-way is approved.\n\tThe Secretary will be required to review any direct effects of an approval of the TERA itself under NEPA. The subsequent tribal approval of leases, business agreements, and rights-of-way under TERA will not be subject to another review under NEPA. In other words, tribes will not be exempt from NEPA. It will be front-loaded so that the requirements are at the secretarial level, but if that agreement goes through, they will not have to go through the NEPA process two times.\n\tThe TERA will also require the Secretary to do an annual trust asset evaluation to modernize the tribe's energy development activities and allow her to reassume the responsibility over those activities if she finds an imminent jeopardy of trust assets. This section gives third parties who have or may sustain a significant adverse environmental impact as a result of the tribe's failure to comply with its TERA the standing to petition the Secretary to review the tribe's activities. This process both protects the tribe's status and certainly does not allow them to circumvent NEPA. If she finds the tribe in violation of TERA, she may suspend the leases or rights-of-way or suspend TERA altogether.\n\tSection 2604 also discusses the Secretary's trust responsibility. It expressly states that the section does not absolve the United States from that responsibility and expressly states that the Secretary will continue to have a trust obligation to protect a tribe when another party to a lease agreement or right-of-way is in breach. It does not affect trust responsibility at all. \n\tSection 2604 provides that the United States will not be liable to any party, including a tribe, for losses resulting in the terms of any lease agreements or right-of-way executed by the tribe pursuant to the approved TERA, which makes sense; Liability follows responsibility. If a tribe makes the leasing decisions, it should certainly be held responsible. If the United States continues to make the leasing decisions, it will continue to be held responsible. If Indian self-determination means anything, it means the right of tribes to make their own decisions and their responsibility to the tribes to live with those decisions.\n\n\tSection 2605 deals with the Federal Power Marketing Administration. This section authorizes the Bonneville Power Administration and the Western Area Power Administration to encourage Indian energy development through a variety of means. It authorizes the power administrations to purchase power from Indian tribal generators to meet their own needs or energy needs on Indian lands, and it requires that any such power purchase must not cost more than the prevailing market price.\n\tThis section also authorizes the Energy Secretary to undertake a power allocation study with a report due within 2 years of the enactment of the title.\n\tSection 2606 deals with Indian mineral development review. This section authorizes the Interior Secretary to undertake a review of all activities conducted under the Indian Mineral Development Act of 1982 and to report the results of that review to Congress. Included in the study would be recommendations for overcoming the barriers to greater mineral development on Indian lands, such as legal barriers, physical barriers, market barriers, and others.\n\tSection 2607 authorizes the Energy Secretary, in tandem with the Interior Secretary and the Army Corps of Engineers, to undertake a feasibility study of developing a demonstration project that uses wind energy generated by tribes and hydropower generated by the Army Corps of Engineers on the Missouri River to supply area to the Western Area Power Administration. A report of this study is due within 1 year of enactment.\n\tThat is the substance of this amendment. It is very important that the choice of the tribes is upheld, and it certainly is whether you want to participate or not.\n\tFor the record, I ask unanimous consent to have letters of support printed in the Record, including from the National Congress of American Indians which has over 300 tribal members, and the Council of Energy Resource Tribes with over 50 Members, and several letters from individual tribes, including the Chickasaw and the Cherokee.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n                                              National Congress of\n\n\n                                             American Indians,\n\n                                                     June 2, 2003.\n     Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Indian Affairs, Hart Office \n       Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: This letter is to offer general \n     support for the Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-\n     Determination Act of 2003 (Title III). Since the release of \n     your mark in April, NCAI has been working feverishly to offer \n     a solution to the concerns expressed by tribal \n     representatives. NCAI engaged in this effort so that we could \n     provide general support for this significant piece of \n     legislation once these concerns were addressed. Through this \n     collaborative process, we believe this legislation has the \n     potential to enhance economic development initiatives and \n     will be of great benefit to economic development in Indian \n     country.\n       As you may be aware, concerns were raised by a number of \n     tribes and tribal advocates regarding some provisions of the \n     Chairman's mark for this measure. We shared in their concern \n     regarding provisions that significantly limit the United \n     State's liability and release the Secretary of Interior from \n     any accountability to Indian tribes for actions that she is \n     required to undertake pursuant to the legislation. \n     Additionally, we were concerned about the definition of \n     ``tribal consortium'' which differed greatly from the \n     definition that is traditionally employed in legislation \n     affecting Indian tribes and offers federal money to non-\n     tribal entities that should be going to Indian tribes. In \n     addition to these two central concerns, we were not satisfied \n     with provisions pertaining to environmental review and we had \n     some general drafting-related issues.\n       Given these concerns, NCAI has convened several conference \n     calls with tribal representatives including the Navajo \n     Nation. Council of Energy Resources Tribes, and the \n     International Council on Utility Policy, and developed a \n     series of tribal recommendations for modifying Title III. We \n     also convened with your staff and Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee staff to discuss the tribal \n     recommendations. Thereafter, your staff held a conference \n     call for those same representatives and staffers from the \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resource Committee. Although we are \n     pleased that we were able to craft better language for the \n     trust responsibility provisions, we are still concerned with \n     some of the limitations.\n       Nonetheless, we realize that in this political climate, the \n     language as currently revised is likely the best compromise \n     that can be reached. We appreciate the effort of your staff \n     and other committee staffers to negotiate language that \n     attempts to address the tribal concerns in light of the \n     current political environment. Again, I want to underscore \n     that the tribal support comes from working with a group of \n     tribal representatives and organizations from diverse \n     perspectives, but not all perspectives. Because of this, our \n     revised version of your mark may not reflect the needs and \n     desires of all tribes who wish to utilize this legislation to \n     develop their energy resources.\n       We would like to thank you and your staff for all of their \n     hard work on this very important issue. I cannot stress \n     enough how grateful we are to your commitment to developing \n     legislative solutions to age-old problems in Indian country. \n     Title III is just one more example of how Indian tribes \n     benefit from your championship.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Jacqueline Johnson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Council of Energy Resource Tribes,\n\n                                         Denver, CO, June 3, 2003.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: On behalf of the 53 CERT member \n     Tribes, I am writing to express CERT's support for the Title \n     III Indian Energy provisions of S. 14.\n       As you know, there are some provisions in section 2604 of \n     the Title III of the bill as reported that has caused concern \n     among CERT member Tribes. Fortunately, we believe those \n     concerns have largely been addressed by language agreed to \n     between Committee staff and representatives of CERT and \n     several member Tribes. At this time, we believe we have \n     reached agreement that addresses the concerns of CERT and the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe, the Navajo Nation and the \n     Jicarilla Apache Nation. We expect you will hear from each of \n     those tribes as well.\n       CERT has agreed to language that insures that the Tribal \n     Energy Resource Agreements (TERA) process is a voluntary, \n     opt-in program for development of Tribal energy resources. We \n     have also agreed to language to be certain that the public \n     comment opportunities go to the environmental and other \n     impacts of the development and not to the terms of the \n     business agreements themselves. CERT accepts the revised \n     language that better describes the Secretary's trust duties \n     under this section. Finally, the scope of the Secretary's \n     NEPA review of the TERA is settled.\n       While drafting final language for this section has been \n     somewhat difficult, we compliment the staff of both the \n     Senate Energy Comittee and the Senate Indian Affairs \n     Committee for their dedication to resolving the remaining \n     differences between us on language relating to trust \n     protections and enviroinmental issues.\n       Again, we are pleased to support Title III with these \n     changes to section 2604 and appreciate your steadfast support \n     of the right of Indian Tribes to gain a better measure of \n     control over the development of energy resources on their own \n     lands.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  A. David Lester,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Southern Ute Indian Tribal Council,\n\n                                        Ignacio, CO, May 27, 2003.\n     Re: Indian Tribal Energy Development and Self-Determination \n       Act of 2003; S. 14, Title III\n     Chairman Pete V. Domenici,\n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Domenici: Approximately one month ago, the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe submitted a statement of \n     conceptual, but qualified, support for the Indian Tribal \n     Energy Development and Self-Determination Act of 2003. Our \n     Tribe's activities have shown that tribal energy development \n     can provide tremendous economic development opportunities for \n     tribes while simultaneously assisting the Nation in meeting \n     its energy demands. For tribes that have demonstrated the \n     capability to represent themselves effectively in energy \n     development activities, we have long-advocated legislation \n     that would provide the option of bypassing the stifling \n     effects of the Bureau of Indian Affairs approval requirements \n     applicable to tribal leases, business agreements and rights-\n     of-way. The referenced legislation addresses this very \n     matter; however, as Section 2604 of Title III emerged from \n     the Senate Committee of Indian Affairs and the Senate \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, it contained a \n     number of provisions that were objectionable to the Indian \n     community. \n       Over the last month, committee staff members and \n     representatives of tribes and Indian organizations have \n     engaged in an intense dialogue about the problems in the \n     draft legislation, and, as a result of their tireless \n     efforts, proposed amendments have been developed that would \n     eliminate the problems previously identified. A list of those \n     proposed amendments is attached for references purposes. \n     Among the different matters resolved to our satisfaction have \n     been the following: (i) confirmation that Section 2604 is a \n     voluntary program available to Tribes on an opt-in/opt-out \n     basis; (ii) inclusion of pre-approval public notice and \n     comment opportunities regarding the environmental impacts of \n     a proposed tribal mineral lease, business agreement or right-\n     of-way, but preservation of the confidentiality of the \n     business terms of such documents; (iii) acceptable balancing \n     of the limitations on and ongoing responsibility of the \n     Secretary to perform trust duties associated with a \n     participating tribe's activities undertaken pursuant to this \n     legislation; and (iv) confirmation of the appropriate scope \n     of NEPA review that would be associated with the Secretary's \n     decision to approve a Tribal Energy Resource Agreement \n     (``TERA''), which is the enabling document permitting a tribe \n     to proceed with independent development of mineral leases, \n     business agreements, or rights-of-way. Again, we helped \n     develop and wholly support these amendments.\n       During the course of debate on this legislation, some have \n     suggested that Section 2604 will eliminate effective \n     environmental protection on affected tribal lands. We want to \n     assure the members of the Senate that this is not the case. \n     Energy resource development by a tribe generally carries with \n     it a deep commitment to preserving one's backyard. Tribal \n     leaders are directly accountable to their members for \n     preserving environmental resources. In the Four Corners \n     Region, it is not unusual for private landowners or BLM \n     lessees to comment enviously on the environmental diligence \n     employed by our Tribe in the development of our energy \n     resources. We renew our invitation to members of the Senate \n     to visit our Reservation and see first-hand our energy \n     resource projects.\n       In conclusion, with the referenced amendments, we strongly \n     support S. 14, Title III. We urge other members of the Senate \n     to also support this legislation, and we commend those who \n     have worked toward its development and passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Howard D. Richards, Sr.,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Native American Energy Group, LLC,\n\n                                    Ft. Washakie, WY, May 7, 2003.\n     Senator Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: Native American Energy Group (NAEG) \n     is an Indian owned company working with tribes and allottees \n     throughout the country to determine how best to develop oil \n     and gas reserves and help provide for the energy security of \n     this country while also protecting the interests of mineral \n     owners. The recent Indian provisions of the Energy Bill are a \n     big step in the right direction to accomplish positive \n     results for the Indian people of this country.\n       One of the areas of contention is the environmental area \n     with many people stating that these provisions will gut the \n     NEPA process. While this is a legitimate concern, nowhere \n     have I read or heard that this is the intent of these \n     provisions. In fact recent language in the Bill clearly \n     denotes compliance with all applicable tribal and federal \n     environmental laws. Even without this new language though my \n     understanding was always that the intent was not to gut \n     environmental laws. Tribal governments with energy resources \n     are pro-development but by the same token they are also pro-\n     environment. This may seem a dichotomy of sorts but my read \n     on this bill is that the language will strengthen tribal \n     sovereignty, develop tribal capacities and make tribal and \n     allotted oil and gas operations more accountable with less \n     impacts. In addition, the federal trust oversight will not be \n     diminished which is always a concern of tribal governments.\n       NAEG appreciates the work and coordination that goes into \n     an effort of this magnitude and you and your staff are to be \n     commended for the recent provisions as presented in the bill. \n     The history and discussions surrounding this bill recognize \n     the importance of bringing tribes into the mainstream of the \n     energy picture of this country and providing the mechanisms \n     for the technical, administrative and legislative efforts to \n     occur.\n       The research your staff has undertaken in support of this \n     bill very well explains the amounts of energy resources \n     situated on tribal and allotted lands. This largely untapped \n     resource can be a boost for this country as we seek to \n     provide jobs and diversify our economy, while helping America \n     meet its energy needs. Please share with the rest of the \n     Senate Indian Committee our support for these endeavors and \n     if there is any information we can provide to assist you in \n     your work please do not hesitate to call me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Wes Martel,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Cherokee Nation,\n\n                                      Tahlequah, OK, June 2, 2003.\n     Hon.

Thoughtful development of our \n     tribal natural resources serves all Americans.\n       We are grateful for the opportunities and support Title III \n     provide to the Chickasaw Nation, and for all of Indian \n     Country, as we explore and develop our natural resources. The \n     language allows us to exercise our own progressive style in \n     development and regulation; yet, it provides for those tribes \n     which prefer the more traditional approach.\n       Having a voice in the U.S. Department of Energy will \n     highlight and expedite tribal energy issues. This is an \n     opportunity for every tribe to enter into the nation's \n     economic mainstream with the support of the federal \n     government.\n       Your help, and that of Senators Bingaman and Domenici, is \n     appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Bill Anoatubby,\n     Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            The Mohegan Tribe,\n\n                                     Uncasville, CT, June 5, 2003.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I am going to take two literary allusions \nand put them together as the background for the points I wish to make. \nThe first one is a novel that has become a worldwide classic called \n``1984,'' written by George Orwell. You may recall that in this \nparticular novel, George Orwell describes a terrifying future. And the \nprincipal character in his novel, Winston Smith, works at the Ministry \nof Truth.\n  His job at the Ministry of Truth is to go back over old newspapers \nand clip out things that contradict the current party line and send \nthose down the memory hole; in other words, destroy them, so that if \nsomeone comes along and tries to determine whether there is any past \nsupport for the present position, the past has been scrubbed to the \npoint where everything there agrees with the present position. Anything \nthat was said previously that disagrees with the present position of \nBig Brother, the figure that controls the world in the novel, has been \nsent down the memory hole. It has been destroyed.\n  Keep that in mind as I take another literary allusion. This is an \nexact quote from Ben Bradlee, formerly editor of the Washington Post \nand one of\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\nthe great journalists of our time who said:\n\n       Journalism is the first rough draft of history.\n\n  I cite those two because I want to put them together in the debate \nthat has occurred on the floor and even more so that is going on out in \nthe world of the media--the debate about whether we had proper \njustification for going into Iraq. We are being told over and over \nagain that the world was lied to, the American people were lied to, the \nCongress was lied to because we were told that Saddam Hussein had \nweapons of mass destruction. And since we haven't found any, that means \nwe were deceived at the very beginning when the justification was given \nto us by the Bush administration to move ahead with respect to the \noperation in Iraq.\n  I submit to you, those who make that argument have tried to \nreconstruct their own memory holes. They have tried to take past \ninformation and scrub it from the record and pretend it was never \nthere. In other words, to go back to Ben Bradlee's comment that \n``journalism is the first rough draft of history,'' they are prepared, \neven this quickly after the journalists have reported what was said, to \ntry to change the first draft of history and create, virtually \novernight, a new history that never existed.\n  Well, my memory hole has not been used. I have not scrubbed from my \nmemory a series of statements and comments that have been made prior to \nIraq. And I intend to go through those comments here tonight to make it \nclear that those who claim that the President misled the Congress, the \npeople, and the rest of the world with respect to his reasons for going \ninto Iraq are, in fact, trying to rewrite history.\n  The record is very clear. It is very firm. And unless Winston Smith \nis suddenly somehow materialized to change history, the record stands \nin firm denunciation of those who are now attacking the President on \nthis issue.\n  Let's go back to the question of weapons of mass destruction. I \nremember going to S-407 in this building, the room on the fourth floor \nwhere we go to receive confidential, highly classified briefings from \nadministration officials. I remember sitting there and listening to \nMadeleine Albright, Secretary of State, outline for us in detail the \nreasons we had to attack Iraq. President Clinton, who appointed her \nSecretary of State, was even more pointed in his public statements of \nthe fact that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. In the \nPresident's phrase, ``Saddam Hussein will surely use them.'' We needed, \naccording to the President and the Secretary of State, to move ahead \nmilitarily in Iraq.\n  I remember walking out of that meeting in S-407 convinced that the \nbombs would start falling within days. As it turned out, the \nadministration changed its mind and moved away from that particular \ndecision. They backed off. But they never backed off their statement \nthat weapons of mass destruction were there, that weapons of mass \ndestruction would be used, and that Saddam Hussein could not be trusted \nlong term with weapons of mass destruction.\n  Vice President Gore--however much he has attacked this administration \nand its positions--has nonetheless stated on the record his firm belief \nthat there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I think it is \nclear that if President Bush were involved in some kind of sleight of \nhand to pretend that weapons were there when they were not, and create \nsome sort of conspiracy among the members of his administration to \npeddle this false notion, former Vice President Gore would not be part \nof that conspiracy. As Vice President, he saw the intelligence \nbriefings. He was in a position to evaluate how accurate they were, and \nVice President Gore has said publicly on the record, speaking of Saddam \nHussein on September 23:\n\n       We know that he has stored secret supplies of biological \n     and chemical weapons throughout his country.\n\n  One of the men in Iraq who worked with Saddam Hussein in creating \nthose weapons had a piece in the Wall Street Journal where he made this \nstatement: ``Inspectors will never find them.'' Also, he pointed out \nthat the artillery shells that had been found by the inspectors that \nwere hollow were, in fact, a demonstration of the fact that there were \nweapons of mass destruction--that is, chemical and biological weapons--\nbecause when the inspectors said, oh, there is no problem here, the \nwarheads are hollow and there is nothing there, this man who worked in \nIraq to create these weapons said, of course, they are hollow; the \nweapons are not put into the artillery shells until just before they \nare to be used. The artillery shells are prepared for weapons of mass \ndestruction--for chemical or biological weapons--and then stored \nhollow.\n  So instead of saying that the discovery of these weapons proves they \ndon't have chemical or biological capability, in fact, the reverse is \nactually true. We do not have a storehouse in the American military of \nhollow artillery shells because we don't use chemical weapons. The \nIraqis have hollow shells because they expect to put chemical agents in \nthose shells. All of this is part of the record and was available prior \nto the current debate of those who just want to look back and find it.\n  Senator Bob Graham, who used to be chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee when all of this intelligence was being developed, and is \nstill the ranking member of that committee, had this to say when Colin \nPowell went before the United Nations and laid out the case:\n\n       I applaud Secretary Powell for finally making available to \n     the world the information on which this administration will \n     base its actions in Iraq. . . . In my judgment, the most \n     significant information was the confirmation of a linkage \n     between the shadowy networks of international terrorists and \n     Saddam Hussein, the true coalition of evil.\n\n  All of this information was available to all these individuals prior \nto the time we went into Iraq, and all of them were satisfied that it \nwas sound information. All of them were satisfied that it was real. And \nnow the press is pretending that nobody--nobody--believed there were \nweapons of mass destruction in Iraq except the Bush administration, and \nthat everybody simply took the Bush administration at its word and now \nis being betrayed by the facts because we have not found enough of it \nto satisfy them; we have only found hollow artillery shells; we have \nonly found chemicals that could be used for pesticides.\n  I wonder if anyone has done an analysis of just how many pesticides \nIraqi agriculture requires. Looking at the stores of chemicals they \nhave found, chemicals that have dual use--yes, they could be pesticides \nor they could be a component part of a chemical weapon. Look at the \nquantities we have found and ask yourself: Do the Iraqis really need \nthis much for pesticides? Or do they have another purpose?\n  We have not yet found Saddam Hussein. As Kit Bond said today at \nlunch, if we don't ever find Saddam Hussein, is that proof of the fact \nthat he doesn't exist? If we don't find him, will that be evidence that \nthe Bush administration made him up? If we don't find him, is that \nproof that he never was in Iraq? That same kind of reasoning is being \napplied here. We have not found all of the weapons of mass destruction \nthat all of the critics would like to have as proof of their position, \nso our failure to have done that so far is, in their logic, proof that \nthese weapons never existed or proof that they were never in Iraq.\n  I think Senator Bond's question is a legitimate one. If we don't find \nSaddam Hussein, does that mean he never existed or he was never in \nIraq? Of course not. It means something happened. Either we killed him \nthe first night with that first strike and his remains have been \nremoved by the SSO--his central group of key supporters--so that his \nbody will never be found or he has left the country or he was killed \nsomewhere else. But we know he was there. Everybody knew he was there, \nand our failure to find him now does not mean he was not there when the \nattack began. Quite the contrary. Everybody is satisfied he was there.\n  The same thing applies to the weapons of mass destruction. As I have \ndemonstrated, starting with President Clinton, we have known they were \nthere, we have known they had them. If we cannot find them all, that \nmeans either they were destroyed by us or by the Iraqis or they have \nbeen moved somewhere. It doesn't mean they never existed. The evidence \nthat they existed cannot go down the memory hole just to make the \npresent arguments sound more convincing.\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\n  I read a commentator who quoted Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, in what \nthe commentator thought was a damning admission on this story, when he \nsaid:\n\n       Yes, we had other reasons for going into Iraq, but we \n     stressed weapons of mass destruction because that was the one \n     everybody was focused on.\n\n  According to the commentator, that is a damning admission on the part \nof the Secretary that we had other motives, and that is part of the \nattack that is being mounted on the floor, that the Bush administration \nwas duplicitous: They told us they were going after weapons of mass \ndestruction, but they had other motives. And here, Secretary Wolfowitz \nhas admitted it; a smoking gun.\n\n  Back to my memory. I remember very clearly that the Bush \nadministration openly and directly said they had other motives. Let me \ngo down them as I remember them.\n  Weapons of mass destruction--there are many countries that have \nweapons of mass destruction. If we were to go after the country in the \nworld, other than ourselves, that has the highest stock of weapons of \nmass destruction, we would go after Russia. Why don't we? Because \nweapons of mass destruction alone are by no means justification for \nattacking another nation. They must be tied to other motives. This is \nwhat I am sure Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was talking about.\n  Right now President Putin and President Bush have a good \nrelationship. Russia and the United States have a trusting \nrelationship. Why should we attack Russia just because it has weapons \nof mass destruction when that relationship exists?\n  Iraq was ruled by a tyrant, and not just your everyday tyrant but a \nbrutal, bloody tyrant who had demonstrated that he not only possessed \nweapons of mass destruction, he was willing to use weapons of mass \ndestruction and has done so--the only person in the world whose \ngovernment has employed weapons of mass destruction against anyone \nelse--in this case it was his own people--in the last half century. So, \nyes, there are other motives besides possessing weapons of mass \ndestruction. They are the man's personality and his history.\n  We are not just interested in nations that have WMD. We are \ninterested in brutal tyrants who will use weapons of mass destruction.\n  Next, Iraq was clearly a crossroads of terrorist activity. That is \nwhat Senator Graham referred to, not just al-Qaida. Iraq was one of the \nprincipal financial supporters of the terrorist suicide bombings in \nPalestine. They offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who would kill \nhimself as long as he took a few Jews with him. How many tyrants around \nthe world are willing to harbor terrorists and support terrorists? The \nlist gets a little smaller.\n  North Korea has weapons of mass destruction. North Korea is ruled by \na brutal tyrant. But North Korea has not invaded any of its neighbors \nfor half a century, and North Korea is not a haven for al-Qaida, Hamas, \nHezbollah, and the other terrorist organizations. We are closing down \nhere on the other motives.\n  Attacking your neighbors. Saddam Hussein has attacked his neighbors \ntwice in the last dozen years, set off two major wars, and is \nresponsible for killing more Muslims than any other person on the \nplanet.\n  The other motives that the Bush administration had in dealing with \nIraq were the totality of the situation. Yes, they wanted to deal with \nWMD. Yes, they wanted to deal with a tyrant who was brutalizing his own \npeople. Yes, they wanted to deal with terrorism. And, yes, they wanted \nto deal with somebody who was threatening his neighbors. If you take \nthat criteria and apply it to all the countries in the world, you come \nup with only one that qualifies on every count.\n  It was not the single issue that current commentators and candidates, \npundits and pollsters are talking about that prompted President Bush to \ngive the order to go ahead in Iraq. It is a distortion of history to \nhammer again and again on the fraud that says only weapons of mass \ndestruction drove us to go into Iraq, and it is our failure to find \nweapons of mass destruction in this time period in Iraq that \ndemonstrates we were wrong.\n\n  Nobody has gone to the last part of that sentence. Nobody has said \nyet that we were wrong to have taken out Saddam Hussein. They come \nclose to that in their attack on the President. They say he lied. They \nsay he manipulated. They say he distorted. But they cannot quite bring \nthemselves to say we were wrong to have done it, and no one will say \nthe world would have been a better place if we had not. Why? Because we \nhave discovered some other things we did not know.\n  If you are going to talk about intelligence failures, our \nintelligence community did not know until we got into Iraq about the \nmass graves. We did not know about the prisons holding children who \nwere put in there as young as 4 and 5 years of age and have been there \nfor 5 years or more.\n  We did not know the details of the brutality of this man. We did not \nknow that he treated his own population, those who were hostile to him \nor, indeed, simply suspect in his eyes, as brutally as Adolf Hitler \ntreated the Jews in World War II in Germany. We did not know that. We \nhave discovered that now. So no one will quite go to the point of \nsaying we made a mistake, that Bush did the wrong thing.\n  One commentator closed his attack on the Bush administration with \nthis interesting quibble, in my view. He said: It was the right war but \nit was fought for the wrong reason. I find it very difficult to \nreconcile those two. If it was the right war and has achieved the right \nresult, it was the right thing to have done, and it was the right thing \nto have done for all of the reasons that people who hate this \nadministration are now conveniently forgetting all of the historical \nbuildup to this that has gone down the memory hole that people are now \nconveniently saying never happened.\n  This is a historic Chamber, and it has seen all kinds of debates, \nhigh and low. It has seen all standards of rhetoric, good and bad, and, \nyes, if I may, true and false. There has been a call for the rafters \nhere to be ringing in a discussion of the Iraqi war and America's \nactivity. I wanted to answer that call and do what I can to see that \nthe rafters are ringing with the truth; that the rafters are ringing \nwith real history, not invented history; that the rafters are ringing \nwith a recognition that what the Bush administration has done in Iraq \nwas the right thing to have done; it was based on sound and careful \nanalysis that ran over two administrations; that was vetted thoroughly \nwith our allies abroad, bringing Great Britain, Australia, Poland, and \nothers, into the fight, and the result has demonstrated that the world \nis a safer place.\n  The Iraqi people live in a safer society, and the prospects for the \nfuture are better than would have been the case if we had gone to the \nbrink, as President Clinton did, and then changed our minds. President \nClinton thought the evidence was overwhelming but decided not to act. \nPresident Bush thought the evidence was overwhelming and did act, and \nthe rafters should ring with at least one speech that applauds that \ndecision and that level of leadership.\n  I say to my colleagues, I say to the country, I say to my \nconstituents, I believe the history is there that justifies the \ndecision, and I believe the evidence is there after the fact that more \nthan justifies the decision.\n  In this case, America and her President can stand proud before the \nworld as having done the right thing for the right reason.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION IN IRAQ\n\n\tMr. BENNETT.

We do not have a storehouse in the American military of hollow artillery shells because we don't use chemical weapons. The Iraqis have hollow shells because they expect to put chemical agents in those shells. All of this is part of the record and was available prior to the current debate of those who just want to look back and find it.\n\tSenator Bob Graham, who used to be chairman of the Intelligence Committee when all of this intelligence was being developed, and is still the ranking member of that committee, had this to say when Colin Powell went before the United Nations and laid out the case:\n\n       I applaud Secretary Powell for finally making available to \n     the world the information on which this administration will \n     base its actions in Iraq. . . . In my judgment, the most \n     significant information was the confirmation of a linkage \n     between the shadowy networks of international terrorists and \n     Saddam Hussein, the true coalition of evil.\n\n\tAll of this information was available to all these individuals prior to the time we went into Iraq, and all of them were satisfied that it was sound information. All of them were satisfied that it was real. And now the press is pretending that nobody--nobody--believed there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq except the Bush administration, and that everybody simply took the Bush administration at its word and now is being betrayed by the facts because we have not found enough of it to satisfy them; we have only found hollow artillery shells; we have only found chemicals that could be used for pesticides.\n\tI wonder if anyone has done an analysis of just how many pesticides Iraqi agriculture requires. Looking at the stores of chemicals they have found, chemicals that have dual use--yes, they could be pesticides or they could be a component part of a chemical weapon. Look at the quantities we have found and ask yourself: Do the Iraqis really need this much for pesticides? Or do they have another purpose?\n\tWe have not yet found Saddam Hussein. As Kit Bond said today at lunch, if we don't ever find Saddam Hussein, is that proof of the fact that he doesn't exist? If we don't find him, will that be evidence that the Bush administration made him up? If we don't find him, is that proof that he never was in Iraq? That same kind of reasoning is being applied here. We have not found all of the weapons of mass destruction that all of the critics would like to have as proof of their position, so our failure to have done that so far is, in their logic, proof that these weapons never existed or proof that they were never in Iraq.\n\tI think Senator Bond's question is a legitimate one. If we don't find Saddam Hussein, does that mean he never existed or he was never in Iraq? Of course not. It means something happened. Either we killed him the first night with that first strike and his remains have been removed by the SSO--his central group of key supporters--so that his body will never be found or he has left the country or he was killed somewhere else. But we know he was there. Everybody knew he was there, and our failure to find him now does not mean he was not there when the attack began. Quite the contrary. Everybody is satisfied he was there.\n\tThe same thing applies to the weapons of mass destruction. As I have demonstrated, starting with President Clinton, we have known they were there, we have known they had them. If we cannot find them all, that means either they were destroyed by us or by the Iraqis or they have been moved somewhere. It doesn't mean they never existed. The evidence that they existed cannot go down the memory hole just to make the present arguments sound more convincing. \n\tI read a commentator who quoted Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz, in what the commentator thought was a damning admission on this story, when he said:\n\n       Yes, we had other reasons for going into Iraq, but we \n     stressed weapons of mass destruction because that was the one \n     everybody was focused on.\n\n\tAccording to the commentator, that is a damning admission on the part of the Secretary that we had other motives, and that is part of the attack that is being mounted on the floor, that the Bush administration was duplicitous: They told us they were going after weapons of mass destruction, but they had other motives. And here, Secretary Wolfowitz has admitted it; a smoking gun.\n\n\tBack to my memory. I remember very clearly that the Bush administration openly and directly said they had other motives. Let me go down them as I remember them.\n\tWeapons of mass destruction--there are many countries that have weapons of mass destruction. If we were to go after the country in the world, other than ourselves, that has the highest stock of weapons of mass destruction, we would go after Russia. Why don't we? Because weapons of mass destruction alone are by no means justification for attacking another nation. They must be tied to other motives. This is what I am sure Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz was talking about.\n\tRight now President Putin and President Bush have a good relationship. Russia and the United States have a trusting relationship. Why should we attack Russia just because it has weapons of mass destruction when that relationship exists?\n\tIraq was ruled by a tyrant, and not just your everyday tyrant but a brutal, bloody tyrant who had demonstrated that he not only possessed weapons of mass destruction, he was willing to use weapons of mass destruction and has done so--the only person in the world whose government has employed weapons of mass destruction against anyone else--in this case it was his own people--in the last half century. So, yes, there are other motives besides possessing weapons of mass destruction. They are the man's personality and his history.\n\tWe are not just interested in nations that have WMD. We are interested in brutal tyrants who will use weapons of mass destruction.\n\tNext, Iraq was clearly a crossroads of terrorist activity. That is what Senator Graham referred to, not just al-Qaida. Iraq was one of the principal financial supporters of the terrorist suicide bombings in Palestine. They offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who would kill himself as long as he took a few Jews with him. How many tyrants around the world are willing to harbor terrorists and support terrorists? The list gets a little smaller.\n\tNorth Korea has weapons of mass destruction. North Korea is ruled by a brutal tyrant. But North Korea has not invaded any of its neighbors for half a century, and North Korea is not a haven for al-Qaida, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the other terrorist organizations. We are closing down here on the other motives.\n\tAttacking your neighbors. Saddam Hussein has attacked his neighbors twice in the last dozen years, set off two major wars, and is responsible for killing more Muslims than any other person on the planet.\n\tThe other motives that the Bush administration had in dealing with Iraq were the totality of the situation. Yes, they wanted to deal with WMD. Yes, they wanted to deal with a tyrant who was brutalizing his own people. Yes, they wanted to deal with terrorism. And, yes, they wanted to deal with somebody who was threatening his neighbors. If you take that criteria and apply it to all the countries in the world, you come up with only one that qualifies on every count.\n\tIt was not the single issue that current commentators and candidates, pundits and pollsters are talking about that prompted President Bush to give the order to go ahead in Iraq. It is a distortion of history to hammer again and again on the fraud that says only weapons of mass destruction drove us to go into Iraq, and it is our failure to find weapons of mass destruction in this time period in Iraq that demonstrates we were wrong.\n\n\tNobody has gone to the last part of that sentence. Nobody has said yet that we were wrong to have taken out Saddam Hussein. They come close to that in their attack on the President. They say he lied. They say he manipulated. They say he distorted. But they cannot quite bring themselves to say we were wrong to have done it, and no one will say the world would have been a better place if we had not. Why? Because we have discovered some other things we did not know.\n\tIf you are going to talk about intelligence failures, our intelligence community did not know until we got into Iraq about the mass graves. We did not know about the prisons holding children who were put in there as young as 4 and 5 years of age and have been there for 5 years or more.\n\tWe did not know the details of the brutality of this man. We did not know that he treated his own population, those who were hostile to him or, indeed, simply suspect in his eyes, as brutally as Adolf Hitler treated the Jews in World War II in Germany. We did not know that. We have discovered that now. So no one will quite go to the point of saying we made a mistake, that Bush did the wrong thing.\n\tOne commentator closed his attack on the Bush administration with this interesting quibble, in my view. He said: It was the right war but it was fought for the wrong reason. I find it very difficult to reconcile those two. If it was the right war and has achieved the right result, it was the right thing to have done, and it was the right thing to have done for all of the reasons that people who hate this administration are now conveniently forgetting all of the historical buildup to this that has gone down the memory hole that people are now conveniently saying never happened.\n\tThis is a historic Chamber, and it has seen all kinds of debates, high and low. It has seen all standards of rhetoric, good and bad, and, yes, if I may, true and false. There has been a call for the rafters here to be ringing in a discussion of the Iraqi war and America's activity. I wanted to answer that call and do what I can to see that the rafters are ringing with the truth; that the rafters are ringing with real history, not invented history; that the rafters are ringing with a recognition that what the Bush administration has done in Iraq was the right thing to have done; it was based on sound and careful analysis that ran over two administrations; that was vetted thoroughly with our allies abroad, bringing Great Britain, Australia, Poland, and others, into the fight, and the result has demonstrated that the world is a safer place.\n\tThe Iraqi people live in a safer society, and the prospects for the future are better than would have been the case if we had gone to the brink, as President Clinton did, and then changed our minds. President Clinton thought the evidence was overwhelming but decided not to act. President Bush thought the evidence was overwhelming and did act, and the rafters should ring with at least one speech that applauds that decision and that level of leadership.\n\tI say to my colleagues, I say to the country, I say to my constituents, I believe the history is there that justifies the decision, and I believe the evidence is there after the fact that more than justifies the decision.\n\tIn this case, America and her President can stand proud before the world as having done the right thing for the right reason.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Iraqi people needed our help, our \ntanks, our troops, and our commitment to topple Saddam Hussein.\n  For the first time in their lives, many Iraqis are tasting freedom, \nand like people everywhere, they think it's wonderful. I'm proud of our \nmilitary and America's commitment to make the people of the Middle East \nmore free and secure.\n  Our military men and women surely face more difficult days in Iraq, \nand the Iraqi people will be tested by the responsibilities that come \nwith freedom. The thugs who propped up the previous regime and outside \nforces with goals of their own will seek to cause problems, stir up \ntrouble and initiate violence. Freedom is messy--nowhere more so than \nin a country that has just shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n  But the journey towards a democratic Iraq has now been embarked upon. \nLike so many nations before it, Iraq now endures the growing pains \ncommon to a fledgling democracy. The uncertainty of today's Iraq, I am \nhopeful, will soon give way to the promise of a better future for the \nIraqi people. And as we move closer to this goal, we must remember \nthose who sacrificed for this noble cause.\n  Today, I rise to honor a man who made the ultimate sacrifice one can \nmake for his country and the cause of freedom.\n  Specialist Jose A. Perez III was killed last week when his convoy was \nambushed near Baghdad. Perez's convoy received fire from a rocket-\npropelled grenade while on a main supply route.\n  This San Diego, TX, native was stationed in Fort Sill. He came from a \nfamily with a proud military tradition who knows all to well the pain \nof losing a loved one. His uncle, Baldemar\n\n[[Page S7466]]\n\n``Billy'' Benavides, Jr. died in the Persian Gulf in 1992.\n  My heart breaks for this family that has given so much to our great \nNation. Of his older brother, 9-year-old Joshua said, ``He was a very \ngood hero, and he died for our freedom. I will never forget him.''\n  A good hero indeed.\n  As we watch the dawn of a new day in Iraq, let us never forget that \nthe freedom we enjoy every day in America is bought at a price.\n  Specialist Perez did not die in vain. He died so that many others \ncould live in security and freedom. And for that sacrifice, we are \nforever indebted. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family \ntoday and with the troops who are putting their lives on the line in \nIraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "OKLAHOMA LOSS IN OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM\n\n\tMr. NICKLES.

I'm proud of our military and America's commitment to make the people of the Middle East more free and secure.\n\tOur military men and women surely face more difficult days in Iraq, and the Iraqi people will be tested by the responsibilities that come with freedom. The thugs who propped up the previous regime and outside forces with goals of their own will seek to cause problems, stir up trouble and initiate violence. Freedom is messy--nowhere more so than in a country that has just shaken off a brutal dictatorship.\n\tBut the journey towards a democratic Iraq has now been embarked upon. Like so many nations before it, Iraq now endures the growing pains common to a fledgling democracy. The uncertainty of today's Iraq, I am hopeful, will soon give way to the promise of a better future for the Iraqi people. And as we move closer to this goal, we must remember those who sacrificed for this noble cause.\n\tToday, I rise to honor a man who made the ultimate sacrifice one can make for his country and the cause of freedom.\n\tSpecialist Jose A. Perez III was killed last week when his convoy was ambushed near Baghdad. Perez's convoy received fire from a rocket-propelled grenade while on a main supply route.\n\tThis San Diego, TX, native was stationed in Fort Sill. He came from a family with a proud military tradition who knows all to well the pain of losing a loved one. His uncle, Baldemar ``Billy'' Benavides, Jr. died in the Persian Gulf in 1992.\n\tMy heart breaks for this family that has given so much to our great Nation. Of his older brother, 9-year-old Joshua said, ``He was a very good hero, and he died for our freedom. I will never forget him.''\n\tA good hero indeed.\n\tAs we watch the dawn of a new day in Iraq, let us never forget that the freedom we enjoy every day in America is bought at a price.\n\tSpecialist Perez did not die in vain. He died so that many others could live in security and freedom. And for that sacrifice, we are forever indebted. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family today and with the troops who are putting their lives on the line in Iraq.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Don Nickles"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

Mr. President, yesterday I wanted to give a statement on \nthe indictment of Charles Taylor by the Special Court in Sierra Leone, \nbut due to the rapidly changing events in West Africa and the lack of \nfloor time because of extensive debates on the Defense Authorization \nand Energy bills, I did not get an opportunity. What follows is the \nstatement that I sent to the State Department, Special Court, and \nUnited Nations officials, yesterday, expressing my views on this \nserious issue.\n\n       I rise today to voice my strong support for the decision of \n     the Special Court for Sierra Leone to indict Charles Taylor \n     for ``bearing the greatest responsibility for war crimes, \n     crimes against humanity, and serious violations of \n     international humanitarian law in Sierra Leone.'' I commend \n     the Court's prosecutor, David Crane, for taking this decisive \n     action.\n       Since its inception, the Special Court has moved swiftly to \n     indict key figures allegedly involved in some of the worst \n     atrocities that occurred during the brutal civil war in \n     Sierra Leone during the late 1990s. The Court has also made \n     it a priority to emphasize outreach programs to further the \n     reconciliation process and promote the rule of law throughout \n     the country.\n       Despite important progress, we all know that the Court's \n     work would be grossly deficient if those most responsible for \n     these crimes were not brought to justice because they were \n     too hard to catch, were high officials of a foreign \n     government, or no longer resided inside of Sierra Leone. It \n     would be like the United States deciding against pursuing the \n     perpetrator of an act of terrorism on American soil, that \n     killed or maimed thousands of individuals, because he left \n     the country or was a high-ranking official in a foreign \n     government. That would be unacceptable.\n       That is precisely why Congress expressed its clear intent \n     that the Special Court for Sierra Leone should pursue those \n     most responsible, irrespective of where they currently \n     reside.\n       In the report that accompanied the Senate version of the \n     Fiscal Year 2002 Foreign Operations bill, Report 107-58, \n     Congress stated in unambiguous terms: ``To build a lasting \n     peace, the Committee believes that it is imperative for the \n     international community to support a tribunal in order to \n     bring to justice those responsible for war crimes and other \n     atrocities in Sierra Leone, irrespective of where they \n     currently reside.''\n\n  This statement was later endorsed by the Conference Report to the \nFiscal Year 2002 Foreign Operations bill, Report 107-345, which put the \nHouse of Representatives on record on this issue as well.\n  Even before these reports were issued, Senators Feingold, Frist, \nMcConnell and I wrote a letter to Secretary Powell, dated June 20, \n2001, which stated: ``Because some of the individuals most responsible \nfor the atrocities in Sierra Leone are no longer in the country, we \nbelieve it is imperative that the tribunal has the authority to \nprosecute culpable individuals--including senior Liberian officials--\nregardless of where they reside. This will prevent such persons from \nescaping justice simply by leaving the country.''\n  I can safely say that we had one individual especially in mind when \nwe drafted that text: Charles Taylor. I was the principal author of the \nletter and two Congressional reports referenced above.\n  The involvement of Charles Taylor in the conflict in Sierra Leone is \nwell documented and I will not go into great detail here. I will simply \nsay that there is no doubt in my mind that he deserves to be brought to \njustice before the Special Court.\n  To its credit, the State Department took the advice of Congress. The \nState Department successfully negotiated an agreement that established \nthe Special Court for Sierra Leone and which did\n\n[[Page S7467]]\n\nnot contain geographic restrictions on the Prosecutor, allowing him to \ngo after Charles Taylor.\n  Perhaps the Prosecutor for the Court, David Crane, best described the \nSpecial Court's mandate: ``My office was given an international mandate \nby the United Nations and the Republic of Sierra Leone to follow the \nevidence impartially wherever it leads.''\n  Today, acting on information that Charles Taylor was traveling to \nGhana, the Special Court unsealed an indictment for Charles Taylor, \noriginally approved March 7, 2003, and served the outstanding warrant \nfor his arrest on Ghanaian authorities and transmitted the arrest \nwarrant to INTERPOL.\n  Again, I commend the prosecutor for taking this step. While I \nunderstand there are some, including in the Administration, who are \nconcerned about the impact that this may have on the peace process now \nunderway in West Africa, I agree with Mr. Crane's comments on this \nsensitive issue:\n\n       To ensure the legitimacy of these negotiations, it is \n     imperative that the attendees know they are dealing with an \n     indicted war criminal. These negotiations can still move \n     forward, but they must do so without the involvement of this \n     indictee. The evidence upon which this indictment was \n     approved raises serious questions about Taylor's suitability \n     to be a guarantor of any deal, let alone a peace agreement.\n\n  The Ghanaian Government needs to act immediately. It needs to uphold \nthe basic tenants of international law, apprehend Charles Taylor and \nhold him until arrangements can be made to transfer him to the Court. \nIn addition, the State Department needs to send an unequivocal message \nto Accra that action on this issue is urgently needed.\n  This may be the only chance that we get for years to bring Charles \nTaylor to justice. It is imperative that, in its most important moment \nthus far, the United States and Ghana do everything in their power to \napprehend Charles Taylor. If this does not occur, the world will have \nmissed a golden opportunity to bring to justice one of the world's most \nheinous war criminals and advance the cause of international justice.\n  In closing, I would like to read into the Record Mr. Crane's \nstatement issued today that describes the situation concerning Charles \nTaylor:\n\n       Today, on behalf of the people of Sierra Leone and the \n     international community, I announce the indictment of Charles \n     Ghankay Taylor, also known as Charles Ghankay Macarthur \n     Dapkpana Taylor.\n       The indictment accuses Taylor of ``bearing the greatest \n     responsibility'' for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and \n     serious violations of international humanitarian law within \n     the territory of Sierra Leone since 30 November 1996. The \n     indictment was judicially approved on March 7th and until \n     today, was sealed on my request to the Court.\n       My office was given an international mandate by the United \n     Nations and the Republic of Sierra Leone to follow the \n     evidence impartially wherever it leads. It has led us \n     unequivocally to Taylor.\n       Upon learning that Taylor was travelling to Ghana, the \n     Registrar of the Special Court served the outstanding warrant \n     for his arrest on Ghanaian authorities and transmitted the \n     arrest warrant to INTERPOL. This is the first time that his \n     presence outside of Liberia has been publicly confirmed. The \n     Registrar was doing his duty by carrying out the order of the \n     Court.\n       Furthermore, the timing of this announcement was carefully \n     considered in light of the important peace process begun this \n     week. To ensure the legitimacy of these negotiations, it is \n     imperative that the attendees know they are dealing with an \n     indicted war criminal. These negotiations can still move \n     forward, but they must do so without the involvement of this \n     indictee. The evidence upon which this indictment was \n     approved raises serious questions about Taylor's suitability \n     to be a guarantor of any deal, let alone a peace agreement.\n       I am aware that many members of the international community \n     have invested a great deal of energy in the current peace \n     talks. I want to make it clear that in reaching my decision \n     to make the indictment public. I have not consulted with any \n     state. I am acting as an independent prosecutor and this \n     decision was based solely on the law.\n       I also want to send a clear message to all factions \n     fighting in Liberia that they must respect international \n     humanitarian law. Commanders are under international legal \n     obligation to prevent their members from violating the laws \n     of war and committing crimes against humanity.\n       In accordance with Security Council resolutions 1315, 1470, \n     and 1478, now is the time for all nations to reinforce their \n     commitments to international peace and security. West Africa \n     will not know true peace until those behind the violence \n     answer for their actions. This office now calls upon the \n     international community to take decisive action to ensure \n     that Taylor is brought to justice.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday the Special Court for Sierra \nLeone unsealed an indictment of President Charles Taylor of Liberia. \nTaylor is accused of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and serious \nviolations of international humanitarian law. I commend the Court for \ntaking its mandate seriously and for following the evidence where it \nled--directly to a sitting head of state.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of accountability mechanisms in \nSierra Leone--both the Special Court and the Truth and Reconciliation \nthat will address the horrible crimes committed by the foot soldiers in \nthe field--soldiers who were, all too often, children. I have worked to \nensure that the United States provides appropriate financial support to \nthese mechanisms, and I have raised the importance of our political \nsupport at the highest levels. West Africa must break the cycle of \nviolence and impunity, and all of us in the international community \nhave a role to play in that effort.\n  The Special Court is charged with prosecuting those who bear the \ngreatest responsibility for serious violations of international \nhumanitarian law committed in Sierra Leone since November 1996. For \nover a decade, Sierra Leone was one of the most insecure places on \nEarth. Civilians not only suffered from deprivation and displacement, \nthey also had to contend with the forced recruitment of child soldiers, \nwidespread and brutal sexual violence, and horrifying murders and \nmutilations. Those responsible for these crimes abandoned all human \ndecency in their simple quest for power and wealth.\n  The indictment announced yesterday had been sealed for months, but \nfor years there has been no secret about one basic fact--Charles Taylor \nis a war criminal. I said so years ago, and it remains true today. He \nshould be brought before the Court and held accountable for his \nactions.\n  I also strongly support continued American efforts to isolate and \npressure the Taylor regime. But at the same time, the situation of the \nLiberian people cannot be overlooked. Pressuring and condemning Taylor \nis not a complete policy toward this troubled and volatile country. The \narmed rebel groups currently fighting for dominance in Liberia have \nproven all to willing to prey on Liberian civilians in their own lust \nfor power. We must ask ourselves, what will Liberia look like in 10 \nyears, and what will that mean for the Liberian people, for the West \nAfrican region, and for international criminal networks? What steps can \nbe taken today to influence that outcome? And then we must muster the \nwill and the means to act before the trend most recently exemplified by \ncrisis in Cote d'Ivoire dominates the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "INDICTMENT OF CHARLES TAYLOR\n\n\tMr. LEAHY.

It has led us \n     unequivocally to Taylor.\n       Upon learning that Taylor was travelling to Ghana, the \n     Registrar of the Special Court served the outstanding warrant \n     for his arrest on Ghanaian authorities and transmitted the \n     arrest warrant to INTERPOL. This is the first time that his \n     presence outside of Liberia has been publicly confirmed. The \n     Registrar was doing his duty by carrying out the order of the \n     Court.\n       Furthermore, the timing of this announcement was carefully \n     considered in light of the important peace process begun this \n     week. To ensure the legitimacy of these negotiations, it is \n     imperative that the attendees know they are dealing with an \n     indicted war criminal. These negotiations can still move \n     forward, but they must do so without the involvement of this \n     indictee. The evidence upon which this indictment was \n     approved raises serious questions about Taylor's suitability \n     to be a guarantor of any deal, let alone a peace agreement.\n       I am aware that many members of the international community \n     have invested a great deal of energy in the current peace \n     talks. I want to make it clear that in reaching my decision \n     to make the indictment public. I have not consulted with any \n     state. I am acting as an independent prosecutor and this \n     decision was based solely on the law.\n       I also want to send a clear message to all factions \n     fighting in Liberia that they must respect international \n     humanitarian law. Commanders are under international legal \n     obligation to prevent their members from violating the laws \n     of war and committing crimes against humanity.\n       In accordance with Security Council resolutions 1315, 1470, \n     and 1478, now is the time for all nations to reinforce their \n     commitments to international peace and security. West Africa \n     will not know true peace until those behind the violence \n     answer for their actions. This office now calls upon the \n     international community to take decisive action to ensure \n     that Taylor is brought to justice.\n\n\tMr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, yesterday the Special Court for Sierra Leone unsealed an indictment of President Charles Taylor of Liberia. Taylor is accused of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and serious violations of international humanitarian law. I commend the Court for taking its mandate seriously and for following the evidence where it led--directly to a sitting head of state.\n\tI have long been a strong supporter of accountability mechanisms in Sierra Leone--both the Special Court and the Truth and Reconciliation that will address the horrible crimes committed by the foot soldiers in the field--soldiers who were, all too often, children. I have worked to ensure that the United States provides appropriate financial support to these mechanisms, and I have raised the importance of our political support at the highest levels. West Africa must break the cycle of violence and impunity, and all of us in the international community have a role to play in that effort.\n\tThe Special Court is charged with prosecuting those who bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in Sierra Leone since November 1996. For over a decade, Sierra Leone was one of the most insecure places on Earth. Civilians not only suffered from deprivation and displacement, they also had to contend with the forced recruitment of child soldiers, widespread and brutal sexual violence, and horrifying murders and mutilations. Those responsible for these crimes abandoned all human decency in their simple quest for power and wealth.\n\tThe indictment announced yesterday had been sealed for months, but for years there has been no secret about one basic fact--Charles Taylor is a war criminal. I said so years ago, and it remains true today. He should be brought before the Court and held accountable for his actions.\n\tI also strongly support continued American efforts to isolate and pressure the Taylor regime. But at the same time, the situation of the Liberian people cannot be overlooked. Pressuring and condemning Taylor is not a complete policy toward this troubled and volatile country. The armed rebel groups currently fighting for dominance in Liberia have proven all to willing to prey on Liberian civilians in their own lust for power. We must ask ourselves, what will Liberia look like in 10 years, and what will that mean for the Liberian people, for the West African region, and for international criminal networks? What steps can be taken today to influence that outcome? And then we must muster the will and the means to act before the trend most recently exemplified by crisis in Cote d'Ivoire dominates the region.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Patrick J.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern \nabout the loss to the U.S. economy of most of our high-end \nsemiconductor chip manufacturing sector, the threat of the subsequent \nloss of the semiconductor research and design sectors, and the \nresulting serious national security implications.\n  The composition of the global semiconductor industry has changed \ndramatically in recent years. East Asian countries are leveraging these \nchanging market forces through their national trade and industrial \npolicies to drive a migration of semiconductor manufacturing to that \nregion, particularly China, through a large array of direct and \nindirect subsidies to their domestic semiconductor industry. If this \naccelerating shift in manufacturing overseas continues, the U.S. will \nlose the ability over time to reliably obtain high-end semiconductor \nintegrated circuits from trusted sources, at a time when these advanced \nprocessing components are becoming a crucial defense technology \nadvantage to the U.S. Experts in the military and intelligence sectors \nhave made clear that relying on semiconductor integrated circuits \nfabricated outside the U.S., e.g. in China, Taiwan and Singapore, is \nnot an acceptable national security option. The economic impact in the \nU.S. of the loss of manufacturing, research and design has equally \nserious implications.\n  I would like to direct my colleagues' attention to a White Paper, \nthat I am asking to be included in the Congressional Record, which \noutlines the fact that this off-shore migration of high-end \nsemiconductor chip manufacturing is a result of concerted foreign \ngovernment action, through an effective combination of government trade \nand industrial policies which have taken advantage of opportunities \nresulting from market forces and changes in the semiconductor industry. \nThis White Paper lists a number of possible actions the defense and \nintelligence communities should consider to prevent this serious loss \nof U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and design capability. I have also \nrequested that the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, \nand the National Reconnaissance Office submit reports and plans of \naction to respond to this impending national security threat. I have \nasked that these reports provide an analysis of the semiconductor \nmanufacturing issues that relate to defense and national security, as \nwell as an analysis of the potential solutions that are discussed in \nthe White Paper. I hope these reports will detail the steps that will \nbe taken to counteract this loss of critical components for U.S. \ndefense needs, as well as a timetable for the implementation of such \nsteps. I note that the Armed Services Committee report on the bill we \npassed yesterday requests similar information.\n  I hope we can act promptly to avoid a potential national security \ncrisis in terms of reliable access to cutting-edge technology necessary \nto the critical defense needs of our country. The loss goes beyond \neconomics and security. What is at stake here is our ability to be \npreeminent in the world of ideas on which the semiconductor industry is \nbased. A prompt, concerted effort by the defense and intelligence \ncommunity in cooperation with industry can reverse this trend of off-\nshore migration of manufacturing, research and design that is now under \nway and that will become essentially irreversible if no action is taken \nin the next few months.\n  I ask consent that my ``White Paper on National Security Aspects of \nthe Global Migration of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n White Paper: National Security Aspects of the Global Migration of the \n                      U.S. Semiconductor Industry\n\n       The U.S. is facing an imminent threat to national security \n     as a result of foreign government actions that have \n     capitalized on the changing composition of the semiconductor \n     industry. Our concern is the loss to the U.S. economy of the \n     high-end semiconductor manufacturing sector, the potential \n     subsequent loss of the semiconductor research and design \n     sectors, and the grave national security implications that \n     this would entail. East Asian countries are leveraging market \n     forces through their national trade and industrial policies \n     to drive a migration of semiconductor manufacturing to that \n     region, particularly China. If this accelerating shift in \n     manufacturing overseas continues, the U.S. will lose the \n     ability to reliably obtain high-end semiconductor integrated \n     circuits from trusted sources. This will pose serious \n     national security concerns to our defense and intelligence \n     communities. Historically, shifts in manufacturing result \n     over time in the migration of research and design \n     capabilities. This is especially true of leading-edge \n     industries such as advanced semiconductor manufacturing, \n     which requires a tight linkage and geographic proximity for \n     research, development, engineering and manufacturing \n     activities. The economic impact in the U.S. of the loss of \n     manufacturing, research and design has equally serious \n     implications.\n       The Pentagon's Advisory Group on Electron Devices (AGED) \n     has warned that the Department of Defense (DoD) faces \n     shrinking advantages across all technology areas due to the \n     rapid decline of the U.S. semiconductor industry, and that \n     the off-shore movement of intellectual capital and industrial \n     capability, particularly in microelectronics, has impacted \n     the ability of the U.S. to research and produce the best \n     technologies and products for the nation and the war-fighter. \n     This global migration has also been discussed in a recently \n     released National Research Council/National Academy of \n     Sciences report on the U.S. semiconductor industry, which \n     details the significant growth in foreign programs that \n     support national and regional semiconductor industries. This \n     support is fueling the structural changes in the global \n     industry, and encouraging a shift of U.S. industry abroad.\n\n\n                critical national security applications\n\n       Studies have shown that numerous advanced defense \n     applications now under consideration will require high-end \n     components with performance levels beyond that which is \n     currently available. These cutting-edge devices will be \n     required for critical defense capabilities in areas such as \n     synthetic aperture radar, electronic warfare, and image \n     compression and processing. Defense needs in the near future \n     will also be focused on very high performance for missile \n     guidance (``fire and forget''), signal processing, and \n     radiation-hardened chips to withstand the extreme \n     environments of space-based communications and tactical \n     environments. There are profound needs for much more advanced \n     onboard processing capabilities for unmanned aerial vehicles \n     undertaking both reconnaissance and attack missions, for \n     cruise missiles and ballistic missile defense, and for\n\n[[Page S7469]]\n\n     the infrastructure that connects these systems. As the \n     military transforms to a ``network-centric'' force in the \n     future, the DoD's Global Information Grid will demand \n     extremely high-performance computation to overcome the \n     technical barriers to a seamless communication network \n     between terrestrial 24 and 48 color optical fiber and \n     satellite platforms transmitting in 100+Mbps wireless. Such \n     performance will also be necessary for ``last-mile'' \n     extremely high-speed connectivity to platforms and to the \n     soldier in the field, as well as for the high-speed \n     encryption requirements for a secure communication system. \n     Intelligence agencies will increasingly need the most \n     advanced chips for very high-speed signal processing and data \n     analysis, for real-time data evaluation, for sensor input and \n     analysis, and for encryption and decryption.\n       As studies for DARPA have indicated, the next several \n     generations of integrated circuits, which emerge at roughly \n     eighteen-month intervals as predicted by Moore's Law, offer \n     the potential for exponential gains in defense war-fighting \n     capability. It is erroneous to believe that future U.S. war-\n     fighting capability will be derived from chips one or two \n     generations behind current state-of-the-art technology. Many \n     of the integrated circuits and processing platforms that are \n     coming in to use, and which are at the heart of DoD defense \n     strategies, are clearly at the cutting edge in their \n     capabilities.\n       With the dramatic new capabilities enabled by rapidly \n     evolving chip technologies, DoD and the intelligence agencies \n     will need to be first adopters of the most advanced \n     integrated circuits, and will be increasingly dependent on \n     such chips for a defense and intelligence edge. If the \n     ongoing migration of the chip manufacturing sector continues \n     to East Asia, DoD and our intelligence services will lose \n     both first access and assured access to secure advanced chip-\n     making capability, at the same time that these components are \n     becoming a crucial defense technology advantage. Informed \n     elements of the intelligence community therefore have made \n     clear that relying on integrated circuits fabricated outside \n     the U.S. (e.g. in China, Taiwan and Singapore) is not an \n     acceptable national security option.\n\n\n     economic importance and changes in the semiconductor industry\n\n       The influence of the semiconductor industry to the U.S. \n     economy in the last decade is difficult to overstate. The \n     U.S. semiconductor sector currently employs 240,000 people in \n     high-wage manufacturing jobs, and had sales totaling $102 \n     billion in the global market in 2000 (50 percent of total \n     worldwide sales). In 1999, this sector was the largest value-\n     added industry in manufacturing in the U.S.--larger than the \n     iron, steel and motor vehicle industries combined. The \n     productivity growth in the U.S. in the 1990s was due in \n     significant part to the computer production and advances in \n     information technology that depended on the semiconductor \n     industry. The economic implications of the potential \n     migration of high-end semiconductor chip research, design and \n     manufacturing to off-shore facilities has the potential to \n     cause (and, it could be argued, is already causing) long-term \n     damage to the economic growth of this country, with \n     corresponding national security ramifications.\n       A fundamental change in the semiconductor industry has \n     been, in very simplified form, that the price to performance \n     curve has reduced revenue in the industry dramatically over \n     the last decade. During the early 1960's, and continuing \n     until about 1994, the compound annual growth rate in revenue \n     of the industry was 16 percent. From 1994 to the present, the \n     growth rate has been approximately 8 percent. This situation \n     is combined with the very large costs associated with the \n     development of new 300 mm fabrication facilities (``fabs''), \n     as well as the increasing complexity and cost of research and \n     design as the industry must develop methods other than the \n     traditional scaling methods (making all aspects of the chips \n     smaller and smaller) in order to increase performance. These \n     factors, and the current recession, are driving the industry \n     to consolidations. As those consolidations take place, new \n     business models, such as fabless companies and consortia, \n     come into play.\n\n\n   a process driven by government policy in reaction to market forces\n\n       The principal reason that China is becoming a center of \n     semiconductor manufacturing is the effective combination of \n     government trade and industrial policies which have taken \n     advantage of opportunities resulting from market forces and \n     changes in the semiconductor industry. In a sector \n     characterized by rapidly increasing capital costs and the \n     need to have access to large, rapidly growing markets, such \n     as China's, Chinese government policies and subsidies can \n     decisively change the terms of international competition. The \n     impact of these incentives is accentuated as a result of the \n     multi-year recession, which has sharply reduced revenue and \n     increased the competition for markets to absorb the \n     industry's characteristic high fixed costs. Government \n     policies in Taiwan were already drawing new manufacturing \n     capability, as well as tool and equipment makers, to its \n     science and technology park complex. However, in the last two \n     years, Chinese policy has resulted in a sharp upsurge in \n     construction of fabrication facilities in that country, with \n     plans for a great many more.\n       The U.S. high-tech industry has been in a recession the \n     last two years, with sharply reduced sales and severe losses. \n     The number of state-of-the-art U.S. chip manufacturing \n     facilities is expected to sharply decrease in the next 3-5 \n     years to as few as 1-2 firms that now have the revenue base \n     to own a 300 mm wafer production fab, and likely less than a \n     handful of firms. Although the U.S. currently leads the world \n     semiconductor industry with a 50 percent world market share, \n     the Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that the \n     U.S. share of 300 mm wafer production capacity will be only \n     approximately 20 percent in 2005, while Asian share will \n     reach 65 percent (only 10 percent of this from Japan). The \n     remaining state-of-the-art U.S. chip-making firms face great \n     difficulty in attaining the huge amounts of capital required \n     to construct next-generation fabs. This situation stands in \n     contrast to that in China. To ensure that they develop the \n     ability to build the next-generation fabrication facilities, \n     the Chinese central government, in cooperation with regional \n     and local authorities, has undertaken a large array of direct \n     and indirect subsidies to support their domestic \n     semiconductor industry. They have also developed a number of \n     partnerships with U.S. and European companies that are cost-\n     advantageous to the companies in the short-term. The Chinese \n     government is successfully using tax subsidies (see below) to \n     attract foreign capital from semiconductor firms seeking \n     access to what is expected to be one of the world's largest \n     markets. This strategy, which is similar to that employed by \n     the European Union in early 1990s, is a means of inducing \n     substantial inflows of direct investment by private firms. \n     Indeed, much of the funding is Taiwanese, driven by the tax \n     incentives and their need for market access, especially for \n     commodity products such as DRAMs. The strategy does not \n     rely on cheaper labor, as that is a small element in \n     semiconductor production.\n       The Chinese are, however, able to increasingly draw on \n     substantially larger pools of technically trained labor as \n     compared to the U.S., from the large cohorts of domestic \n     engineering graduates. Importantly, the output of Chinese \n     universities is supplemented by large numbers of engineers \n     trained at U.S. universities and mid-career professionals who \n     are offered substantial incentives to return to work in \n     China. These incentives for scientists and engineers, which \n     include substantial tax benefits, world-class living \n     facilities, extensive stock options taxed at par value, and \n     other amenities, are proving effective in attracting \n     expatriate labor. They also represent an important new \n     dimension in an accelerating global competition for highly \n     skilled IT labor.\n       The immediate and most powerful incentives for a highly \n     leveraged industry are the direct and indirect subsidies, \n     including infrastructure needed for state-of-the-art fabs, \n     offered by the government. For example, the Chinese central \n     government has undertaken indirect subsidies in the form of a \n     substantial rebate on the value-added tax (VAT) charged on \n     Chinese-made chips. While many believe this is an illegal \n     subsidy under GATT trade rules, the impact of the subsidy on \n     the growth of the industry may well be irreversible before--\n     and if--any trade action is taken. There are a variety of \n     other documented measures adopted by the Chinese government. \n     The development of special government funded industrial \n     parks, the low costs of building construction in China as \n     compared to the U.S., and their apparent disinterest in the \n     expensive pollution controls required of fabrication \n     facilities in the U.S. all represent further hidden \n     subsidies. The aggregate effect of these individual \n     ``subsidies'' may be only a few tens of percentage points of \n     decrease (literally, only 20-30 percent in the manufacturing \n     costs of the chips, but in such a cost-driven industry, this \n     difference appears to play an important role in driving the \n     entire offshore migration process for these critical \n     components. Essentially, these actions reflect a strategic \n     decision and represent a concerted effort by the Chinese \n     government to capture the benefits of this enabling, high-\n     tech industry, and thereby threatening to be a monopoly \n     supplier and thus in control of pricing and supply.\n       It is therefore important to understand that the current \n     shift in manufacturing capacity to China is not entirely the \n     result of market forces. It is equally important to recognize \n     that even if some residual U.S. manufacturing capacity \n     remains after this large-scale migration takes place, the \n     shift of the bulk of semiconductor manufacturing will \n     severely constrain the ability of the U.S. to maintain high-\n     end research and development capabilities. Such directed \n     government support has proven itself to be a severe threat to \n     U.S. industry. For a variety of reasons, the U.S. government \n     has never been able to provide such coordinated support. The \n     results of this deficit have been devastating. The idea that \n     national governments cannot contribute to the health and \n     direction of such a ``consumer based'' industry is unfounded, \n     particularly given the national security implications.\n\n\n                            A Plan of Action\n\n       The stakes are real. The time for the country to react \n     effectively is limited. There are things that can be done. If \n     these steps are taken in a timely fashion, the collective \n     impact of the measures will be more powerful in maintaining \n     reliable first access to high-end semiconductor chip design \n     and manufacturing in the U.S. These could include:\n       Active Enforcement of GATT trade rules. Currently the \n     Chinese government is providing a 14 percent rebate on VAT to \n     customers who buy Chinese-made semiconductor chips, \n     essentially providing a large\n\n[[Page S7470]]\n\n     subsidy of their domestic industry in clear violation of GATT \n     rules. Thus, U.S.-made chips would pay a 17 percent VAT, and \n     Chinese-made chips would pay a 3 percent VAT. Given the tight \n     price competition of chips and the growing importance of the \n     Chinese chip market, this is a very significant step towards \n     ending U.S. production. It is important to ensure that GATT \n     rules are properly enforced in this instance, and not allow \n     government imposed advantages for foreign competitors to \n     damage U.S. manufacturers. DoD should insist that the U.S. \n     Trade Representative undertake prompt bilateral negotiations \n     to remove these measures.\n       Joint production agreements. With the current downturn in \n     the high-tech sector, it is probable that many chip \n     manufacturing companies will be unable to acquire the \n     necessary capital to invest in the $3+ billion required for \n     new 12-inch water advanced chip fabrication facilities, which \n     are radically increasing in cost. Title 15 of the U.S. code \n     (sections 4301 through 4305) gives private technology \n     companies facing global competition the ability to enter into \n     joint production ventures with a waiver of certain anti-trust \n     laws. Under this provision, a group of companies could \n     consolidate assets into a small number of chip fabrication \n     plants, which could be jointly run by a cooperative of two to \n     five companies. This cooperative investment in a fab could \n     sharply reduce the risk and cost to each participating firm, \n     and their agreements to purchase chips from the new fab could \n     be the basis to obtain financing. The Department could \n     encourage this kind of venture and offer contracting \n     opportunities to meet DoD's own chip-making needs, thus being \n     an additional guarantor of demand.\n       Business models. A variety of creative business models \n     exist which can help the Department and intelligence agencies \n     obtain improved access to advanced manufacturing lines. The \n     Department and intelligence agencies can enter into \n     agreements with a number of U.S.-based chip manufacturers \n     within the context of one of these models to the mutual \n     benefit of all parties. DoD should contract with selected \n     U.S. fabs for long-term access, using any one or more types \n     of contractual vehicles (such as ``take or pay''). DoD should \n     also direct its aerospace end-users to employ the services of \n     these domestic fabs. While DoD, NSA and NRO are only a very \n     small piece of the semiconductor market, they can still use \n     their residual contracting power to encourage retention of \n     U.S. advanced chip manufacturing in a coordinated way. DoD \n     and the intelligence agencies must pursue this avenue of \n     creative government-industry cooperation, and must do so \n     soon, as time is not on the side of the U.S. industrial base \n     or the U.S. Government. It is important to note, however, \n     that even a much stronger and better coordinated effort in \n     this area alone will not resolve DoD's problems because over \n     time without a strong domestic commercial semiconductor \n     industrial base it will become very difficult for DoD to \n     retain access to state of the art chips. DoD requires an \n     industry with technology leadership, not just its own \n     short term supply fix.\n       Encourage tax incentives for U.S. investment. As the next \n     generation of chip fabrication facilities can cost at least \n     $3 billion per plant, the manufacturing sector will require \n     assistance in acquiring the investment capital necessary to \n     develop the manufacturing capabilities for cutting edge \n     semiconductor chips. DoD and the intelligence agencies should \n     work with industry and propose targeted tax incentives, \n     possibly in coordination with state and local government \n     financing, to assist in meeting these investment costs. As \n     noted above, these efforts cannot be delayed into the out-\n     years, as time is of the essence.\n       Increase Science and Engineering Graduates. The \n     unprecedented technical challenges faced by the industry will \n     require technically trained talent to provide solutions to \n     these problems. In order to effectively compete against the \n     concerted effort by the Chinese to capture the semiconductor \n     industry, it will be necessary to counter the growing \n     disparity of trained talent in both physical sciences and \n     engineering between East Asia and the U.S. Incentives need to \n     be created for increasing university student training in \n     these fields, in particular, of students who are U.S. \n     citizens. The training over the past two decades of East \n     Asian students in American universities, who increasingly \n     return to their country of origin, is a partial cause of the \n     present situation. Additionally, efforts need to be \n     undertaken to encourage their retention in the U.S. Overall, \n     DoD should focus on programs that increase the number of \n     science and engineering graduates at the B.S. and M.S. level \n     needed to provide the technical capabilities for the \n     semiconductor industry.\n       Increases in Federal Funds for Research and Development \n     (R&D). Levels of federal funding in the U.S. for research on \n     microelectronics have been steadily decreasing, while at the \n     same time, competitors in Asia and Europe have dramatically \n     expanded public support for semiconductor R&D. This decline \n     in U.S. research support is of particular concern because the \n     industry is increasingly addressing extremely complex \n     technical challenges for which no solution is readily \n     apparent. The following points highlight this need for \n     restoration of funding and describe possible steps that could \n     be taken:\n       a. DARPA's annual funding of microelectronics research and \n     development--the principle channel of direct federal \n     financial support in this area--has declined since 1999, and \n     is projected to decline further. DoD should consider \n     restoring this funding.\n       b. SEMATECH, the private industry partnership with \n     government which was created to help revive the weakened U.S. \n     industry in 1987 through collaborative research and pooled \n     manufacturing knowledge, was provided with government funds \n     of $100 million per year, fully matched by industry funds. \n     Since 1996, SEMATECH has no longer received any government \n     fundings. Originally an entirely U.S. endeavor, SEMATECH has \n     now had to become ``international'' to remain in operation, \n     thereby destroying its original U.S.-centric focus. DoD \n     should consider alternative mechanisms for cooperative R&D \n     efforts with industry in critical research areas.\n       c. In the current harsh financial climate of the U.S. high-\n     tech industry, the private sector will not be able to \n     continue an adequate investment in research and development--\n     there have in fact been widespread anecdotal report of major \n     decreases in R&D efforts in the U.S. commercial electronics \n     industry. The need is developing for processors based on the \n     next generation of silicon chip technology (referred to as \n     the ``90 nanometer'' generation), and the U.S. could find \n     itself without a domestic manufacturing base, as the research \n     for that technology generation should be under way now. The \n     area of non-silicon semiconductors, which offer a level of \n     speed performance exceeding that of silicon components, is \n     clearly under-funded. For example, research is needed on \n     nano-electronics, such as alternatives to silicon CMOS \n     through nanotubes and nanowires. This technology will be \n     important for next-generation military communications and \n     radar systems (operating in consort with advanced silicon \n     processor chips). Here too, the DoD must find ways to assist \n     the U.S. non-silicon semiconductor manufacturing based by \n     further encouraging R&D appropriate to DoD requirements.\n       d. I urge the Department and intelligence agencies to \n     support increased government funding for R&D of advanced chip \n     technologies and also to support the development of new DoD-\n     specfic chip designs within the aerospace industry, which, \n     like the fabs, are losing their capabilities as the chip \n     designs themselves are increasingly conducted overseas. DoD's \n     decades-long role in the support of such research has \n     diminished in recent years. Rejuvenation of this long-\n     standing DoD role in advanced R&D would help to assure that \n     U.S. industry, to the extent that it can be retained, will \n     lead the future shifts to the most advanced chip technology \n     which DoD will need.\n       Cooperative Research Programs. Programs such as the Focus \n     Research Center Program (FRCP) under the Microelectronics \n     Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO) seek to overcome the \n     growing challenges companies face in advancing \n     microelectronics technologies through government-industry \n     partnerships that focus on cutting-edge research deemed \n     critical to the continued growth of the industry. The \n     government's share of funding (25 percent) of this \n     cooperative program has been supported through the \n     Government-Industry Co-sponsoring of University Research \n     (GICUR) program within the Office of Secretary of Defense. \n     The funding targets for this program as outlined in the \n     original ramp-up plan have not been met. In fact, this \n     program has been zeroed out of the administration's FY 2004 \n     budget. DoD should ensure that funding levels for this vital \n     area of government-industry collaborative research be \n     properly supported, and that when U.S. universities are the \n     recipients of such funding, the training of U.S. citizens (in \n     contrast to foreign students) is strongly emphasized.\n       Survey of Trade Practices. DoD should survey all possible \n     technologies that the Chinese government may be targeting for \n     subsidies that would assist in the transfer of U.S. chip-\n     making and related fields to China, and then develop a list \n     of those subsidies that are in violation of GATT trade rules \n     and seek USTR action For those that are not in violation but \n     nonetheless create a competitive ``edge'' for China, the \n     Department and the intelligence agencies will need to develop \n     counter strategies. The focus should aid to strengthen the \n     entire electronics and IT ``food chain''--from semiconductor \n     manufacturing equipment to semiconductors to computers and \n     systems. This will require broad interagency coordination and \n     cooperation. It would probably be necessary to form such a \n     ``tiger team'' immediately, and to provide that team with the \n     authority and resources to act to stem the deterioration of \n     our defense-critical on-shore infrastructure.\n       The Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Industry. Over \n     the last decade a fair fraction of U.S. semiconductor tooling \n     and equipments capability has migrated off shore. This has \n     been particularly true of the ``high technology'' end of the \n     business--advanced lithography. The migration has had a \n     significant impact on our ability to guide and direct \n     development in the chip economy as a whole. For example, when \n     ASML (a Dutch firm) tool over SVG-L (our last cutting edge \n     lithography stepper supplier) the personnel base at the \n     former SVG-L site, in part because of the recession, was \n     reduced, and some advanced product development shifted to \n     Europe. Along with the sale of SVG-L, Tinsley, an SVG-L \n     subsidiary, which is the world's premier supplier of aspheric \n     optical components widely used in defense surveillance \n     systems, was also conveyed to ASML. Lithography patent \n     battles that could affect sales and services to U.S. chip\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\n     makers using equipment from either of these companies are \n     continuing. As another example, it is generally accepted \n     throughout the industry that the photomask is a key gating \n     element in semiconductor development today, and that mask \n     development is one of the largest challenges currently facing \n     the industry. The cost of photomask infrastructure \n     development is currently outstripping available R&D resources \n     by a factor of 4 to 5. A recent SEMATECH study indicated the \n     shortfall at approximately $750 million. Outside the U.S., \n     this shortfall is being met with Government sponsored \n     development activities in hopes of taking over the market. A \n     small number of U.S. merchant mask companies are currently \n     spearheading an effort to establish a pre-competitive R&D \n     activity focused on U.S. mask infrastructure development. The \n     need, supported by SEMATECH, includes advanced tool \n     evaluation and development, along with materials, metrology, \n     and standards activities to improve future photomask \n     manufacturing capability. The goal is to accelerate leading \n     edge photomask infrastructure capability on-shore by building \n     on prior and current mask industry investments. DoD should \n     give full consideration to supporting this effort for a U.S. \n     mask consortium. Overall, the ``tiger team'' should survey \n     and make recommendations on what can be done to stimulate and \n     grow what is left of the on-shore semiconductor equipment \n     industry, including masks and lithography.\n\n\n                   necessity of comprehensive action\n\n       If DoD and the intelligence agencies lose commercial \n     advanced chip production capability, off of which they have \n     sharply leveraged over the past two decades to greatly reduce \n     their costs and to improve war-fighting capability, the \n     ability to benefit from such cost-saving relationships will \n     be permanently lost. DoD can attempt to achieve temporary \n     solutions, such as building its own next generation \n     government-owned chip fabrication facility, but this is \n     likely to be both expensive and ineffective. If the best \n     research and design capability shifts to China along with \n     manufacturing, this approach will not work past the next \n     generation or two of semiconductor chip production. In \n     addition, such temporary solutions are not only unworkable \n     over time if the U.S. wishes to retain the best capability \n     that is required for defense and intelligence needs, but will \n     be far more expensive than the solutions proposed above. This \n     is because the opportunity to leverage off the commercial \n     sector (an approach which the DoD and intelligence community \n     rely upon at present) for new advances and cost savings will \n     be lost. The U.S. policy goal should not be to seek to \n     prevent China from obtaining significant chip-making \n     capability in the very near future. That will happen. The \n     issue is whether the U.S. can improve its competitive \n     position and remove unfair distortions in order to retain \n     significant on-shore manufacturing capacity.\n\n\n                     conclusions and further action\n\n       A prompt, concerted effort by the defense and intelligence \n     community can reverse this trend of off-shore migration of \n     manufacturing, research and design that is now underway and \n     that will become essentially irreversible if no action is \n     taken in the next few months. I am requesting a report and \n     plan of action from DoD and the intelligence community, based \n     on the steps enumerated above, on how they will act to \n     prevent the national security damage that the loss of the \n     U.S. semiconductor industry will entail.\n       The loss goes beyond economics and security. What is at \n     stake here is our ability to be preeminent in the world of \n     ideas on which the semiconductor industry is based. Much of \n     applied physical science--optics, materials, science, \n     computer science, to name a few--will be practiced at foreign \n     centers of excellence. This stunning loss of intellectual \n     capability will impede our efforts in all areas of our \n     society.\n       I hope that by bringing attention to this matter, we can \n     avoid a potential national security crisis in terms of \n     reliable access to cutting edge technology necessary to the \n     critical defense needs of our country. We are being \n     confronted by one of the greatest transfers of critical \n     defense technologies ever organized by another government and \n     the time for action is overdue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "THE NATIONAL SECURITY ASPECTS OF THE GLOBAL MIGRATION OF THE U.S. \n                         SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY\n\n\tMr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about the loss to the U.S. economy of most of our high-end semiconductor chip manufacturing sector, the threat of the subsequent loss of the semiconductor research and design sectors, and the resulting serious national security implications.\n\tThe composition of the global semiconductor industry has changed dramatically in recent years. East Asian countries are leveraging these changing market forces through their national trade and industrial policies to drive a migration of semiconductor manufacturing to that region, particularly China, through a large array of direct and indirect subsidies to their domestic semiconductor industry. If this accelerating shift in manufacturing overseas continues, the U.S. will lose the ability over time to reliably obtain high-end semiconductor integrated circuits from trusted sources, at a time when these advanced processing components are becoming a crucial defense technology advantage to the U.S. Experts in the military and intelligence sectors have made clear that relying on semiconductor integrated circuits fabricated outside the U.S., e.g. in China, Taiwan and Singapore, is not an acceptable national security option. The economic impact in the U.S. of the loss of manufacturing, research and design has equally serious implications.\n\tI would like to direct my colleagues' attention to a White Paper, that I am asking to be included in the Congressional Record, which outlines the fact that this off-shore migration of high-end semiconductor chip manufacturing is a result of concerted foreign government action, through an effective combination of government trade and industrial policies which have taken advantage of opportunities resulting from market forces and changes in the semiconductor industry. This White Paper lists a number of possible actions the defense and intelligence communities should consider to prevent this serious loss of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and design capability. I have also requested that the Department of Defense, the National Security Agency, and the National Reconnaissance Office submit reports and plans of action to respond to this impending national security threat. I have asked that these reports provide an analysis of the semiconductor manufacturing issues that relate to defense and national security, as well as an analysis of the potential solutions that are discussed in the White Paper. I hope these reports will detail the steps that will be taken to counteract this loss of critical components for U.S. defense needs, as well as a timetable for the implementation of such steps. I note that the Armed Services Committee report on the bill we passed yesterday requests similar information.\n\tI hope we can act promptly to avoid a potential national security crisis in terms of reliable access to cutting-edge technology necessary to the critical defense needs of our country. The loss goes beyond economics and security. What is at stake here is our ability to be preeminent in the world of ideas on which the semiconductor industry is based. A prompt, concerted effort by the defense and intelligence community in cooperation with industry can reverse this trend of off-shore migration of manufacturing, research and design that is now under way and that will become essentially irreversible if no action is taken in the next few months.\n\tI ask consent that my ``White Paper on National Security Aspects of the Global Migration of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry'' be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\tWhite Paper: National Security Aspects of the Global Migration of the \n                      U.S. Semiconductor Industry\n\n       The U.S. is facing an imminent threat to national security \n     as a result of foreign government actions that have \n     capitalized on the changing composition of the semiconductor \n     industry. Our concern is the loss to the U.S. economy of the \n     high-end semiconductor manufacturing sector, the potential \n     subsequent loss of the semiconductor research and design \n     sectors, and the grave national security implications that \n     this would entail. East Asian countries are leveraging market \n     forces through their national trade and industrial policies \n     to drive a migration of semiconductor manufacturing to that \n     region, particularly China. If this accelerating shift in \n     manufacturing overseas continues, the U.S. will lose the \n     ability to reliably obtain high-end semiconductor integrated \n     circuits from trusted sources. This will pose serious \n     national security concerns to our defense and intelligence \n     communities. Historically, shifts in manufacturing result \n     over time in the migration of research and design \n     capabilities. This is especially true of leading-edge \n     industries such as advanced semiconductor manufacturing, \n     which requires a tight linkage and geographic proximity for \n     research, development, engineering and manufacturing \n     activities. The economic impact in the U.S. of the loss of \n     manufacturing, research and design has equally serious \n     implications.\n       The Pentagon's Advisory Group on Electron Devices (AGED) \n     has warned that the Department of Defense (DoD) faces \n     shrinking advantages across all technology areas due to the \n     rapid decline of the U.S. semiconductor industry, and that \n     the off-shore movement of intellectual capital and industrial \n     capability, particularly in microelectronics, has impacted \n     the ability of the U.S. to research and produce the best \n     technologies and products for the nation and the war-fighter. \n     This global migration has also been discussed in a recently \n     released National Research Council/National Academy of \n     Sciences report on the U.S. semiconductor industry, which \n     details the significant growth in foreign programs that \n     support national and regional semiconductor industries. This \n     support is fueling the structural changes in the global \n     industry, and encouraging a shift of U.S. industry abroad.\n\n\n                critical national security applications\n\n       Studies have shown that numerous advanced defense \n     applications now under consideration will require high-end \n     components with performance levels beyond that which is \n     currently available. These cutting-edge devices will be \n     required for critical defense capabilities in areas such as \n     synthetic aperture radar, electronic warfare, and image \n     compression and processing. Defense needs in the near future \n     will also be focused on very high performance for missile \n     guidance (``fire and forget''), signal processing, and \n     radiation-hardened chips to withstand the extreme \n     environments of space-based communications and tactical \n     environments. There are profound needs for much more advanced \n     onboard processing capabilities for unmanned aerial vehicles \n     undertaking both reconnaissance and attack missions, for \n     cruise missiles and ballistic missile defense, and for \n     the infrastructure that connects these systems. As the \n     military transforms to a ``network-centric'' force in the \n     future, the DoD's Global Information Grid will demand \n     extremely high-performance computation to overcome the \n     technical barriers to a seamless communication network \n     between terrestrial 24 and 48 color optical fiber and \n     satellite platforms transmitting in 100+Mbps wireless. Such \n     performance will also be necessary for ``last-mile'' \n     extremely high-speed connectivity to platforms and to the \n     soldier in the field, as well as for the high-speed \n     encryption requirements for a secure communication system. \n     Intelligence agencies will increasingly need the most \n     advanced chips for very high-speed signal processing and data \n     analysis, for real-time data evaluation, for sensor input and \n     analysis, and for encryption and decryption.\n       As studies for DARPA have indicated, the next several \n     generations of integrated circuits, which emerge at roughly \n     eighteen-month intervals as predicted by Moore's Law, offer \n     the potential for exponential gains in defense war-fighting \n     capability. It is erroneous to believe that future U.S. war-\n     fighting capability will be derived from chips one or two \n     generations behind current state-of-the-art technology. Many \n     of the integrated circuits and processing platforms that are \n     coming in to use, and which are at the heart of DoD defense \n     strategies, are clearly at the cutting edge in their \n     capabilities.\n       With the dramatic new capabilities enabled by rapidly \n     evolving chip technologies, DoD and the intelligence agencies \n     will need to be first adopters of the most advanced \n     integrated circuits, and will be increasingly dependent on \n     such chips for a defense and intelligence edge. If the \n     ongoing migration of the chip manufacturing sector continues \n     to East Asia, DoD and our intelligence services will lose \n     both first access and assured access to secure advanced chip-\n     making capability, at the same time that these components are \n     becoming a crucial defense technology advantage. Informed \n     elements of the intelligence community therefore have made \n     clear that relying on integrated circuits fabricated outside \n     the U.S. (e.g. in China, Taiwan and Singapore) is not an \n     acceptable national security option.\n\n\n     economic importance and changes in the semiconductor industry\n\n       The influence of the semiconductor industry to the U.S. \n     economy in the last decade is difficult to overstate. The \n     U.S. semiconductor sector currently employs 240,000 people in \n     high-wage manufacturing jobs, and had sales totaling $102 \n     billion in the global market in 2000 (50 percent of total \n     worldwide sales). In 1999, this sector was the largest value-\n     added industry in manufacturing in the U.S.--larger than the \n     iron, steel and motor vehicle industries combined. The \n     productivity growth in the U.S. in the 1990s was due in \n     significant part to the computer production and advances in \n     information technology that depended on the semiconductor \n     industry. The economic implications of the potential \n     migration of high-end semiconductor chip research, design and \n     manufacturing to off-shore facilities has the potential to \n     cause (and, it could be argued, is already causing) long-term \n     damage to the economic growth of this country, with \n     corresponding national security ramifications.\n       A fundamental change in the semiconductor industry has \n     been, in very simplified form, that the price to performance \n     curve has reduced revenue in the industry dramatically over \n     the last decade. During the early 1960's, and continuing \n     until about 1994, the compound annual growth rate in revenue \n     of the industry was 16 percent. From 1994 to the present, the \n     growth rate has been approximately 8 percent. This situation \n     is combined with the very large costs associated with the \n     development of new 300 mm fabrication facilities (``fabs''), \n     as well as the increasing complexity and cost of research and \n     design as the industry must develop methods other than the \n     traditional scaling methods (making all aspects of the chips \n     smaller and smaller) in order to increase performance. These \n     factors, and the current recession, are driving the industry \n     to consolidations. As those consolidations take place, new \n     business models, such as fabless companies and consortia, \n     come into play.\n\n\n   a process driven by government policy in reaction to market forces\n\n       The principal reason that China is becoming a center of \n     semiconductor manufacturing is the effective combination of \n     government trade and industrial policies which have taken \n     advantage of opportunities resulting from market forces and \n     changes in the semiconductor industry. In a sector \n     characterized by rapidly increasing capital costs and the \n     need to have access to large, rapidly growing markets, such \n     as China's, Chinese government policies and subsidies can \n     decisively change the terms of international competition. The \n     impact of these incentives is accentuated as a result of the \n     multi-year recession, which has sharply reduced revenue and \n     increased the competition for markets to absorb the \n     industry's characteristic high fixed costs. Government \n     policies in Taiwan were already drawing new manufacturing \n     capability, as well as tool and equipment makers, to its \n     science and technology park complex. However, in the last two \n     years, Chinese policy has resulted in a sharp upsurge in \n     construction of fabrication facilities in that country, with \n     plans for a great many more.\n       The U.S. high-tech industry has been in a recession the \n     last two years, with sharply reduced sales and severe losses. \n     The number of state-of-the-art U.S. chip manufacturing \n     facilities is expected to sharply decrease in the next 3-5 \n     years to as few as 1-2 firms that now have the revenue base \n     to own a 300 mm wafer production fab, and likely less than a \n     handful of firms. Although the U.S. currently leads the world \n     semiconductor industry with a 50 percent world market share, \n     the Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that the \n     U.S. share of 300 mm wafer production capacity will be only \n     approximately 20 percent in 2005, while Asian share will \n     reach 65 percent (only 10 percent of this from Japan). The \n     remaining state-of-the-art U.S. chip-making firms face great \n     difficulty in attaining the huge amounts of capital required \n     to construct next-generation fabs. This situation stands in \n     contrast to that in China. To ensure that they develop the \n     ability to build the next-generation fabrication facilities, \n     the Chinese central government, in cooperation with regional \n     and local authorities, has undertaken a large array of direct \n     and indirect subsidies to support their domestic \n     semiconductor industry. They have also developed a number of \n     partnerships with U.S. and European companies that are cost-\n     advantageous to the companies in the short-term. The Chinese \n     government is successfully using tax subsidies (see below) to \n     attract foreign capital from semiconductor firms seeking \n     access to what is expected to be one of the world's largest \n     markets. This strategy, which is similar to that employed by \n     the European Union in early 1990s, is a means of inducing \n     substantial inflows of direct investment by private firms. \n     Indeed, much of the funding is Taiwanese, driven by the tax \n     incentives and their need for market access, especially for \n     commodity products such as DRAMs. The strategy does not \n     rely on cheaper labor, as that is a small element in \n     semiconductor production.\n       The Chinese are, however, able to increasingly draw on \n     substantially larger pools of technically trained labor as \n     compared to the U.S., from the large cohorts of domestic \n     engineering graduates. Importantly, the output of Chinese \n     universities is supplemented by large numbers of engineers \n     trained at U.S. universities and mid-career professionals who \n     are offered substantial incentives to return to work in \n     China. These incentives for scientists and engineers, which \n     include substantial tax benefits, world-class living \n     facilities, extensive stock options taxed at par value, and \n     other amenities, are proving effective in attracting \n     expatriate labor. They also represent an important new \n     dimension in an accelerating global competition for highly \n     skilled IT labor.\n       The immediate and most powerful incentives for a highly \n     leveraged industry are the direct and indirect subsidies, \n     including infrastructure needed for state-of-the-art fabs, \n     offered by the government. For example, the Chinese central \n     government has undertaken indirect subsidies in the form of a \n     substantial rebate on the value-added tax (VAT) charged on \n     Chinese-made chips. While many believe this is an illegal \n     subsidy under GATT trade rules, the impact of the subsidy on \n     the growth of the industry may well be irreversible before--\n     and if--any trade action is taken. There are a variety of \n     other documented measures adopted by the Chinese government. \n     The development of special government funded industrial \n     parks, the low costs of building construction in China as \n     compared to the U.S., and their apparent disinterest in the \n     expensive pollution controls required of fabrication \n     facilities in the U.S. all represent further hidden \n     subsidies. The aggregate effect of these individual \n     ``subsidies'' may be only a few tens of percentage points of \n     decrease (literally, only 20-30 percent in the manufacturing \n     costs of the chips, but in such a cost-driven industry, this \n     difference appears to play an important role in driving the \n     entire offshore migration process for these critical \n     components. Essentially, these actions reflect a strategic \n     decision and represent a concerted effort by the Chinese \n     government to capture the benefits of this enabling, high-\n     tech industry, and thereby threatening to be a monopoly \n     supplier and thus in control of pricing and supply.\n       It is therefore important to understand that the current \n     shift in manufacturing capacity to China is not entirely the \n     result of market forces. It is equally important to recognize \n     that even if some residual U.S. manufacturing capacity \n     remains after this large-scale migration takes place, the \n     shift of the bulk of semiconductor manufacturing will \n     severely constrain the ability of the U.S. to maintain high-\n     end research and development capabilities. Such directed \n     government support has proven itself to be a severe threat to \n     U.S. industry. For a variety of reasons, the U.S. government \n     has never been able to provide such coordinated support. The \n     results of this deficit have been devastating. The idea that \n     national governments cannot contribute to the health and \n     direction of such a ``consumer based'' industry is unfounded, \n     particularly given the national security implications.\n\n\n                            A Plan of Action\n\n       The stakes are real. The time for the country to react \n     effectively is limited. There are things that can be done. If \n     these steps are taken in a timely fashion, the collective \n     impact of the measures will be more powerful in maintaining \n     reliable first access to high-end semiconductor chip design \n     and manufacturing in the U.S. These could include:\n       Active Enforcement of GATT trade rules. Currently the \n     Chinese government is providing a 14 percent rebate on VAT to \n     customers who buy Chinese-made semiconductor chips, \n     essentially providing a large \n     subsidy of their domestic industry in clear violation of GATT \n     rules. Thus, U.S.-made chips would pay a 17 percent VAT, and \n     Chinese-made chips would pay a 3 percent VAT. Given the tight \n     price competition of chips and the growing importance of the \n     Chinese chip market, this is a very significant step towards \n     ending U.S. production. It is important to ensure that GATT \n     rules are properly enforced in this instance, and not allow \n     government imposed advantages for foreign competitors to \n     damage U.S. manufacturers. DoD should insist that the U.S. \n     Trade Representative undertake prompt bilateral negotiations \n     to remove these measures.\n       Joint production agreements. With the current downturn in \n     the high-tech sector, it is probable that many chip \n     manufacturing companies will be unable to acquire the \n     necessary capital to invest in the $3+ billion required for \n     new 12-inch water advanced chip fabrication facilities, which \n     are radically increasing in cost. Title 15 of the U.S. code \n     (sections 4301 through 4305) gives private technology \n     companies facing global competition the ability to enter into \n     joint production ventures with a waiver of certain anti-trust \n     laws. Under this provision, a group of companies could \n     consolidate assets into a small number of chip fabrication \n     plants, which could be jointly run by a cooperative of two to \n     five companies. This cooperative investment in a fab could \n     sharply reduce the risk and cost to each participating firm, \n     and their agreements to purchase chips from the new fab could \n     be the basis to obtain financing. The Department could \n     encourage this kind of venture and offer contracting \n     opportunities to meet DoD's own chip-making needs, thus being \n     an additional guarantor of demand.\n       Business models. A variety of creative business models \n     exist which can help the Department and intelligence agencies \n     obtain improved access to advanced manufacturing lines. The \n     Department and intelligence agencies can enter into \n     agreements with a number of U.S.-based chip manufacturers \n     within the context of one of these models to the mutual \n     benefit of all parties. DoD should contract with selected \n     U.S. fabs for long-term access, using any one or more types \n     of contractual vehicles (such as ``take or pay''). DoD should \n     also direct its aerospace end-users to employ the services of \n     these domestic fabs. While DoD, NSA and NRO are only a very \n     small piece of the semiconductor market, they can still use \n     their residual contracting power to encourage retention of \n     U.S. advanced chip manufacturing in a coordinated way. DoD \n     and the intelligence agencies must pursue this avenue of \n     creative government-industry cooperation, and must do so \n     soon, as time is not on the side of the U.S. industrial base \n     or the U.S. Government. It is important to note, however, \n     that even a much stronger and better coordinated effort in \n     this area alone will not resolve DoD's problems because over \n     time without a strong domestic commercial semiconductor \n     industrial base it will become very difficult for DoD to \n     retain access to state of the art chips. DoD requires an \n     industry with technology leadership, not just its own \n     short term supply fix.\n       Encourage tax incentives for U.S. investment. As the next \n     generation of chip fabrication facilities can cost at least \n     $3 billion per plant, the manufacturing sector will require \n     assistance in acquiring the investment capital necessary to \n     develop the manufacturing capabilities for cutting edge \n     semiconductor chips. DoD and the intelligence agencies should \n     work with industry and propose targeted tax incentives, \n     possibly in coordination with state and local government \n     financing, to assist in meeting these investment costs. As \n     noted above, these efforts cannot be delayed into the out-\n     years, as time is of the essence.\n       Increase Science and Engineering Graduates. The \n     unprecedented technical challenges faced by the industry will \n     require technically trained talent to provide solutions to \n     these problems. In order to effectively compete against the \n     concerted effort by the Chinese to capture the semiconductor \n     industry, it will be necessary to counter the growing \n     disparity of trained talent in both physical sciences and \n     engineering between East Asia and the U.S. Incentives need to \n     be created for increasing university student training in \n     these fields, in particular, of students who are U.S. \n     citizens. The training over the past two decades of East \n     Asian students in American universities, who increasingly \n     return to their country of origin, is a partial cause of the \n     present situation. Additionally, efforts need to be \n     undertaken to encourage their retention in the U.S. Overall, \n     DoD should focus on programs that increase the number of \n     science and engineering graduates at the B.S. and M.S. level \n     needed to provide the technical capabilities for the \n     semiconductor industry.\n       Increases in Federal Funds for Research and Development \n     (R&D). Levels of federal funding in the U.S. for research on \n     microelectronics have been steadily decreasing, while at the \n     same time, competitors in Asia and Europe have dramatically \n     expanded public support for semiconductor R&D. This decline \n     in U.S. research support is of particular concern because the \n     industry is increasingly addressing extremely complex \n     technical challenges for which no solution is readily \n     apparent. The following points highlight this need for \n     restoration of funding and describe possible steps that could \n     be taken:\n       a. DARPA's annual funding of microelectronics research and \n     development--the principle channel of direct federal \n     financial support in this area--has declined since 1999, and \n     is projected to decline further. DoD should consider \n     restoring this funding.\n       b. SEMATECH, the private industry partnership with \n     government which was created to help revive the weakened U.S. \n     industry in 1987 through collaborative research and pooled \n     manufacturing knowledge, was provided with government funds \n     of $100 million per year, fully matched by industry funds. \n     Since 1996, SEMATECH has no longer received any government \n     fundings. Originally an entirely U.S. endeavor, SEMATECH has \n     now had to become ``international'' to remain in operation, \n     thereby destroying its original U.S.-centric focus. DoD \n     should consider alternative mechanisms for cooperative R&D \n     efforts with industry in critical research areas.\n       c. In the current harsh financial climate of the U.S. high-\n     tech industry, the private sector will not be able to \n     continue an adequate investment in research and development--\n     there have in fact been widespread anecdotal report of major \n     decreases in R&D efforts in the U.S. commercial electronics \n     industry. The need is developing for processors based on the \n     next generation of silicon chip technology (referred to as \n     the ``90 nanometer'' generation), and the U.S. could find \n     itself without a domestic manufacturing base, as the research \n     for that technology generation should be under way now. The \n     area of non-silicon semiconductors, which offer a level of \n     speed performance exceeding that of silicon components, is \n     clearly under-funded. For example, research is needed on \n     nano-electronics, such as alternatives to silicon CMOS \n     through nanotubes and nanowires. This technology will be \n     important for next-generation military communications and \n     radar systems (operating in consort with advanced silicon \n     processor chips). Here too, the DoD must find ways to assist \n     the U.S. non-silicon semiconductor manufacturing based by \n     further encouraging R&D appropriate to DoD requirements.\n       d. I urge the Department and intelligence agencies to \n     support increased government funding for R&D of advanced chip \n     technologies and also to support the development of new DoD-\n     specfic chip designs within the aerospace industry, which, \n     like the fabs, are losing their capabilities as the chip \n     designs themselves are increasingly conducted overseas. DoD's \n     decades-long role in the support of such research has \n     diminished in recent years. Rejuvenation of this long-\n     standing DoD role in advanced R&D would help to assure that \n     U.S. industry, to the extent that it can be retained, will \n     lead the future shifts to the most advanced chip technology \n     which DoD will need.\n       Cooperative Research Programs. Programs such as the Focus \n     Research Center Program (FRCP) under the Microelectronics \n     Advanced Research Corporation (MARCO) seek to overcome the \n     growing challenges companies face in advancing \n     microelectronics technologies through government-industry \n     partnerships that focus on cutting-edge research deemed \n     critical to the continued growth of the industry. The \n     government's share of funding (25 percent) of this \n     cooperative program has been supported through the \n     Government-Industry Co-sponsoring of University Research \n     (GICUR) program within the Office of Secretary of Defense. \n     The funding targets for this program as outlined in the \n     original ramp-up plan have not been met. In fact, this \n     program has been zeroed out of the administration's FY 2004 \n     budget. DoD should ensure that funding levels for this vital \n     area of government-industry collaborative research be \n     properly supported, and that when U.S. universities are the \n     recipients of such funding, the training of U.S. citizens (in \n     contrast to foreign students) is strongly emphasized.\n       Survey of Trade Practices. DoD should survey all possible \n     technologies that the Chinese government may be targeting for \n     subsidies that would assist in the transfer of U.S. chip-\n     making and related fields to China, and then develop a list \n     of those subsidies that are in violation of GATT trade rules \n     and seek USTR action For those that are not in violation but \n     nonetheless create a competitive ``edge'' for China, the \n     Department and the intelligence agencies will need to develop \n     counter strategies. The focus should aid to strengthen the \n     entire electronics and IT ``food chain''--from semiconductor \n     manufacturing equipment to semiconductors to computers and \n     systems. This will require broad interagency coordination and \n     cooperation. It would probably be necessary to form such a \n     ``tiger team'' immediately, and to provide that team with the \n     authority and resources to act to stem the deterioration of \n     our defense-critical on-shore infrastructure.\n       The Semiconductor Equipment and Materials Industry. Over \n     the last decade a fair fraction of U.S. semiconductor tooling \n     and equipments capability has migrated off shore. This has \n     been particularly true of the ``high technology'' end of the \n     business--advanced lithography. The migration has had a \n     significant impact on our ability to guide and direct \n     development in the chip economy as a whole. For example, when \n     ASML (a Dutch firm) tool over SVG-L (our last cutting edge \n     lithography stepper supplier) the personnel base at the \n     former SVG-L site, in part because of the recession, was \n     reduced, and some advanced product development shifted to \n     Europe. Along with the sale of SVG-L, Tinsley, an SVG-L \n     subsidiary, which is the world's premier supplier of aspheric \n     optical components widely used in defense surveillance \n     systems, was also conveyed to ASML. Lithography patent \n     battles that could affect sales and services to U.S. chip \n     makers using equipment from either of these companies are \n     continuing. As another example, it is generally accepted \n     throughout the industry that the photomask is a key gating \n     element in semiconductor development today, and that mask \n     development is one of the largest challenges currently facing \n     the industry. The cost of photomask infrastructure \n     development is currently outstripping available R&D resources \n     by a factor of 4 to 5. A recent SEMATECH study indicated the \n     shortfall at approximately $750 million. Outside the U.S., \n     this shortfall is being met with Government sponsored \n     development activities in hopes of taking over the market. A \n     small number of U.S. merchant mask companies are currently \n     spearheading an effort to establish a pre-competitive R&D \n     activity focused on U.S. mask infrastructure development. The \n     need, supported by SEMATECH, includes advanced tool \n     evaluation and development, along with materials, metrology, \n     and standards activities to improve future photomask \n     manufacturing capability. The goal is to accelerate leading \n     edge photomask infrastructure capability on-shore by building \n     on prior and current mask industry investments. DoD should \n     give full consideration to supporting this effort for a U.S. \n     mask consortium. Overall, the ``tiger team'' should survey \n     and make recommendations on what can be done to stimulate and \n     grow what is left of the on-shore semiconductor equipment \n     industry, including masks and lithography.\n\n\n                   necessity of comprehensive action\n\n       If DoD and the intelligence agencies lose commercial \n     advanced chip production capability, off of which they have \n     sharply leveraged over the past two decades to greatly reduce \n     their costs and to improve war-fighting capability, the \n     ability to benefit from such cost-saving relationships will \n     be permanently lost. DoD can attempt to achieve temporary \n     solutions, such as building its own next generation \n     government-owned chip fabrication facility, but this is \n     likely to be both expensive and ineffective. If the best \n     research and design capability shifts to China along with \n     manufacturing, this approach will not work past the next \n     generation or two of semiconductor chip production. In \n     addition, such temporary solutions are not only unworkable \n     over time if the U.S. wishes to retain the best capability \n     that is required for defense and intelligence needs, but will \n     be far more expensive than the solutions proposed above. This \n     is because the opportunity to leverage off the commercial \n     sector (an approach which the DoD and intelligence community \n     rely upon at present) for new advances and cost savings will \n     be lost. The U.S. policy goal should not be to seek to \n     prevent China from obtaining significant chip-making \n     capability in the very near future. That will happen. The \n     issue is whether the U.S. can improve its competitive \n     position and remove unfair distortions in order to retain \n     significant on-shore manufacturing capacity.\n\n\n                     conclusions and further action\n\n       A prompt, concerted effort by the defense and intelligence \n     community can reverse this trend of off-shore migration of \n     manufacturing, research and design that is now underway and \n     that will become essentially irreversible if no action is \n     taken in the next few months. I am requesting a report and \n     plan of action from DoD and the intelligence community, based \n     on the steps enumerated above, on how they will act to \n     prevent the national security damage that the loss of the \n     U.S. semiconductor industry will entail.\n       The loss goes beyond economics and security. What is at \n     stake here is our ability to be preeminent in the world of \n     ideas on which the semiconductor industry is based. Much of \n     applied physical science--optics, materials, science, \n     computer science, to name a few--will be practiced at foreign \n     centers of excellence. This stunning loss of intellectual \n     capability will impede our efforts in all areas of our \n     society.\n       I hope that by bringing attention to this matter, we can \n     avoid a potential national security crisis in terms of \n     reliable access to cutting edge technology necessary to the \n     critical defense needs of our country. We are being \n     confronted by one of the greatest transfers of critical \n     defense technologies ever organized by another government and \n     the time for action is overdue.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Joseph I.

Mr. President, Burma's brutal and illegitimate military \ngovernment committed yet another vicious atrocity last week when Aung \nSan Suu Kyi and many members of her democracy movement were suddenly \nassaulted by a paramilitary group. Some of her supporters were killed \nand many others were wounded. She herself was taken into so-called \n``protective custody'' by the regime but little more is known of her \nwhereabouts, her health, or the safety of the 20 or so people arrested \nwith her.\n  The violent repression of these democracy activists is another sad \nand infuriating example of the continuing efforts by the Burmese \ngovernment to block any genuine political reform in the country.\n  Only a year ago Suu Kyi was released from one of her numerous \noccasions of house arrest in Burma, this one lasting 19 months. Her \nrelease last spring came with the promise to release political \nprisoners and begin a new discussion with her party. That party, the \nNational League of Democracy, legitimately won power in a 1990 \nelection, but was denied the opportunity to take office in the \ngovernment crackdown that followed.\n  This cruel attack is another example of a corrupt government that \ncontinues to commit flagrant human rights violations against its \ncitizens, uses rape as a weapon of intimidation and torture against \nwomen, and forcibly enslaves child soldiers to fight their own people.\n  This new atrocity has outraged the world, and many governments have \ndenounced it. Stronger action by the international community is long \noverdue, and we must act as well.

Mr. President, Burma's brutal and illegitimate military government committed yet another vicious atrocity last week when Aung San Suu Kyi and many members of her democracy movement were suddenly assaulted by a paramilitary group. Some of her supporters were killed and many others were wounded. She herself was taken into so-called ``protective custody'' by the regime but little more is known of her whereabouts, her health, or the safety of the 20 or so people arrested with her.\n\tThe violent repression of these democracy activists is another sad and infuriating example of the continuing efforts by the Burmese government to block any genuine political reform in the country.\n\tOnly a year ago Suu Kyi was released from one of her numerous occasions of house arrest in Burma, this one lasting 19 months. Her release last spring came with the promise to release political prisoners and begin a new discussion with her party. That party, the National League of Democracy, legitimately won power in a 1990 election, but was denied the opportunity to take office in the government crackdown that followed.\n\tThis cruel attack is another example of a corrupt government that continues to commit flagrant human rights violations against its citizens, uses rape as a weapon of intimidation and torture against women, and forcibly enslaves child soldiers to fight their own people.\n\tThis new atrocity has outraged the world, and many governments have denounced it. Stronger action by the international community is long overdue, and we must act as well. Under S. 1182, the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, we call on the Burmese government to release Suu Kyi and her supporters immediately and with no additional harm. Our legislation will impose a total ban on import from Burma. It will freeze the Burmese government's assets in the United States. It will tighten the visa ban on their government officials.

Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in support of \nthe Holocaust Victims' Assets, Restitution Policy, and Remembrance Act.\n  We are motivated by a desire to achieve justice for Holocaust victims \nand their families, and we recognize that if such justice is to be \nattained, the United States must continue to lead the world by example.\n  The United States has provided leadership in this area ever since \nAmerican troops liberated the death camps. Most recently, the United \nStates has been the driving force behind international settlements with \nforeign governments, the Swiss banks, the European insurance companies, \nand German corporations that benefited from slave labor. This \nlegislation recognizes that the struggle for justice requires continued \nAmerican leadership and that the foundation is the appropriate \nmechanism for that leadership.\n  Justice is timeless, and it is time for us to take the necessary \nsteps and help Holocaust survivors reunite with their assets and \nbelongings. For many survivors and family members, a painting, a piece \nof furniture, or a family heirloom is the only remaining connection \nbetween them and their loved ones who died in the Holocaust. This \nlegislation is long overdue. I hope that it reunites many victims and \nfamilies with those items that have been missing for too many years, \nand a reunion like that would be a bittersweet kind of justice.\n  The purpose of this act is to create a public/private foundation to \nintegrate research that has been conducted by 23 international \ncommissions in the area of Holocaust-era assets, to complete the \nresearch agenda that arises from that synthesis, and stimulate the \ntransition to a contemporary restitution policy.\n  The foundation will be the single most effective facilitator of the \nidentification and return of Holocaust-era asserts to their rightful \nowners and heirs ever supported by the U.S. Government.\n  If the nations of the world are to be convinced of our lasting \ncommitment to justice for Holocaust victims and if continued work on \nHolocaust assets issues is to be truly effective, the foundation must \nhave the stamp of the Federal Government. But the Federal Government \ncannot, and should not, perform these tasks by itself.\n  It will coordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, State \ngovernments, the private sector, and individuals here, and abroad, to \nhelp people locate and identify assets who would\n\n[[Page S7472]]\n\notherwise have no ability to do so. It will encourage policymakers to \ndeal with contemporary restitution issues, including how best to treat \nunclaimed assets.\n  The foundation is authorized for 10 years, after which it will sunset \nand ``spin off'' its research results and materials to other \nappropriate public and private entities. It is able to accept private \nfunds as well as public dollars.\n  The commission identified a number of policy initiatives that require \nU.S. leadership. These initiatives included, but are not limited to the \nneed to: compile a report that integrates, synthesizes, and supplements \nthe research on Holocaust-era assets that has been conducted around the \nworld; review the degree to which other nations have implemented the \nprinciples adopted at various international conferences; work with \norganizations to provide for the coordinated and centralized \ndissemination of information about restitution programs; encourage the \ncreation and expansion of mechanisms, including Alternative Dispute \nResolution options, to assist claimants in obtaining the speedy \nresolution of their claims; and, support the establishment and \nmaintenance of a computerized and searchable database of Holocaust \nvictims' claims for the restitution of personal property.\n  The foundation will also encourage, and support, the efforts of State \ngovernments to facilitate the cross match of unclaimed property records \nwith lists of Holocaust victims. It will work with the museum community \nto further stimulate provenance research into European paintings and \nJudaica. It will promote and monitor the implementation by major \nbanking institutions of the agreement developed in conjunction with the \nNew York Bankers Association. Finally, it will work with the private \nsector to develop and promote common standards and best practices for \nresearch on Holocaust-era assets.\n  The impetus for the foundation comes from the work of the \nPresidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United \nStates chaired by Edgar M. Bronfman, Sr. The commission report, \n``Plunder and Restitution: The U.S. and Holocaust Victims' Assets,'' \nwas the most comprehensive examination ever conducted into how the \nFederal Government handled the assets of Holocaust victims that came \ninto its possession or control.\n  The Congress has dealt with Holocaust issues on a nonpartisan basis, \nand I am confident it will consider this bill in the same spirit.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's attention the exemplary achievements and outstanding service of Officer Clayton Harmston of the San Francisco Police Department.\n\tThe American Legion, Department of California has chosen Officer Clayton Harmston as its Law Enforcement Officer of the Year for Valor. Officer Harmston is receiving this award for the extraordinary heroism he displayed in the line of duty on July 7, 2002.\n\tOn that day, Officer Harmston and his partner stopped a vehicle that was operating in a suspicious manner. During the vehicle stop, Officer Harmston approached the passenger, who was just paroled from State prison. The passenger refused to submit to a search and immediately attacked Officer Harmston. A struggle ensued, Officer Harmston was knocked to the ground face-first, and then the parolee drew his loaded weapon on Officer Harmston. Although injured and dazed, Officer Harmston demonstrated great presence of mind and warned his partner of the gun. When Harmston's partner distracted the parolee, Officer Harmston displayed remarkable courage by attempting to pull the gun away from the parolee. During the struggle, the parolee shot Officer Harmston who was able to roll away to cover, where a gun battle began. The gunman was struck and fell to the ground, refusing to release his weapon until it was taken from his grip.\n\tOfficer Clayton Harmston, despite his injuries, used all his abilities and resources to protect his partner and ultimately end this dangerous situation. Officer Harmston is an inspiration to all. It is because of the courage and valor of police officers such as Clayton Harmston that our streets are safer.\n\tCalifornians are extremely proud of Officer Harmston. He is most deserving of the American Legion, Department of California's Law Enforcement Officer of the Year for Valor award and of the admiration that he receives from colleagues and friends. I am honored to pay tribute to him, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in wishing Officer Harmston much continued success in his law enforcement career.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Barbara Boxer"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "149 Cong.

A bill to expand and enhance postbaccalaureate opportunities \nat Hispanic-serving institutions, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN: Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nTexas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to introduce the Next Generation \nHispanic-Serving Institution Act. This bill will strengthen provisions \nin Title V of the Higher Education Act, HEA, by providing our Hispanic-\nServing Institutions with both graduate opportunities and reductions in \nregulatory barriers.\n  According to the 2000 census Hispanics make up 12.5 percent of the \nAmerican population. Currently Hispanics constitute 10 percent of the \ncollege enrollment. By 2050 the Hispanic population will grow to 25 \npercent. It is in our national interest to ensure that this population \nis well educated so that they will be ready to take their place as \nprofessionals, scientists, inventors, and well-informed citizens.\n  Hispanic-Serving Institutions, HSIs, serve students of all \nbackgrounds and ethnicities in 13 States. Colleges and universities \nbecome eligible for HSI status if at least 50 percent of their student \npopulation receives need-based financial assistance, 25 percent is \nHispanic, and 50 percent of their Hispanic population is low-income. It \nis at these HSIs that the largest growth in advanced degrees awarded to \nHispanics is occurring. Between 1991 and 2000 the number of Hispanic \nstudents earning master's degrees at HSIs grew 136 percent and the \nnumber of receiving doctoral degrees grew by 85 percent. Currently over \n25 percent of the Hispanics who obtained these degrees did so at HSIs. \nAs a nation, we need to expand the capacity of Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions, support their undergraduate programs, and encourage them \nto offer quality graduate and professional degree programs.\n  The Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institution Act will strengthen \nour Hispanic-Serving Institutions by: Establishing a competitive grant \nprogram for HSIs to support their masters and doctoral degree programs. \nEliminating the current requirement for HSIs to show that 50 percent of \ntheir Hispanic population is low-income. This requirement is difficult \nfor the institutions to meet because they cannot collect the necessary \nstudent data. Eliminating the 2-year wait-out period between HSI grants \nallowing continuous funding of existing programs. Adding, as an \nauthorized activity, programs that support student transfers from 2-\nyear to 4-year institutions. Raising the funding for the Title V HSI \ngrant program to $175,000,000. Allocating $125,000,000 for a new grant \nprogram to support HSI masters and doctoral programs.\n  The State of New Mexico houses 19 HSIs within its border. The New \nMexico HSIs serve the entire State and their student populations are \nvery diverse. Over the years these 19 institutions have worked \ndiligently to educate and support all students. They have graduated \noutstanding teachers, scientists, and other professionals. The Next \nGeneration Hispanic-Serving Institution Act supports the valuable work \nthat these and all other HSIs are currently doing and gives them new \nresources they need to expand their offerings.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore Federal remedies for infringements of \nintellectual property by States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in June 1999, the United States Supreme \nCourt issued a pair of decisions that altered the legal landscape with \nrespect to intellectual property. I am referring to Florida Prepaid v. \nCollege Savings Bank and its companion case, College Savings Bank v. \nFlorida Prepaid. The Court ruled in these cases that States and their \ninstitutions cannot be held liable for damages for patent infringement \nand other violations of the Federal intellectual property laws, even \nthough they can and do enjoy the full protection of those laws for \nthemselves.\n  Both Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank were decided by the \nsame five-to-four majority of the justices. This slim majority of the \nCourt threw out three Federal statutes that Congress passed, \nunanimously, in the early 1990s, to reaffirm that the Federal patent, \ncopyright, and trademark laws apply to everyone, including the States.\n  I believe that there is an urgent need for Congress to respond to the \nFlorida Prepaid decisions, for two reasons.\n  First, the decisions opened up a huge loophole in our Federal \nintellectual property laws. If we truly believe in fairness, we cannot \ntolerate a situation in which some participants in the intellectual \nproperty system get legal\n\n[[Page S7480]]\n\nprotection but need not adhere to the law themselves. If we truly \nbelieve in the free market, we cannot tolerate a situation where one \nclass of market participants have to play by the rules and others do \nnot. As Senator Specter said in August 1999, in a floor statement that \nwas highly critical of the Florida Prepaid decisions, they ``leave us \nwith an absurd and untenable state of affairs,'' where ``States will \nenjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitors.''\n  The second reason why Congress should respond to the Florida Prepaid \ndecisions is that they raise broader concerns about the roles of \nCongress and the Court. Over the past decade, in a series of five-to-\nfour decisions that might be called examples of ``judicial activism,'' \nthe current Supreme Court majority has overturned Federal legislation \nwith a frequency unprecedented in American constitutional history. In \ndoing so, the Court has more often than not relied on notions of State \nsovereign immunity that have little if anything to do with the text of \nthe Constitution.\n  Some of us have liked some of the results; others have liked others; \nbut that is not the point. This activist Court has been whittling away \nat the legitimate constitutional authority of the federal government. \nAt the risk of sounding alarmist, this is the fact of the matter: We \nare faced with a choice. We can respond--in a careful and measured \nway--by reinstating our democratic policy choices in legislation that \nis crafted to meet the Court's stated objections. Or we can run away, \nabdicate our democratic policy-making duties to the unelected Court, \nand go down in history as the incredible shrinking Congress.\n  About four months after the Florida Prepaid decisions issued, I \nintroduced a bill that responded to those decisions. The Intellectual \nProperty Protection Restoration Act of 1999 was designed to restore \nFederal remedies for violations of intellectual property rights by \nstates. I have continued to refine this legislation over the years, and \nin February 2002, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held the \nCommittee's first hearing on the issue of sovereign immunity and the \nprotection of intellectual property.\n\n  Today, I am pleased to be introducing the Intellectual Property \nProtection Restoration Act of 2003, which builds on my earlier \nproposals and on the helpful comments I have received on those \nproposals from legal experts across the country. I am proud to have the \nHouse leaders on intellectual property issues, Representatives Smith \nand Berman, as the principal sponsors of the House companion bill.\n  This bill has the same common-sense goal as the three statutes that \nthe Supreme Court's decisions invalidated: To protect intellectual \nproperty rights fully and fairly. But the legislation has been re-\nengineered, after extensive consultation with constitutional and \nintellectual property experts, to ensure full compliance with the \nCourt's new jurisprudential requirements. As a result, the bill has \nearned the strong support of the U.S. Copyright Office and the \nendorsements of a broad range of organizations including the American \nBar Association, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, \nthe Business Software Alliance, the Intellectual Property Owners \nAssociation, the International Trademark Association, the Motion \nPicture Association of America, the Professional Photographers of \nAmerica Association, and the Chamber of Commerce.\n  In essence, our bill presents States with a choice. It creates \nreasonable incentives for States to waive their immunity in \nintellectual property cases, but it does not oblige them to do so. \nStates that choose not to waive their immunity within two years after \nenactment of the bill would continue to enjoy many of the benefits of \nthe Federal intellectual property system; however, like private parties \nthat sue States for infringement, States that sue private parties for \ninfringement could not recover any money damages unless they had waived \ntheir immunity from liability in intellectual property cases.\n  This arrangement is clearly constitutional. Congress may attach \nconditions to a State's receipt of Federal intellectual property \nprotection under its Article I intellectual property power just as \nCongress may attach conditions on a State's receipt of federal funds \nunder its Article I spending power. Either way, the power to attach \nconditions to the federal benefit is part of the greater power to deny \nthe benefit altogether. And no condition could be more reasonable or \nproportionate than the condition that in order to obtain full \nprotection for your federal intellectual property rights, you must \nrespect those of others.\n  I am encouraged by the Supreme Court's recent decision in Nevada \nDepartment of Human Resources v. Hibbs, which, although very narrow, \nsuggests that certain Justices may be starting to realize that the \nCourt has gone too far in sacrificing ordinary people's rights at the \naltar of sovereign immunity. By upholding the Family and Medical Leave \nAct as applied to the States, the Hibbs case also suggests that a very \ncarefully crafted law, which simply does what is necessary to protect \nimportant rights, will be upheld.\n  I hope we can all agree on the need to protect the rights of \nintellectual property owners. A recent GAO study confirmed that, as the \nlaw now stands, owners of intellectual property have few or no \nalternatives or remedies available against State infringers--just a \nseries of dead ends.\n  We need to assure American inventors and investors, and our foreign \ntrading partners, that as State involvement in intellectual property \nbecomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. intellectual \nproperty rights are backed by legal remedies. I want to emphasize the \ninternational ramifications here. American trading interests have been \nwell served by our strong and consistent advocacy of effective \nintellectual property protections in treaty negotiations and other \ninternational fora. Those efforts could be jeopardized by the loophole \nin U.S. intellectual property enforcement that the Supreme Court has \ncreated.\n  Senator Brownback made this point at a Judiciary Committee hearing on \nFebruary 27, 2002. He said, ``When states assert sovereign immunity for \nthe purpose of infringing upon intellectual property rights, it damages \nthe credibility of the United States internationally, and could \npossibly even lead to violations of our treaty obligations. Any \ndecrease in the level of enforcement of intellectual property rights \naround the world is likely to harm American businesses, because of our \nposition as international leaders in industries like pharmaceuticals, \ninformation technology, and biotechnology.''\n  The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act restores \nprotection for violations of intellectual property rights that may, \nunder current law, go unremedied. We unanimously passed more sweeping \nlegislation in the early 1990s, but were thwarted by the Supreme \nCourt's shifting jurisprudence. We should enact this legislation \nwithout further delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows.\n\n                                S. 1191\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Consumer and Small Business Energy \nCommission to assess and provide recommendations regarding recent \nenergy price spikes from the perspective of consumers and small \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consumer and \nSmall Business Energy Commission Act. I am pleased to have the support \nof the Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, in introducing this \nlegislation. This legislation will allow us to better understand the \ncauses of energy price spikes from the consumer and small business \nperspectives, and better address this pressing issue.\n  The Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act would establish \na Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission. The members would be \nappointed on a bipartisan basis by the Speaker and Minority Leader of \nthe House and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, as well \nas the President. The Commission would be comprised of representatives \nof consumer groups, the energy industry, small businesses, and the \nAdministration. The Commission will study the causes of energy price \nspikes and issue recommendations on how to avert price spikes in the \nfuture.\n  Sine 1990, residential heating oil, residential natural gas, \ncommercial natural gas, industrial natural gas, and gasoline have all \nhad significantly fluctuating prices. Gasoline price spikes have become \ncommonplace in the Midwest. Escalating home heating and cooling bills \nhave crippled family budgets in the Midwest and Northeast. Farmers and \nindustries dependent on natural gas for the production of fertilizer \nand other chemical products have also suffered economically. Most \nrecently, natural gas prices have skyrocketed and gasoline prices have \nshown little sign of falling from the historic highs of the past few \nmonths.\n  We need a comprehensive study of these problems. Some past studies \nhave assessed the long-range supply and demand for energy product. The \nFederal Trade Commission studied gasoline price spikes in the Midwest, \nand Senator Levin has embarked on a series of hearings exploring \ngasoline pricing issues. Other studies have investigated narrow or \nspecific abuses of market power in the energy industry, such as in \nCalifornia. The Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission will look \nat the entire picture, focusing on price fluctuations of all consumer \nenergy products. The list of potential causes that need to be studied \nincludes: insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery \ncapacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, possible regulation \nproblems, flawed deregulation, excessive consumption, over-reliance on \nforeign supplies, insufficient investment in research and development \nof alternative sources, opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and \nabuse of market power.\n  We need to give consumers and small businesses a voice. When \nconsumers go to pay their grocery bills, or their tuition bills, or \neven their residential electricity bills in most states, and when small \nbusinesses go to pay for raw materials, prices are fairly predictable. \nBut when they go to pay for their heating and cooling, natural gas, or \ngasoline, families and businesses face the frustrating reality of wild \nprice swings.\n  We need to bring consumers and small businesses to the table together \nwith representatives of the energy industry and government. We need \nthese groups to work collectively, and to consider the range of \npossible causes of energy price spikes.\n\n  A measure very similar to this bill enjoyed strong, bipartisan \nsupport last year, and passed as an amendment to the Senate energy bill \nby a vote of 69-30. The minor changes to this bill include adding \ndirect representation of small businesses to the Commission, expanding \nthe participation of Administration representatives in the study phase, \nand establishing an Executive Committee to expedite the issuance of the \nfinal report, which will include recommendations.\n  By enacting the Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act, we \nwill be able to better understand the causes of energy price spikes and \nhopefully avert them in the future. I urge my colleagues to join me as \na cosponsor of this important legislation.

A bill to provide for qualified withdrawals from the Capital \nConstruction Fund for fishermen leaving the industry and for the \nrollover of Capital Construction Funds to individual retirement plans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Capital \nConstruction Fund Qualified Withdrawal Act of 2003. My friends and \ncolleagues, Senator Smith and Senator Murray, join me in introducing \nthis important bill.\n  In January of 2000, a fishery disaster was declared by the Secretary \nof Commerce for the West Coast groundfish fishery. Due to major \ndeclines in fish population, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council \ndecreased groundfish catch quotas by 90 percent. Today, the groundfish \nfishery in Oregon and adjoining States in the Pacific Northwest \ncontinues to face daunting challenges as a result of this disaster. \nFishery income has dropped 55 percent and over a thousand fishers face \nbankruptcy. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has called for a 50 \npercent reduction in fishing capacity as part of their strategic plan \nfor the recovery of the fishery. This legislation supports this effort \nby reforming the Capital Construction Fund in a way that will ease the \ngroundfish fishers' transition away from fishing.\n  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, Merchant Marine Act of 1936, \namended 1969, 46 U.S.C. 1177, has been a way for fishers to accumulate \nfunds, free from taxes, for the purpose of buying or refitting fishing \nvessels. It was conceived at a time when the federal government wanted \nto help capitalize and expand American fishing fleets. The program was \na success: it led to a larger U.S. fishing fleet. However, fish \npopulations declined and the U.S. commercial fishing fleet is now over-\ncapitalized. The CCF's usefulness has not kept up with the times, and \nnow it exacerbates problems facing U.S. fisheries, including the West \nCoast groundfish fishery.\n  Now is the time to help fishers, who wish to do so, to leave the \nfleet.\n  In Oregon, the amounts in CCF accounts range from $10,000 to over \n$200,000. This legislation changes current law to allow fishers to \nremove money from their CCF for purposes other than buying new vessels \nor upgrading current vessels, without losing up to 70 percent of their \nCCF funds in taxes and penalties. This legislation changes the CCF so \nfishers who want to opt out of fishing are not penalized for doing so.\n  This bill takes a significant step towards helping fishermen and \nmaking the West Coast groundfish fishery and the commercial fishing \nindustry sustainable by amending the CCF to allow non-fishing uses of \ninvestments. This bill amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and the \nInternal Revenue Code to allow funds currently in the CCF to be rolled \nover into an IRA or other types of retirement accounts, or to be used \nfor the payment of an industry fee authorized by the fishery capacity \nreduction program, without adverse tax consequences to the account \nholders. This bill will also encourage innovation and conservation by \nallowing fishers to use funds deposited in a CCF to develop or purchase \nnew gear that reduces bycatch.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Ms. \n        Cantwell, and Mr. Domenici):\n  S. 1194. A bill to foster local collaborations which will ensure that \nresources are effectively and efficiently used within the criminal and \njuvenile justice systems; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators \nDomenici, Leahy, Grassley, and Cantwell, to introduce the ``Mentally \nIll Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003.'' This \nbipartisan measure would, among other things, create a program of \nplanning and implementation grants for communities so they may offer \nmore treatment and other services to mentally ill offenders. Under this \nbill, programs receiving grant funds would be operated collaboratively \nby both a criminal justice agency and a mental health agency.\n  The mentally ill population poses a particularly difficult challenge \nfor our criminal justice system. People afflicted with mental illness \nare incarcerated at significantly higher rates than the general \npopulation. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, while only \nabout five percent of the American population has a mental illness, \nabout 16 percent of the State prison population has such an illness. \nThe Los Angeles County Jail, for example,\n\n[[Page S7484]]\n\ntypically has more mentally ill inmates than any hospital in the \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, however, the reality of our criminal justice system is \nthat jails and prisons do not provide a therapeutic environment for the \nmentally ill and are unlikely to do so any time soon. Indeed, the \nmentally ill inmate often is preyed upon by other inmates or becomes \neven sicker in jail. Once released from jail or prison, many mentally \nill people end up on the streets. With limited personal resources and \nlittle or no ability to handle their illness alone, they often commit \nfurther offenses resulting in their re-arrest and re-incarceration. \nThis ``revolving door'' is costly and disruptive for all involved.\n  Although these problems tend to manifest themselves primarily within \nthe prison system, the root cause of our current situation is found in \nthe mental health system and its failure to provide sufficient \ncommunity-based treatment solutions. Accordingly, the solution will \nnecessarily involve collaboration between the mental health system and \ncriminal justice system. In fact, it also will require greater \ncollaboration between the substance abuse treatment and mental health \ntreatment communities, because many mentally ill offenders have a drug \nor alcohol problem in addition to their mental illness.\n  The purpose of the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime \nReduction Act'' is to foster exactly this type of collaboration at the \nFederal, State, and local levels. The bill provides incentives for the \ncriminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health, and substance abuse \ntreatment systems to work together at each level of government to \nestablish a network of services for offenders with mental illness. The \nbill's approach is unique, in that it not only would promote public \nsafety by helping curb the incidence of repeat offenders, but it also \nwould promote public health, by ensuring that those with a serious \nmental illness are treated as soon as possible and as efficiently and \neffectively as possible.\n  Among its major provisions, this legislation calls for the \nestablishment of a new competitive grant program, which would be housed \nat the U.S. Department of Justice, but administered by the Attorney \nGeneral with the active involvement of the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services. To ensure that collaboration occurs at the local level, \nthe bill would require that two entities jointly submit a single grant \napplication on behalf of a community.\n  Applications demonstrating the greatest commitment to collaboration \nwould receive priority for grant funds. If applicants can show that \ngrant funds would be used to promote public health, as well as public \nsafety, and if the program they propose would have the active \nparticipation of each joint applicant, and if their grant application \nhas the support of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, then it would receive priority for funding.\n  Additionally, the bill would permit grant funds to be used for a \nvariety of purposes, each of which embodies the goal of collaboration. \nFirst, grant funds may be used to provide courts with more options, \nsuch as specialized dockets, for dealing with the non-violent offender \nwho has a serious mental illness or a co-occurring mental illness and \ndrug or alcohol problem. Second, grant funds could be used to enhance \ntraining of mental health and criminal justice system personnel, who \nmust know how to deal appropriately with the mentally ill offender. \nThird, grant funds could be devoted to programs that divert the \ncriminal justice system into treatment those non-violent offenders with \nsevere and persistent mental illness. Finally, correctional facilities \nmay use grant funds to promote the treatment of inmates and ease their \ntransition back into the community upon release from jail or prison.\n  In specifically authorizing grant funds to be used to promote more \noptions for courts to deal with mentally ill offenders, this bill \nbuilds on legislation that I introduced two years ago with my colleague \nfrom Ohio, Congressman Ted Strickland. That measure, which became law, \nauthorized $10 million per year for the establishment of more mental \nhealth courts. I have long supported mental health courts, which enable \nthe criminal justice system to provide an individualized treatment \nsolution for a mentally ill offender, while also requiring \naccountability of the offender. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday would make possible the creation or expansion of more mental \nhealth courts, and it also would promote the funding of treatment \nservices that support such courts.\n  In addition to making planning and implementation grants available to \ncommunities, the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction \nAct'' also calls for an Interagency Task Force to be established at the \nfederal level. This Task Force would include the Attorney General and \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of \nEducation, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Commissioner of \nSocial Security. The Task Force would be charged with identifying new \nways that federal departments can work together to reduce recidivism \namong mentally ill adults and juveniles.\n  Finally, the bill would direct the Attorney General and Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services to develop a list of ``best practices'' for \ncriminal justice personnel to use when diverting mentally ill offenders \nfrom the criminal justice system.\n  Ultimately, this is a good bill and one that is long overdue. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this important legislative measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mentally Ill Offender \n     Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16 \n     percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and \n     prisons have a mental illness.\n       (2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, approximately 20 percent of youth in \n     the juvenile justice system have serious mental health \n     problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental \n     health and substance abuse disorders.\n       (3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally \n     Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious \n     mental illness will come into contact with the American \n     criminal justice system at some point in their lives.\n       (4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into \n     contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the \n     diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional \n     disorder.\n       (5) A significant proportion of adults with a serious \n     mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice \n     system are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness; and \n     many of these individuals are arrested and jailed for minor, \n     nonviolent offenses.\n       (6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or \n     emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or \n     juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and \n     psychological interventions that integrate treatment, \n     rehabilitation, and support services.\n       (7) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance \n     abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure \n     the provision of services for those with mental illness or \n     co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can \n     reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile \n     corrections facilities, while providing improved public \n     safety.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to increase public safety by \n     facilitating collaboration among the criminal justice, \n     juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance \n     abuse systems. Such collaboration is needed to--\n       (1) reduce rearrests among adult and juvenile offenders \n     with mental illness, or co-occurring mental illness and \n     substance abuse disorders;\n       (2) provide courts, including existing and new mental \n     health courts, with appropriate mental health and substance \n     abuse treatment options;\n       (3) maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution through \n     diversion in appropriate cases involving non-violent \n     offenders with mental illness;\n       (4) promote adequate training for criminal justice system \n     personnel about mental illness and substance abuse disorders \n     and the appropriate responses to people with such illnesses;\n       (5) promote adequate training for mental health treatment \n     personnel about criminal\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\n     offenders with mental illness and the appropriate response to \n     such offenders in the criminal justice system;\n       (6) promote communication between criminal justice or \n     juvenile justice personnel, mental health treatment \n     personnel, nonviolent offenders with mental illness, and \n     other support services such as housing, job placement, \n     community, and faith-based organizations; and\n       (7) promote communication, collaboration, and \n     intergovernmental partnerships among municipal, county, and \n     State elected officials with respect to mentally ill \n     offenders.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I have joined today with Senators DeWine, \nGrassley, Cantwell, and Domenici to introduce legislation that will \nhelp State and local governments reduce crime by providing more \neffective treatment for the mentally ill. All too often, people with \nmental illness rotate repeatedly between the criminal justice system \nand the streets of our communities, committing a series of minor \noffenses. Law enforcement officers' ever scarcer time is being occupied \nby these offenders, who divert them from their more urgent \nresponsibilities. Meanwhile, offenders find themselves in prisons or \njails, where little or no appropriate medical care is available for \nthem. This bill give State and local governments the tools to break \nthis cycle, for the good of law enforcement, corrections officers, the \npublic's safety, and mentally ill offenders.\n  I held a Judiciary Committee hearing last June on the criminal \njustice system and mentally ill offenders. At that\n\n[[Page S7487]]\n\nhearing, we heard from State mental health officials, law enforcement \nofficers, corrections officials, and the representative of counties \naround our Nation. All agreed that people with untreated mental illness \nare more likely to commit crimes, and that our State mental health \nsystems, prisons and jails do not have the resources they need to treat \nthe mentally ill, and prevent crime and recidivism. As this \nlegislation's findings detail, more than 16 percent of adults \nincarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness, about 20 \npercent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental \nhealth problems, and up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a \nserious mental illness will come into contact with the American \ncriminal justice system at some point in their lives. This is a serious \nproblem that I hear about often when I talk with law enforcement \nofficials and others in Vermont.\n  Under this bill, State and local governments can apply for funding to \na. create or expand mental health courts or other court-based programs, \nwhich can divert qualified offenders from prison to receive treatment; \nb. create or expand programs to provide specialized training for \ncriminal justice and mental health system personnel; c. create or \nexpand local treatment programs that serve individuals with mental \nillness or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders; \nand d. promote and provide mental health treatment for those \nincarcerated in or released from a penal or correctional institution.\n  This legislation brings together law enforcement, corrections, and \nmental health professionals--indeed, officials from each of these \nfields in Vermont have offered their advice and support in drafting \nthis bill. They know that the States have been dealing with the unique \nproblems created by mentally ill offenders for many years, and that a \nFederal response is overdue. I look forward to working with them, and \nwith Senator DeWine, Representative Ted Strickland, and other Members, \nto see this bill enacted this Congress.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be once again \nintroducing with Senator DeWine the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and \nCrime Reduction Act of 2003. This bipartisan bill authorizes the \nAttorney General to administer a grant program to assist communities in \nplanning and implementing services for mentally ill offenders. These \ngrants will increase public safety by fostering collaborative efforts \nby criminal justice, mental health, and substance abuse agencies. I \nhave seen these types of collaborative programs work in Iowa and I know \nthat they can work elsewhere.\n  We have an obligation to ensure that the public is protected from \nthese offenders who suffer from mental illness. The Bureau of Justice \nStatistics has reported that over 16 percent of adults incarcerated in \nU.S. jails and prison have a mental illness. In addition, the Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has reported that over 20 \npercent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental \nhealth problems. This grant program will help increase public safety, \nas well as reduce the number of mentally ill adults and juveniles \nincarcerated in correctional facilities.\n  These grant dollars may be used by States and localities to establish \nmental health courts or other diversion programs, create or expand \ncommunity-based treatment programs, provide in-jail treatment and \ntransitional services, and for training of criminal justice and mental \nhealth system employees. The state of Iowa and a number of its counties \nare already leading the way in finding creative and collaborative \nprograms to address the problems presented by these mentally ill \ncriminals. Working together, the criminal justice, mental health, and \nsubstance abuse professionals can make a difference in the lives of \nthis special class of offenders and also increase the safety of the \npublic.\n  I want to thank Senator DeWine for his leadership on this important \nissue. He has drafted a bill that reflects a common sense approach to a \nserious public safety issue. I also want to encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this important piece of legislation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator DeWine \nand Senator Patrick Leahy along with Senators Grassley and Domenici in \ncosponsoring this important legislation. This bill will take steps to \nreduce the prevalence of the mentally ill in the criminal justice \nsystem by providing more effective treatment. Forty percent of the \nmentally ill in this country come in contact with the criminal justice \nsystem, many for minor but repeated offenses. This wastes tremendous \nlaw enforcement resources that can be better focused on more urgent \nresponsibilities and results in many of the mentally ill sitting in \njail cells where little treatment is available to them. My State has \nalready taken some forward looking action in this area, and this \nlegislation is an important next step.\n  The Mentally Ill Crime Reduction Act of 2003 funds new grants that \nwill give States the tools they need to work collaboratively to break \nthe cycle of mentally ill people repeatedly moving through the \ncorrections system. This legislation will allow more jurisdictions to \nfollow Seattle's lead in creating mental health courts that monitor \nindividuals to keep them in treatment and out of jail. It will provide \nmuch needed funding to mental health and substance abuse programs, and \nit will provide critical dollars for treatment of those incarcerated in \nor released from prisons. The legislation has the support of Washington \nState Corrections Director Joe Lehman and the Washington Department of \nSocial and Health Services as well as the National Alliance for the \nMentally Ill and the Council of State Governments. I'd like to \nespecially thank the Bazelon Center for its work in this area.\n  Last year, the Council on State Governments Criminal Justice/Mental \nHealth Consensus Project issued a report that detailed the imbalance of \nthe mentally ill in the criminal justice system. The Project found \nthat, while those suffering from serious mental illness represent \napproximately five percent of the population of this country, they \nrepresent over 16 percent of the prison population. Of that 16 percent, \nnearly three-quarters also have a substance abuse problem, and nearly \nhalf were incarcerated for committing a nonviolent crime. In some \njurisdictions recidivism rates for mentally ill inmates can reach over \n70 percent. Police, judges and prosecutors are usually without options \nof what to do with mentally ill patients, given the lack of health \nservices, and thus many end up in jail for minor crimes. The Los \nAngeles County Jail alone holds as many as 3,300 individuals with \nmental illness, more than any state hospital or mental health \ninstitution in the United States.\n  Each time a mentally ill individual is incarcerated, his or her \nmental condition will likely worsen. Once incarcerated, people with \nmental illness are particularly susceptible to harming themselves or \nothers. This environment exacerbates their mental illness, yet access \nto effective counseling or medication is severely limited. This in turn \nbrings on depression or delusions that immobilize them; many have spent \nyears trying to mask torments or hallucinations with alcohol or drugs \nand on average spend more time in prisons.\n  This problem is particularly acute in the area of juvenile offenders. \nThe Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reports that \nover 20 percent of children in the juvenile justice system, over \n155,000, have serious mental health problems. This bill creates \nspecialized training programs for juvenile and criminal justice agency \npersonnel in identifying symptoms of mentally ill individuals that will \nhelp identify and treat juveniles at an earlier stage.\n\n  The prevalence of people with mentally illness in the criminal \njustice system comes at a high price to taxpayers. In King County, WA, \nofficials identified 20 people who had been repeatedly hospitalized, \njailed or admitted to detoxification centers. These emergency services \ncost the county approximately $1.1 million in a single year. In \ncontrast, an Illinois Cooperative Program which brought criminal \njustice and mental health service personnel together to provide \nservices to those mentally ill patients released from jail calculated \nthat the 30 individuals in the study spend approximately 2,200 days \nless in jail, and 2,100 fewer days, in hospitals than they had the \nprevious year, for a savings of $1.2 million dollars.\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\n  In 1997, Seattle Fire Department Captain Stanley Stevenson was \nmurdered by an individual who had been found incompetent by the local \nmunicipal court but was released because of the lack of alternative \noptions. This murder was the impetus for the creation of a Task Force \nthat led directly to the formation of the King County Mental Health \nCourt in 1999. The primary reason why this Court has been growing more \neffective in dealing with mentally ill offenders is that it has \nincreased cooperation between the mental health and criminal justice \nsystems, institutions that have traditionally not worked closely \ntogether. Building on the model of the drug court, the mental health \ncourt closely monitors compliance with treatment regimens by assembling \na team proficient in dealing with the mentally ill and at using the \nstick of the criminal justice system to make that treatment work. The \nvast majority of these mentally ill individuals are responsive to \ntreatment.\n  This program has progressed well and is becoming an effective means \nof helping mentally ill offenders, assuring public safety, and running \na more cost efficient system. Yet to allow this system to continue to \nexpand in Seattle and other communities in Washington State, as well as \nto allow other States to begin using these types of programs, federal \ngrant funding is critical. That is what this bill provides.\n  Collaboration between mental health, substance abuse, law \nenforcement, judicial, and other criminal justice personnel is also \ncritical to the success of our mental health court program in Seattle. \nIt is only through full coordination between the criminal justice and \nthe mental health treatment community at the Federal and the local \nlevel that these efforts will be successful.\n  Similarly, only through full coordination at the Federal and local \nlevel will this bill be able to make a critical difference. I believe \nthat some additional improvements can be made to strengthen that \ncritical coordination and I look forward to working with Senator DeWine \nand Senator Leahy to accomplish that goal. I welcome the introduction \nof this legislation and look forward to working with my cosponsors to \nmake this bill law in the next Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL  (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        McCain, Mr. Frist, Mr. Alexander, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Bunning, \n        Mr. Smith, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1195. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nclarify that inpatient drug prices charged to certain public hospitals \nare included in the best price exemptions for the medicaid drug rebate \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Bingaman, \nRockefeller, McCain, Frist, Alexander, Lincoln, Bunning, Smith, Bob \nGraham, Santorum, Kerry, Kennedy and Hatch to introduce a modest but \nimportant piece of legislation, the Safety Net Hospital Pharmacy Access \nAct. This legislation would correct a small error in current law that \nprohibits safety-net hospitals from being able to negotiate with \npharmaceutical companies for the lowest prices they can get.\n  Let me provide some background on this problem. In 1990, Congress \nestablished the Medicaid drug-rebate program to ensure that the \nMedicaid program pays no more than a pharmaceutical manufacturer's \n``best price'' for a covered outpatient drug. So whatever was the \nlowest price the manufacturer offered to anyone, this becomes the price \nMedicaid pays under this ``best price'' rule.\n  Unfortunately, this rule provides an incentive for pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers not to offer deep discounts to anyone, given that these \nprices may become the new price that Medicaid pays. Given this, in 1992 \nCongress exempted some organizations from the Medicaid best price \ncalculations so that pharmaceutical manufacturers would offer them \nlower drug prices. These organizations include the VA, the Department \nof Defense, and section 340B covered entities. These 340B hospitals are \nso called because they fall under section 340B of the Public Health \nServices Act, which defines 12 categories of publicly funded safety net \nproviders. There are approximately 160 hospitals in the country that \nfall under the 340B program. These hospitals often bear the burden of \nproviding a substantial amount of uncompensated care in dealing with \nthe indigent or the uninsured.\n  Unfortunately, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services \ninterpreted the 1992 law as only applying to outpatient drugs purchased \nby these entities. Therefore, drugs purchased for inpatient use at the \n340B hospitals are covered by the Medicaid best price rule. This means \nthese hospitals actually pay more for these drugs than for drugs that \nthey can negotiate their own prices for in the outpatient setting. The \nlegislation I am introducing today corrects this problem by allowing \nthe 340B hospitals to also negotiate for lower drug prices in the \ninpatient setting.\n  This is an important correction since these hospitals are often \nproviding free care to the indigent and the uninsured. And let me be \nclear that this legislation would not require pharmaceutical companies \nto provide discounts to these hospitals. All this legislation would do \nis allow the hospitals to negotiate for lower prices. However, in my \ndiscussion with representatives of hospitals that would be affected by \nthis law, they believe they would be able to save money.\n  For instance, the Maricopa County hospital, which is the public \nhospital for the city of Phoenix, believes that it could save up to $1 \nmillion a year. Since this hospital constantly runs in the red because \nof the massive amount of uncompensated care it is required under \nfederal law to provide, such savings would be very helpful.\n  I want to thank the bill's cosponsors. I also want to urge my \ncolleagues to take a close look at this important legislation. I am \ngoing to work to see that it is passed this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1196. A bill to eliminate the marriage penalty permanently in \n2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to \nprovide permanent tax relief from one of the most egregious, anti-\nfamily aspects of the tax code--the marriage penalty. Relieving \nAmerican taxpayers of this burden has been one of my highest priorities \nas a U.S. Senator.\n  Last week President Bush signed into law a $350 billion jobs and \neconomic growth package to put Americans back to work and stimulate the \neconomy. The bill provides immediate marriage penalty relief by \nenlarging the standard deduction and the 15 percent tax bracket for \nmarried couples filing jointly to twice that as for single filers. This \nprovision will save 34 million married couples an average of $589 this \nyear alone.\n  Enacting marriage penalty relief is a giant step for tax fairness, \nbut it may be fleeting. The Jobs and Growth Act was just signed, but \neven as the ink dries a tax increase on married couples looms in the \nnear future. Since the bill was restricted by artificial limitations to \n$350 billion, the marriage penalty provisions will only be in effect \nfor two years. In 2005, marriage will again be a taxable event for \nmillions of Americans. Similar restrictions were placed on the 2001 tax \ncut, so, while relief will be phased in by 2009, it will disappear for \ngood in 2011 unless we act decisively.\n  Millions of couples across America will be penalized once more by our \ntax code simply because they are married. Without marriage penalty \nrelief, 48 percent of married couples will again pay the government an \naverage $1,400 more in taxes.\n  Given the state of the economy and the difficulty many families face \nin making ends meet, we must make sure we do not backtrack on this \nimportant reform.\n  Without marriage penalty relief, the tax code provides a significant \ndisincentive for people to walk down the aisle, and the benefits of \nmarriage are well established. Marriage is a fundamental institution in \nour society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living \nin a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\nto suffer from child abuse. Research indicates they are less likely to \nbe depressed or have developmental problems. Scourges such as \nadolescent drug use are less common in married families, and married \nmothers are less likely to be victims of domestic violence.\n  The bill I am offering would make the marriage penalty relief in the \nJobs and Growth Act permanent. It also will accelerate changes to the \nearned income tax credit that were passed in the 2001 tax reform bill. \nThis will reduce the marriage penalty on lower income couples.\n  We cannot be satisfied until couples never again must decide between \nlove and money. Marriage should not be a taxable event.\n  I call on the Senate to finish the job we started and say ``I do'' to \nproviding permanent marriage penalty relief today.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure the \nsafety and accuracy of medical imaging examinations and radiation \ntherapy treatments; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, imagine for a moment you have gone to the \ndoctor to have a medical condition evaluated. Uncertain as to what your \ninjury may be, your doctor sends you to a specialist for a medical \nimaging examination to determine the extent of your injury and the \nproper course of treatment for it.\n  Or, imagine, having heard the dreaded diagnosis of cancer, going to \nthe same facility for radiation therapy.\n  In either case, our sense of concern and anxiety about our medical \ncondition will serve to focus our attention on ourselves, and not on \nthe caregivers providing us with the treatment we need to recover, or \nin the case of cancer, to survive.\n  But, what would you say if you knew that the individual helping to \ndirect your diagnosis or the one providing your course of treatment is \nsomeone who has done nothing more to earn his credentials than spend a \nfew weeks getting some on the job training.\n  Imagine how you would feel and the level of trust you would have in a \nsystem that allowed such a thing to happen.\n  Unfortunately, that's an all too common occurrence with the present \nstate of our health care system.\n  But, it is a problem that we can solve with the passage of \nlegislation I am introducing today.\n  The Consumer Assurance of Radiological Excellence, RadCARE, Act will \nensure that there are coherent standards in place for those who plan \nand deliver radiation therapy treatments. I am pleased to be joined by \nmy distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, as well \nas Senators Daschle, Lautenberg, and Dorgan, in this effort, which will \nbring peace of mind and restore the confidence of the health consumer \nin the treatment they receive from those who perform radiologic \nprocedures. It will also increase awareness of the skills of these \nhealth care professionals and raise the level of visibility their \nprofession enjoys in the public eye.\n  It is important that we establish standards for personnel who perform \nradiologic procedures because physicians depend upon medical imaging \nexaminations to diagnose disease and identify and treat injuries of all \nkinds. The quality of a radiologic procedure hinges upon the expertise \nof the professionals who assist in administering them.\n  Currently, 15 States as well as the District of Columbia do not \nregulate or register radiologic personnel.\n  To address that lack of attention, the RadCARE Act will strengthen \nthe Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981. The \ncurrent law calls for States to establish voluntarily a set of \neducational and credentialing standards for radiologic and medical \nimaging personnel. Yet many States still do not have licensing laws in \nplace that meet the standards recommended by the Federal Government. \nThe RadCARE Act will require that radiologic and medical imaging \npersonnel meet a minimum credentialing standard.\n  The RadCARE Act will not affect states that have a suitable licensing \nsystem or those that have mandated higher standards than required by \nFederal law. If a state has no meaningful\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\nregulations or licensing system, however, then the Federal standards \nwill apply. The RadCARE Act also has a provision to ensure access to \nquality healthcare in rural regions where a one-size-fits all approach \nmay not be applicable. Enforcement of the RadCARE Act would be achieved \nby restricting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement to facilities that \nemploy personnel who meet the minimal federal standards.\n  The RedCARE Act will improve the safety of radiological procedures by \nreducing the risk of harmful overexposure to radiation. Healthcare \ncosts will also be lowered by decreasing the number of repeated \nprocedures due to personnel error. Additionally, the RadCARE Act will \nenable radiologists and other healthcare professionals to have access \nto quality information so that patients receive the best health care \npossible.\n  This legislation is supported by a variety of organizations concerned \nwith the quality of these procedures, including the American Society of \nRadiologic Technologists, the Society of Nuclear Medicine Technologist \nSection, the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists, the Nuclear \nMedicine Technology Certification Board, the Association of Vascular \nand Interventional Radiographers, and the other members of the Alliance \nfor Quality Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, which represents the \nmore than 275,000 medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals \nin the United States.\n  When it comes right down to it, it's a big enough battle to fight the \ncancers or the injuries to our bodies that require such invasive \ntreatments or diagnosis. We shouldn't have to worry about the level of \ncompetence of those who are providing us with the services we so \ndesperately require for the maintenance of our health.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and passing this much \nneeded legislation. It respects the power of the states who have \naddressed this problem as it provides minimum standards for those who \nhave not.\n  More importantly, its enactment into law will do a great deal to \nincrease the level of confidence of the American health consumer in our \nhealthcare system.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Assurance of \n     Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 300,000,000 medical imaging examinations and \n     radiation therapy treatments are administered annually in the \n     United States.\n       (2) Seven out of every 10 Americans undergo a medical \n     imaging examination or radiation therapy treatment every year \n     in the United States.\n       (3) The administration of medical imaging examinations and \n     radiation therapy treatments and the effect on individuals of \n     such procedures have a substantial and direct effect upon \n     public health and safety and upon interstate commerce.\n       (4) It is in the interest of public health and safety to \n     minimize unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to radiation \n     due to the performance of medical imaging and radiation \n     therapy procedures by personnel lacking appropriate education \n     and credentials.\n       (5) It is in the interest of public health and safety to \n     have a continuing supply of adequately educated persons and \n     appropriate accreditation and certification programs \n     administered by State governments.\n       (6) Persons who perform or plan medical imaging or \n     radiation therapy, including those employed at Federal \n     facilities or reimbursed by Federal health programs, should \n     be required to demonstrate competence by reason of education, \n     training, and experience.\n       (7) The protection of public health and safety from \n     unnecessary or inappropriate medical imaging and radiation \n     therapy procedures and the assurance of efficacious \n     procedures are the responsibilities of both the State and the \n     Federal Governments.\n       (8) Facilities that conduct medical imaging or radiation \n     therapy engage in and affect interstate commerce. Patients \n     travel regularly across State lines to receive medical \n     imaging services or radiation therapy. Facilities that \n     conduct medical imaging or radiation therapy engage \n     technicians, physicians, and other staff in an interstate \n     market, and purchase medical and other supplies in an \n     interstate market.\n       (9) In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient \n     Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35) \n     which established minimum Federal standards for the \n     accreditation of education programs for persons who perform \n     or plan medical imaging examinations and radiation therapy \n     treatments and for the certification of such persons. The Act \n     also provided the States with a model State law for the \n     licensing of such persons.\n       (10) Twenty-two years after the enactment of the Consumer-\n     Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981--\n       (A) 13 States do not require licensure of any kind for \n     persons who perform or plan medical imaging examinations and \n     radiation therapy treatments;\n       (B) 37 States license, regulate, or register radiographers;\n       (C) 28 States license radiation therapists;\n       (D) 22 States license nuclear medicine technologists;\n       (E) 8 States license or require board certification of \n     medical physicists; and\n       (F) no States regulate or license medical dosimetrists.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure the accreditation of education programs for, \n     and the licensure or certification of, persons who perform, \n     plan, evaluate, or verify patient dose for medical imaging \n     examinations and radiation therapy treatments; and\n       (2) to ensure the safety and accuracy of medical imaging \n     examinations and radiation therapy treatments.\n\n     SEC. 3. QUALITY OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION THERAPY.\n\n       Part F of title III of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 262 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n           ``Subpart 4--Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy\n\n     ``SEC. 355.

A bill to establish the Child Care Provider Development and \nRetention Grant Program, the Child Care Provider Scholarship Program, \nand a program of child care provider health benefits coverage, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Focus on \nCommitted and Underpaid Staff for Children's Sake Act. I am pleased \nthat Senators Kennedy, Murray, and Bingaman are joining me as original \ncosponsors and that companion legislation is being introduced in the \nHouse today by Representatives George Miller and Patrick Kennedy.\n  The need for child care has become a daily fact of life for millions \nof parents nationwide. Sixty-five percent of mothers with children \nunder age six and 78 percent of mothers with children ages 6 to 13 are \nin the labor force. Each day, 13 million preschool children, including \n6 million infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day in child \ncare.\n  The quality of that care has a tremendous impact on the critical \nearly years of children's development. And, the most powerful \ndeterminant of the quality of child care is the training, education, \nand pay of those who spend 8-10 hours a day caring for our children.\n  Yet, what we know about the child care field is alarming. Despite the \nfact that continuity of care is critical for the emotional development \nof children, staff turnover at child care centers averages 30 percent \nper year--four times greater than the turnover rate for elementary \nschool teachers.\n  We as a society say there is no more important task than helping to \nraise a child. Yet, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we pay \nthe average child care worker about $16,500 a year--barely above the \npoverty level for a family of three. Few child care providers have \nbasic benefits like health coverage or paid leave. Only a small \nfraction of child care workers have graduated from college.\n  We pay people millions of dollars a year to throw baseballs, to shoot \nbasketballs and to swing golf clubs. What does that say about our \npriorities when at the same time we pay those who care for our most \nprecious resource--our children--poverty-level wages?\n  A report by the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for \nChild Care Workforce on child care providers' pay, training and \neducation highlighted the current crisis in the child care field. In a \nsurvey of child care centers in three California communities, the study \nfound that three-quarters of all child care staff employed in 1996 were \nno longer on the job in 2000. Some centers reported 100 percent \nturnover. Additionally, nearly half of the child care providers who had \nleft had a Bachelor's degree, compared to only one-third of the new \nteachers. Some 49 percent, nearly half, of those who had left their \njob, left the child care field entirely.\n  It's clear that if we want to attract quality teachers to the child \ncare field, the pay has to better reflect the value we place on their \nwork. We can't attract them and we can't keep them if we don't pay them \na living wage.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide states with funds \nto increase child care worker pay based on the level of education--the \ngreater the level of education, the greater the increase in pay. In \naddition, the legislation will provide scholarships of up to $1,500 for \nchild care workers who want to further their early childhood education \ntraining by getting a college degree, an Associate's degree, or a child \ndevelopment associate credential.\n  The legislation also includes a separate allotment to states to \naddress access to health care coverage by child care workers. States \nwould be free to develop their own creative methods to improve access \nto health care, but the intent is to ensure that an industry that works \nwith children--who as many parents know, often come down with a variety \nof illnesses, particularly preschool age children--would have greater \naccess to comprehensive and affordable health care coverage.\n  We will never make significant strides in improving the quality of \nchild care in this Nation if we fail to address one of the leading \nproblems--attracting and retaining a quality child care workforce. It \nis time to invest in our children by investing in those who dedicate \ntheir lives to caring for our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a short summary of the bill \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  the focus act: focus on committed and underpaid staff or children's \n                                sake act\n\n       Background: According to the Department of Labor, the \n     average wage for a child care provider is $8.16 an hour--\n     $16,980 per year. Despite the important role child care \n     providers play in early childhood development and learning, \n     child care providers earn less than bus drivers ($29,430), \n     barbers ($21,190), and janitors ($19,800). The turnover rate \n     in the child care field is high--30 percent. But, to offer \n     compensation to attract and retain high quality staff, child \n     care programs would be required to charge fees that many \n     parents would not be able to afford. Current law \n     reimbursement rates, which are woefully inadequate for \n     center-based and family day care homes already shut out too \n     many parents from the child care market.\n       The FOCUS Act: The purpose of the FOCUS Act is to establish \n     a Child care Provider Retention and development Grant \n     Program, a Child Care Provider Scholarship Program, and to \n     improve access to health coverage by child care workers and \n     their dependents in order to reward and promote retention of \n     committee, quality child care providers.\n       Child Care Provider Retention and Development Grant \n     Program: The FOCUS Act provides grants to states to \n     supplement the\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\n     wages of full-time child care workers who have a child \n     development associate (CDA) credential by at least $1,000. A \n     child care worker who has a Bachelors Degree in child \n     development or early child education shall receive a grant of \n     at least twice as much as grants made to providers who have \n     an Associates degree in the area of child development or \n     early child education. Grants to providers with an AA degree \n     shall be at least 150 percent of grants made to those with a \n     CDA. States shall provide grants in progressively larger \n     dollar amounts to child care providers to reflect the number \n     of years worked as a child care provider.\n       Child Care Provider Scholarships: The FOCUS Act provides \n     grants to states for child care providers who have been \n     employed for at least a year in the child care field--maximum \n     grant is $1,500, to further staff education and training. \n     FOCUS Act scholarships are not counted against other federal \n     education aid.\n       Health Care Coverage for Child Care Providers: The FOCUS \n     Act provides grants to states to provide better access to \n     health coverage for child care workers. States retain a great \n     deal of flexibility in determining how they will improve \n     access to health care and health coverage by child care \n     providers.\n       Funding: For FY 2004, the FOCUS Act authorizes $500 million \n     for wage and scholarship initiatives and $200 million for \n     health care initiatives. Such sums are authorized for fiscal \n     years 2005-2008.\n       Of the $500 million for wage and scholarship initiatives, \n     67.5 percent is for grants to attract and retain a quality \n     child care workforce and 22.5 percent is for scholarships to \n     promote a child care workforce better educated on childhood \n     development.\n       Set-aside: 3 percent for Indian Tribes and tribal \n     organizations.\n       Funding formula: based on the number of children under age \n     5 and the percentage of children receiving free or reduced \n     price lunches. 90/10 funding 1st year; 85/15 funding 2nd \n     year; 80/20 funding 3rd year; 75/25 funding fourth and \n     subsequent years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1199. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \noutreach activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill help to ensure that all of our veterans know about Federal \nbenefits to which they may be entitled by improving outreach programs \nconducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  I am please to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Arkansas, \nMrs. Lincoln, and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Three years ago, the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, WDVA, \nlaunched a statewide program called ``I Owe You.'' Under the direction \nof Secretary Ray Boland, the program encourages veterans to apply, or \nto re-apply, for benefits that they earned from their service in the \nUnited States military.\n  As part of this program, WDVA has sponsored six events around \nWisconsin called ``Supermarkets of Veterans Benefits'' at which \nveterans can begin the process of learning whether they qualify for \nFederal benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. These \nevents, which are based on a similar program in Georgia, supplement the \nwork of Wisconsin's County Veterans Service Officers and veterans \nservice organizations by helping our veterans to reconnect with the VA \nand to learn more about services and benefits for which they may be \neligible. More than 11,000 veterans and their families have attended \nthe supermarkets, which include information booths with representatives \nfrom WDVA, VA, and veterans service organizations, as well as a variety \nof Federal, State, and local agencies. I was proud to have members of \nmy staff speak with veterans and their families at a number of these \nevents. These events have helped veterans and their families to learn \nabout numerous topics, including health care, how to file a disability \nclaim, and pre-registration for internment in veterans cemeteries.\n  The Institute for Government Innovation at Harvard University's \nKennedy School of Government recognized the ``I Owe You'' program by \nnaming it a semi-finalist for the 2002 Innovations in American \nGovernment Award. The program was also featured in the March/April 2003 \nissue of Disabled American Veterans Magazine.\n  The State of Wisconsin is performing a service that is clearly the \nobligation of the VA. These are Federal benefits that we owe to our \nveterans and it is the Federal Government's responsibility to make sure \nthat they receive them. The VA has a statutory obligation to perform \noutreach, and current budget pressures should not be used as an excuse \nto halt or reduce these efforts.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today was spurred by the \noverwhelming response to the WDVA's ``I Owe You'' program and the \nsupermarkets of veterans benefits. If more than 11,000 Wisconsin \nveterans are unaware of benefits that may be owed to them, it is \ntroubling to think how many veterans around our country are also \nunaware of them. We can and should do better for our veterans, who \nselflessly served our country and protected the freedoms that we all \ncherish. And it is important to address gaps in the VA's outreach \nprogram as we welcome home and prepare to enroll into the VA system the \ntens of thousands of dedicated military personnel who are serving in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and other places around the globe.\n  In order to help to facilitate consistent implementation of VA's \noutreach responsibilities around the country, my bill would create a \nstatutory definition of the term ``outreach.''\n  My bill also would help to improve outreach activities performed by \nthe VA in three ways. First, it would create separate funding line \nitems for outreach activities within the budgets of the VA and its \nagencies, the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration, and the National Cemetery Administration. Currently \nfunding for outreach is taken from the general operating expenses for \nthese agencies. These important programs should have a dedicated \nfunding source instead of being forced to compete for scarce funding \nwith other crucial VA programs.\n  I have long supported efforts adequately fund VA programs. We can and \nshould do more to provide the funding necessary to ensure that our \nbrave veterans are getting the health care and other benefits that they \nhave earned in a timely manner and without having to travel long \ndistances or wait more than a year to see a doctor or to have a claim \nprocessed.\n  Secondly, the bill would create an intra-agency structure to require \nthe Office of the Secretary, the Office of Public Affairs, the VBA, the \nVHA, and the NCA to coordinate outreach activities. By working more \nclosely together, the VA components would be able to consolidate their \nefforts, share proven outreach mechanisms, and avoid duplication of \neffort that could waste scarce funding.\n  Finally, the bill would ensure that the VA can enter into cooperative \nagreements with State Departments of Veterans Affairs regarding \noutreach activities and would give the VA grant-making authority to \naward funds to State Departments of Veterans Affairs for outreach \nactivities such as the WDVA's ``I Owe You Program.'' Grants that are \nawarded to State departments under this program could be used to \nenhance outreach activities and to improve activities relating to \nveterans claims processing, which is a key component of the VA benefits \nprocess. State departments that receive grants under this program may \nchoose to award portions of their grants to local governments, other \npublic entities, or private or non-profit organizations that engage in \nveterans outreach activities.\n  I am pleased that this bill has the support of a number of national \nand Wisconsin organizations that are committed to improving the lives \nof our Nation's veterans, including: Disabled American Veterans; \nParalyzed Veterans of America; Vietnam Veterans of America; the \nNational Association of County Veterans Service Officers; the National \nAssociation of State Directors of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin Association of County \nVeterans Service Officers; the Wisconsin Department of Disabled \nAmerican Veterans; the Wisconsin Department of Veterans of Foreign \nWars; the Wisconsin Paralyzed Veterans Association; and the Wisconsin \nState Council, Vietnam Veterans of America.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7493]]\n\n                                S. 1199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am happy to be joining my \ncolleague Senator Lindsey Graham in introducing the YMCA Healthy Teen \nAct. Senator Graham and I are introducing this bill along with Senators \nBunning, Corzine, Daschle, DeWine, Durbin, Landrieu, Lincoln, Murray, \nRoberts, and Smith. This bipartisan legislation will address a critical \nissue for our Nation's future: the health of our children.\n  Unfortunately, there has been an alarming trend in recent years \ntowards increased obesity in our Nation's youth. On average, America's \nyoung people spend 4 hours a day watching television, 1 and \\1/2\\ hours \na day listening to music, 30 minutes watching videos, and 20 minutes \nplaying video games. Only 13 percent of students walk or bike to \nschool. Only one State, Illinois, requires daily physical education in \nschools. The Surgeon General has reported that 13 percent of children \nand adolescents are overweight, more than double the number who were \noverweight in 1970.\n  We are rapidly becoming a country of the unfit, the inactive, and the \nunhealthy--and our young people are suffering the consequences of a \nsedentary lifestyle. If ignored, obesity in children leads to obesity \nin adulthood--and the numerous health problems that come with it \nincluding diabetes, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive \npulmonary disease, and cancer. These five diseases alone account for \nmore than two-thirds of all deaths in the United States, and caring for \nthem comes at a tremendous cost to society--close to $117 billion \nannually.\n  On top of the need for increased physical activity and healthier \nlifestyles, the evidence is all around us that our young people today \nalso need some extra care and support. Kids today face challenges and \nobstacles that I never dreamed about when I was growing up in Regent. \nAlthough recent promising evidence show that rates of smoking, drinking \nand the use of illegal drugs among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders fell \nsimultaneously in 2002, still half of all high school seniors have \nreported using illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime.\n  These challenges arise in part from the temptations kids face when \nthey have too much idle time on their own. Every day, millions of \nAmerican teens are left unsupervised after school. Studies have shown \nthat teens left unsupervised during those hours are more likely to \nsmoke, drink alcohol, engage in sexual activity, and become involved in \ndelinquent behavior than teens who participate in structured, \nsupervised afterschool activities. Also, nearly 80 percent of teens who \nare involved in afterschool activities are A or B students, while only \nhalf of those who are not involved earn those grades.\n  To address these crucial issues facing America's youth, I propose we \nturn to an exemplary organization dedicated to improving kids' lives, \nthe YMCA. Nearly 2.4 million teenagers--1 out of every 10--are involved \nin a program offered by their local YMCA. In 2001, total membership \nrolls reached their highest level in history, with 18.3 million men, \nwomen, and children--half of them under 18--receiving a vast range of \nservices from their local YMCAs.\n\n  In the past year and a half, I visited three of the six YMCAs that \nserve\n\n[[Page S7494]]\n\nNorth Dakota teens. Through programs focused on education, healthy \nlifestyles, physical activity, leadership, and service learning, these \nNorth Dakota YMCAs helped 12,500 teens in my State develop character, \nbuild confidence, and become healthier within the last year alone.\n  I have seen firsthand what a difference a safe, structured, and \nhealthy afterschool environment can make for our youth. In those \ncommunities in North Dakota and across the country, the YMCA is a place \nto learn, a place to play sports, a place to meet friends, and a place \nto simply shed the problems that youths face every day in school and at \nhome and just have some fun. North Dakota teens embrace the countless \nopportunities presented to them at their YMCAs with enthusiasm, and I \nhave no doubt they are not alone.\n  While the YMCA is national in scope, they are local in control and \nevery program is designed and evaluated to meet the communities' unique \nneeds. I am confident that this bill will help the YMCA to reach more \nteens and continue to provide successful solutions for our Nation's \nteens and families.\n  To serve more teens in need of healthier lifestyles and safe and \nstructured afterschool programs, the YMCA has set the goal of doubling \nthe number of teens served to one in five teens by 2005. This ambitious \ncampaign is called the Teen Action Agenda.\n  The bill that Senator Graham and I offer today provides funding to \nhelp the YMCA reach teens who need safe and structured activities that \nwill promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles. This piece of \nlegislation authorizes Federal appropriations of $20 million per year \nfor fiscal years 2004 through 2008 for the YMCA to implement its Teen \nAction Agenda. This funding would in turn be distributed to local YMCAs \nthat are located in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. Similar \nlegislation was passed in the 105th Congress for the Boys and Girls \nClub and in the 106th Congress for the Police Athletic League to aid in \ntheir efforts to reach out to youth.\n  Each program funded through this initiative would include physical \nactivity and nutritional education components, and could also focus on \nother health risks faced by teenage youths, such as tobacco, drugs, and \nrisky behaviors that lead to injury and violence.\n  This bill will encourage public-private partnerships and leverage \nadditional funding for teen programs. It contains a matching component \nthat will be met by the YMCA through local and private support. The \nYMCA in 2001 raised $777 million in public contributions, double the \nannual contribution levels of a decade ago, and continues to grow and \ngain support from communities for its work. The matching component, \nalong with the support the YMCA programs receive from national \ncorporate sponsors, will turn $20 million in Federal funds into $50 \nmillion that will be invested in proven programs that serve teens who \nare most in need.\n  Adolescence is an opportune time to instill in children positive \neating habits and exercise routines that will carry over into \nadulthood. The YMCA is an established and proven organization that is \nin the position to reach out and influence thousands of teenagers. This \nlegislation is an opportunity for us to do something for the health of \nour Nation's teenagers, when they now face greater risks and challenges \nthan ever before. Again, for the sake of our children's future, I urge \nmy Senate colleagues to join Senator Graham and me in cosponsoring this \npiece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 1203. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding \ndistance education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, one of the great benefits of the revolution \nin information technology has been its effect on education. With the \ninformation superhighway and the number of online research and \ninformation sources it has made available, modern technology and higher \neducation have become inseparable.\n  The notion of distance learning and the access it provides to \nstudents--especially those in rural areas--could use a little more \nsupport, however, so that is why I am introducing the Distance Learning \nand Online Education Act of 2003.\n  This legislation builds on principles already found in the Higher \nEducation Act to help reach populations that have traditionally been \nexcluded from attending institutions of higher education.\n  Wyoming is a very rural State. There is only one four year school in \nthe entire State, and there are only seven community colleges. If you \ninclude the University of Wyoming's satellite campuses, that adds up to \nnine institutions of higher education in an area of nearly one hundred \nthousand square miles. By contrast, there are one hundred twenty nine \ninstitutions of higher education in the State of Massachusetts, which \nmakes up an area roughly one tenth the size of Wyoming. In fact, the \nonly State that has fewer institutions of higher education is Alaska.\n  Expanding access to higher education for our rural communities has \nbeen a challenge for many years. Now, the Internet has made it possible \nfor prospective students in rural communities, far removed from the \nuniversity campus, to attend college online. They may now spend their \ntime studying, rather than commuting back and forth between school.\n  At present, the most significant barriers that distance learners and \nonline education programs must face are those that were created by the \nHigher Education Act. Under current law, students attending \ninstitutions that enroll more than half of their students in distance \nprograms are ineligible for Federal student financial assistance. As a \nresult, many of the communities that this assistance is designed to \nreach have been excluded from sharing in its benefits, including \nstudents from rural communities, single mothers, working professionals, \nand a range of others who are interested in attending college but who \ncannot afford to do so.\n  The legislation that I introduce today corrects this problem by \ncreating an avenue for online and distance educators to reach out to \nrural communities and non-traditional students by making them eligible \nfor federal student assistance. It creates an eligibility standard for \nthese institutions that helps to ensure they will provide high quality \neducation programs, while it also protects Federal funding from fraud \nand abuse.\n  The Distance Learning and Online Education Act ensures students will \nreceive a high quality education by requiring online educators to \nbecome accredited by an agency that has an appropriate focus on \ndistance education. As provided under current law, the accrediting body \nmust also be recognized by the Secretary of Education as an agency that \ncan determine the institution's eligibility under Title IV of the \nHigher Education Act. This is a slightly higher standard than is \nexpected of the brick and mortar institutions that have been entrusted \nwith Title IV funding since the Higher Education Act was originally \npassed.\n  My bill will also protect against any fraud and abuse of Title VI \nfunds by requiring distance educators to demonstrate their financial \nresponsibility. In addition to meeting the default rates already \nestablished in current law, institutions interested in becoming \neligible must also have a record free from audit findings or program \nreview findings resulting in significant penalties for a period of at \nleast two years. Distance learning institutions must also show that \nthey have not had their participation in Title IV limited, suspended or \nterminated during the previous five years, and they must create a \nsystem of assurances that the student participating in the program is \nthe individual completing the work.\n  It is clear that the shape of higher education in this country is \nchanging and it will never be the same again. We have an opportunity, \nthrough technology, to reach student populations that have been \nexcluded from participation in higher education because they cannot \nafford to attend or travel to classrooms or campuses located many miles \nfrom their homes. We can change part of the equation by changing the \nway we view those programs that hold the greatest promise for non-\ntraditional students. Making them eligible for federal student \nassistance will go a long way toward making a higher education \navailable to everyone with\n\n[[Page S7495]]\n\nthe interest in learning and the determination to get the job done. The \nDistance Learning and Online Education Act of 2003 will provide a hand \nup--not a hand out--to those whose interest in a higher education is \nlimited only by their resources. By offering them a helping hand we can \neliminate that obstacle and help a new generation achieve their goals \nand live their dreams.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to recognize the heritage of hunting and provide \nopportunities for continued hunting on Federal public land; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hunting \nHeritage Protection Act. With the introduction of this important \nlegislation, we are able to acknowledge our Nation's rich heritage of \nhunting. The purpose of this bill is to pass that legacy on to future \ngenerations by protecting and preserving the rights of our Nation's \nsportsmen and women.\n  In 2001 over 13 million Americans contributed over $20.6 billion to \nthe U.S. economy while hunting--a true recreational activity. Many \nbelieve that in order to hunt you must own land, but that is not true. \nI believe that hunting should be available as a recreational activity \nfor everyone.\n  I have been an avid outdoor sportsman since my early adulthood. I am \nalso an avid conservationist, like most other hunters. Mr. President, \nrecreational hunting provides many opportunities to spend valuable time \nwith children, just as I do with my son. He has been hunting since he \nwas a young boy where he discovered and learned to appreciate one of \nthe Earth's greatest treasures, nature.\n  Over the years, hunters have contributed billions of dollars to \nwildlife conservation, by purchasing licenses, permits, and stamps, as \nwell as paying excise taxes on goods used by hunters. Since the time of \nPresident Teddy Roosevelt, father of the conservation movement, \nsportsmen and women have been and will continue to be some of the \ngreatest supporters of sound wildlife management and conservation \npractices in the U.S.\n  Hunters need to be recognized for the vital role they play in \nconservation in this country. The Hunting Heritage Protection Act will \ndo just that. This bill formalizes a policy by which the Federal \nGovernment will support, promote, and enhance recreational hunting \nopportunities, as permitted under State and Federal law. Further, the \nbill mandates that Federal public land and water are to be open to \naccess and use for recreational hunting where and when appropriate. I \nshould clarify and stress that this bill does not suggest that we open \nall national parks to hunting. As I mentioned, the goal is simple--I \nwant recreational hunting on our public land to be available to the \ncitizens of this country where and when appropriate.\n  It is crucial that the tradition of hunting is protected and that the \nvaluable contributions that hunters have made to conservation in this \ncountry are recognized. And, we want to ensure that Federal land \nmanagement decisions and their actions result in a `no net loss of \nhunting opportunities'' on our public lands. This bill allows Congress \nto address this issue and to honor our Nation's sportsmen and women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 1205. A bill to provide discounted housing for teachers and other \nstaff in rural areas of States with a population less than 1,000,000 \nand with a high population of Native Americans or Alaska Natives; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murkowski, I rise to \nintroduce the Rural Teacher Housing Act of 2003.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will \nhave a profound effect on the retention of good teachers, \nadministrators, and other school staff in remote and rural areas of \nAlaska and in the rest of our Nation.\n  In rural areas of Alaska, school districts face the challenge of \nrecruiting and retaining teachers, administrators and other school \nstaff due to the lack of affordable housing. In one school district, \nthey hire one teacher for every\n\n[[Page S7496]]\n\nsix who decide not to accept job offers. Half of the applicants not \naccepting a teaching position in that district indicated that their \ndecision was related to the lack of housing options.\n  Recently, I traveled throughout rural Alaska with Education Secretary \nRod Paige. I wanted him to see the challenges of educating children in \nsuch a remote and rural environment. At one rural school, the principal \nmust sleep in his office due to the lack of housing in that village. In \nthe same village, there is not enough housing for each teacher to have \ntheir own separate home--several teachers must share a single home. \nTherefore, there is not enough room for the teachers' spouses.\n  Rural Alaskan school districts also experience a high annual rate of \nteacher turnover due to the dearth of affordable housing. Apparently, \nup to 30 percent of teachers leave rural school districts due to \nhousing issues. How can we expect our children to thrive and to meet \nthe mandates of the No Child Left Behind Act in such an educational \nenvironment? Clearly, the lack of affordable teacher housing in rural \nAlaska is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to ensure that \nchildren in rural Alaska receive an educational experience that is \nsecond to none and is also respectful of cultural differences.\n  My bill authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nprovide funds to States to address the shortage of teacher housing in \nrural areas in Alaska and in the rest of our Nation. Specifically, my \nbill provides funds to States that have a population of 1 million or \nfewer people and include qualifying municipalities, which have \npopulations of 6,500 or fewer people and also do not have direct access \nto either a State or interstate highway system. The appropriate state \nhousing authority will accept such funds and will then transfer the \nfunds to an eligible school district in a qualifying municipality. An \neligible school district must be within the boundaries of an Indian \nreservation, one or more Alaska Native villages or land owned by one or \nmore Alaska Native village corporations. This legislation will allow \nthe eligible school districts to address the housing shortage in the \nfollowing ways: construct housing units, purchase and rehabilitate \nexisting housing units, or rehabilitate housing units that are already \nowned by a school district. Once this phase is complete, eligible \nschool districts shall provide the housing to teachers or other school \nstaff under terms agreed upon by the school district and the teacher or \nother staff.\n  It is imperative that we address this important issue immediately and \nallow the flexibility for the disbursement of funds to be handled at \nthe local level. The quality of education of our rural children is at \nstake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand and enhance postbaccalaureate opportunities at Hispanic-serving institutions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\tMr. BINGAMAN: Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Texas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to introduce the Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institution Act. This bill will strengthen provisions in Title V of the Higher Education Act, HEA, by providing our Hispanic-Serving Institutions with both graduate opportunities and reductions in regulatory barriers.\n\tAccording to the 2000 census Hispanics make up 12.5 percent of the American population. Currently Hispanics constitute 10 percent of the college enrollment. By 2050 the Hispanic population will grow to 25 percent. It is in our national interest to ensure that this population is well educated so that they will be ready to take their place as professionals, scientists, inventors, and well-informed citizens.\n\tHispanic-Serving Institutions, HSIs, serve students of all backgrounds and ethnicities in 13 States. Colleges and universities become eligible for HSI status if at least 50 percent of their student population receives need-based financial assistance, 25 percent is Hispanic, and 50 percent of their Hispanic population is low-income. It is at these HSIs that the largest growth in advanced degrees awarded to Hispanics is occurring. Between 1991 and 2000 the number of Hispanic students earning master's degrees at HSIs grew 136 percent and the number of receiving doctoral degrees grew by 85 percent. Currently over 25 percent of the Hispanics who obtained these degrees did so at HSIs. As a nation, we need to expand the capacity of Hispanic-Serving Institutions, support their undergraduate programs, and encourage them to offer quality graduate and professional degree programs.\n\tThe Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institution Act will strengthen our Hispanic-Serving Institutions by: Establishing a competitive grant program for HSIs to support their masters and doctoral degree programs. Eliminating the current requirement for HSIs to show that 50 percent of their Hispanic population is low-income. This requirement is difficult for the institutions to meet because they cannot collect the necessary student data. Eliminating the 2-year wait-out period between HSI grants allowing continuous funding of existing programs. Adding, as an authorized activity, programs that support student transfers from 2-year to 4-year institutions. Raising the funding for the Title V HSI grant program to $175,000,000. Allocating $125,000,000 for a new grant program to support HSI masters and doctoral programs.\n\tThe State of New Mexico houses 19 HSIs within its border. The New Mexico HSIs serve the entire State and their student populations are very diverse. Over the years these 19 institutions have worked diligently to educate and support all students. They have graduated outstanding teachers, scientists, and other professionals. The Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institution Act supports the valuable work that these and all other HSIs are currently doing and gives them new resources they need to expand their offerings.\n\n\tI urge my colleagues to support this bill and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to restore Federal remedies for infringements of intellectual property by States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\tMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in June 1999, the United States Supreme Court issued a pair of decisions that altered the legal landscape with respect to intellectual property. I am referring to Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank and its companion case, College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid. The Court ruled in these cases that States and their institutions cannot be held liable for damages for patent infringement and other violations of the Federal intellectual property laws, even though they can and do enjoy the full protection of those laws for themselves.\n\tBoth Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank were decided by the same five-to-four majority of the justices. This slim majority of the Court threw out three Federal statutes that Congress passed, unanimously, in the early 1990s, to reaffirm that the Federal patent, copyright, and trademark laws apply to everyone, including the States.\n\tI believe that there is an urgent need for Congress to respond to the Florida Prepaid decisions, for two reasons.\n\tFirst, the decisions opened up a huge loophole in our Federal intellectual property laws. If we truly believe in fairness, we cannot tolerate a situation in which some participants in the intellectual property system get legal protection but need not adhere to the law themselves. If we truly believe in the free market, we cannot tolerate a situation where one class of market participants have to play by the rules and others do not. As Senator Specter said in August 1999, in a floor statement that was highly critical of the Florida Prepaid decisions, they ``leave us with an absurd and untenable state of affairs,'' where ``States will enjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitors.''\n\tThe second reason why Congress should respond to the Florida Prepaid decisions is that they raise broader concerns about the roles of Congress and the Court. Over the past decade, in a series of five-to-four decisions that might be called examples of ``judicial activism,'' the current Supreme Court majority has overturned Federal legislation with a frequency unprecedented in American constitutional history. In doing so, the Court has more often than not relied on notions of State sovereign immunity that have little if anything to do with the text of the Constitution.\n\tSome of us have liked some of the results; others have liked others; but that is not the point. This activist Court has been whittling away at the legitimate constitutional authority of the federal government. At the risk of sounding alarmist, this is the fact of the matter: We are faced with a choice. We can respond--in a careful and measured way--by reinstating our democratic policy choices in legislation that is crafted to meet the Court's stated objections. Or we can run away, abdicate our democratic policy-making duties to the unelected Court, and go down in history as the incredible shrinking Congress.\n\tAbout four months after the Florida Prepaid decisions issued, I introduced a bill that responded to those decisions. The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act of 1999 was designed to restore Federal remedies for violations of intellectual property rights by states. I have continued to refine this legislation over the years, and in February 2002, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held the Committee's first hearing on the issue of sovereign immunity and the protection of intellectual property.\n\n\tToday, I am pleased to be introducing the Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act of 2003, which builds on my earlier proposals and on the helpful comments I have received on those proposals from legal experts across the country. I am proud to have the House leaders on intellectual property issues, Representatives Smith and Berman, as the principal sponsors of the House companion bill.\n\tThis bill has the same common-sense goal as the three statutes that the Supreme Court's decisions invalidated: To protect intellectual property rights fully and fairly. But the legislation has been re-engineered, after extensive consultation with constitutional and intellectual property experts, to ensure full compliance with the Court's new jurisprudential requirements. As a result, the bill has earned the strong support of the U.S. Copyright Office and the endorsements of a broad range of organizations including the American Bar Association, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, the Business Software Alliance, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, the International Trademark Association, the Motion Picture Association of America, the Professional Photographers of America Association, and the Chamber of Commerce.\n\tIn essence, our bill presents States with a choice. It creates reasonable incentives for States to waive their immunity in intellectual property cases, but it does not oblige them to do so. States that choose not to waive their immunity within two years after enactment of the bill would continue to enjoy many of the benefits of the Federal intellectual property system; however, like private parties that sue States for infringement, States that sue private parties for infringement could not recover any money damages unless they had waived their immunity from liability in intellectual property cases.\n\tThis arrangement is clearly constitutional. Congress may attach conditions to a State's receipt of Federal intellectual property protection under its Article I intellectual property power just as Congress may attach conditions on a State's receipt of federal funds under its Article I spending power. Either way, the power to attach conditions to the federal benefit is part of the greater power to deny the benefit altogether. And no condition could be more reasonable or proportionate than the condition that in order to obtain full protection for your federal intellectual property rights, you must respect those of others.\n\tI am encouraged by the Supreme Court's recent decision in Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, which, although very narrow, suggests that certain Justices may be starting to realize that the Court has gone too far in sacrificing ordinary people's rights at the altar of sovereign immunity. By upholding the Family and Medical Leave Act as applied to the States, the Hibbs case also suggests that a very carefully crafted law, which simply does what is necessary to protect important rights, will be upheld.\n\tI hope we can all agree on the need to protect the rights of intellectual property owners. A recent GAO study confirmed that, as the law now stands, owners of intellectual property have few or no alternatives or remedies available against State infringers--just a series of dead ends.\n\tWe need to assure American inventors and investors, and our foreign trading partners, that as State involvement in intellectual property becomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. intellectual property rights are backed by legal remedies. I want to emphasize the international ramifications here. American trading interests have been well served by our strong and consistent advocacy of effective intellectual property protections in treaty negotiations and other international fora. Those efforts could be jeopardized by the loophole in U.S. intellectual property enforcement that the Supreme Court has created.\n\tSenator Brownback made this point at a Judiciary Committee hearing on February 27, 2002. He said, ``When states assert sovereign immunity for the purpose of infringing upon intellectual property rights, it damages the credibility of the United States internationally, and could possibly even lead to violations of our treaty obligations. Any decrease in the level of enforcement of intellectual property rights around the world is likely to harm American businesses, because of our position as international leaders in industries like pharmaceuticals, information technology, and biotechnology.''\n\tThe Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act restores protection for violations of intellectual property rights that may, under current law, go unremedied. We unanimously passed more sweeping legislation in the early 1990s, but were thwarted by the Supreme Court's shifting jurisprudence. We should enact this legislation without further delay.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows.\n\n                                S. 1191\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission to assess and provide recommendations regarding recent energy price spikes from the perspective of consumers and small businesses; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\tMr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act. I am pleased to have the support of the Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, in introducing this legislation. This legislation will allow us to better understand the causes of energy price spikes from the consumer and small business perspectives, and better address this pressing issue.\n\tThe Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act would establish a Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission. The members would be appointed on a bipartisan basis by the Speaker and Minority Leader of the House and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, as well as the President. The Commission would be comprised of representatives of consumer groups, the energy industry, small businesses, and the Administration. The Commission will study the causes of energy price spikes and issue recommendations on how to avert price spikes in the future.\n\tSine 1990, residential heating oil, residential natural gas, commercial natural gas, industrial natural gas, and gasoline have all had significantly fluctuating prices. Gasoline price spikes have become commonplace in the Midwest. Escalating home heating and cooling bills have crippled family budgets in the Midwest and Northeast. Farmers and industries dependent on natural gas for the production of fertilizer and other chemical products have also suffered economically. Most recently, natural gas prices have skyrocketed and gasoline prices have shown little sign of falling from the historic highs of the past few months.\n\tWe need a comprehensive study of these problems. Some past studies have assessed the long-range supply and demand for energy product. The Federal Trade Commission studied gasoline price spikes in the Midwest, and Senator Levin has embarked on a series of hearings exploring gasoline pricing issues. Other studies have investigated narrow or specific abuses of market power in the energy industry, such as in California. The Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission will look at the entire picture, focusing on price fluctuations of all consumer energy products. The list of potential causes that need to be studied includes: insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery capacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, possible regulation problems, flawed deregulation, excessive consumption, over-reliance on foreign supplies, insufficient investment in research and development of alternative sources, opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and abuse of market power.\n\tWe need to give consumers and small businesses a voice. When consumers go to pay their grocery bills, or their tuition bills, or even their residential electricity bills in most states, and when small businesses go to pay for raw materials, prices are fairly predictable. But when they go to pay for their heating and cooling, natural gas, or gasoline, families and businesses face the frustrating reality of wild price swings.\n\tWe need to bring consumers and small businesses to the table together with representatives of the energy industry and government. We need these groups to work collectively, and to consider the range of possible causes of energy price spikes.\n\n\tA measure very similar to this bill enjoyed strong, bipartisan support last year, and passed as an amendment to the Senate energy bill by a vote of 69-30. The minor changes to this bill include adding direct representation of small businesses to the Commission, expanding the participation of Administration representatives in the study phase, and establishing an Executive Committee to expedite the issuance of the final report, which will include recommendations.\n\tBy enacting the Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act, we will be able to better understand the causes of energy price spikes and hopefully avert them in the future. I urge my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1192\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer and Small Business \n     Energy Commission Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there have been several sharp increases since 1990 in \n     the price of electricity, gasoline, home heating oil, natural \n     gas, and propane in the United States;\n       (2) recent examples of such increases include--\n       (A) unusually high gasoline prices that are at least partly \n     attributable to global politics;\n       (B) electricity price spikes during the California energy \n     crisis of 2001; and\n       (C) the Midwest gasoline price spikes in spring 2001;\n       (3) shifts in energy regulation, including the allowance of \n     greater flexibility in competition and trading, have affected \n     price stability and consumers in ways that are not fully \n     understood;\n       (4) price spikes undermine the ability of low-income \n     families, the elderly, and small businesses (including \n     farmers and other agricultural producers) to afford essential \n     energy services and products;\n       (5) energy price spikes can exacerbate a weak economy by \n     creating uncertainties that discourage investment, growth, \n     and other activities that contribute to a strong economy;\n       (6) the Department of Energy has determined that the \n     economy would be likely to perform better with stable or \n     predictable energy prices;\n       (7) price spikes can be caused by many factors, including \n     insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery \n     capacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, over-regulation \n     or under-regulation, flawed deregulation, excessive \n     consumption, over-reliance on foreign supplies, insufficient \n     research and development of alternative energy sources, \n     opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and abuses of \n     market power;\n       (8) consumers and small businesses have few options other \n     than to pay higher energy costs when prices spike, resulting \n     in reduced investment and slower economic growth and job \n     creation;\n       (9) the effect of price spikes, and possible responses to \n     price spikes, on consumers and small businesses should be \n     examined; and\n       (10) studies have examined price spikes of specific energy \n     products in specific contexts or for specific reasons, but no \n     study has examined price spikes comprehensively with a focus \n     on the impacts on consumers and small businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for qualified withdrawals from the Capital Construction Fund for fishermen leaving the industry and for the rollover of Capital Construction Funds to individual retirement plans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\tMr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Capital Construction Fund Qualified Withdrawal Act of 2003. My friends and colleagues, Senator Smith and Senator Murray, join me in introducing this important bill.\n\tIn January of 2000, a fishery disaster was declared by the Secretary of Commerce for the West Coast groundfish fishery. Due to major declines in fish population, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council decreased groundfish catch quotas by 90 percent. Today, the groundfish fishery in Oregon and adjoining States in the Pacific Northwest continues to face daunting challenges as a result of this disaster. Fishery income has dropped 55 percent and over a thousand fishers face bankruptcy. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has called for a 50 percent reduction in fishing capacity as part of their strategic plan for the recovery of the fishery. This legislation supports this effort by reforming the Capital Construction Fund in a way that will ease the groundfish fishers' transition away from fishing.\n\tThe Capital Construction Fund, CCF, Merchant Marine Act of 1936, amended 1969, 46 U.S.C. 1177, has been a way for fishers to accumulate funds, free from taxes, for the purpose of buying or refitting fishing vessels. It was conceived at a time when the federal government wanted to help capitalize and expand American fishing fleets. The program was a success: it led to a larger U.S. fishing fleet. However, fish populations declined and the U.S. commercial fishing fleet is now over-capitalized. The CCF's usefulness has not kept up with the times, and now it exacerbates problems facing U.S. fisheries, including the West Coast groundfish fishery.\n\tNow is the time to help fishers, who wish to do so, to leave the fleet.\n\tIn Oregon, the amounts in CCF accounts range from $10,000 to over $200,000. This legislation changes current law to allow fishers to remove money from their CCF for purposes other than buying new vessels or upgrading current vessels, without losing up to 70 percent of their CCF funds in taxes and penalties. This legislation changes the CCF so fishers who want to opt out of fishing are not penalized for doing so.\n\tThis bill takes a significant step towards helping fishermen and making the West Coast groundfish fishery and the commercial fishing industry sustainable by amending the CCF to allow non-fishing uses of investments. This bill amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and the Internal Revenue Code to allow funds currently in the CCF to be rolled over into an IRA or other types of retirement accounts, or to be used for the payment of an industry fee authorized by the fishery capacity reduction program, without adverse tax consequences to the account holders. This bill will also encourage innovation and conservation by allowing fishers to use funds deposited in a CCF to develop or purchase new gear that reduces bycatch.\n\tI look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Ms. \n        Cantwell, and Mr. Domenici):\n\tS. 1194. A bill to foster local collaborations which will ensure that resources are effectively and efficiently used within the criminal and juvenile justice systems; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\tMr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Domenici, Leahy, Grassley, and Cantwell, to introduce the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003.'' This bipartisan measure would, among other things, create a program of planning and implementation grants for communities so they may offer more treatment and other services to mentally ill offenders. Under this bill, programs receiving grant funds would be operated collaboratively by both a criminal justice agency and a mental health agency.\n\tThe mentally ill population poses a particularly difficult challenge for our criminal justice system. People afflicted with mental illness are incarcerated at significantly higher rates than the general population. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, while only about five percent of the American population has a mental illness, about 16 percent of the State prison population has such an illness. The Los Angeles County Jail, for example, typically has more mentally ill inmates than any hospital in the country.\n\tUnfortunately, however, the reality of our criminal justice system is that jails and prisons do not provide a therapeutic environment for the mentally ill and are unlikely to do so any time soon. Indeed, the mentally ill inmate often is preyed upon by other inmates or becomes even sicker in jail. Once released from jail or prison, many mentally ill people end up on the streets. With limited personal resources and little or no ability to handle their illness alone, they often commit further offenses resulting in their re-arrest and re-incarceration. This ``revolving door'' is costly and disruptive for all involved.\n\tAlthough these problems tend to manifest themselves primarily within the prison system, the root cause of our current situation is found in the mental health system and its failure to provide sufficient community-based treatment solutions. Accordingly, the solution will necessarily involve collaboration between the mental health system and criminal justice system. In fact, it also will require greater collaboration between the substance abuse treatment and mental health treatment communities, because many mentally ill offenders have a drug or alcohol problem in addition to their mental illness.\n\tThe purpose of the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act'' is to foster exactly this type of collaboration at the Federal, State, and local levels. The bill provides incentives for the criminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health, and substance abuse treatment systems to work together at each level of government to establish a network of services for offenders with mental illness. The bill's approach is unique, in that it not only would promote public safety by helping curb the incidence of repeat offenders, but it also would promote public health, by ensuring that those with a serious mental illness are treated as soon as possible and as efficiently and effectively as possible.\n\tAmong its major provisions, this legislation calls for the establishment of a new competitive grant program, which would be housed at the U.S. Department of Justice, but administered by the Attorney General with the active involvement of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. To ensure that collaboration occurs at the local level, the bill would require that two entities jointly submit a single grant application on behalf of a community.\n\tApplications demonstrating the greatest commitment to collaboration would receive priority for grant funds. If applicants can show that grant funds would be used to promote public health, as well as public safety, and if the program they propose would have the active participation of each joint applicant, and if their grant application has the support of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, then it would receive priority for funding.\n\tAdditionally, the bill would permit grant funds to be used for a variety of purposes, each of which embodies the goal of collaboration. First, grant funds may be used to provide courts with more options, such as specialized dockets, for dealing with the non-violent offender who has a serious mental illness or a co-occurring mental illness and drug or alcohol problem. Second, grant funds could be used to enhance training of mental health and criminal justice system personnel, who must know how to deal appropriately with the mentally ill offender. Third, grant funds could be devoted to programs that divert the criminal justice system into treatment those non-violent offenders with severe and persistent mental illness. Finally, correctional facilities may use grant funds to promote the treatment of inmates and ease their transition back into the community upon release from jail or prison.\n\tIn specifically authorizing grant funds to be used to promote more options for courts to deal with mentally ill offenders, this bill builds on legislation that I introduced two years ago with my colleague from Ohio, Congressman Ted Strickland. That measure, which became law, authorized $10 million per year for the establishment of more mental health courts. I have long supported mental health courts, which enable the criminal justice system to provide an individualized treatment solution for a mentally ill offender, while also requiring accountability of the offender. The legislation we are introducing today would make possible the creation or expansion of more mental health courts, and it also would promote the funding of treatment services that support such courts.\n\tIn addition to making planning and implementation grants available to communities, the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act'' also calls for an Interagency Task Force to be established at the federal level. This Task Force would include the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Commissioner of Social Security. The Task Force would be charged with identifying new ways that federal departments can work together to reduce recidivism among mentally ill adults and juveniles.\n\tFinally, the bill would direct the Attorney General and Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a list of ``best practices'' for criminal justice personnel to use when diverting mentally ill offenders from the criminal justice system.\n\tUltimately, this is a good bill and one that is long overdue. I encourage my colleagues to support this important legislative measure.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mentally Ill Offender \n     Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16 \n     percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and \n     prisons have a mental illness.\n       (2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, approximately 20 percent of youth in \n     the juvenile justice system have serious mental health \n     problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental \n     health and substance abuse disorders.\n       (3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally \n     Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious \n     mental illness will come into contact with the American \n     criminal justice system at some point in their lives.\n       (4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into \n     contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the \n     diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional \n     disorder.\n       (5) A significant proportion of adults with a serious \n     mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice \n     system are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness; and \n     many of these individuals are arrested and jailed for minor, \n     nonviolent offenses.\n       (6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or \n     emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or \n     juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and \n     psychological interventions that integrate treatment, \n     rehabilitation, and support services.\n       (7) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance \n     abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure \n     the provision of services for those with mental illness or \n     co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can \n     reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile \n     corrections facilities, while providing improved public \n     safety.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to increase public safety by \n     facilitating collaboration among the criminal justice, \n     juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance \n     abuse systems. Such collaboration is needed to--\n       (1) reduce rearrests among adult and juvenile offenders \n     with mental illness, or co-occurring mental illness and \n     substance abuse disorders;\n       (2) provide courts, including existing and new mental \n     health courts, with appropriate mental health and substance \n     abuse treatment options;\n       (3) maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution through \n     diversion in appropriate cases involving non-violent \n     offenders with mental illness;\n       (4) promote adequate training for criminal justice system \n     personnel about mental illness and substance abuse disorders \n     and the appropriate responses to people with such illnesses;\n       (5) promote adequate training for mental health treatment \n     personnel about criminal \n     offenders with mental illness and the appropriate response to \n     such offenders in the criminal justice system;\n       (6) promote communication between criminal justice or \n     juvenile justice personnel, mental health treatment \n     personnel, nonviolent offenders with mental illness, and \n     other support services such as housing, job placement, \n     community, and faith-based organizations; and\n       (7) promote communication, collaboration, and \n     intergovernmental partnerships among municipal, county, and \n     State elected officials with respect to mentally ill \n     offenders.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I have joined today with Senators DeWine, Grassley, Cantwell, and Domenici to introduce legislation that will help State and local governments reduce crime by providing more effective treatment for the mentally ill. All too often, people with mental illness rotate repeatedly between the criminal justice system and the streets of our communities, committing a series of minor offenses. Law enforcement officers' ever scarcer time is being occupied by these offenders, who divert them from their more urgent responsibilities. Meanwhile, offenders find themselves in prisons or jails, where little or no appropriate medical care is available for them. This bill give State and local governments the tools to break this cycle, for the good of law enforcement, corrections officers, the public's safety, and mentally ill offenders.\n\tI held a Judiciary Committee hearing last June on the criminal justice system and mentally ill offenders. At that hearing, we heard from State mental health officials, law enforcement officers, corrections officials, and the representative of counties around our Nation. All agreed that people with untreated mental illness are more likely to commit crimes, and that our State mental health systems, prisons and jails do not have the resources they need to treat the mentally ill, and prevent crime and recidivism. As this legislation's findings detail, more than 16 percent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness, about 20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental health problems, and up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious mental illness will come into contact with the American criminal justice system at some point in their lives. This is a serious problem that I hear about often when I talk with law enforcement officials and others in Vermont.\n\tUnder this bill, State and local governments can apply for funding to a. create or expand mental health courts or other court-based programs, which can divert qualified offenders from prison to receive treatment; b. create or expand programs to provide specialized training for criminal justice and mental health system personnel; c. create or expand local treatment programs that serve individuals with mental illness or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders; and d. promote and provide mental health treatment for those incarcerated in or released from a penal or correctional institution.\n\tThis legislation brings together law enforcement, corrections, and mental health professionals--indeed, officials from each of these fields in Vermont have offered their advice and support in drafting this bill. They know that the States have been dealing with the unique problems created by mentally ill offenders for many years, and that a Federal response is overdue. I look forward to working with them, and with Senator DeWine, Representative Ted Strickland, and other Members, to see this bill enacted this Congress.\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be once again introducing with Senator DeWine the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003. This bipartisan bill authorizes the Attorney General to administer a grant program to assist communities in planning and implementing services for mentally ill offenders. These grants will increase public safety by fostering collaborative efforts by criminal justice, mental health, and substance abuse agencies. I have seen these types of collaborative programs work in Iowa and I know that they can work elsewhere.\n\tWe have an obligation to ensure that the public is protected from these offenders who suffer from mental illness. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has reported that over 16 percent of adults incarcerated in U.S. jails and prison have a mental illness. In addition, the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has reported that over 20 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental health problems. This grant program will help increase public safety, as well as reduce the number of mentally ill adults and juveniles incarcerated in correctional facilities.\n\tThese grant dollars may be used by States and localities to establish mental health courts or other diversion programs, create or expand community-based treatment programs, provide in-jail treatment and transitional services, and for training of criminal justice and mental health system employees. The state of Iowa and a number of its counties are already leading the way in finding creative and collaborative programs to address the problems presented by these mentally ill criminals. Working together, the criminal justice, mental health, and substance abuse professionals can make a difference in the lives of this special class of offenders and also increase the safety of the public.\n\tI want to thank Senator DeWine for his leadership on this important issue. He has drafted a bill that reflects a common sense approach to a serious public safety issue. I also want to encourage my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.\n\tMs. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator DeWine and Senator Patrick Leahy along with Senators Grassley and Domenici in cosponsoring this important legislation. This bill will take steps to reduce the prevalence of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system by providing more effective treatment. Forty percent of the mentally ill in this country come in contact with the criminal justice system, many for minor but repeated offenses. This wastes tremendous law enforcement resources that can be better focused on more urgent responsibilities and results in many of the mentally ill sitting in jail cells where little treatment is available to them. My State has already taken some forward looking action in this area, and this legislation is an important next step.\n\tThe Mentally Ill Crime Reduction Act of 2003 funds new grants that will give States the tools they need to work collaboratively to break the cycle of mentally ill people repeatedly moving through the corrections system. This legislation will allow more jurisdictions to follow Seattle's lead in creating mental health courts that monitor individuals to keep them in treatment and out of jail. It will provide much needed funding to mental health and substance abuse programs, and it will provide critical dollars for treatment of those incarcerated in or released from prisons. The legislation has the support of Washington State Corrections Director Joe Lehman and the Washington Department of Social and Health Services as well as the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and the Council of State Governments. I'd like to especially thank the Bazelon Center for its work in this area.\n\tLast year, the Council on State Governments Criminal Justice/Mental Health Consensus Project issued a report that detailed the imbalance of the mentally ill in the criminal justice system. The Project found that, while those suffering from serious mental illness represent approximately five percent of the population of this country, they represent over 16 percent of the prison population. Of that 16 percent, nearly three-quarters also have a substance abuse problem, and nearly half were incarcerated for committing a nonviolent crime. In some jurisdictions recidivism rates for mentally ill inmates can reach over 70 percent. Police, judges and prosecutors are usually without options of what to do with mentally ill patients, given the lack of health services, and thus many end up in jail for minor crimes. The Los Angeles County Jail alone holds as many as 3,300 individuals with mental illness, more than any state hospital or mental health institution in the United States.\n\tEach time a mentally ill individual is incarcerated, his or her mental condition will likely worsen. Once incarcerated, people with mental illness are particularly susceptible to harming themselves or others. This environment exacerbates their mental illness, yet access to effective counseling or medication is severely limited. This in turn brings on depression or delusions that immobilize them; many have spent years trying to mask torments or hallucinations with alcohol or drugs and on average spend more time in prisons.\n\tThis problem is particularly acute in the area of juvenile offenders. The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reports that over 20 percent of children in the juvenile justice system, over 155,000, have serious mental health problems. This bill creates specialized training programs for juvenile and criminal justice agency personnel in identifying symptoms of mentally ill individuals that will help identify and treat juveniles at an earlier stage.\n\n\tThe prevalence of people with mentally illness in the criminal justice system comes at a high price to taxpayers. In King County, WA, officials identified 20 people who had been repeatedly hospitalized, jailed or admitted to detoxification centers. These emergency services cost the county approximately $1.1 million in a single year. In contrast, an Illinois Cooperative Program which brought criminal justice and mental health service personnel together to provide services to those mentally ill patients released from jail calculated that the 30 individuals in the study spend approximately 2,200 days less in jail, and 2,100 fewer days, in hospitals than they had the previous year, for a savings of $1.2 million dollars. \n\tIn 1997, Seattle Fire Department Captain Stanley Stevenson was murdered by an individual who had been found incompetent by the local municipal court but was released because of the lack of alternative options. This murder was the impetus for the creation of a Task Force that led directly to the formation of the King County Mental Health Court in 1999. The primary reason why this Court has been growing more effective in dealing with mentally ill offenders is that it has increased cooperation between the mental health and criminal justice systems, institutions that have traditionally not worked closely together. Building on the model of the drug court, the mental health court closely monitors compliance with treatment regimens by assembling a team proficient in dealing with the mentally ill and at using the stick of the criminal justice system to make that treatment work. The vast majority of these mentally ill individuals are responsive to treatment.\n\tThis program has progressed well and is becoming an effective means of helping mentally ill offenders, assuring public safety, and running a more cost efficient system. Yet to allow this system to continue to expand in Seattle and other communities in Washington State, as well as to allow other States to begin using these types of programs, federal grant funding is critical. That is what this bill provides.\n\tCollaboration between mental health, substance abuse, law enforcement, judicial, and other criminal justice personnel is also critical to the success of our mental health court program in Seattle. It is only through full coordination between the criminal justice and the mental health treatment community at the Federal and the local level that these efforts will be successful.\n\tSimilarly, only through full coordination at the Federal and local level will this bill be able to make a critical difference. I believe that some additional improvements can be made to strengthen that critical coordination and I look forward to working with Senator DeWine and Senator Leahy to accomplish that goal. I welcome the introduction of this legislation and look forward to working with my cosponsors to make this bill law in the next Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL  (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        McCain, Mr. Frist, Mr. Alexander, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Bunning, \n        Mr. Smith, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n        Kennedy, and Mr. Hatch):\n\tS. 1195. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to clarify that inpatient drug prices charged to certain public hospitals are included in the best price exemptions for the medicaid drug rebate program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\tMr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Bingaman, Rockefeller, McCain, Frist, Alexander, Lincoln, Bunning, Smith, Bob Graham, Santorum, Kerry, Kennedy and Hatch to introduce a modest but important piece of legislation, the Safety Net Hospital Pharmacy Access Act. This legislation would correct a small error in current law that prohibits safety-net hospitals from being able to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies for the lowest prices they can get.\n\tLet me provide some background on this problem. In 1990, Congress established the Medicaid drug-rebate program to ensure that the Medicaid program pays no more than a pharmaceutical manufacturer's ``best price'' for a covered outpatient drug. So whatever was the lowest price the manufacturer offered to anyone, this becomes the price Medicaid pays under this ``best price'' rule.\n\tUnfortunately, this rule provides an incentive for pharmaceutical manufacturers not to offer deep discounts to anyone, given that these prices may become the new price that Medicaid pays. Given this, in 1992 Congress exempted some organizations from the Medicaid best price calculations so that pharmaceutical manufacturers would offer them lower drug prices. These organizations include the VA, the Department of Defense, and section 340B covered entities. These 340B hospitals are so called because they fall under section 340B of the Public Health Services Act, which defines 12 categories of publicly funded safety net providers. There are approximately 160 hospitals in the country that fall under the 340B program. These hospitals often bear the burden of providing a substantial amount of uncompensated care in dealing with the indigent or the uninsured.\n\tUnfortunately, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services interpreted the 1992 law as only applying to outpatient drugs purchased by these entities. Therefore, drugs purchased for inpatient use at the 340B hospitals are covered by the Medicaid best price rule. This means these hospitals actually pay more for these drugs than for drugs that they can negotiate their own prices for in the outpatient setting. The legislation I am introducing today corrects this problem by allowing the 340B hospitals to also negotiate for lower drug prices in the inpatient setting.\n\tThis is an important correction since these hospitals are often providing free care to the indigent and the uninsured. And let me be clear that this legislation would not require pharmaceutical companies to provide discounts to these hospitals. All this legislation would do is allow the hospitals to negotiate for lower prices. However, in my discussion with representatives of hospitals that would be affected by this law, they believe they would be able to save money.\n\tFor instance, the Maricopa County hospital, which is the public hospital for the city of Phoenix, believes that it could save up to $1 million a year. Since this hospital constantly runs in the red because of the massive amount of uncompensated care it is required under federal law to provide, such savings would be very helpful.\n\tI want to thank the bill's cosponsors. I also want to urge my colleagues to take a close look at this important legislation. I am going to work to see that it is passed this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Hagel):\n\tS. 1196. A bill to eliminate the marriage penalty permanently in 2003; to the Committee on Finance.\n\tMrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to provide permanent tax relief from one of the most egregious, anti-family aspects of the tax code--the marriage penalty. Relieving American taxpayers of this burden has been one of my highest priorities as a U.S. Senator.\n\tLast week President Bush signed into law a $350 billion jobs and economic growth package to put Americans back to work and stimulate the economy. The bill provides immediate marriage penalty relief by enlarging the standard deduction and the 15 percent tax bracket for married couples filing jointly to twice that as for single filers. This provision will save 34 million married couples an average of $589 this year alone.\n\tEnacting marriage penalty relief is a giant step for tax fairness, but it may be fleeting. The Jobs and Growth Act was just signed, but even as the ink dries a tax increase on married couples looms in the near future. Since the bill was restricted by artificial limitations to $350 billion, the marriage penalty provisions will only be in effect for two years. In 2005, marriage will again be a taxable event for millions of Americans. Similar restrictions were placed on the 2001 tax cut, so, while relief will be phased in by 2009, it will disappear for good in 2011 unless we act decisively.\n\tMillions of couples across America will be penalized once more by our tax code simply because they are married. Without marriage penalty relief, 48 percent of married couples will again pay the government an average $1,400 more in taxes.\n\tGiven the state of the economy and the difficulty many families face in making ends meet, we must make sure we do not backtrack on this important reform.\n\tWithout marriage penalty relief, the tax code provides a significant disincentive for people to walk down the aisle, and the benefits of marriage are well established. Marriage is a fundamental institution in our society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living in a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or to suffer from child abuse. Research indicates they are less likely to be depressed or have developmental problems. Scourges such as adolescent drug use are less common in married families, and married mothers are less likely to be victims of domestic violence.\n\tThe bill I am offering would make the marriage penalty relief in the Jobs and Growth Act permanent. It also will accelerate changes to the earned income tax credit that were passed in the 2001 tax reform bill. This will reduce the marriage penalty on lower income couples.\n\tWe cannot be satisfied until couples never again must decide between love and money. Marriage should not be a taxable event.\n\tI call on the Senate to finish the job we started and say ``I do'' to providing permanent marriage penalty relief today.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure the safety and accuracy of medical imaging examinations and radiation therapy treatments; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\tMr. ENZI. Mr. President, imagine for a moment you have gone to the doctor to have a medical condition evaluated. Uncertain as to what your injury may be, your doctor sends you to a specialist for a medical imaging examination to determine the extent of your injury and the proper course of treatment for it.\n\tOr, imagine, having heard the dreaded diagnosis of cancer, going to the same facility for radiation therapy.\n\tIn either case, our sense of concern and anxiety about our medical condition will serve to focus our attention on ourselves, and not on the caregivers providing us with the treatment we need to recover, or in the case of cancer, to survive.\n\tBut, what would you say if you knew that the individual helping to direct your diagnosis or the one providing your course of treatment is someone who has done nothing more to earn his credentials than spend a few weeks getting some on the job training.\n\tImagine how you would feel and the level of trust you would have in a system that allowed such a thing to happen.\n\tUnfortunately, that's an all too common occurrence with the present state of our health care system.\n\tBut, it is a problem that we can solve with the passage of legislation I am introducing today.\n\tThe Consumer Assurance of Radiological Excellence, RadCARE, Act will ensure that there are coherent standards in place for those who plan and deliver radiation therapy treatments. I am pleased to be joined by my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, as well as Senators Daschle, Lautenberg, and Dorgan, in this effort, which will bring peace of mind and restore the confidence of the health consumer in the treatment they receive from those who perform radiologic procedures. It will also increase awareness of the skills of these health care professionals and raise the level of visibility their profession enjoys in the public eye.\n\tIt is important that we establish standards for personnel who perform radiologic procedures because physicians depend upon medical imaging examinations to diagnose disease and identify and treat injuries of all kinds. The quality of a radiologic procedure hinges upon the expertise of the professionals who assist in administering them.\n\tCurrently, 15 States as well as the District of Columbia do not regulate or register radiologic personnel.\n\tTo address that lack of attention, the RadCARE Act will strengthen the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981. The current law calls for States to establish voluntarily a set of educational and credentialing standards for radiologic and medical imaging personnel. Yet many States still do not have licensing laws in place that meet the standards recommended by the Federal Government. The RadCARE Act will require that radiologic and medical imaging personnel meet a minimum credentialing standard.\n\tThe RadCARE Act will not affect states that have a suitable licensing system or those that have mandated higher standards than required by Federal law. If a state has no meaningful regulations or licensing system, however, then the Federal standards will apply. The RadCARE Act also has a provision to ensure access to quality healthcare in rural regions where a one-size-fits all approach may not be applicable. Enforcement of the RadCARE Act would be achieved by restricting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement to facilities that employ personnel who meet the minimal federal standards.\n\tThe RedCARE Act will improve the safety of radiological procedures by reducing the risk of harmful overexposure to radiation. Healthcare costs will also be lowered by decreasing the number of repeated procedures due to personnel error. Additionally, the RadCARE Act will enable radiologists and other healthcare professionals to have access to quality information so that patients receive the best health care possible.\n\tThis legislation is supported by a variety of organizations concerned with the quality of these procedures, including the American Society of Radiologic Technologists, the Society of Nuclear Medicine Technologist Section, the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists, the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board, the Association of Vascular and Interventional Radiographers, and the other members of the Alliance for Quality Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, which represents the more than 275,000 medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals in the United States.\n\tWhen it comes right down to it, it's a big enough battle to fight the cancers or the injuries to our bodies that require such invasive treatments or diagnosis. We shouldn't have to worry about the level of competence of those who are providing us with the services we so desperately require for the maintenance of our health.\n\tI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and passing this much needed legislation. It respects the power of the states who have addressed this problem as it provides minimum standards for those who have not.\n\tMore importantly, its enactment into law will do a great deal to increase the level of confidence of the American health consumer in our healthcare system.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Assurance of \n     Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) More than 300,000,000 medical imaging examinations and \n     radiation therapy treatments are administered annually in the \n     United States.\n       (2) Seven out of every 10 Americans undergo a medical \n     imaging examination or radiation therapy treatment every year \n     in the United States.\n       (3) The administration of medical imaging examinations and \n     radiation therapy treatments and the effect on individuals of \n     such procedures have a substantial and direct effect upon \n     public health and safety and upon interstate commerce.\n       (4) It is in the interest of public health and safety to \n     minimize unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to radiation \n     due to the performance of medical imaging and radiation \n     therapy procedures by personnel lacking appropriate education \n     and credentials.\n       (5) It is in the interest of public health and safety to \n     have a continuing supply of adequately educated persons and \n     appropriate accreditation and certification programs \n     administered by State governments.\n       (6) Persons who perform or plan medical imaging or \n     radiation therapy, including those employed at Federal \n     facilities or reimbursed by Federal health programs, should \n     be required to demonstrate competence by reason of education, \n     training, and experience.\n       (7) The protection of public health and safety from \n     unnecessary or inappropriate medical imaging and radiation \n     therapy procedures and the assurance of efficacious \n     procedures are the responsibilities of both the State and the \n     Federal Governments.\n       (8) Facilities that conduct medical imaging or radiation \n     therapy engage in and affect interstate commerce. Patients \n     travel regularly across State lines to receive medical \n     imaging services or radiation therapy. Facilities that \n     conduct medical imaging or radiation therapy engage \n     technicians, physicians, and other staff in an interstate \n     market, and purchase medical and other supplies in an \n     interstate market.\n       (9) In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient \n     Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35) \n     which established minimum Federal standards for the \n     accreditation of education programs for persons who perform \n     or plan medical imaging examinations and radiation therapy \n     treatments and for the certification of such persons. The Act \n     also provided the States with a model State law for the \n     licensing of such persons.\n       (10) Twenty-two years after the enactment of the Consumer-\n     Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981--\n       (A) 13 States do not require licensure of any kind for \n     persons who perform or plan medical imaging examinations and \n     radiation therapy treatments;\n       (B) 37 States license, regulate, or register radiographers;\n       (C) 28 States license radiation therapists;\n       (D) 22 States license nuclear medicine technologists;\n       (E) 8 States license or require board certification of \n     medical physicists; and\n       (F) no States regulate or license medical dosimetrists.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure the accreditation of education programs for, \n     and the licensure or certification of, persons who perform, \n     plan, evaluate, or verify patient dose for medical imaging \n     examinations and radiation therapy treatments; and\n       (2) to ensure the safety and accuracy of medical imaging \n     examinations and radiation therapy treatments.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish the Child Care Provider Development and Retention Grant Program, the Child Care Provider Scholarship Program, and a program of child care provider health benefits coverage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\tMr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Focus on Committed and Underpaid Staff for Children's Sake Act. I am pleased that Senators Kennedy, Murray, and Bingaman are joining me as original cosponsors and that companion legislation is being introduced in the House today by Representatives George Miller and Patrick Kennedy.\n\tThe need for child care has become a daily fact of life for millions of parents nationwide. Sixty-five percent of mothers with children under age six and 78 percent of mothers with children ages 6 to 13 are in the labor force. Each day, 13 million preschool children, including 6 million infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day in child care.\n\tThe quality of that care has a tremendous impact on the critical early years of children's development. And, the most powerful determinant of the quality of child care is the training, education, and pay of those who spend 8-10 hours a day caring for our children.\n\tYet, what we know about the child care field is alarming. Despite the fact that continuity of care is critical for the emotional development of children, staff turnover at child care centers averages 30 percent per year--four times greater than the turnover rate for elementary school teachers.\n\tWe as a society say there is no more important task than helping to raise a child. Yet, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we pay the average child care worker about $16,500 a year--barely above the poverty level for a family of three. Few child care providers have basic benefits like health coverage or paid leave. Only a small fraction of child care workers have graduated from college.\n\tWe pay people millions of dollars a year to throw baseballs, to shoot basketballs and to swing golf clubs. What does that say about our priorities when at the same time we pay those who care for our most precious resource--our children--poverty-level wages?\n\tA report by the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for Child Care Workforce on child care providers' pay, training and education highlighted the current crisis in the child care field. In a survey of child care centers in three California communities, the study found that three-quarters of all child care staff employed in 1996 were no longer on the job in 2000. Some centers reported 100 percent turnover. Additionally, nearly half of the child care providers who had left had a Bachelor's degree, compared to only one-third of the new teachers. Some 49 percent, nearly half, of those who had left their job, left the child care field entirely.\n\tIt's clear that if we want to attract quality teachers to the child care field, the pay has to better reflect the value we place on their work. We can't attract them and we can't keep them if we don't pay them a living wage.\n\tThe legislation I am introducing today will provide states with funds to increase child care worker pay based on the level of education--the greater the level of education, the greater the increase in pay. In addition, the legislation will provide scholarships of up to $1,500 for child care workers who want to further their early childhood education training by getting a college degree, an Associate's degree, or a child development associate credential.\n\tThe legislation also includes a separate allotment to states to address access to health care coverage by child care workers. States would be free to develop their own creative methods to improve access to health care, but the intent is to ensure that an industry that works with children--who as many parents know, often come down with a variety of illnesses, particularly preschool age children--would have greater access to comprehensive and affordable health care coverage.\n\tWe will never make significant strides in improving the quality of child care in this Nation if we fail to address one of the leading problems--attracting and retaining a quality child care workforce. It is time to invest in our children by investing in those who dedicate their lives to caring for our children.\n\tI ask unanimous consent to print a short summary of the bill following my remarks.\n\tThere being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n  the focus act: focus on committed and underpaid staff or children's \n                                sake act\n\n       Background: According to the Department of Labor, the \n     average wage for a child care provider is $8.16 an hour--\n     $16,980 per year. Despite the important role child care \n     providers play in early childhood development and learning, \n     child care providers earn less than bus drivers ($29,430), \n     barbers ($21,190), and janitors ($19,800). The turnover rate \n     in the child care field is high--30 percent. But, to offer \n     compensation to attract and retain high quality staff, child \n     care programs would be required to charge fees that many \n     parents would not be able to afford. Current law \n     reimbursement rates, which are woefully inadequate for \n     center-based and family day care homes already shut out too \n     many parents from the child care market.\n       The FOCUS Act: The purpose of the FOCUS Act is to establish \n     a Child care Provider Retention and development Grant \n     Program, a Child Care Provider Scholarship Program, and to \n     improve access to health coverage by child care workers and \n     their dependents in order to reward and promote retention of \n     committee, quality child care providers.\n       Child Care Provider Retention and Development Grant \n     Program: The FOCUS Act provides grants to states to \n     supplement the \n     wages of full-time child care workers who have a child \n     development associate (CDA) credential by at least $1,000. A \n     child care worker who has a Bachelors Degree in child \n     development or early child education shall receive a grant of \n     at least twice as much as grants made to providers who have \n     an Associates degree in the area of child development or \n     early child education. Grants to providers with an AA degree \n     shall be at least 150 percent of grants made to those with a \n     CDA. States shall provide grants in progressively larger \n     dollar amounts to child care providers to reflect the number \n     of years worked as a child care provider.\n       Child Care Provider Scholarships: The FOCUS Act provides \n     grants to states for child care providers who have been \n     employed for at least a year in the child care field--maximum \n     grant is $1,500, to further staff education and training. \n     FOCUS Act scholarships are not counted against other federal \n     education aid.\n       Health Care Coverage for Child Care Providers: The FOCUS \n     Act provides grants to states to provide better access to \n     health coverage for child care workers. States retain a great \n     deal of flexibility in determining how they will improve \n     access to health care and health coverage by child care \n     providers.\n       Funding: For FY 2004, the FOCUS Act authorizes $500 million \n     for wage and scholarship initiatives and $200 million for \n     health care initiatives. Such sums are authorized for fiscal \n     years 2005-2008.\n       Of the $500 million for wage and scholarship initiatives, \n     67.5 percent is for grants to attract and retain a quality \n     child care workforce and 22.5 percent is for scholarships to \n     promote a child care workforce better educated on childhood \n     development.\n       Set-aside: 3 percent for Indian Tribes and tribal \n     organizations.\n       Funding formula: based on the number of children under age \n     5 and the percentage of children receiving free or reduced \n     price lunches. 90/10 funding 1st year; 85/15 funding 2nd \n     year; 80/20 funding 3rd year; 75/25 funding fourth and \n     subsequent years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. McCain):\n\tS. 1199. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the outreach activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\tMr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that will help to ensure that all of our veterans know about Federal benefits to which they may be entitled by improving outreach programs conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\tI am please to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln, and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n\tThree years ago, the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, WDVA, launched a statewide program called ``I Owe You.'' Under the direction of Secretary Ray Boland, the program encourages veterans to apply, or to re-apply, for benefits that they earned from their service in the United States military.\n\tAs part of this program, WDVA has sponsored six events around Wisconsin called ``Supermarkets of Veterans Benefits'' at which veterans can begin the process of learning whether they qualify for Federal benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. These events, which are based on a similar program in Georgia, supplement the work of Wisconsin's County Veterans Service Officers and veterans service organizations by helping our veterans to reconnect with the VA and to learn more about services and benefits for which they may be eligible. More than 11,000 veterans and their families have attended the supermarkets, which include information booths with representatives from WDVA, VA, and veterans service organizations, as well as a variety of Federal, State, and local agencies. I was proud to have members of my staff speak with veterans and their families at a number of these events. These events have helped veterans and their families to learn about numerous topics, including health care, how to file a disability claim, and pre-registration for internment in veterans cemeteries.\n\tThe Institute for Government Innovation at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government recognized the ``I Owe You'' program by naming it a semi-finalist for the 2002 Innovations in American Government Award. The program was also featured in the March/April 2003 issue of Disabled American Veterans Magazine.\n\tThe State of Wisconsin is performing a service that is clearly the obligation of the VA. These are Federal benefits that we owe to our veterans and it is the Federal Government's responsibility to make sure that they receive them. The VA has a statutory obligation to perform outreach, and current budget pressures should not be used as an excuse to halt or reduce these efforts.\n\tThe legislation that I am introducing today was spurred by the overwhelming response to the WDVA's ``I Owe You'' program and the supermarkets of veterans benefits. If more than 11,000 Wisconsin veterans are unaware of benefits that may be owed to them, it is troubling to think how many veterans around our country are also unaware of them. We can and should do better for our veterans, who selflessly served our country and protected the freedoms that we all cherish. And it is important to address gaps in the VA's outreach program as we welcome home and prepare to enroll into the VA system the tens of thousands of dedicated military personnel who are serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places around the globe.\n\tIn order to help to facilitate consistent implementation of VA's outreach responsibilities around the country, my bill would create a statutory definition of the term ``outreach.''\n\tMy bill also would help to improve outreach activities performed by the VA in three ways. First, it would create separate funding line items for outreach activities within the budgets of the VA and its agencies, the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. Currently funding for outreach is taken from the general operating expenses for these agencies. These important programs should have a dedicated funding source instead of being forced to compete for scarce funding with other crucial VA programs.\n\tI have long supported efforts adequately fund VA programs. We can and should do more to provide the funding necessary to ensure that our brave veterans are getting the health care and other benefits that they have earned in a timely manner and without having to travel long distances or wait more than a year to see a doctor or to have a claim processed.\n\tSecondly, the bill would create an intra-agency structure to require the Office of the Secretary, the Office of Public Affairs, the VBA, the VHA, and the NCA to coordinate outreach activities. By working more closely together, the VA components would be able to consolidate their efforts, share proven outreach mechanisms, and avoid duplication of effort that could waste scarce funding.\n\tFinally, the bill would ensure that the VA can enter into cooperative agreements with State Departments of Veterans Affairs regarding outreach activities and would give the VA grant-making authority to award funds to State Departments of Veterans Affairs for outreach activities such as the WDVA's ``I Owe You Program.'' Grants that are awarded to State departments under this program could be used to enhance outreach activities and to improve activities relating to veterans claims processing, which is a key component of the VA benefits process. State departments that receive grants under this program may choose to award portions of their grants to local governments, other public entities, or private or non-profit organizations that engage in veterans outreach activities.\n\tI am pleased that this bill has the support of a number of national and Wisconsin organizations that are committed to improving the lives of our Nation's veterans, including: Disabled American Veterans; Paralyzed Veterans of America; Vietnam Veterans of America; the National Association of County Veterans Service Officers; the National Association of State Directors of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs; the Wisconsin Association of County Veterans Service Officers; the Wisconsin Department of Disabled American Veterans; the Wisconsin Department of Veterans of Foreign Wars; the Wisconsin Paralyzed Veterans Association; and the Wisconsin State Council, Vietnam Veterans of America.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: \n                                S. 1199\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent unhealthy, risky behaviors among teenage youth; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\tMr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am happy to be joining my colleague Senator Lindsey Graham in introducing the YMCA Healthy Teen Act. Senator Graham and I are introducing this bill along with Senators Bunning, Corzine, Daschle, DeWine, Durbin, Landrieu, Lincoln, Murray, Roberts, and Smith. This bipartisan legislation will address a critical issue for our Nation's future: the health of our children.\n\tUnfortunately, there has been an alarming trend in recent years towards increased obesity in our Nation's youth. On average, America's young people spend 4 hours a day watching television, 1 and \\1/2\\ hours a day listening to music, 30 minutes watching videos, and 20 minutes playing video games. Only 13 percent of students walk or bike to school. Only one State, Illinois, requires daily physical education in schools. The Surgeon General has reported that 13 percent of children and adolescents are overweight, more than double the number who were overweight in 1970.\n\tWe are rapidly becoming a country of the unfit, the inactive, and the unhealthy--and our young people are suffering the consequences of a sedentary lifestyle. If ignored, obesity in children leads to obesity in adulthood--and the numerous health problems that come with it including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. These five diseases alone account for more than two-thirds of all deaths in the United States, and caring for them comes at a tremendous cost to society--close to $117 billion annually.\n\tOn top of the need for increased physical activity and healthier lifestyles, the evidence is all around us that our young people today also need some extra care and support. Kids today face challenges and obstacles that I never dreamed about when I was growing up in Regent. Although recent promising evidence show that rates of smoking, drinking and the use of illegal drugs among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders fell simultaneously in 2002, still half of all high school seniors have reported using illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime.\n\tThese challenges arise in part from the temptations kids face when they have too much idle time on their own. Every day, millions of American teens are left unsupervised after school. Studies have shown that teens left unsupervised during those hours are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, engage in sexual activity, and become involved in delinquent behavior than teens who participate in structured, supervised afterschool activities. Also, nearly 80 percent of teens who are involved in afterschool activities are A or B students, while only half of those who are not involved earn those grades.\n\tTo address these crucial issues facing America's youth, I propose we turn to an exemplary organization dedicated to improving kids' lives, the YMCA. Nearly 2.4 million teenagers--1 out of every 10--are involved in a program offered by their local YMCA. In 2001, total membership rolls reached their highest level in history, with 18.3 million men, women, and children--half of them under 18--receiving a vast range of services from their local YMCAs.\n\n\tIn the past year and a half, I visited three of the six YMCAs that serve North Dakota teens. Through programs focused on education, healthy lifestyles, physical activity, leadership, and service learning, these North Dakota YMCAs helped 12,500 teens in my State develop character, build confidence, and become healthier within the last year alone.\n\tI have seen firsthand what a difference a safe, structured, and healthy afterschool environment can make for our youth. In those communities in North Dakota and across the country, the YMCA is a place to learn, a place to play sports, a place to meet friends, and a place to simply shed the problems that youths face every day in school and at home and just have some fun. North Dakota teens embrace the countless opportunities presented to them at their YMCAs with enthusiasm, and I have no doubt they are not alone.\n\tWhile the YMCA is national in scope, they are local in control and every program is designed and evaluated to meet the communities' unique needs. I am confident that this bill will help the YMCA to reach more teens and continue to provide successful solutions for our Nation's teens and families.\n\tTo serve more teens in need of healthier lifestyles and safe and structured afterschool programs, the YMCA has set the goal of doubling the number of teens served to one in five teens by 2005. This ambitious campaign is called the Teen Action Agenda.\n\tThe bill that Senator Graham and I offer today provides funding to help the YMCA reach teens who need safe and structured activities that will promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles. This piece of legislation authorizes Federal appropriations of $20 million per year for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 for the YMCA to implement its Teen Action Agenda. This funding would in turn be distributed to local YMCAs that are located in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. Similar legislation was passed in the 105th Congress for the Boys and Girls Club and in the 106th Congress for the Police Athletic League to aid in their efforts to reach out to youth.\n\tEach program funded through this initiative would include physical activity and nutritional education components, and could also focus on other health risks faced by teenage youths, such as tobacco, drugs, and risky behaviors that lead to injury and violence.\n\tThis bill will encourage public-private partnerships and leverage additional funding for teen programs. It contains a matching component that will be met by the YMCA through local and private support. The YMCA in 2001 raised $777 million in public contributions, double the annual contribution levels of a decade ago, and continues to grow and gain support from communities for its work. The matching component, along with the support the YMCA programs receive from national corporate sponsors, will turn $20 million in Federal funds into $50 million that will be invested in proven programs that serve teens who are most in need.\n\tAdolescence is an opportune time to instill in children positive eating habits and exercise routines that will carry over into adulthood. The YMCA is an established and proven organization that is in the position to reach out and influence thousands of teenagers. This legislation is an opportunity for us to do something for the health of our Nation's teenagers, when they now face greater risks and challenges than ever before. Again, for the sake of our children's future, I urge my Senate colleagues to join Senator Graham and me in cosponsoring this piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Campbell):\n\tS. 1203. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding distance education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\tMr. ENZI. Mr. President, one of the great benefits of the revolution in information technology has been its effect on education. With the information superhighway and the number of online research and information sources it has made available, modern technology and higher education have become inseparable.\n\tThe notion of distance learning and the access it provides to students--especially those in rural areas--could use a little more support, however, so that is why I am introducing the Distance Learning and Online Education Act of 2003.\n\tThis legislation builds on principles already found in the Higher Education Act to help reach populations that have traditionally been excluded from attending institutions of higher education.\n\tWyoming is a very rural State. There is only one four year school in the entire State, and there are only seven community colleges. If you include the University of Wyoming's satellite campuses, that adds up to nine institutions of higher education in an area of nearly one hundred thousand square miles. By contrast, there are one hundred twenty nine institutions of higher education in the State of Massachusetts, which makes up an area roughly one tenth the size of Wyoming. In fact, the only State that has fewer institutions of higher education is Alaska.\n\tExpanding access to higher education for our rural communities has been a challenge for many years. Now, the Internet has made it possible for prospective students in rural communities, far removed from the university campus, to attend college online. They may now spend their time studying, rather than commuting back and forth between school.\n\tAt present, the most significant barriers that distance learners and online education programs must face are those that were created by the Higher Education Act. Under current law, students attending institutions that enroll more than half of their students in distance programs are ineligible for Federal student financial assistance. As a result, many of the communities that this assistance is designed to reach have been excluded from sharing in its benefits, including students from rural communities, single mothers, working professionals, and a range of others who are interested in attending college but who cannot afford to do so.\n\tThe legislation that I introduce today corrects this problem by creating an avenue for online and distance educators to reach out to rural communities and non-traditional students by making them eligible for federal student assistance. It creates an eligibility standard for these institutions that helps to ensure they will provide high quality education programs, while it also protects Federal funding from fraud and abuse.\n\tThe Distance Learning and Online Education Act ensures students will receive a high quality education by requiring online educators to become accredited by an agency that has an appropriate focus on distance education. As provided under current law, the accrediting body must also be recognized by the Secretary of Education as an agency that can determine the institution's eligibility under Title IV of the Higher Education Act. This is a slightly higher standard than is expected of the brick and mortar institutions that have been entrusted with Title IV funding since the Higher Education Act was originally passed.\n\tMy bill will also protect against any fraud and abuse of Title VI funds by requiring distance educators to demonstrate their financial responsibility. In addition to meeting the default rates already established in current law, institutions interested in becoming eligible must also have a record free from audit findings or program review findings resulting in significant penalties for a period of at least two years. Distance learning institutions must also show that they have not had their participation in Title IV limited, suspended or terminated during the previous five years, and they must create a system of assurances that the student participating in the program is the individual completing the work.\n\tIt is clear that the shape of higher education in this country is changing and it will never be the same again. We have an opportunity, through technology, to reach student populations that have been excluded from participation in higher education because they cannot afford to attend or travel to classrooms or campuses located many miles from their homes. We can change part of the equation by changing the way we view those programs that hold the greatest promise for non-traditional students. Making them eligible for federal student assistance will go a long way toward making a higher education available to everyone with the interest in learning and the determination to get the job done. The Distance Learning and Online Education Act of 2003 will provide a hand up--not a hand out--to those whose interest in a higher education is limited only by their resources. By offering them a helping hand we can eliminate that obstacle and help a new generation achieve their goals and live their dreams.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to recognize the heritage of hunting and provide opportunities for continued hunting on Federal public land; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\tMr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hunting Heritage Protection Act. With the introduction of this important legislation, we are able to acknowledge our Nation's rich heritage of hunting. The purpose of this bill is to pass that legacy on to future generations by protecting and preserving the rights of our Nation's sportsmen and women.\n\tIn 2001 over 13 million Americans contributed over $20.6 billion to the U.S. economy while hunting--a true recreational activity. Many believe that in order to hunt you must own land, but that is not true. I believe that hunting should be available as a recreational activity for everyone.\n\tI have been an avid outdoor sportsman since my early adulthood. I am also an avid conservationist, like most other hunters. Mr. President, recreational hunting provides many opportunities to spend valuable time with children, just as I do with my son. He has been hunting since he was a young boy where he discovered and learned to appreciate one of the Earth's greatest treasures, nature.\n\tOver the years, hunters have contributed billions of dollars to wildlife conservation, by purchasing licenses, permits, and stamps, as well as paying excise taxes on goods used by hunters. Since the time of President Teddy Roosevelt, father of the conservation movement, sportsmen and women have been and will continue to be some of the greatest supporters of sound wildlife management and conservation practices in the U.S.\n\tHunters need to be recognized for the vital role they play in conservation in this country. The Hunting Heritage Protection Act will do just that. This bill formalizes a policy by which the Federal Government will support, promote, and enhance recreational hunting opportunities, as permitted under State and Federal law. Further, the bill mandates that Federal public land and water are to be open to access and use for recreational hunting where and when appropriate. I should clarify and stress that this bill does not suggest that we open all national parks to hunting. As I mentioned, the goal is simple--I want recreational hunting on our public land to be available to the citizens of this country where and when appropriate.\n\tIt is crucial that the tradition of hunting is protected and that the valuable contributions that hunters have made to conservation in this country are recognized. And, we want to ensure that Federal land management decisions and their actions result in a `no net loss of hunting opportunities'' on our public lands. This bill allows Congress to address this issue and to honor our Nation's sportsmen and women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):\n\tS. 1205. A bill to provide discounted housing for teachers and other staff in rural areas of States with a population less than 1,000,000 and with a high population of Native Americans or Alaska Natives; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\tMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murkowski, I rise to introduce the Rural Teacher Housing Act of 2003.\n\tMs. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will have a profound effect on the retention of good teachers, administrators, and other school staff in remote and rural areas of Alaska and in the rest of our Nation.\n\tIn rural areas of Alaska, school districts face the challenge of recruiting and retaining teachers, administrators and other school staff due to the lack of affordable housing. In one school district, they hire one teacher for every six who decide not to accept job offers. Half of the applicants not accepting a teaching position in that district indicated that their decision was related to the lack of housing options.\n\tRecently, I traveled throughout rural Alaska with Education Secretary Rod Paige. I wanted him to see the challenges of educating children in such a remote and rural environment. At one rural school, the principal must sleep in his office due to the lack of housing in that village. In the same village, there is not enough housing for each teacher to have their own separate home--several teachers must share a single home. Therefore, there is not enough room for the teachers' spouses.\n\tRural Alaskan school districts also experience a high annual rate of teacher turnover due to the dearth of affordable housing. Apparently, up to 30 percent of teachers leave rural school districts due to housing issues. How can we expect our children to thrive and to meet the mandates of the No Child Left Behind Act in such an educational environment? Clearly, the lack of affordable teacher housing in rural Alaska is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to ensure that children in rural Alaska receive an educational experience that is second to none and is also respectful of cultural differences.\n\tMy bill authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide funds to States to address the shortage of teacher housing in rural areas in Alaska and in the rest of our Nation. Specifically, my bill provides funds to States that have a population of 1 million or fewer people and include qualifying municipalities, which have populations of 6,500 or fewer people and also do not have direct access to either a State or interstate highway system. The appropriate state housing authority will accept such funds and will then transfer the funds to an eligible school district in a qualifying municipality. An eligible school district must be within the boundaries of an Indian reservation, one or more Alaska Native villages or land owned by one or more Alaska Native village corporations. This legislation will allow the eligible school districts to address the housing shortage in the following ways: construct housing units, purchase and rehabilitate existing housing units, or rehabilitate housing units that are already owned by a school district. Once this phase is complete, eligible school districts shall provide the housing to teachers or other school staff under terms agreed upon by the school district and the teacher or other staff.\n\tIt is imperative that we address this important issue immediately and allow the flexibility for the disbursement of funds to be handled at the local level. The quality of education of our rural children is at stake.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 160\n\n       Whereas the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \n     Nations determined that aquaculture is the fastest growing \n     food sector that provides animal protein for citizens of the \n     world;\n       Whereas global aquacultural production (including the \n     production of aquatic plants) has increased at an average \n     rate of 9.2 percent per year since 1970, compared with only \n     1.4 percent for capture fisheries and 2.8 percent for \n     terrestrial-farmed meat production systems;\n       Whereas freshwater aquacultural production increased from \n     15,900,000 metric tons in 1996 to 22,600,000 metric tons in \n     2001, marine aquacultural production increased from \n     10,800,000 metric tons in 1996 to 15,200,000 metric tons in \n     2001, and total aquacultural production increased from \n     26,700,000 metric tons in 1996 to 37,800,000 metric tons in \n     2001;\n       Whereas economic modeling predicts that global annual \n     consumption of fish and shellfish per person will increase \n     over time, from about 16 kilograms today to between 19 and 21 \n     kilograms in 2030, due to increased health consciousness and \n     the stronger demand for seafood products;\n       Whereas the United States imports more than 60 percent of \n     its seafood products, resulting in an annual seafood trade \n     deficit in excess of $7,000,000,000; and\n       Whereas section 7109 of the Farm Security and Rural \n     Investment Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-171; 116 Stat. 436) \n     reauthorized the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 (16 U.S.C. \n     2801 et seq.) until 2007, but did not adequately address \n     emerging national issues\n\n[[Page S7497]]\n\n     such as offshore aquaculture development, water quality \n     concerns, invasive species impacts, and a coordinated siting, \n     permitting, and licensing process: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls on the Federal Government \n     to actively pursue a unified approach to strengthen and \n     promote the national policy on aquaculture, including as \n     priorities--\n       (1) ensuring the sustainable development of production \n     where aquaculture is economically viable, environmentally \n     feasible, and culturally acceptable;\n       (2) analyzing the supply and demand for domestic and \n     exported aquacultural products to enable the United States to \n     compete in the global marketplace;\n       (3) increasing the availability of new technical and \n     scientific information that supports aquaculture development;\n       (4) with regard to marine aquaculture, providing \n     encouragement and identification of marine zones favorable to \n     aquaculture that take into consideration desired \n     environmental conditions and potential use conflicts; and\n       (5) establishing a goal of a 5-fold increase in United \n     States aquacultural production by 2025.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which \ncalls upon the Federal Government to actively pursue a unified approach \nto strengthen our national policy on aquaculture. The United States has \nallowed its seafood trade deficit to reach $7 billion by importing over \n60 percent of its seafood products from foreign countries, a \ndistressing statistic. My resolution calls for immediate action by \nlocal, State, and Federal agencies to cooperatively reduce this seafood \ntrade deficit. The United States must step forward to meet the growing \nconsumer demand for seafood products that are sustainable, economically \nviable, environmentally feasible, and culturally acceptable. In order \nto adequately address the seafood trade deficit, we must promote \naquaculture by committing to a five fold increase in U.S. aquaculture \nproduction by the year 2025.\n  As early as 1878, Congress supported the managed production of fish \nin the wake of a decrease in marine fisheries off the Atlantic Coast. \nAlmost 100 years later, our Nation made important strides to encourage \nU.S. aquaculture by enacting the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 to \ncoordinate all appropriate Federal programs and policies involving \naquaculture. Even though the National Aquaculture Act was reauthorized \nby P.L. 107-171 until the year 2007, the legislation still falls short \nof its goal to ensure coordination and promote a strong aquaculture \nindustry. Producers need improved guidance to clarify and simplify \nregulations pertaining to siting and environmental issues, particularly \nfor the timely development of aquaculture in offshore waters. The level \nof funding for research and development has been very, very low and \ntangible incentives for marine aquaculture have been lacking compared \nto those of the agriculture and fishing industries. Therefore, a new, \nunified Federal policy promoting aquaculture is vitally needed to \ntransform U.S. aquaculture into a major industry.\n  The current trends in aquaculture both worldwide and in the United \nStates necessitate prompt action by the Federal Government. The \ncontribution of aquaculture to global supplies of fish, crustaceans, \nand mollusks is growing by 9.21 percent annually. But aquaculture \nindustries in china, India, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia have greatly \nsurpassed the United States due in part to less expensive labor, lower \nproperty values, and weaker environmental regulations. In fact, the \ntotal value of aquaculture production is approximately $61 billion \nworldwide; of this, the $0.5 billion U.S. aquaculture industry is far \noutpaced by nations that have a 1 to 28 billion dollar value. Although \nU.S. aquaculture has been considered a minor industry over the years, \nit is rapidly becoming one of the fastest-growing industries and has \nvast, vast potential. The U.S. has two choices. We can either stand by \nand watch our seafood trade deficit grow larger than $7 billion or we \ncan seize this opportunity to promote a strong U.S. aquaculture \nindustry to produce healthier foods and economic benefits for our \ncitizens.\n  U.S. aquaculture development can meet the growing consumer demand for \nquality seafood products and, at the same time, relieve the pressure on \noverfished stocks. More than one billion people currently derive at \nleast 20 percent of their animal protein from fish, and studies have \npredicted that this demand for seafood will only increase over time. \nMeanwhile, half of the world's main fish stocks are fully exploited or \nproducing catches that have reached their maximum sustainable limits. A \nstrong U.S. aquaculture industry will result in a net contribution to \nworldwide food availability, economic growth, and improved living \nstandards.\n\n  In Hawaii, we are at the forefront of U.S. aquaculture through \nsupportive research and production efforts for marine aquaculture. \nHawaii first harvested offshore aquaculture products from sea cages in \n1999 and the State awarded its first commercial lease for offshore \naquaculture in State waters in the year 2001. The aquaculture \ntechnologies developed in Hawaii with high environmental standards can \nhelp lead the world in economically and environmentally sound \naquaculture practices.\n  The U.S. needs to invest in our aquaculture industry today. This \nresolution recognizes the importance of aquaculture and calls for a \ncoherent national approach to provide appropriate guidance for a \nsustainable aquaculture industry in different regions of the United \nStates.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which calls upon the Federal Government to actively pursue a unified approach to strengthen our national policy on aquaculture. The United States has allowed its seafood trade deficit to reach $7 billion by importing over 60 percent of its seafood products from foreign countries, a distressing statistic. My resolution calls for immediate action by local, State, and Federal agencies to cooperatively reduce this seafood trade deficit. The United States must step forward to meet the growing consumer demand for seafood products that are sustainable, economically viable, environmentally feasible, and culturally acceptable. In order to adequately address the seafood trade deficit, we must promote aquaculture by committing to a five fold increase in U.S. aquaculture production by the year 2025.\n\tAs early as 1878, Congress supported the managed production of fish in the wake of a decrease in marine fisheries off the Atlantic Coast. Almost 100 years later, our Nation made important strides to encourage U.S. aquaculture by enacting the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 to coordinate all appropriate Federal programs and policies involving aquaculture. Even though the National Aquaculture Act was reauthorized by P.L. 107-171 until the year 2007, the legislation still falls short of its goal to ensure coordination and promote a strong aquaculture industry. Producers need improved guidance to clarify and simplify regulations pertaining to siting and environmental issues, particularly for the timely development of aquaculture in offshore waters. The level of funding for research and development has been very, very low and tangible incentives for marine aquaculture have been lacking compared to those of the agriculture and fishing industries. Therefore, a new, unified Federal policy promoting aquaculture is vitally needed to transform U.S. aquaculture into a major industry.\n\tThe current trends in aquaculture both worldwide and in the United States necessitate prompt action by the Federal Government. The contribution of aquaculture to global supplies of fish, crustaceans, and mollusks is growing by 9.21 percent annually. But aquaculture industries in china, India, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia have greatly surpassed the United States due in part to less expensive labor, lower property values, and weaker environmental regulations. In fact, the total value of aquaculture production is approximately $61 billion worldwide; of this, the $0.5 billion U.S. aquaculture industry is far outpaced by nations that have a 1 to 28 billion dollar value. Although U.S. aquaculture has been considered a minor industry over the years, it is rapidly becoming one of the fastest-growing industries and has vast, vast potential. The U.S. has two choices. We can either stand by and watch our seafood trade deficit grow larger than $7 billion or we can seize this opportunity to promote a strong U.S. aquaculture industry to produce healthier foods and economic benefits for our citizens.\n\tU.S. aquaculture development can meet the growing consumer demand for quality seafood products and, at the same time, relieve the pressure on overfished stocks. More than one billion people currently derive at least 20 percent of their animal protein from fish, and studies have predicted that this demand for seafood will only increase over time. Meanwhile, half of the world's main fish stocks are fully exploited or producing catches that have reached their maximum sustainable limits. A strong U.S. aquaculture industry will result in a net contribution to worldwide food availability, economic growth, and improved living standards.\n\n\tIn Hawaii, we are at the forefront of U.S. aquaculture through supportive research and production efforts for marine aquaculture. Hawaii first harvested offshore aquaculture products from sea cages in 1999 and the State awarded its first commercial lease for offshore aquaculture in State waters in the year 2001. The aquaculture technologies developed in Hawaii with high environmental standards can help lead the world in economically and environmentally sound aquaculture practices.\n\tThe U.S. needs to invest in our aquaculture industry today. This resolution recognizes the importance of aquaculture and calls for a coherent national approach to provide appropriate guidance for a sustainable aquaculture industry in different regions of the United States. This coherent, comprehensive strategy will contribute to worldwide food availability while providing much-needed economic growth within the United States. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Daniel K.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 122, S. Res. \n116.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 116) commemorating the life, \n     achievements, and contributions of Al Lerner.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Alfred Lerner. \nAl, as he was called by those who knew him best, was a man of great \nsuccess and wealth but also great compassion and charity.\n  Al was born in New York City, graduated from Columbia College and \nproudly served in the Marine Corps as an officer and pilot from 1955 \nthrough 1957. The son of Russian immigrants, Al Lerner had an amazing \nsense of patriotism and was so proud to accept the Ellis Island Medal \nin honor of his immigrant heritage and individual achievements in 2002.\n  My personal relationship with Al developed because of the fondness we \nshared for the city of Cleveland, and Cleveland is a better place \nbecause of Al Lerner. His generosity was seen in well known ways such \nas his contributions to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, where \nthe Lerner Research Institute was founded, and to the Cleveland Clinic. \nIn fact, Al Lerner's $100,000,000 contribution to the Cleveland Clinic \nwas one of the largest donations to academic medicine in the history of \nthe United States. Al gave so much of himself to these institutions, \nserving as president and trustee of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and \nestablishing the Lerner Research Institute at the Clinic to conduct \nresearch of new treatments for cancer, coronary artery disease and \nAIDS.\n  Al Lerner also understood how important professional football is to \nthe city of Cleveland, and due in large part to his business savvy, \nLerner and his partner, Carmen Policy, were able to reestablish a \nfootball team in Cleveland. He was subsequently appointed chairman of \nthe National Football League Finance Committee, and I am confident that \nthe Cleveland Browns' 2002 playoff appearance, just 4 years after \nreturning to the league, had a great deal to do with Al's leadership\n\n[[Page S7508]]\n\nand guidance. I am not sure Cleveland would have its Browns today \nwithout Al Lerner's dedication and determination.\n  Despite his amazing success as the founder, chairman, and chief \nexecutive of MBNA Corporation, Al Lerner remained grounded. He helped \nraise funds through the company and the Cleveland Browns, for the \n``Cleveland Brown Hero Fund'' to aid families from the New York City \nFire and Police Departments who suffered the loss of a parent in the \ntragic September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Al also answered \nPresident Bush's call in the aftermath of September 11, and was a \nmember of the President's Foreign Advisory Board.\n  Throughout his lifetime, many of Al's other achievements could also \nbe observed in quieter ways that were never heralded. His dedication to \nhis family was remarkable. He married his high school sweetheart and \nbest friend, Norma. They shared 47 glorious years together and raised \ntwo children, Randy and Nancy. My wife Janet and I talked often about \nhow Al and Norma seemed to love each other and genuinely enjoyed each \nother's company. Perhaps the greatest contribution that the two of them \nmade was the strong example of a good marriage for their children, \nseven grandchildren, and anyone who know Al and Norma Lerner.\n  I am honored to have known and worked with Al Lerner and am confident \nthat his legacy will remain an example of hard work, philanthropy, and \ngenuine kindness for generations to come.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 116) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 116\n\n       Whereas Alfred Lerner (``Al'' to those who knew him best) \n     was a successful, humble, compassionate, and well respected \n     member of his family and community whose life was devoted to \n     civic involvement and efforts to improve the quality of \n     education and health care available to his fellow citizens;\n       Whereas Al Lerner was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1933, \n     graduated from Brooklyn Technical High School in 1951, and \n     received a B.A. from Columbia College in 1955;\n       Whereas Al Lerner was a Marine Corps officer and pilot from \n     1955 through 1957, displaying his love of country by wearing \n     his Marine Corps cap long after finishing his tour of duty, \n     and later was a director of the Marine Corps Law Enforcement \n     Foundation;\n       Whereas Al Lerner was the son of Russian immigrants, and in \n     2002 received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, which \n     celebrates immigrant heritage and individual achievements;\n       Whereas Al Lerner and his high school sweetheart, best \n     friend, and partner in life, Norma Lerner, shared 47 years of \n     marriage and were deeply committed to their 2 children, Randy \n     and Nancy;\n       Whereas Al and Norma Lerner made extremely generous \n     contributions to local and national charities, including a \n     contribution of $10,000,000 in 1993 to Rainbow Babies and \n     Children's Hospital in Cleveland, a donation of $16,000,000 \n     to support construction of the Lerner Research Institute, and \n     a donation of $100,000,000 to the Cleveland Clinic--one of \n     the largest donations to academic medicine in the history of \n     the United States;\n       Whereas Al Lerner served as president and trustee of the \n     Cleveland Clinic Foundation where the Lerner Research \n     Institute was established to conduct research of new \n     treatments for cancer, coronary artery disease, and AIDS;\n       Whereas Al Lerner, along with his business partner Carmen \n     Policy, reestablished a National Football League team in \n     Northern Ohio when he purchased the expansion Cleveland \n     Browns football organization in 1998, worked hard to make the \n     people of Cleveland and Northern Ohio proud of their football \n     team, and was subsequently appointed chairman of the National \n     Football League Finance Committee;\n       Whereas the Cleveland Browns, on the strength of Al \n     Lerner's leadership, reached the National Football League \n     playoffs following the 2002 season, only 4 years after \n     returning to the league;\n       Whereas Al Lerner served as founder, chairman, and chief \n     executive of MBNA Corporation, which employs thousands of \n     people in Ohio and is the Nation's largest issuer of \n     independent credit cards;\n       Whereas Al Lerner served as vice chairman, trustee, and \n     benefactor of Columbia College, which is now known as \n     Columbia University, and also served as a trustee for Case \n     Western Reserve University and New York Presbyterian \n     Hospital;\n       Whereas Al Lerner helped raise funds, through his \n     affiliation with MBNA and the Cleveland Browns, for the \n     ``Cleveland Browns Hero Fund'' to aid families from the New \n     York City Fire and Police Departments who suffered the loss \n     of a parent in the tragic September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks;\n       Whereas Al Lerner was appointed in 2001 by President Bush \n     as 1 of 15 members of the President's Foreign Intelligence \n     Advisory Board, which advises the President concerning the \n     quality and adequacy of intelligence collection, intelligence \n     analysis and estimates, counter-intelligence, and other \n     intelligence activities;\n       Whereas Al Lerner is survived by his wife, partner, and \n     best friend, Norma, their son Randy, their daughter Nancy, \n     and 7 grandchildren; and\n       Whereas Al Lerner passed away on October 23, 2002, and the \n     contributions he made to his family, his community, and his \n     Nation will not be forgotten: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors the life, achievements, and contributions of \n     Alfred Lerner; and\n       (2) extends its deepest sympathies to the family of Alfred \n     Lerner for the loss of a great and generous man.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "COMMEMORATING LIFE, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF AL LERNER\n\n\tMr. BENNETT.
