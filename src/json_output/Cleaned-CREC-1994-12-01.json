Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of H.R. 5110, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5110) to approve and implement the trade \n     agreements concluded in the Uruguay round of multilateral \n     trade negotiations.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the order, there shall be 9 hours of \ndebate remaining under the statutory time limitation with 2 hours under \nthe control of the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan], 2 hours under \nthe control of the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], and 5 \nhours under the control of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Packwood].\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Moynihan, the Senator from New York, \nis recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be \nrequired to make an opening statement on, as Reverend Halverson said, \nthis last day of the 103d Congress and the momentous--as I see it and \nmany do--decision we will make at the end of this day and at the end of \nthis Congress, which is the decision to ratify or not the legislation \nthat will put into effect the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade culminating 60 years of American trade policy that \nbegan with Cordell Hull in 1934.\n  The Washington Post has an editorial this morning which, in the view \nof this Senator, sums up the case with great clarity and force. I would \ntake the liberty, sir, of reading it to the Senate.\n  It says:\n\n       Until the Soviet Union collapsed, the military threat was \n     the glue that held the rest of the world together and \n     enforced political cooperation. Currently, it's beginning to \n     look as though trade is going to be the next organizing \n     principle, with trading relations and institutions becoming \n     the transition lines of political influence. Americans can \n     take great pride in the work that their country has done in \n     the past 50 years to bring stability and prosperity to a \n     dangerous world. Some dangers have now vanished with the end \n     of the Soviet Union, but others are appearing. Both for its \n     own interest and the world's, the United States has to remain \n     the central force in the world's trading system.\n\n  I think we would all agree on that, even if we disagree on the \nparticulars of the arrangements of the institutions, the facilities, \nthat we put in place. But the great point about our decision today is \nto consult our experience as well as our hopes and not simply our \nfeelings.\n  Trade is always an area that arouses concern among citizens, and ever \nhas done as far back as our Republic goes. In 1791, Alexander Hamilton, \nin his report on manufacturers, made a powerful case but a case that \nhad to be made that, no, it would not be enough for the United States \nsimply to remain a rural agricultural nation; that we had to be a \nmanufacturing and trading nation. We have been so ever since, never \nmore so than now.\n  This is the expanding sector of our economy, the one that brings--and \nI think it is fair to say, as the Washington Post observed it--not \nnecessarily more jobs, but a lot of better jobs, jobs with higher value \nadded, higher wages, and better, longer term prospects.\n  That, sir, is what brings us here on this final day, an era which we \ncan see as having begun in the depths of the Depression, with the \nrecognition of strong, able leaders--Franklin D. Roosevelt, Cordell \nHull--that we had to change what had been a pattern set for many years \nof protectionism and take the gamble which in the end has succeeded. \nAnd, having done so, I say this is the moment of decision.\n  I met today with my colleague and dear friend, the Senator from \nOregon [Mr. Packwood], who is necessarily delayed for a few moments.\n  I saw my friend from South Carolina visit the Chamber. He is here \nnow. I cannot believe that he will not return in force and with great \nvigor.\n  But, for the moment, it falls to me to welcome him this morning. I \nmade some opening remarks, and perhaps the Senator from South Carolina \nwould like to do so the same.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. \nHollings].\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I always enjoy the comments and \nexpression, and literally the education, I receive from the \ndistinguished Senator from New York. He has a profound sense of \nhistory.\n  What happens is that America should continue to lead in the trading \nsystem. Therein, in and of itself, is our difficulty. We are not \nleading; we are losing. Yes, we set the example in a losing fashion \nover 45, almost 50 years. It was almost like the Golden Rule: ``Do unto \nothers as they would do unto you.''\n  And we tried to set the good example of Adam Smith and David Ricardo \nof comparative advantage, open markets and free trade, which we all \nbelieve in. This Senator voted for free trade with the Free Trade \nAgreement with Canada. I strongly support the proposed free trade \nagreement with Chile, which we will be visiting in a few weeks, because \nwe have relatively the same standards of living, the same systems of \nopen markets--David Ricardo--comparative advantage. But the \ncompetition, according to Alexander Hamilton or Friedrich List, is \nmeasured not by a cheap shirt or what you can buy but what you can \nproduce. Decisions are made that weaken or strengthen the economy.\n  Interestingly, Mr. President, that is the example being followed \ntoday in Eastern Europe. You only have to read this week's special \nedition of Business Week. Romania, Hungary, and all the rest of these \nEuropeans now are not going for old David Ricardo and Adam Smith. They \nare going for Friedrich List, as the Germans long since have with their \ninterlocking directives and Japan with the Keiretsu, of course, out in \nthe Pacific rim. And so now, after the 60 years, which the \ndistinguished Senator points out, the change that has taken place with \nthe fall of the wall is that we should no longer sacrifice our economy \nto keep the alliance together. Yes, the editorial is correct, we kept \nthe alliance together. It worked and it deserves praise. But with this \nchange, now is the time to rebuild the economy of the United States; \nand the reality is that we are in decline. Everyone knows that. \nEveryone knows that. That is, the people of America know. That is what \nthe election was about, and the stupid politicians here in Washington--\nwe politicians--cannot recognize it. That is the frustration of the \nAmerican voter.\n  The American worker, yes, the most productive American worker, who is \nthe most productive in the world, is taking home 20 percent less pay \nthan what he was 20 years ago. His wife is having to go out and work to \nmake up for that loss of income. And then you have the latchkey \nchildren, and we politicians run around saying, ``I am for the family, \nand we have to get the children and mothers back together.'' We are \nseparating them with this GATT. Can they not see it? Can they not \nunderstand where the crime begins in the inner city of New York, with \n93,000 garment workers down there who will now lose their jobs, which \nwill flee to the Pacific rim? Everybody knows. Rather than creating \nenterprise zones, what we are doing here today at 6 o'clock is taking \nthe enterprise out of the zone. Leading? That Americans should continue \nto lead the world's trading system--I wish they had politicians and \nnewspapers made overseas. Washington would be out of business and long \ngone. They make everything else offshore. If we could only get \npoliticians and newspapers manufactured offshore, this crowd would \nlearn quickly.\n  Mr. President, the President went out there just a couple of weeks \nago to Indonesia, and every one of those countries in the Pacific rim \nwas at the meeting. We have a deficit in the balance of trade. Who is \nleading? Is the United States leading? They rebuffed us. The head of \ntrade in Malaysia and the head of trade in Indonesia said, ``We are not \ngoing along with this.'' To keep face, they want, of course, this \nparticular GATT, because this opens up the United States, as Senator \nBrown from Colorado pointed out. This opens us up entirely, but it does \nnot open up the Keiretsu or the closed markets of the Pacific rim. None \nwhatsoever. The GATT proponents defend the WTO rules. Do not worry \nabout the WTO rulings, they do not have to be obeyed, they say. But if \nnobody changes the laws in the United States, in the debate, ergo, they \ndo not change the laws of Japan or the Keiretsu. They cannot have it \nboth ways.\n  So the President is out there with a $150 billion deficit. They keep \ntalking exports, exports, exports. Fine. I export regularly from South \nCarolina. We built the ports there and we are proud of it. But look at \nthe entire picture, not like a CPA coming in and looking at your \nexpenses and not your income. You are faulty on income here in this \ncase. Your imports far overshadow--$150 billion worth--your exports. \nThere is the President with a $150 billion hole in his pocket and a tin \ncup begging the Japanese. Tell me about the fears of inflation. They \nkeep writing all those articles about inflation. But I asked Mr. Felix \nRohatyn at the GATT hearings that we had in the Commerce Committee and \nhe said, ``Yes, that is a good part of it.''\n  I said, ``Mr. Rohatyn, is it not a fact that we have depended on the \nJapanese, until recently, to buy 30 percent of our Treasury instruments \nto finance our debt? Is that not a fact? Now, is it not a fact that \nthey are threatening us every time we go there and tell them to open \nthe markets?''\n  Who is the Trade Representative? Ambassador Kantor or Secretary \nBentsen? Everybody with common sense knows it is Secretary Bentsen, \nbecause he has to finance our debt. So we give in and we have meetings \nwith the Japanese and praise each other and agree to negotiate, as with \nfinancial services, and we will come back again. Just like services \nthemselves. We have to negotiate those still. You have to go back to \nthe WTO. Senator Brown read the agreement.\n  But the reason for that tin cup in the hand is we have now subjected \nour economy and economic future to the whims of the Pacific rim \nfinancing our debt. We are in decline.\n  Heavens above, wake up, Washington. My friend John F. Kennedy wrote \nthe book, ``Why England Slept.'' They all say, ``Hollings is just for \ntextiles.'' I have been in textiles, yes, but I have been in an entire \npicture for 28 years up here. I testified before I got here in the \nfifties before the International Tariff Commission. I want to write the \nbook called ``Why America Continues To Sleep.''\n  Yes, we have a special session. I never intended it. I never thought \nthe President, not calling us back for a lame duck for health care, or \nfor welfare reform, and not calling us back for all the other issues we \nare interested in, such as the information superhighway, would call us \nback for GATT. We have until July 1995 on this one. No industrial \ncountry has adopted it, none. So we could easily debate it next year. \nWe debate complicated treaties. SALT I, SALT II, the ABM treaties. We \ncan put in reservations. We cannot do the same with this one, except, \nof course, for the distinguished minority leader, soon to become \nmajority leader, who goes to the White House and, as we read in a \nnewspaper, in a dignified fashion got his amendments. The Finance and \nWays and Means Committees have a right to amend. We will look at the \ngift to the Washington Post later.\n  We will look at these other things later. We will get like 10 New \nYork doctors on Carter's little liver pills. Under the agreement \nbetween the President and the future majority leader, we will get four \nor five court judges to make up their minds for us to see whether or \nnot we will have reservations.\n  They get amendments. I do not know what amendments they agreed to. We \ndo not. It is scandalous the way this Congress operates and this \nGovernment in Washington. Nothing has changed. They are wheeling and \ndealing. They are saying: I will take your budget-buster for GATT. You \ntake mine later on for capital gains. Do not be telling me about a veto \non capital gains, Mr. President, because it loses $25 billion. I am \ntaking a loss of $31 billion for you today to save your political hide.\n  Nothing has changed. Come on. And our country is in decline and \nbetter wake up and not lose. Start leading by rejecting this agreement \nand getting a good competitive trade policy.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time not be allocated to either side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is there time allotted for the Senator from New Mexico?\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is time under the control of the \nSenator from New Mexico. If the Senator opposes the point of order the \ntime is under the control of Mr. Packwood.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am sure that the Senator from Oregon \n[Mr. Packwood], would wish the Senator from New Mexico to have as much \ntime as he requires.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. How much time does the Senator require?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. About 15 minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be recognized for not to \nexceed 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Moynihan.\n  Mr. President, for some it must have seemed like this day would never \ncome. Hundreds of people, both here and abroad, have worked on the \nUruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations for the past 8 years; \n125 nations began the negotiations in Punta del Este in September 1986. \nOn April 15, 1994, 111 signed the final act in Marrakesh, and thus we \nare here. By signing that final act those 111 nations committed to \nbring the results before their respective legislatures for \nratification.\n  Several countries have ratified this agreement, the United Kingdom, \nGreece, and Belgium among them. France and Canada are very close and \nwill ratify this agreement this year. Japan will soon follow. The \nUnited States through the U.S. Senate in this Senator's humble opinion \nshould also vote to ratify this agreement.\n  My colleagues from the Finance Committee have ably spoken to the U.S. \nSenate and the Senators herein regarding the benefits to trade and \nnational welfare that the GATT agreement will afford to our country and \nour people, and I concur with those remarks.\n  I especially congratulate the soon-to-be chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for his eloquent remarks. I have listened to them. I openly \ncommend him for his explanation of what trade means to American jobs \nand what GATT could mean to American workers and American prosperity.\n  That is not to detract from other excellent statements to the \nAmerican people and to the Senate that have been made here on the \nfloor.\n  The merits of the Uruguay round agreement have not been nearly so \ncontroversial as the issue that I will speak about here today--how the \nagreement affects the Federal budget. By far the largest budget effect \nis the loss of revenues from reduced tariffs. The Congressional Budget \nOffice has estimated that the net revenue loss amounts to $11.5 billion \nover the first 5 years and $31.8 billion over 10 years.\n  This Uruguay round agreement cuts overall U.S. tariff collections by \n15 percent from what they otherwise would be. Everyone should \nunderstand, because of Budget Act points of order, consideration of \nthis implementing legislation requires 60 votes in the U.S. Senate. I \nwill explain this shortly.\n  It has been very difficult for the U.S. Congress to wrap its arms \naround the deficit. We tried at the 1990 summit conference, but at that \ntime we did not have a GATT agreement in mind. The Chair, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, was an active member of that \nbudget summit.\n  We came up with a concept, aside and apart from GATT, and it is \ncalled pay-as-you-go. It says, if a policy results in lower revenues, \nyou must make up the loss somewhere else with new revenues or with \nentitlement cuts. Now, frankly, that is very new, that 60-vote point of \norder for pay-go. It is very new to American legislation and certainly \nto the body of the Senate and our processes.\n  I, for one, believe it is among one of the five or six good new \nconcepts for budget control. It is easy to understand. It resonances \nnicely--pay-go. Everybody thinks that is right. You ought to pay as you \ngo. But the truth of the matter is that it is all based on estimates \nand all based on assumptions. What paygo does, in a sense, is put a big \npicket fence around the deficit.\n  But I must suggest we left a nice gate in the fence. There is a \nlittle gate in this fence. And the gate is a hard gate to get through--\n60 votes, supermajority. I submit that is precisely why we put that in \nand it finds itself right here on the floor.\n  When there is something of paramount American importance, you open \nthe gate and you say, ``Look, these rules are good, but these rules are \nnot impeccable. These rules are not things that cannot be violated.'' \nAnd if the GATT agreement is good for America, it appears to this \nSenator that you ought to open that gate in the fence. And that is why \nI support waiving this point of order and opening that gate in the \nfence.\n  Now I want to continue on to make sure that my constituents and those \nwho are interested in the views of somebody who has been working on the \nbudget for a long time and understands all this estimating, understands \nthe big current argument about dynamic evaluation of activities versus \nstatic. I am not one that jumps to the tune of either one, as if the \nrhythm is absolutely mandatory.\n  From my standpoint, I am looking for accuracy in these two apparently \nopposite systems of static versus dynamic. And that is at play here \ntoday. For those who would like me to say you do not need a waiver \nbecause if this was estimated with a dynamic model there would not be \nany revenue loss, I am not prepared to do that yet. We are going to \nhave a joint hearing with the House and Senate Budget Committees on the \ndynamic versus static issue. For the first time in the history of both \nbodies, both budget committees are going to have hearings to let the \npublic understand that.\n  But for now, I do not choose to say there is no effect on the \ndeficit, but I do choose to say it is rather minimal. And let me \nproceed to discuss that, having discussed that opening in that fence \nwith the gate that requires 60 votes to get around this wall.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, as a result of \nthis agreement, there will be following the results: In agriculture, \nthere will be a savings of $1.5 billion over the first 5 years and $5.2 \nbillion over 10 years. Now that means we will spend less on agriculture \nbecause of this agreement.\n  The overall net cost of the agreement to the Treasury before any \noffsets is $10 billion over the first 5 years under the current way of \nestimating. Over 10 years, the cost is $26.6 billion. However, the \nadministration and Congress worked together to structure a package of \noffsets. The entire agreement, offsets included, increases the deficit \nby $1.7 billion over 5 years, I say to Senator Moynihan, $1.7 billion \nover 5 years and $12 billion over 10 years.\n  Now I am not one that excuses spending because it is a small amount. \nBut I must put this one in perspective. This increase in the deficit \nrepresents two-tenths of 1 percent, I say to Senator Packwood, two-\ntenths of 1 percent of the total projected deficit for the next 5 \nyears, five-tenths of 1 percent of the total projected deficit for the \nnext 10 years--if, in fact, the numbers are right; if, in fact there is \nno positive influence on America starting out in the 6th, 7th, 8th year \nby getting rid of tariffs which have to work in our favor. I have heard \neveryone speak to that. It is unequivocal that getting rid of tariffs \nworks to our advantage.\n  So last May, Congress wrote a budget for this country by the adoption \nof a budget resolution which set a floor for revenues and a ceiling for \noutlays. The GATT implementing legislation, on its own, reduces \nrevenues below that floor and, therefore, as I indicated heretofore, \nviolates the budget resolution. The Budget Act defines this in section \n311(a) and talks about a point of order. It takes 60 votes to waive, as \nI have just indicated in my general explanation of the pay-go \nprovisions, which I think have generally been very good.\n  This same budget resolution modified the pay-as-you-go point of order \nestablished last year. Our pay-go enforcement makes it out of order to \nconsider legislation that, combined with all legislation enacted since \nAugust of 1993, would increase the deficit for any one of the following \nthree periods: 1995, 1995 to 1999, or 2000 to 2004. So I say to my \nfriends in the Senate, we are now out there in the 2000 and 2004 part \nof this.\n  Incidentally, that was not even the law a year and a half ago. We \nwent out 10 years, I say to Senator Moynihan, and heretofore we had \nonly gone out 5. So, in a sense, we are burdening GATT with a very, \nvery stern test when we are very tough on the evaluation of these \nactivities in terms of estimates.\n  So, based on the CBO scoring, it is obvious that GATT violates this \npay-go point of order, this fence around expenditures or loss of \nrevenues for the last two thresholds and is subject to this point of \norder.\n  I urge that the Senate vote to waive this point of order. And, as I \nhave indicated, generally I do not do that lightly but I believe the \n60-vote point of order was there clearly intended to give us the \nopportunity to not have to comply with pay-go when we find it is in the \nnational interest to do otherwise.\n  The administration knew the budget effects of this agreement and knew \nprecisely what they would be. They proceeded to try their hardest, as I \ncan determine, to find ways to offset the costs and it was not their \nwish to run into points of order over GATT. People worked tirelessly \nhere in the Congress and in the administration for months to work out a \nfunding package for this agreement.\n  I can remember 8 months ago talking to both Senator Moynihan and \nSenator Packwood about that. So we have been all busy doing it. We \ncould accomplish it mutually and we had to do it with the \nadministration and the Congress.\n  Since the agreement with all the offsets will still increase the \ndeficit, this point of order lies. And so we are confronted with the \nfacts as I have described them with this rather small effect if it all \nworks out that way, and do we have a GATT or do we not based upon those \nrather small and almost insignificant budget effects.\n  Mr. President, our budget rules are tough. They are very tough. They \nwere meant to be. And I think of the rules, as I have indicated before, \nare like a fence with a gate. We have this small gate, but we are \npenalized when we use it and we have to get 60 votes. I support waiving \nthis Budget Act for purposes of considering the GATT implementation \nlanguage and we simply have too much to lose if we miss this \nopportunity.\n  In the field of economics that is known for diverse answers to the \nsame question, there is a remarkable agreement on the benefits of GATT \nto our people. So where economists differ on many things there is \nalmost a unanimous concurrence that GATT is good for American workers \nand for our future. So, if we fail to waive, we are letting all that go \ndown the drain because of a 60-vote point of order that I have done my \nvery best to describe in terms of its impact.\n  Incidentally, the United States is not the only winner. Reducing \ntrade barriers is not a zero sum game where some countries benefit at \nthe expense of others.\n  The positive, overall effects of GATT are long term and accrue to all \ncountries participating. With free trade--and free trade causes \ninvestment and capital formation--workers become more productive, the \neconomy grows, and jobs increase. Household incomes rise.\n  While we do not score the future expected economic growth for budget \npurposes, in this case we can be pretty sure it is going to happen. \nThis is one of the cases where we need to crack the gate open, as I \nhave indicated, and fit this legislation through it and waive the pay-\ngo.\n  In my mind, this is not a vote on whether we increase the budget \ndeficit. It is a vote for free trade. So for those who are using the \nbudget waiver as an excuse, or for their justification, the truth of \nthe matter is this is not a budget vote. It is a free-trade vote. Those \nwho oppose free trade clearly can use any reason they like. But I \nbelieve the view is very shortsighted that predicates a vote against \nGATT on budget and budget activities.\n  Mr. President, I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I yield the Senator 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dorgan). The Senator may proceed for 5 \nadditional minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Frankly, this GATT agreement will do more for the long-\nterm economic growth and for our people's prosperity than anything else \npassed in the 103d Congress. And I believe that. Most of what we did \nhas some very measurable impacts and much of it has both negatives and \npositives. GATT, as an instrument of change in the way the world \nmarkets work, is the most significant legislation that we will pass \nhere in the whole 103d Congress, and I stand on that and I believe \nthat.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to briefly address a couple of \nimportant issues that citizens in my State and many others have brought \nto our attention. They are legitimate, valid concerns and deserve \nattention.\n  First and foremost, the GATT agreement does not threaten U.S. \nsovereignty. Let me repeat. I know people in New Mexico, many of them \ngood, solid friends of mine, have been talking about sovereignty. In \nthis Senator's opinion, the GATT agreement does not threaten U.S. \nsovereignty. All living Presidents, former Secretaries of State, all \nformer Trade Representatives of the United States, as well as many \nconstitutional scholars, including Robert Bork, are convinced that this \nagreement does not impede U.S. sovereignty.\n  Among all of those people, would any of them want to deny our \nsovereignty? I do not believe so. I do not believe this Senator wants \nto, and I do not believe the 61 Senators who hopefully are going to \nvote for waiver really want to deny our sovereignty.\n  Simply put, the World Trade Organization cannot change U.S. law. The \nWTO cannot change a U.S. law because only the U.S. Congress can change \na U.S. law. Therefore, even if the World Trade Organization made a \nruling that would go against an existing U.S. law, the U.S. law could \nnot automatically be changed to conform to the World Trade Organization \nruling. A U.S. law can only be changed if the U.S. Congress votes to \nchange the law.\n  A final safeguard to U.S. sovereignty is that if at any time the \nUnited States becomes dissatisfied, it can withdraw from the World \nTrade Organization after giving 6 months' notice. That is a pretty good \nescape hatch. In the event the WTO becomes arbitrary or capricious, we \nget out.\n  Another important concern has to do with why should we do this in \nthis session; why should it not be delayed? Many of my constituents are \nasking that. The answer is, this is not a ``rush'' to approve an \nagreement. The GATT has been negotiated for over 8 years by Presidents \nReagan, Bush, and Clinton. The Congress has had ample time to review \ncarefully the specifics of this multilateral trade agreement, and it is \ntime to make a decision one way or another.\n  There are Senators who have read much of this. There are some who \nhave read every word in it. And one of the overriding reasons why we \nneed to make this decision sooner rather than later is that delay in \napproving this means that other nations will continue to impose high \ntariffs on U.S. goods. This is costly to each and every American. The \nUnited States should protect its valued business interests and jobs. \nAccording to some estimates, a belated passage of GATT implementing \nlegislation could cost us as much as $7 billion in lost production over \n1 year alone, as well as thousands of jobs. Given these onerous costs, \nI believe the time is now. I submit to people around the country and \npeople in the State of New Mexico that we have had plenty of time, over \nthree Presidencies, to work on this and get it where it is. I do not \nbelieve it needs to be delayed any longer.\n  Another important concern some have in our country, and in my State, \nis that this agreement appears to be a treaty and, thus, requires a \ntwo-thirds vote by the U.S. Senate. It is important to point out this \nis not a treaty. It was not negotiated as such. It has always been \nconsidered an executive agreement by all parties involved. As such, \nGATT is about the issue of commerce with foreign nations, and under \nArticle I of the Constitution, the Congress has the power to regulate \ncommerce with foreign nations. Hence, only a majority vote in both \nChambers of Congress is required. If it were considered a treaty, then \nthe U.S. Senate would be required under the Constitution to pass it by \na two-thirds vote. However, this is not the case, and I believe the \nconstitutionality of this kind of executive agreement is well \nestablished. I do not choose to go into the legal opinions, but I \nbelieve it is established.\n  A final question of special concern is that GATT requires that every \nUnited States citizen receive an identification number at birth, and \nthat this matter is unrelated and irrelevant to matters of trade. The \nanswer is that this requirement is included in the implementing \nlanguage of GATT; it is not part of the GATT itself. This language was \nincluded in the implementing legislation because to ensure accurate \nassessments of income taxes, improper deductions on tax returns must be \nminimized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is the Social Security number.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Social Security number, that is right. As a \nconsequence, this section is designed to reduce tax cheating by people \nwho claim children they do not have, which has the effect of reducing \ntheir taxes. This is important because it has a significant effect on \nthe amount of tax revenue collected, which directly correlates with the \noverall net cost of the agreement to the U.S. Treasury. Therefore, the \nUnited States has decided that it is critical to maintain an accurate \naccounting of its taxable population.\n\n  Mr. President, as I stated earlier, I believe this legislation is \nextremely advantageous for our long-term economic growth and our \nAmerican prosperity. It is as fiscally disciplined as it can \nrealistically be. It is something we must pass to achieve better \nstandards of living in our own country and around the world. I have \nreviewed this agreement carefully, and I am satisfied that it is in the \nbest interests of our citizens. I am, therefore, confident that the \nGATT should be approved.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon, the Chair is \ninformed, has 4 hours and 38 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Four hours and 38 minutes remaining? I thank the Chair.\n  I ask that only for this reason. Senator Grassley is here ready to \nspeak. Does Senator Hollings have any objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Go right ahead. No.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I am going to give him 15 minutes. But I will say this. \nI have 17 speakers left who have said they wanted to speak. I just know \nwhat is going to happen as they begin to get here in the afternoon. \nThey are going to want 10 or 15 or 20 minutes with 2 hours to go, and I \nwill say, for those who want to speak, if they will come over now they \nare more likely to get 10 or 15 or 20 minutes than they are this \nafternoon.\n  With that, I will yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, will my friend from Oregon allow me just \none moment to say that in our case, we are in yet more straitened \ncircumstances. We have 1 hour 55 minutes. The leader will have to have \nsome time. Probably no more than 10 Senators, at most, can be \naccommodated. There will be a limit of 10 minutes. I hope those who \nwish to speak will let us know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa for \n15 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nwaive the budget point of order and to support the GATT.\n  As my colleagues know, I yield to no one in this Chamber in my desire \nto cut spending and reduce the deficit. The National Taxpayers Union \nrecently rated my voting record as one of the three most fiscally \nconservative in the Senate.\n  I believe it is important that we have the fiscal discipline to pay \nfor tax cuts with reductions in spending or increased revenues.\n  That is why I joined several of my colleagues in signing a July 15 \nletter to President Clinton asking that the administration provide the \nnecessary spending cuts and revenues to make up for the tariff revenues \nthat will be lost under GATT.\n  The Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimated at that time that \nimplementation of GATT will mean a loss of approximately $12 billion in \nrevenues over the next 5 years. The administration's proposed spending \ncuts and revenue increases would limit this loss to only $2.5 billion \nover the next 5 years according to CBO.\n  I am pleased that the July 15 letter was effective in forcing the \nadministration to greatly limit the amount of lost revenues. I am \ndisappointed that the administration did not show the leadership to \nprovide the spending cuts necessary to avoid a budget point of order.\n  However, the $2.5 billion in lost revenues is dwarfed by the costs of \ndelaying GATT and attempting to find the additional funds. The \nDepartment of the Treasury has estimated that postponing the \nimplementation of GATT will cost the United States $70 billion in lost \nproduction over the next 10 years.\n  The Department of the Treasury also estimates that a 6-month delay in \nimplementation will reduce U.S. employment by an average of 25,000 a \nyear over the next decade. These costs greatly overshadow the $4.5 \nbillion in lost revenue.\n  The Department of the Treasury numbers are supported by what I'm \nhearing from my fellow Iowans. In Iowa, many business men and women and \nespecially farmers tell me that they need GATT now. It is my \nunderstanding from them that 100's of millions of dollars are at stake \nfor Iowa companies and workers. Enormous grain sales could be lost to \nunfair EC subsidies if we fail to pass GATT now.\n  Due to this year's bumper crop, there are now mountains of corn in \nIowa. It is imperative to Iowa's economy that this corn reach overseas \nmarkets. Iowa State University estimates that GATT will mean a net \nincrease in farm income of $225.5 million in Iowa by 2002.\n  In considering my vote on this waiver, it was necessary to weigh the \nlong-term impact. While the budget deficit is a top priority for me, \nthere is no question that GATT will be a tremendous boon to our \nNation's workers and the economy. GATT will especially benefit \nagriculture in our Nation--good news for farmers and for Iowa. A \ngrowing economy is crucial if we are going to successfully address the \ndeficit.\n  The budget shortfall is half-a-billion dollars a year. While the \nbudget aspect should be a serious concern, an even more serious concern \nis growth, prosperity and competitiveness. The flow of exports from \nIowa and the United States to greater markets will help bring us these. \nWe can't let half-a-billion dollars a year get in the way of that. It \nwould be like building a beaver dam to stop up the Mississippi. It \nwould do nothing but no good.\n  As my colleague Senator Domenici, the incoming chairman of the Senate \nBudget Committee, made clear earlier today, the authority to waive the \nBudget Act was put into the law by design to provide the Senate a gate \nto disregard the budget rules when it is in the best interests of the \nAmerican people. GATT is certainly a case where we must crack open that \ngate in the budget rules. GATT is without question in the best \ninterests of the American people.\n  I have voted in the past to waive the budget rules when I believed it \nwas in the long-term interests of the American people. In 1992, I voted \nto waive the budget act to allow for an extension of emergency \nunemployment benefits. Given the state of our Nation's economy at the \ntime, I thought it was important that we provide additional benefits to \nfamilies in need.\n  Similarly, it does not make sense to me now to jeopardize the \ntremendous benefits to working families across America and throughout \nIowa from free trade because of the administration's failure to provide \nsufficient spending cuts.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nbudget waiver so we can pass this landmark, worldwide agreement.\n  Mr. President, very soon we will be voting on the GATT implementing \nlegislation, one of the most important pieces of economic legislation \nsince the end of World War II. It is also one of the most \ncontroversial.\n  Many opponents of the agreement have bombarded the American people \nwith the claims that they have nothing to gain and a great deal to lose \nfrom implementation of this agreement: U.S. sovereignty will be \nsacrificed they say; our environmental and sovereignty will be \nscarified they say; our environmental and health standards will be \nendangered; and unemployment will soar.\n  These are frightening prospects, and if they were true I would be the \nfirst to oppose this agreement. But all the ranting from soapboxes \ndoesn't make the opponents arguments true. In fact, these predictions \nare about as accurate as the one about the giant sucking sound NAFTA \nwas supposed to produce, which has proven to be demonstrably false.\n  This is not meant to suggest that the concerns expressed by my \ncolleagues during this debate are without merit. I share many of these \nconcerns, such as the use of child labor in many countries, and will do \nwhatever I can to correct these problems. But I believe we can address \nthese problems more effectively as the most influential member of the \ninternational trading community, as opposed to rejecting this agreement \noutright.\n  For each of us however, the failure to secure certain more parochial \nconcerns should have no impact on our decision whether to support GATT. \nSimply put, the removal of trade barriers generally will promise global \ncompetitiveness and greatly improve the standard of living both here \nand abroad.\n  A look at GATT shows it is an economic winner for the United States. \nEconomists, both Liberal and Conservative, agree that ratification of \nthe agreement will add $100 to $200 billion to the U.S. economy each \nyear, and create thousands of jobs, particularly in the high value-\nadded, high-productivity, high-wage industries that produce the types \nof jobs our economy needs.\n  Let's look at the sectors of our economy that will benefit from this \nagreement:\n  Foreign tariffs on telecommunications equipment and wood products \nwill be lowered and tariffs on agricultural machinery, construction \nequipment, pharmaceuticals, toys, and furniture will be phased out, \nthereby bolstering exports of these products. High-Technology goods \nwill be especially helped.\n  The aircraft industry will benefit from lower subsidies to its \nforeign competitors.\n  Stronger protection of intellectual property will help those \nindustries that have suffered from piracy or product counterfeiting, \ncosting us billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.\n  And especially important to Iowa, exports of agricultural products \nwill rise because of reductions in export subsidies and tariffs in \nEurope, as well as requirements for minimum import access in all \ncountries.\n  My colleagues have discussed the positive impact GATT will have on \nother sectors of the economy, so I would like to focus on the benefits \nof implementing the Uruguay round to Iowa agriculture. Perhaps the most \nsignificant accomplishment of the Uruguay round is the reduction in \ntariffs and export subsidies for agricultural products. The tariff \nreductions will lead to increased access to foreign markets for U.S. \ncommodities--leveling the playing field in the world market for trading \nagricultural goods. The reduction in export subsidies will force our \nforeign competitors to cut their support for agricultural exports--\nagain, leveling the playing field for U.S. producers.\n  How will these liberalized trade rules benefit agriculture? Although \nthe United States is currently running a trade deficit, we enjoy a \nhealthy trade surplus in agricultural goods. So even though our foreign \ntrading partners erect high barriers to U.S. agriculture imports and \nheavily subsidize their own exports, the United States still exports \nmore agricultural commodities than it imports. This is a result of the \nU.S. farmer being the most efficient producer in the world. Because of \nthe wide advantage in productivity enjoyed by the U.S. farmer, we will \nbe able to export even more agricultural products when worldwide \nbarriers and subsidies are lowered.\n  The importance of exports to the agriculture sector and the \nindividual farmer cannot be overstated. In any given year, the United \nStates sells about 70 percent of its wheat, 40 percent of its corn and \n60 percent of its soybeans in the world market. This year, exports take \non increased significance. The harvest of 1994 has resulted in record \nsupplies of corn and soybeans. According to the USDA, the U.S. corn \ncrop could exceed 10 billion bushels for the first time in history and \nsoybeans should set a record at about 2.5 billion bushels. There are \nliterally mountains of grain in Iowa that need to be moved to market. \nHowever, the demand for grain in the United States is not sufficient to \nliquidate these supplies. Therefore, exporting this grain to foreign \nmarkets is essential to the viability of the family farmer.\n  Clearly the family farmer and farm-related workers will benefit from \nGATT. Consider some projections regarding Iowa farmers, for example. \nThe center for agricultural and rural development at Iowa State \nUniversity has concluded that Iowa producers of corn, soybeans, pork, \nand beef all benefit to a large degree under the Uruguay round. As a \nresult of increased trade in these commodities, Iowa State economists \nproject cash receipts of corn to increase $184 million, receipts from \nhogs will increase $110 million, soybean receipts will rise by $83 \nmillion and, finally, cattle cash receipts are expected to increase $92 \nmillion. The bottom line is that Iowa net farm income is projected to \nrise over $200 million per year from 1995 to 2002. I want to stress \nthat these figures are just for Iowa farmers alone. The impact on the \nU.S. agricultural economy is just as dramatic. Cash receipts for \nagriculture products are projected to rise $5 billion by the year 2002 \nwith net farm income rising $1.4 billion per year from 1995 and 2002. \nAlthough these figures are dramatic, my intent is not to befuddle the \nAmerican public by citing a number of estimates and projections. The \nbasis for these projections is simple: Increased access to the world \nmarketplace will increase agricultural exports which, in turn, will \nincrease the net income for the American farmer and those associated \nwith farming.\n\n  And in regard to the budget issue that has been raised by some of my \ncolleagues, in agriculture alone there are a number of budgetary \nconsequences that are receiving little or no attention. For example \nwithout new export markets opened by GATT, U.S. surplus farm production \nwill cost the Government more in storage costs, create higher \ndeficiency payments and require export subsidies to continue the \nagricultural subsidy battle with the European Union. So rejecting GATT \ncould hurt, not help efforts to reduce the budget deficit.\n  Let us not forget that the United States has the lowest tariffs in \nthe world, so GATT will mean that tariffs of other countries will come \ndown. So GATT is more in our interest than that of other nations. When \nforeign tariffs are brought down, the playing field will be level. And \nas the most productive nation on Earth, we can compete with anyone and \nwin.\n  In the final analysis, my support for this agreement is based on the \nfact that GATT is good for America; GATT is good for Iowa; and GATT is \ngood for world prosperity.\n  I would now like to deal with some of the arguments that have been \nfilling the airwaves lately, that come close to predicting the end of \nthe world as we know it if GATT passes. The bone of contention for \nopponents is the provision in GATT that creates the World Trade \nOrganization and gives it the authority to arbitrate and settle \ndisputes between international traders. Opponents claim the WTO would \ninfringe upon U.S. sovereignty making the laws of the land subservient \nto an international tribunal. They have created the impression that the \nWTO was foisted on the United States by countries who want nothing more \nthan to invalidate our laws. The arguments ignore the plain facts. The \nWTO was suggested and fought for by the United States out of \nfrustration with the weakness of, and delays in, GATT dispute \nsettlement proceedings and enforcement. For example, U.S. farmers \nsuffered greatly from the European refusal to abide by several GATT \npanel rulings on agricultural products and the lack of effective \nenforcement rules. Under the WTO procedures, countries that \ndiscriminate against U.S. products can no longer ignore adverse \nrulings. And it is worth noting that the United States has won 80 \npercent of the cases it has brought to GATT since 1947.\n\n  With regard to U.S. sovereignty, I can state without fear of \ncontradiction that no Member of Congress is going to vote against the \nsovereignty of our Nation. This Senator certainly will not do that. But \nthis argument is as false as all the others. Let me quote from the \nimplementing legislation which states that ``nothing in this act shall \nbe construed to amend or modify any law of the United States, including \nany law relating to the protection of human, animal, or plant life or \nhealth, the protection of the environment, or worker safety.'' The \nlegislation also provides in section 102 that ``no provision of GATT * \n* * that is inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have \nany effect.'' So the implementing legislation emphasizes Congress' \ncommitment to ensuring that the United States and not the WTO will \ndetermine the primacy of U.S. laws.\n  And the opponents conveniently overlook the fact that if we don't \nlike what's happening with the WTO, we can withdraw at any time by \ngiving 6 months notice. And thanks to Senator Dole, we will have \nanother withdrawal option, given to Congress, if a review panel decides \nthat WTO decisions against the United States have been arbitrary or \ncapricious. And if that is not enough, there is a provision in the \nagreement that gives Congress the right to review our situation under \nGATT after 5 years and if we don't like what we see we can withdraw at \nthat time. With all these safeguards, it is hard to see how our \nsovereignty is at stake.\n  The plain truth is we are the greatest economic power on the planet, \nand our influence will be respected. In fact, the WTO will operate \nunder the first rule of international trade: Do unto others as you \nwould have them do unto you. If that principle is ignored, then the \nopposite rule will take effect: He who has the gold, rules. We will \ndominate the WTO by that simple fact alone. Simply our threat to \nwithdraw will be enough, because who can imagine a WTO without the most \nprestigious and largest member of the International Economic Community.\n  Let us bear in mind that membership in GATT is not a lifetime \ncommitment. It is, in fact, a voluntary association which we benefit \nfrom because it will require other countries to play by the same rules \nwe have been playing by for years. There is simply no basis to the \nargument that our sovereignty is in danger, and I want my constituents \nto know that this argument is not valid.\n  Another argument that has people in an uproar is the one that says \nCongress should not deal with such an important issue during a lameduck \nsession. Well, Congress has dealt with many matters of enormous \nimportance to the Nation in post-election sessions.\n  Since 1950, there have been six post-election sessions. In those \nsessions, Congress has passed well over 150 bills, resolutions and \nconference reports involving matters of national security, economic \npolicy, foreign policy, and Government spending. During these sessions \nCongress has ratified treaties, approved a budget and budget \nresolutions, approved major environmental measures, passed a mass \ntransit bill and authorized numerous appropriations.\n  Every Member in this body was duly elected by his or her constituents \nto serve in the 103d Congress, so any suggestion that this post-\nelection session lacks ``standing'' or ``legitimacy'' is not legally \nsupportable. This is the argument one makes when he knows he can not \nwin on the merits. It is simply a smokescreen for delay to give the \nopponents of GATT more time to appeal to people's fear and insecurity.\n  Americans have always had a high view of our Nation. We think we \nstand for something important, and that its worth offering the world. \nAnd the world is listening, as more and more countries try to emulate \nus. When you are No. 1, the only superpower, the only Nation with a \nglobally appealing ideology, when you want to keep America first, that \nis the time to promote free trade to open markets to American products. \nGATT does that, and we should pass it now.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado, Senator Hank Brown, \nis recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President. I simply wanted to thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee for entering into the \nRecord yesterday, following my talk, the portion of the cost of GATT \nthat the United States now pays which is a little under 15 percent. Our \nshare of GATT's cost is based on our share of international trade. In \nmy statement yesterday, I mentioned the U.S. contribution could be as \nhigh as 25 percent. This was from an understanding that we may shift to \na formula used by the United Nations which is based on a member \ncountry's portion of the total world GDP, and from other proposed \nchanges in the assessment of members' contributions to the World Trade \nOrganization [WTO] that may take place soon.\n  According to the State Department, the size of a member country's \neconomy will be a consideration in calculating its contribution to help \npay for the new WTO. It is likely that some modifications will be made \nin the contributions to the WTO based on each member's portion of the \ntotal world GDP. Our current portion of the total world economy is 23 \npercent.\n  Also, beginning in 1996, each GATT member country's contribution will \nreflect its share in international trade in goods, services, and \nintellectual property. Thus, the U.S. contribution to WTO will \nsignificantly increase because we have the largest trade in service and \nintellectual property in the world.\n  The chairman's figures are exactly correct that we currently pay 14.6 \npercent of GATT's costs. I appreciate very much him taking the time to \nenter them into the Record to set it straight.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I express my great admiration for \nthe graciousness and thoughtfulness of the Senator from Colorado, who \nis meticulous in these matters. If there is any one of us in this \nChamber who has not had some statistics go awry from time to time, I do \nnot know who that would be. I do very much appreciate his remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nOregon for yielding time to me.\n  Mr. President, after undertaking a careful review of the Uruguay \nround, I am convinced the GATT agreement provides an unprecedented \nopportunity to benefit the United States, create new high-paying jobs, \nand strengthen our economy. The Uruguay round is the most comprehensive \ntrade agreement in history. It breaks down foreign trade barriers and \nopens markets to U.S. goods, services, and agricultural products. Since \nthe United States already has the most open market in the world, this \nmeans more export opportunities for our side.\n  Mr. President, in looking at the agreement and being in meetings with \ncolleagues, talking to administration and former administration \nofficials, I have assimilated a body of information which I am pleased \nto share with the Senate in writing. I have labeled this information, \nthat I ask be printed in the Record, ``GATT Agreement Facts.''\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric, we have heard a lot of fears, we \nhave heard a lot of arguments, and we have heard a lot of speculation. \nWhat the Senate needs to focus its attention on right now are the \nfacts. I asked my staff to try to sift through all of this information \nthat we have accumulated during this process and to put down on paper \nwhat the facts are. The facts are overwhelmingly persuasive, in my \nview, in favor of approval of this agreement, and in waiving the so-\ncalled ``budget rule'' to accomplish the approval of this agreement.\n  I am going to highlight just a few of these facts in the brief time \nthat is available to me, and then ask it all be made a part of the \nRecord.\n  The United States accounted for almost 12 percent of all world \nexports in 1992. We are the world's largest exporting country. We sell \nmore of what we produce in the international marketplace than any other \ncountry.\n  Trade represents approximately one-fourth of our gross domestic \nproduct. Over the last 5 years, U.S. exports accounted for half of our \ntotal U.S. economic growth.\n  The reason these facts are important to me is very obvious. If we are \nable to lower barriers to our trade throughout the world, then those \ngrowth numbers are going to be even higher in the years ahead, above \nwhat are already projected to be opportunities for more growth in \nexports.\n  It benefits us more than any other country to lower barriers and to \nremove unfair barriers to our trade. This agreement will cut tariffs on \nmanufactured goods by over one-third, the largest cut in history.\n  The agreement will bring important areas such as services, \nintellectual property, and agriculture under international rules for \nthe first time. Why is that important? Because agriculture is one of \nour largest industries. If you add production agriculture with the food \nprocessing and transportation industries, almost one out of every five \njobs in America depends upon agriculture, food processing, \ntransportation, and the rest.\n  Being able to export more from this sector of our economy is a \ntremendous advantage to the United States, and agriculture subsidies \nare brought under GATT for the first time under this agreement. \nIncreased agricultural exports will mean higher prices for U.S. \nfarmers, along with increased export-related jobs.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a roster of the Agriculture for GATT Coalition be printed \nin the Record. This is a list of all of the members of this coalition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n   Mr. COCHRAN. To give you an idea, the Senate should notice there are \nthree single-spaced pages of names of organizations and producer groups \nin agriculture that support this agreement.\n  Another fact that I am including is that in my State of Mississippi, \njust as an example, we recorded exports of $803 million in 1993, nearly \n80 percent greater than the $354 million in 1987, just 6 years before. \nExporting and sales in overseas markets is a growth industry in my \nState, as it is in many other States, and much of that is related to \nthe exporting of food, food products, timber and timber products, and \nother manufacture products as well.\n  Mississippi boosted export sales of a wide range of manufactured \nproducts over the 1987-93 period. Rapidly expanding export categories \nincluded furniture and fixtures, up over 1,000 percent; rubber and \nplastic products, up 600 percent; food products, 502 percent; textile \nmill products, 330 percent; fabricated metal products, 154 percent; and \ntransportation equipment, 123 percent.\n  The agreement contains important provisions to open foreign markets \nand reduce tariffs on many of Mississippi's largest and fastest growing \nexport products, leading to economic growth and job creation for the \nState.\n  Mississippi expects rapid growth in overseas sales by Mississippi \nmanufacturing industries such as furniture, rubber and plastics, \nfabricated metals, and transportation equipment.\n  Exports to the State's fastest growing markets--Latin America--stand \nto realize significant benefits under the GATT Agreement.\n  Stronger patent and intellectual property protection under GATT and \nharmonization of foreign tariffs at lower levels will benefit \nMississippi's top export--chemical products.\n  The agreement's elimination of tariffs on paper goods, wood, and many \nfurniture products will enhance the State's exports.\n  Under the agreement, the European Community nations will \nsubstantially reduce tariffs on many of the State's exports of \nindustrial machinery and electronics.\n  The WTO does not endanger U.S. sovereignty.\n  The World Trade Organization would be the governing body of \ninternational trade disputes. It provides a forum to resolve trade \ndisputes and investigate the issues of tariffs and other trade \nbarriers. The WTO cannot directly override U.S. laws or require any \naction to do so. The United States will only be bound to obligations it \nhas accepted and Congress has voted on. In comparison to the current \nsituation, the WTO would have expanded powers. It would be able to \nexercise indirect powerful pressure upon countries to change its laws \nthat contain more rigid requirements on foreign producers than domestic \nproducers, regardless of whether the discrimination was intended or \nnot. A panel decision will no longer be able to be blocked as under the \nexisting GATT. WTO would allow counties aggressively to go after other \ncountries through international trade measures.\n  According to R. William Ide III, president of the American Bar \nAssociation, and I quote:\n\n       In particular, the Uruguay Round dispute settlement \n     provisions leave U.S. domestic legal powers totally intact, \n     just as they were under the old GATT rules. Likewise, the WTO \n     simply provides an updated procedural framework for dealing \n     with GATT trade issues. It gives the U.S. more, not less \n     procedural protections than the old GATT. Finally, none of \n     these changes permits GATT rules to override U.S. domestic \n     law, so U.S. sovereignty remains intact.\n\n  Robert H. Bork concurs, I quote:\n\n       In sum, it is impossible to see a threat to this nation's \n     sovereignty posed by either the WTO (World Trade \n     Organization) or the DSU (Dispute Settlement Understanding). \n     Any agreement liberalizing international trade would \n     necessarily contain mechanisms similar to those in the \n     Uruguay Round agreements. The claim that such mechanisms are \n     a danger to U.S. sovereignty is not merely wrong but would, \n     if accepted, doom all prospects for freer trade achieved by \n     multi-national agreement.\n  In considering the GATT implementing legislation, a budget waiver is \njustified.\n  Under congressional budget rules, the implementing bill must include \nprovisions to offset the loss of tariff revenues under the trade \nagreements. Estimates of lost revenues are about $12 billion for the \nfirst 5 years and as much as $40 billion for 10 years. The bill \nincludes about $1.7 billion in savings available from previously \nenacted legislation, another $2.2 billion in savings from nontax \nwriting committees--including the controversial pioneer preference \nprovisions--and $7.3 billion in a wide variety of relatively small, \nunrelated provisions. Most of the sections are tax provisions, but one \non tax section pertains to reform of the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation. If a budget rules waiver is needed in the Senate, 60 votes \nwill be needed to pass the waiver.\n  A study by the Joint Economic Committee Republican staff, using \nseveral independent estimates of economic growth under the agreement, \nfound that on average, the agreement will raise nearly $30 billion in \nnew revenue over the first 5 years. After accounting for the expected \n$12 billion revenue lost to tariff reductions, the agreement still \ncomes out ahead on revenues by an average of nearly $18 billion. When \nthe total fiscal impact is considered, every study of the GATT surveyed \nby the staff showed a net reduction to the Federal deficit.\n  According to Representative Jim Saxton, of New Jersey:\n\n       We are all aware of the PAYGO rules which threaten to hold \n     up the GATT legislation. In general, the PAYGO rules are \n     helpful in preventing new and wasteful spending. However, in \n     the case of free trade in general and the GATT in particular, \n     such rules fly in the face of virtually all the available \n     evidence. The purpose behind the GATT is to improve economic \n     performance. Virtually all economists agree it will have this \n     effect. * * *\n       There are some valid concerns about the GATT, but \n     objections to this free trade agreement over its fiscal \n     impact are hollow. The GATT will not reduce Federal revenues, \n     and in all likelihood, it will substantially increase them. \n     The Congress should start governing smarter, and the GATT \n     presents a marvelous opportunity to do so.\n\n\n                    background information--history\n\n  The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] is a multilateral \ntrade agreement, entered into force in 1948, to promote freer trade \namong member countries. GATT provides a forum for negotiating trade \nissues and a framework of principles guiding the conduct of trade. \nCentral features of the GATT framework are: nondiscriminatory trade \ntreatment; reliance on tariffs, rather than nontariff barriers, when it \nis necessary to protect domestic producers; adherence to negotiated \ntariff rates, at fixed maximum levels; and, settlement of disputes \nthrough consultation and conciliation. The membership of GATT includes \n123 countries, accounting for over four-fifths of world trade.\n  Prior to the Uruguay round, signatory countries had conducted seven \nrounds of trade negotiations. Despite the significant accomplishments \nof these rounds in removing barriers to trade, many observers \nmaintained that important reforms were needed to improve GATT rules and \nprocedures, to strengthen the codes negotiated in the rounds, and to \nexpand the coverage of the GATT to new areas of international trade. A \nconference in Uruguay in September 1986 launched a new round of \nmultilateral trade negotiations.\n  Trade officials from over 100 countries signed the closing documents \nof the Uruguay round in Marrakesh, Morocco on April 15, 1994. They \nendorsed the Final Act, a 22,000 page document that includes rules on \ntrade in goods, trade in services, intellectual property rights, and \ndispute settlement.\n\n\n                               provisions\n\n  The agreement would produce significant changes in the world trading \nsystem.\n  World Trade Organization.--The agreement establishes a new structure \nfor the administration of world trade rules. The umbrella body with \noversight of this structure will be the World Trade Organization [WTO]. \nWTO will administer agreements on goods, services, and intellectual \nproperty rights, and will oversee the dispute settlement understanding. \nWTO will also administer the trade policy review mechanism, which will \nregularly examine countries' trade policies and practices. Countries \nwill have to sign on to all of the new trade structure or none of it, \nthus eliminating the free rider problem where a country gains the \nbenefits of an agreement without accepting the obligations.\n  Tariff reductions.--Developed countries agreed to cut tariffs on \nindustrial products by an average 38 percent. Tariffs would be reduced \nto zero for the following: construction equipment, agricultural \nequipment, medical equipment, steel, beer, distilled spirits--not all \nkinds--pharmaceutical, paper, toys, and furniture. Tariffs would be \nreduced by 50 to 100 percent on electronic items, and they would be \nharmonized at reduced rates for chemicals. Most tariff reductions would \nbe effective after 5 years, except for certain sensitive products, \nwhich would have tariffs reduced over 10 years.\n  Agriculture.--Countries agreed to cut export subsidy outlays by 36 \npercent and the quantities exported with subsidies by 21 percent--1986-\n90 base--over 6 years for developed countries and over 10 years for \ndeveloping countries.\n  Nontariff barriers to imports, such as quotas, will be replaced by \ntariffs. All tariffs will be reduced by an average 36 percent--24 \npercent for developing countries--with a minimum cut of 15 percent; 10 \npercent for developing countries, for each tariff item.\n  Internal support programs, that distort trade will have to be cut by \n20 percent--1986-88 base. Credit will be allowed for cuts already \nundertaken since 1986. Action will not be taken against export \nsubsidies and internal support measures that meet the above reduction \ncommitments. Imports, however, will be subject to countervailing duties \nexcept in certain circumstances.\n  Sanitary and phytosanitary measures.--Countries also agreed to \nseveral provisions on sanitary and phytosanitary measures; health and \nsafety measures related to people, animals, and plants. They agreed \nthat each country has the right to set its own standards. Standards \nshould be based on scientific principles and can be more stringent than \ninternational standards. States and local governments are expected to \nabide by the Uruguay round framework, but do not have to lower their \nstandards if the standards are scientifically based.\n  Textiles and apparel.--Countries agreed to a 10-year phaseout of the \ncurrent quota system under the multifiber arrangement and full \nintegration of textiles and apparel into the GATT. During the 10-year \nperiod, a safeguard mechanism will be allowed to protect domestic \nindustries against import surges; special provisions on \ntransshipments--shipments through a third country--are included. Quotas \nwill be eliminated in three stages over 10 years, with the importing \ncountries having wide discretion over which products are freed from \nquotas at each stage.\n  Developed and developing countries have agreed to market access \ncommitments, both for tariffs and nontariff barriers. Trade remedies \nare allowed if a country does not meet its commitments.\n  Safeguards--protections against import surges that threaten to harm a \ndomestic industry.--The safeguards section includes some incentives to \nuse the multilateral safeguards process rather than unilateral \nmeasures, and it places tighter controls on how safeguard measures are \nused. For example, existing voluntary restraint agreements; agreements \nwhere the exporting country voluntarily limits its exports, will be \nphased out over 4 years, except for one allowed exception that will be \nphased out by the end of 1999. The reason for imposition of safeguards \nwill be publicly explained, and any safeguards will be phased out over \na maximum term of 8 years.\n  Antidumping.--The agreement consists mostly of relatively minor \nclarification and expansion of existing provisions. Changes include: a \nstandard of review, greater transparency and due process in antidumping \ninvestigations, de minimis dumping and import volume margins, sunset of \nantidumping orders, cumulation of injury, and recognition of \nanticircumvention practices.\n  Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.--The agreement adopts \nsubstantive changes in the subsidies and countervailing practice. It \n(1) introduces modified subsidies disciplines for developing countries; \n(2) defines ``subsidy''; and (3) categorizes subsidies as: prohibited--\nspecific subsidies--to individual enterprises--and export performance-\nconditioned subsidies; actionable--countervailable--those causing \ninjury, impairment of benefits, or serious prejudice, subsidies that \nexceed 5 percent; cover operating losses, or forgive debt; and \nnonactionable--provisions expire in 5 years--for industrial research, \nup to 75 percent of cost; precompetitive development activity, up to 50 \npercent; regional development, or one-time adaptation of facilities to \nnew environmental requirements, up to 20 percent; and introduces \nmodified subsidies disciplines for developing countries.\n  Trade-related investment measures.--The agreement establishes, for \nthe first time, rules on investment measures that distort trade. It \nincludes a list of measures that are prohibited, including local \ncontent and trade balancing requirements. The phaseout period for \neliminating prohibited investment practices would be 2 years for \ndeveloped countries, 5 years for developing countries, and 7 years for \nthe least developed countries. As practices are phased out, a country \ncan impose similar requirements on new entrants into their market in \norder to reduce any disadvantages on already established firms. A \nreview of this section will be required within 5 years.\n  Services.--For the first time, countries agreed to international \nrules and market access commitments to cover trade in services. These \nprovisions are in the newly established General Agreement on Trade in \nServices [GATS]. Also for the first time, disputes concerning the trade \nin services will be covered by multilateral dispute procedures.\n  The GATS includes a broad framework of principles that include most-\nfavored-nation [MFN] treatment, nondiscrimination among foreign \nservices or service providers; national treatment, nondiscrimination \nbetween domestic and foreign services or service providers; \ntransparency, publicly available information; and access to markets.\n  Intellectual property rights.--The agreement establishes, for the \nfirst time, rules for trade-related intellectual property rights [IPR] \nand brings these issues under a multilateral dispute process.\n  Countries agreed to observe the major copyright treaty, the Berne \nConvention, and they agreed to important copyright protections for \ncomputer bases, motion picture makers, and sound recordings. They \nagreed to greater protection under both process and product patents and \nto some limits on compulsory licensing of patents; however, U.S. \npharmaceutical companies oppose the long lead-in time for developing \ncountries to change their laws. Other protections in the agreement \ncover trademarks, trade secrets, integrated circuits, industrial \ndesigns, and appellation of origin--product names specific to a \ngeographical region.\n  Dispute settlement.--The final act greatly strengthens the dispute \nprocedures. It provides that dispute procedures shall apply to the \nareas of goods, services, and intellectual property rights, and allows \ncross-retaliation; that is, retaliation in one are to address a \nviolation in another.\n  Several changes are expected to strengthen the dispute settlement \nprocess; establishment of a dispute panel upon request, automatic \nadoption of panel reports, a time limit on implementation of a panel \nfinding, and automatic approval of retaliation if a country refuses to \nimplement the finding, unless a consensus agrees otherwise. A country \nwill not be forced to change its practices if it loses a case, but if \nit does not implement the panel finding, it might face retaliation by \nthe other party to the dispute. It is uncertain how the use of \nunilateral U.S. measures, section 301, might change with this stronger \ndispute process, but many experts have said that there might be less \nneed to use unilateral measures with stronger multilateral rules.\n  Government procurement.--The government procurement agreement \nprovides for open information on bids, minimum deadlines for bids, \nnotification of bid outcome, procedures for protest of bid decisions, \nand a tie-in to the multilateral dispute procedures. It covers, for the \nfirst time, government procurement in services. The agreement sets a \nthreshold for procurement to be covered, and it expands the types of \nprocurement covered by adding sub-federal procurement, limited mostly \nin public utilities. There is some difference in concessions from \ncountry to country, depending upon the concessions offered by each \ncountry.\n  Other trade provisions.--Several other important provisions are in \nthe final act. The section on import licensing procedures includes a \nminimum notification period if licensing procedures are changed, limits \nthe time to process licensing applications, and requires that countries \ninstituting new licensing procedures must provide detailed \nnotification. The section on customs valuation includes changes related \nto investigation of customs fraud and developing country obligations. \nThe section on preshipment inspection includes rules related to the use \nof preshipment inspection companies, which often are employed by \ndeveloping countries for customs-related work, and dispute provisions. \nThe section on rules of origin includes disciplines on such rules and \nrequires that a 3-year work program be undertaken to try to harmonize \nthe rules of origin among signatories. The section on technical \nbarriers to trade deals with how counties set technical standards and \nhow they determine conformance with those standards. Several provisions \nrelate to miscellaneous GATT articles such as balance-of-payment \nproblems, state trading companies, and preferential trading \narrangements.\n  The environment.--Environmental issues were included in the final act \nas modifications to language in the preamble and sections on technical \nbarriers to trade, sanitary and phyto- sanitary measures, and dispute \nsettlement. An environmental work program was formulated and it was \nagreed that an environmental committee in the WTO will be established \nto carry out the work plan. Environmental groups are split on the \noutcome of the round: some support the increased participation that the \nenvironmental committee provides; others are concerned about the \npotential of the WTO to reduce environmental standards and want a full \nnegotiation of environmental and trade issues. Attention will focus on \nhow environmental goals and objectives might be outlined in the \nimplementing legislation.\n  Worker rights.--The United States pushed strenuously for discussion \nof worker rights during the months between conclusion of the round and \nthe Marrakesh signing. Although the United States was unsuccessful in \nhaving a permanent committee on worker rights established in the WTO, \nit did have the issue placed on the agenda for the preparatory \ncommittee. What this means is that worker rights will be one of the \ntopics considered for possible inclusion on future agendas.\n  Mr. President, based on all of these facts and comments that I have \nbeen able to elicit from present administration officials, from the \nBush administration and the Reagan administration officials, it is as \nclear as anything can be that the approval of this agreement and waiver \nof the budget rules are the things for the Senate to do today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         Ag for GATT Coalition\n\n\n

Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  If I might, Mr. President, I have 16 speakers left, and if we go 15 \nminutes apiece, I will use up more time than I have. If we can hold it \nto 15, I would appreciate it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the debate we are having today is not \nnew; it has raged in this century and those before--here and in the \nParliaments of Europe. For most of the Victorian Age, England, the \ngreatest economic power of the 19th century, held to a policy of free \ntrade and prospered. At the turn of the century, an ``Imperial \nPreference'' plan was proposed to divide the world in two. Crown \ncolonies would enjoy free trade with England, while all other nations \nwould be walled off by stiff tariffs.\n  The Imperial Preference was as controversial then as GATT is today. \nEngland's greatest statesman, Winston Churchill, was then a back-\nbencher in the House of Commons. He had followed in his father's \nfootsteps in support of free trade, and as a Conservative Party member. \nBut on the Imperial Preference, Churchill refused to follow his party \nleaders towards protectionism; he crossed the aisle to join the free-\ntrade liberals, stating that protectionism is a:\n\n       Policy to shut the British Empire up in a ringed fence. Why \n     should we deny ourselves the good and varied merchandise \n     which the traffic of the world offers, more especially since \n     the more we trade with others, the more they trade with us.\n\n  This week, as we debate whether our country should continue to be \npart of the economic community of nations, we should listen to what the \nlessons of history from abroad and from our own former Presidents teach \nus.\n\n\n                                history\n\n  First, we need to remember Calvin Coolidge, a plain-spoken American. \nHe said, ``the business of America is business.'' Our national identity \nis not wrapped up in a historic monarchy. Our Nation is about freedom \nto pursue life, liberty, and happiness. To succeed in that pursuit, we \nneed jobs--and the paychecks that follow. We need employers and \nworkers, raw materials and factories, customers and suppliers.\n  With our abundant resources and educated work force, we produce more \nthan we consume. We cannot have the business and jobs we have today \nwithout trade with other countries.\n  Shortly after President Coolidge left office, Congress passed the \nSmoot-Hawley Act of 1930. Under Smoot-Hawley, tariffs on imports rose \nto the highest level in history. In 1932, tariffs averaged 59 percent--\nnearly doubling the cost of imported raw materials and finished goods. \nSmoot-Hawley pushed us into the depths of the depression; we did not \nfully recover until after the Second World War. Under authority \ndelegated from Congress, the Roosevelt administrations were able to \nreduce these tariffs through a series of international agreements.\n  Following the war, the United States and eight other countries agreed \nto a provisional GATT--15 other nations soon joined. Six rounds of \nnegotiations and agreements followed the initial agreement--the first \nfive concentrated on tariff reduction. Other rounds concentrated on \nreducing nontariff trade barriers and coordinating antidumping laws. \nThe Uruguay round agreement is the latest step in a continuing series \nof agreements that have reduced tariffs and other barriers to \ninternational trade.\n\n\n                    former president's contributions\n\n  As we debate the GATT bill, we need to remember the contributions to \ntwo former Presidents--Presidents Reagan and Bush. Under their \nleadership, the Uruguay round went from an idea--to expand trade \nagreements beyond tariff reduction to trade in services, trade in \nagriculture products, intellectual property protection, and reducing \ngovernment subsidies--to near completion.\n\n  Without their unshakable belief in American competitiveness and the \nfree market system, and their faith in the eventual resolution of the \ntalks to the benefit of the United States, we would not be on the \nthreshold of a new chapter in world economic growth. President Reagan \nsaid:\n\n       America doesn't need to hide behind trade barriers. Given a \n     level playing field, Americans can out-produce and out-\n     compete anyone, anywhere on earth. That's why it's the policy \n     of this Administration to open markets abroad, not close them \n     at home.\n\n  President Bush's leadership and understanding of North American \neconomics probably did more for free trade than any other modern \nPresident. By successfully completing the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement, President Bush showed that freeing countries from trade \nbarriers could do more than just create jobs and increase trade. Trade \ncreates good neighbors and solidifies friendships.\n\n\n                              trade policy\n\n  Despite the efforts of Presidents Bush and Reagan, the Uruguay round \ntalks were a marathon. Internal politics in Japan and France prevented \na resolution of agricultural issues, and delayed completion of the \nround for almost 2 years. Despite claims that foreign rice was unfit \nfor consumption, the Japanese Government agreed to end its ban on \nimports of rice. By the year 2000, rice imports in Japan will be 8 \npercent of the market. French farmers also held up agricultural \nnegotiations--and traffic in Paris--until a worldwide deal on oilseeds \nand other issues were reached.\n  We have delays here in the United States, too. After years of \nnegotiations we made important new agreements with over 100 other \nnations. But the Clinton administration put passage of this \nlegislation, and our participation in the WTO, at risk by delaying this \nbill in order to push new international environment and labor \nstandards. Congress flatly refused to allow this by refusing to include \nnew fast track negotiating authority for the President in this fast \ntrack bill. New negotiating authority should be fully considered on its \nown, in amendable legislation.\n  That brings us to the present. I have been in a dilemma over GATT \nbecause there are serious questions and serious consequences for voting \neither yes or no. I want to discuss a few of the serious issues.\n\n\n                                  wto\n\n  Much of the concern over the agreement has focused on whether the WTO \nis a threat to the sovereignty of the United States. I have thoroughly \nreviewed this issue. I have concluded that the implementing legislation \ncontains adequate safeguards against ceding our authority to a \nmultinational body.\n  Under our constitutional system, no treaty or international agreement \ncan bind the United States if we do not wish to be bound. At any time, \nCongress can override such an agreement by statute. Similarly, the WTO \nAgreement states that any amendment changing the rights or obligations \nof a member country is not binding unless it is agreed to by the \nmember.\n\n  Changes in existing trade agreements--which will include the Uruguay \nround agreements if they go into effect--require a two thirds vote of \nthe WTO. If a member refuses to accept a change, it can be asked to \nwithdraw from the WTO by a three-quarters vote. But such a sanction \ncould not reasonably be imposed on the United States--member countries \nwould not eject their largest customer for their imports from the low-\ntariff trading community. but if it were imposed, ejection would simply \nput us where opponents want us--out of the WTO. So this argument is \nwithout foundation; in sum, it is ``we shouldn't join the WTO because \nwe could get thrown out.''\n  No less a constitutional scholar than Judge Robert Bork has concluded \nthat the sovereignty issue is a ``scarecrow'' raised by opponents of \nlowering trade barriers. Bork found that many of the safeguards in the \nWTO agreement are either the same or stronger than those already \nexisting in the GATT, under which we have operated successfully for \ndecades. Under the new agreement, changes to the WTO dispute settlement \nrules--the rules for challenges by one member to another's laws or \npractices--now require a unanimous vote of all members; under the GATT, \nthey could be changed by a two-third vote.\n  The GATT has existed for almost 50 years as a multilateral trade \nagreement, and an ad hoc body to administer the agreements. But in \norder to make sure that the best interests of the United States are \nprotected, Senator Dole and the Clinton administration reached an \nagreement last week to pass legislation next year that will establish a \n``WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission'' of five Federal appellate \njudges.\n  Under the Dole agreement, if there are three commission \ndeterminations in 5 years that a WTO panel unfairly hurt the United \nStates interests, any Senator or Congressman could introduce a \nprivileged, expedited joint resolution disapproving of United States \nparticipation in the Uruguay round agreements. If the resolution is \nenacted by the Congress and signed by the President, the United States \nwill commence withdrawal from the WTO.\n  Senator Dole's agreement establishes a procedure for expedited \nconsideration of withdrawal from the WTO if the WTO does not \neffectively serve the United States best interests. Because of the \nimprovement made in the agreement, I believe that joining the WTO will \nnot harm the sovereignty of the United States.\n\n\n                               financing\n\n  I remain, however, severely disappointed with the administration's \nfinancing plan.\n  While some of the revenue increases in the bill are good--I certainly \nsupport denying the earned income tax credit to prisoners and illegal \naliens--others are irresponsible. For years, savings bonds have been \nthe soundest, most accessible investment for many Americans. Why are we \neroding the public's trust in savings bonds and the Government by \nrepealing the mandatory 4 percent floor on savings bond interests?\n  Cuts in tariffs are tax cuts--they reduce tariffs on imports. Tariffs \nare unkowingly paid to the Government by consumers as part of the sales \nprice at the check-out counter. Cutting tariffs reduces prices--\nnot only on imports, but through competition on U.S. products, too. \nLower prices mean consumers have more money to spend that goes to \nproducers, instead of to the Government, which means more sales, more \nsales revenue, and more jobs. It also means that economic activity \nincreases--which creates higher, not lower, total Government revenue.\n\n  Despite this, the administration insisted that the tariff cuts be \noffset for the first 5 years--they don't believe tax cuts change \nconsumer behavior. OMB went so far as to say that ``we do not believe \nit is necessary to sacrifice budget discipline'' to pass GATT. But they \nfell $2.5 billion short in their offsets, and came up with a budget \ngimmick--counting past tax increases that were already used for deficit \nreduction--for a second time.\n  After insisting on a static model estimate for the first 5 years, the \nadministration argued that Senators should vote to waive the Budget Act \nbecause cutting tariffs will raise revenue over years 6 through 10. So \noffsetting the first 5 years became unnecessary in the Senate--we need \na Budget Act waiver anyway.\n  The administration could have: Used spending cuts as offsets; \nrecognized that the static model does not compensate for consumer \nbehavior; or fully offset the entire agreement instead of using budget \ngimmicks.\n  Instead, they ask us to believe one prediction method for the first 5 \nyears, and a second for the second 5 years.\n  All I can say in response to such inconsistency is that when \nconsumers have money in their pockets instead of the Government's, they \neither save or spend it--and both help the economy and raise revenue \nmore than higher taxes do. When Republicans are in the majority, I hope \nthe administration will recognize that we expect honest accounting. We \nmay not agree on methods, but there should be no more shell games of \nswitching estimating models after 5 years or recounting past tax \nincreases as an offset.\n\n\n                              consequences\n\n  So that brings me to the consequences of passing or not passing this \nbill. Some have tried to pin jobs lost in America to trade agreements. \nThat is wishful thinking on the part of Members of Congress looking for \nthe trees and missing the forest.\n  Jobs have left America because Government regulation, litigation, and \ntaxation makes it too expensive to do business in America. If our \nbusinesses can not compete, it is not because our workers are paid \nmore. All the statistics show our workers make up for their better \nwages by being more productive and efficient than workers in foreign \ncountries.\n  When our businesses can not compete, its because over-regulation and \nlitigation drive up their production costs, and taxes drain their \ncapital. GATT is a first step towards leveling the playing field \nbecause it reduces other countries trade barriers. We must take that \nfirst step now, and next year we must take another step towards \nleveling the playing field by passing regulatory and litigation reform \nhere at home.\n  Over time, reducing trade barriers has benefited America. In the \nearly 1950's, most countries tariffs on imports averaged 40 percent. \nOnce the new agreements are fully implemented, tariffs will average \nless than 4 percent. Our gross national product in 1947--expressed in \ntoday's prices, for better comparison--was $231 billion. Today, our \nnational economy is almost $7 trillion a year. This is more than a 30-\nfold increase since we first joined the GATT.\n\n  Obviously, GATT has been good for America, and for the world economy. \nReducing tariffs from 40 to 4 percent has created jobs here, and jobs \nabroad. I am sure it has created more jobs in developing countries than \nany foreign aid money ever has.\n  GATT will also be good for my home state of Texas. The GATT agreement \nopens new foreign markets by lowering other countries' tariffs on \nchemicals, computers, semiconductors, construction equipment, and steel \nthat is produced in Texas, and in many other States. Agriculture will \nbenefit from increased access to world markets--feed grain, cotton, \nbeef, and poultry exports are expected to increase.\n  Most important, GATT will benefit consumers; the Treasury estimates \nthat lower prices from GATT will result in savings of $1,700 for every \nAmerican family of four. That is a tax cut which provides needed help \nfor every person--it will mean more food, clothing, books, and \neducation savings for children all over America. People will choose \nwhere their money is spent, instead of being forced to fund \nbureaucratic spending programs from Washington.\n  Our experience with NAFTA is a resounding success. We're enjoying a \n``Surge in Trade,'' according to one recent newspaper article. Exports \nto Mexico are up 22 percent in 1994. These exports support thousands of \njobs in the United States.\n  For example:\n  Because of cuts in tariffs under NAFTA, the Miles, Inc. chemical \ncompany has closed its plants in Mexico. Because the plants in Mexico \nare no longer protected with high tariffs, they cannot compete with the \nproductivity, efficiency, and skills of American workers. Miles now \nexports to Mexico from its plant in Baytown, TX.\n  In El Paso, a new plant that manufacturers Wrangler jeans has created \n450 new jobs this year to meet demand from NAFTA-related trade.\n  Even though newsprint tariffs do not go down until 1997, the improved \nbusiness climate with Mexico has more than doubled newsprint exports to \nMexico in the last year.\n  We can continue to increase our exports under GATT, and increase \nemployment throughout America.\n  So to conclude, while I am troubled by part of this agreement, my \nchoices do not include amending it. My choice is to vote yes--or no. \nBecause of its benefits for American workers and American consumers, I \nwill vote ``yes'' for the implementing bill, and for the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act.\n  Winston Churchill said that the price of greatness is responsibility. \nIt is our responsibility to act now for the benefit of American workers \nand for our country's future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time be charged against the three \nparties in charge of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, yesterday I used the example of \nagriculture as an industry, and I use the term ``industry'' in the best \nsense of the word, that is able to compete worldwide when given a level \nplaying field.\n  In response, my good friend from South Carolina, the junior Senator, \nSenator Hollings, said, well, what would you expect from an industry \nthat is the most subsidized industry in the world and no wonder they \ncan compete?\n  I would like to respond to that as follows: As far as my State of \nOregon is concerned, wheat is our largest agricultural export. At the \nmoment, we export about 85 percent of all the wheat we grow. At the \nmoment, the export price in Portland is $4.50 to $4.60 a bushel. Which \nis above the target subsidy price set in the 1990 farm bill. Therefore, \nthese wheat farmers are getting no GATT-illegal subsidy. They are \ncompeting on the worldwide market without a penny of any GATT-illegal \nsubsidy.\n  In order of export, our next biggest crops are vegetables, \nprincipally processed vegetables, fruits, peaches, cherries, all kinds \nof fruits, and then grass and vegetable seeds. Oregon has become one of \nthe largest seed-growing areas in the entire world, both grass seeds or \nvegetable seeds. Neither vegetables, fruits nor seeds are subsidized at \nall.\n  So we are competing throughout the world without subsidies and \nbeating the world.\n  Yesterday I called John Deere to recheck my facts, and I said, what \ndoes a large combine cost? They said, $145,000 to $150,000. What does \nthe large tractor cost? And this one surprised me--$120,000 to \n$130,000.\n  I guess I am old enough. I was thinking of the old-style tractors. \nThese are immense new tractors that are pulling these combines.\n  You say to yourself, how can a farmer pay $150,000 for a combine and \n$140,000 for a tractor--and that is not all the equipment they need--\nand compete with the farmer someplace else that is using an ox and a \nwooden plow?\n  You know the argument that is raised--30 cents an hour, 30 cents an \nhour, clean conditions, child labor. How does a husband, wife and maybe \na couple kids and maybe or maybe not a hired hand beat the world? And \nthe answer is productivity.\n  At the turn of the century a farmer could feed seven people in the \nUnited States. Now, a farmer can feed about 80 people, and I will wager \nthat by the end of this century a farmer will be able to feed about 100 \npeople in this country.\n  Agriculture is the most stunning example, more than manufacturing, \nmore than services, of our success in productivity. But we can do it in \nmanufacturing and we are starting to. We can do it in services, and we \nare doing it. We have an immense surplus in our balance of trade in \nservices.\n  I just wanted to set the record straight that at least as far as \nOregon is concerned the products we are competing with throughout the \nworld are mostly agricultural products that are not GATT illegally \nsubsidized, that are very, very capital intensive and that we are \nwinning that war and we can continue to do it and GATT will make it \neven easier to do it.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally against the parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wofford). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the chairman yielding and hope that I might \nhave 5 additional minutes if I need it at the end.\n  Mr. President, I take no great pleasure in being on this floor on the \nopposing side of this GATT issue. I think it was Mark Twain who was \nonce asked to debate and he said, ``Fine, give me the opposing side. \nThat will take no preparation.''\n  I would prefer to be here on another side of this issue. But the fact \nis, we are presented with these trade agreements under a fast-track \nprocedure and we are told that you cannot amend them. It is this way or \nno way. So we only have one option here. We either accept or reject \nthese agreements.\n  I also take no pleasure in this because this President, President \nClinton, and this Trade Representative, Ambassador Kantor, have \nexhibited real guts as compared to many others in the past 20 years. \nThey have stood tall on bilateral negotiations with Japan and Canada \nand others, and they have done things other administrations would not \neven think of trying to do. So I support them very much in their \ninitiatives on trade.\n  But our trade strategy, in my judgment, that brings this GATT \nagreement to the floor is a bipartisan failure and has been for a long \nwhile. It moves us in precisely the wrong direction.\n  This year our Nation's trade deficit will be the largest in American \nhistory. If you are not persuaded that the current trade strategy, \nwhich helped produce the largest deficit in history this year, is the \nwrong direction, what on Earth will persuade you?\n  We have accumulated a trade deficit of $1.2 trillion since 1980. What \non Earth does it take to be persuaded that this is the wrong direction?\n  I just heard someone refer a moment ago to the United States of \nAmerica as the dominant figure in world trade, leading the way. And I \nwas thinking of reading to my son the other night about Gulliver's \ntravels and this behemoth Gulliver laying there on the ground tied up \nby the Lilliputians. That is the way we are in trade.\n  Yes, we are large. We are the largest economy in the world. That is \nwhy we are the biggest market for cheap imports, displacing American \njobs. There is no substitute for the American marketplace anywhere on \nthis globe. And that is why in every corner of the Earth there are \ninterests, and especially the international corporations' interests, \nwho want to produce where it is cheap and then sell not in Libya, not \nin Nairobi, not in Kenya, but in the American marketplace.\n  Why? Because they can compete in the market with very cheap labor, \ndisplace American jobs, and injure this country's economy, and under \nthe new GATT they can do so with no restrictions, no admission price at \nall.\n  Under the rules of the new GATT, companies are free to produce shirts \nsomewhere overseas in some factory using 6-year-olds or 10-year-olds \nworking 12 hours a day and making 12 cents an hour, and then ship them \nto Cleveland, ship them to Fargo, ship them to New York to be sold in a \nstore under a designer label name and have the American consumer \npurchase the products of labor of 12-year-olds. The admission price to \nour marketplace should be higher than that.\n  Free trade is just fine, as long as it is fair competition. And the \nplain fact is, this trade strategy is not fair, it is not fair to our \ncountry, it is not fair to our workers, and it is not fair to our \nbusinesses who produce here and try to compete here and around the rest \nof the world.\n  This is supposed to be a time of change and new policy, a period of \nfresh air in public policy in Washington. And, do you know what? We \ncome back to this Senate floor after the recent elections and engage in \nthe same old, worn out, failed trade policies that have put this \ncountry deep in debt. The same old policies. There is no change here.\n  I read yesterday, and I think I will read again, some of the debate \nfrom our consideration of the Tokyo round trade agreements in 1979. \nThat was the last time we debated a new GATT agreement here.\n  Here is what the proponents of the 1979 agreements said. Now, just \nclose your eyes and imagine. Is it 1979 or 1994?\n  ``These agreements offer new opportunities for all Americans. For \nAmerican farmers, the agreement expands world markets for American farm \nproducts. For American workers, the agreement offers more jobs, higher \nincomes, and more effective responses to unfair foreign competition.'' \nThat is the argument made here in 1979.\n  What happened? GATT was passed. Those were the promises. Well, U.S. \nagriculture exports did go up 5 percent. In 14 years, agricultural \nimports into this country went up 32 percent. Is that not something?\n  How about the American workers? Since the Tokyo Round Agreement, the \nUnited States has seen a net loss of 3.3 million manufacturing jobs.\n  Higher incomes? Oh, no. Most Americans out there in the American \nhouseholds understand that average household incomes has declined since \n1979.\n  So how on Earth can the people who gave us the promises in the last \nround have any credibility at all?\n  The central point here is that U.S. living standards are being \nsacrificed to a bunch of failed policies and a slogan called ``free \ntrade.''\n  I know that when you stand on this floor and speak as I speak, you \nare immediately categorized as some protectionist. Protectionist. Lord, \nit is an awful word, I guess, that you would want to protect the \neconomic interests of our country. I do not know when that became \nunfashionable, but I regret that it did. I should think it would be \nfashionable for people to stand here and protect the economic interests \nof America.\n  Protect us against imports? No, not at all. I want our consumers to \nhave the widest choice.\n  Protect us against unfair competition that would move our jobs \nelsewhere? You better believe I want to protect us against that.\n  Protect us against policies that will erode and have eroded the \nincome of the American family? You bet I want to protect us against \nthat. Just chalk it up and mark me down as a protectionist. If we are \ntalking about protecting American income and protecting American jobs, \nyou are darn right that is something I want to protect. If being called \na protectionist is the price for doing that, then count me in.\n\n  But, do not ever confuse protecting the economic interests of our \ncountry with efforts to put a wall around America. A wall is not our \nintent. It will always be my intent to fight for a world in which we \nhave broader, expanded trade but trade which is fair and trade in which \nthere is an admission price to enter a developed marketplace. We fought \nfor 50 years for safe working conditions and fair living wages and \nprotection of air and water against dumping pollutants and chemicals \nand toxic waste into water and air, and the admission price into our \nmarketplace must reflect our determination to maintain those \naccomplishments for the American people.\n  That is exactly what this debate is about.\n  Interesting. I had a debate yesterday with some people from the U.S. \nTrade Representative's office. They were alleging that these new \nagreements are going to help us with Japan. Total bunk. Nonsense. This \nwill do nothing with respect to Japan. We have a $60 billion trade \ndeficit with Japan. It is a shame, a shame that we have that \ncircumstance in our bilateral relationship between us and Japan.\n  Yes, Japan is a good friend but they have taken advantage of us for \ndecades. We ought not have a $60 billion trade deficit with Japan, and \nthis GATT agreement will do nothing to resolve it. The only thing that \nwill resolve it is bilateral negotiations that are tough, assertive, \nstrong, with some nerve, and will on our part say to them, ``You cannot \ndo that. If you expect to ship your goods to the United States of \nAmerica, then you better expect to have your markets open for our goods \nto be shipped there. We are going to hold up a mirror and look in the \nmirror because what you see is what you get. You treat us fairly, we \ntreat you fairly.''\n  That is the way reciprocal trade ought to work.\n  China? China is not even a part of the new trade agreements; another \noutrage. Their trade deficit with us has gone from $9 billion, to $12 \nbillion, to $18 billion--this year to $28 billion. Our trade strategy \nwith China is not working. The deficit is draining American jobs. That \nshould not be hard to understand.\n  I just heard a Member of the Senate talk about jobs leaving America, \nsaying that the exodus is not because of cheap labor elsewhere, but \nbecause of Government regulation. I do not know how you could come to \nsuch a conclusion. You have a choice in this country if you are a \nproducer. You can produce with the same money: Hiring one American, or, \ninstead, 20 Filipinos; or 40 from India; or, 80 Chinese.\n  Under those conditions, producers go outside this country and use \ncheap labor to produce their products; ship American jobs there, and \nthen ship their goods back here. That means we lose. It is a process of \naccessing cheap labor to injure our marketplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator for 5 additional minutes?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Two?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Two is fine. I had wanted to speak about child labor and \nabout agriculture.\n  Regarding agriculture, the Senator from Oregon made the point about \nfarmers. I support it fully. While we disagree on the end strategy \nhere, I support his point about agriculture. But the fact is, you take \na look at what happens in agriculture. We negotiate to reduce export \nsubsidies and, guess what? We lose every single trade negotiation. The \nEuropean Community will end up with three times as much allowable \nexport subsidies on wheat, for example, as our country will be allowed \nto use. That is fair? Of course it is not fair.\n  Think of this as an Olympics. We have an Olympics and we put uniforms \non Americans and we put ``USA'' on them. We all sit on the edge of our \ncouch hoping that we win. This is an economic Olympics of sorts. The \nfact is the winners are going to be the recipients of new jobs, \nexpanded opportunities, and economies that provide new growth.\n  The losers are misguided nations who believe what matters is not what \nyou produce, but what your consume. It is called the British disease: a \nshrinking economy, shrinking base, shrinking job opportunities. The \nfact is, what matters is what you produce. That is the genesis of \neconomic health, the genesis of jobs and income.\n  This is an international Olympics of sorts, and the fact is we have \nsomehow been embarrassed to support our team. We have somehow not been \nconcerned about our winning. The only important element at the end of \nthis debate when all the dust settles on all the issues that are raised \nis this and only this: Have we done something that increases--no, not \ntrade exports, not GDP--have we done something that increases the \nstandard of living of people who live in America? If not, then we have \nlost. And, on that basis, this GATT trade agreement is a loser for this \ncountry.\n  There is a much better way, with open trade, expanded trade, and \nbetter opportunity for the entire world; a way that I support. That is \nfree trade with fair competition between us and other countries of the \nworld.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota \nfor his fine statement, and I appreciate his comments, especially about \nthe importance of incorporating basic internationally-recognized human \nrights standards into our trade policy.\n  Let me start by quoting from the Calgary Herald of the other day.\n\n       This past Friday the preparatory committee for the new \n     World Trade Organization, WTO, rejected any formal \n     institutional arrangement subjecting the new body to any \n     human rights scrutiny whatsoever.\n\n  This was this last Friday. This was the last effort to have some kind \nof linkage to human rights in this trade arrangement, and it failed. I \nwould like to just follow up on what the Senator from North Dakota \nsaid. He said he did not have a chance to go to child labor and human \nrights issues. I want to do so now. And if a picture is worth 1000 \nwords, let me start out with a picture.\n  The first picture here is of three sisters, age 6 to 16, working in \nan incense factory in Nagpur, India. They roll 20,000 incense sticks \nper day for less than $1.65. Children working all day, for a total \nincome of $1.65.\n  Next picture. Young children who work in a carpet factory in Nepal, \nfor long hours under strict production quotas that they must meet to \navoid abuse by their employers.\n  Next picture. Children who are forced to work because of debts owed \nby their parents, in India--in virtual indentured servitude.\n  Mr. President, while some on this floor have downplayed this issue, \nfacts are stubborn things. There are an estimated 200 million children \nin the workplace worldwide, working under dangerous and unsafe \nconditions in violation of international human rights standards. In \nBangladesh, children as young as 8 years old make up 25 percent of the \nwork force in the garment industry.\n  In Brazil, 4-year-old children--4-year-old kids--work up to 10 hours \na day harvesting cotton. Mr. President, here again we are talking about \nchildren who work for little pay and who are subject to abuse by \nemployers when they do not meet their harvesting quotas.\n  I start out this way because I really believe that the promotion of \ninternationally-recognized human rights standards should be a part of \nwhat the United States of America should be about in our foreign and \ntrade policies. There should be some kind of linkage in our trade \nagreements. I felt that way in relation to most-favored nation status \nfor China. I felt that way in relation to our policy toward Indonesia. \nI felt that way in terms of the North American Free-Trade Agreement. \nAnd I most definitely feel that way when it comes to the new WTO.\n  And I am concerned because I do not believe, despite the tireless \nefforts by international advocates for children, that enough is known \nabout the horrible abuses in this area all around the world. I know \nthat come this Christmas, when parents buy toys for their children, it \nmay not occur to them that in many cases the toys they buy for their \nchildren were made by children in other countries even younger than \ntheir own kids, for $1.35 a day under the most harsh, exploitative, \nawful working conditions. I know that when people buy carpets for their \nliving room they do not want to buy carpets that are produced by \nchildren working under these kind of conditions.\n  And let's not try to fool anyone that this issue is going to be \nvigorously pursued within the World Trade Organization. As I said \nearlier, it was just last Friday that we had the final formal rejection \nby the WTO preparatory committee of any kind of human rights scrutiny \nby the United Nations, any kind of linkage to child labor or other \nsocial development issues under this agreement.\n  I have been in the Senate now for 4 years and I have learned a \nlesson. This is a respectful disagreement with other colleagues. That \nis the way we have to be, in respectful disagreement.\n  And one of the things I have learned is that if you do not have some \nkind of framework, some kind of intellectual and philosophical \nframework that you stay true to, you just sort of get buffeted about on \nthe basis of who can yell the loudest, who can exert the most pressure \nand all the rest. Now some argue that in order for developing countries \nto become more democratic, and better able to extend basic civil and \npolitical rights to all of its citizens, you have to have the trade \nliberalization and the economic expansion first. And there is an \nelement of truth to that argument. In some countries, it has worked out \nthat way. But you are much more likely to get progress in human rights \nif pressure is maintained by major trading partners for such progress, \nand if everyone--all trading nations--have agreed beforehand on at \nleast a few basic minimum standards.\n  If history has taught us anything, it is that the only way that \nhappens is when the United States and other major countries take the \nlead and insist on some kind of linkage, and use our leadership as a \ndemocracy to encourage and pressure other countries to live up to these \nbasic standards.\n  I wanted so much for there to be some kind of basic human rights \nformulation built into this agreement, and have pressed for that. I \nhave not been able to support either the GATT or NAFTA, as much as I am \nan internationalist by birth, partly for these reasons. I am the son of \na Jewish immigrant from Russia. My mother's family was from the \nUkraine. My father taught me that we ignore the world at our own peril. \nBut I believe from head to toe that human rights and child labor \nconditions must be a part of such an agreement. Instead, this linkage \nwas formally rejected.\n  Mr. President, as we move forward in this debate, let's not forget \nthat there is a linkage between the working conditions of these \nchildren in these pictures and this agreement. These kids' lives do \nmatter. Commercial logic is not the only logic; they do matter. There \nis a linkage between the conditions of their lives and what happens to \nour work force as well. As Senator Dorgan said, it is very difficult \nfor workers to compete, for citizens in our country to compete, against \nchildren who are getting paid $1.35 for a whole day.\n  When I take together the human rights questions, which are compelling \nquestions to me, the child labor questions, which are compelling \nquestions to me, and I realize that this agreement does not acknowledge \nthese conditions and makes no effort to begin to address these \nconditions, it saddens me. Combined with concern that the WTO, which \nmakes important trade decisions that crucially affect the quality of \nthe lives of citizens in the United States of America, does not meet \npublicly and is not publicly or democratically accountable, it gets \neven worse. And then when you consider that some of the legislation my \nState and others have passed in consumer protection, in environmental \nprotection, health and safety over the years might be put at risk by \nWTO decisions, this agreement does not make the grade. All of that \nlegislation could be challenged as GATT-illegal and our country, \ntherefore, made subject to economic retaliation.\n  Though I am an internationalist, and would have loved to have had an \nopportunity through amendments to have improved this agreement, that is \nnot possible under the fast-track procedures. I would have loved to \nhave had the opportunity through amendments to have built in some \nlinkage to human rights and child labor, to have built in some \nprotection for democratic procedures and decisionmaking, to have made \nthis trade agreement more accountable.\n  But I do not have that opportunity. This is on fast-track procedure, \nwhich I voted against, and, therefore, I cannot in good conscience--and \nI emphasize the word ``conscience''--I cannot in good conscience view \nthis trade agreement as a step forward. I cannot view this trade \nagreement, though I want to, as one which will lead to the uplifting of \nthe living standards of peoples in our nations. I believe it is a step \nbackward.\n  I know some of my colleagues disagree. But that is my rigorous \nanalysis, that is my honest assessment, that is my view and, therefore, \nI will vote no.\n  I yield the rest of my time.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, when we consider that over 20 percent of \nAmerica's economy is dependent upon trade--when we consider that over \nthe past four decades, trade-related jobs in our country have grown \nthree times faster than overall American job creation--when we consider \nthat open markets and free trade mean new jobs for American workers--we \nrealize how important this debate is.\n  Not only are we considering an historic trade agreement--an agreement \nsome 7 years in the making--but an agreement that can go a long way \ntoward providing jobs and security for Americans.\n  Of course, Mr. President, I wish I could say that this is a perfect \nagreement--that it would be immediately and universally advantageous to \nall Americans. But such is not the case. The fact is that long-term \ngrowth seldom comes without change and change is sometimes disruptive \nand even painful. There will be real challenges in the short term.\n  Some will be less than others as this agreement is to be phased in \nover a number of years, but from the beginning we must be aware of \nthose men and women and families whose lives and livelihoods will be \naffected by this agreement.\n  We must also be aware of concerns felt by others regarding the \ncreation of the World Trade Organization. Personally, I am satisfied \nthat--as Robert Bork and other distinguished scholars have said--the \nGATT and the WTO will not interfer with American sovereignty. America \ncannot be bound by an international agreement or treaty if it does not \nwish to be bound.\n  As Judge Bork has said, ``Congress may, at any time, override such an \nagreement or provisions * * * by statute.'' Despite this assurance, we \nmust continue to be vigilant and certain that now and in the future \nAmerica remains first among equals in its international relationships.\n  The key to that future will be borders that are open for imports and \nexports--trade that is free and fair. As the great historian Will \nDurant pointed out, tariffs that restrict trade in the name of \nprotectionism are little more than civilized piracy--piracy that \nstrangles commerce and internationalizes poverty.\n  If we are to realize the potential of our future, we must have \ninternational agreements that break down these barriers. I believe the \nagreements that emerged from the Uruguay round of trade talks is a step \nin the right direction.\n  Let me tell you what this agreement can do for Delaware:\n  In my State, exports have grown 27 percent since 1987 to $3.5 billion \nin 1993. The Port of Wilmington and the longshoremen that work there, \nDelaware's farmers, our workers at chemical, pharmaceutical, and auto \nplants have all seen their exports grow. This agreement will further \nincrease these exports and create even more jobs by reducing and \neliminating tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade.\n  In Delaware, our farm sector is of vital importance, but our farmers \nare often on the short end of the stick when it comes to exporting to \nour trade partners like Canada. This agreement will move us toward \ncorrecting such inequity. Not only in Delaware, but across the Nation, \nour farmers, who exported over $40 billion last year, will finally see \nsome relief from the subsidy and other unfair trade policies that have \nplagued world agricultural trade for far too long. We are the world's \nlargest agricultural exporter and will be a major beneficiary of \nliberalized trade in this critical area.\n  This agreement will also strengthen intellectual property rights and \nimprove trade rules that protect Delaware and American industries \nagainst unfair trade practices. The intellectual property rules alone \nwill be critical to eliminating the piracy of U.S. intellectual \nproperty that are essential to our pharmaceutical, software, and \nchemical industries, to name a few. Each of these industries is \nimportant to Delaware, and piracy of intellectual property costs our \neconomy billions of dollars each year.\n  For these, and other, reasons, Mr. President, I will support this \nagreement. I encourage my colleagues to do likewise. With them, I \nunderstand that this agreement will not be completely painless to all \nAmericans. Change is often difficult.\n  But if America is to maintain its leadership in the global \ncommunity--if we are to have the bright and prosperous future that is \npossible--I believe we need this agreement.\n  We need it because our Nation's economic health is dependent upon the \nglobal economy. We need it because it is in our fundamental interest to \nhave an international trade regime that is built on three pillars: \nopenness and cooperation; predictable rules of fair play; and \nmechanisms to make sure the rules are upheld. Creating these conditions \nhas been the essential purpose of the GATT, particularly this Uruguay \nround. That is why I will vote for this agreement.\n  Mr. President, I would like to now explain more in depth my analysis \nof the Uruguay Round Agreement and my reasons to support it.\n  Mr. President, we are now considering whether to approve an historic \ntrade agreement--the Uruguay round. It was negotiated under the aegis \nof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, otherwise known as the \nGATT, which has served as the foundation for global trade since 1947. \nThe negotiations leading to this historic agreement were initiated by \nPresident Reagan, almost concluded by President Bush, and finalized by \nPresident Clinton. The agreement has been over 7 years in the making, \nand has had strong bipartisan support throughout.\n  Before us is the legislation that is needed to implement our \nobligations under the Uruguay round. It is a momentous decision in many \nrespects. It will determine the future course of our trade relations \nwith other nations. It will have a substantial impact on jobs and \neconomic growth here at home. It will say a lot about our Nation's \nconfidence in facing the economic challenges and opportunities ahead. \nThere should be no illusions about if--this decision is a defining \nmoment for America and the rest of the world.\n  The Uruguay round was concluded last December, and, over the past \nseveral months, Congress has worked with the administration on the \nlegislation that is needed to implement it. What has emerged is not a \nperfect trade agreement, and some serious questions have been raised \nabout it, such as those regarding the new World Trade Organization \n[WTO] and its affect on U.S. sovereignty.\n  Likewise, the implementing legislation is not perfect, and the \nimplementation process has not gone as smoothly as it could, or should, \nhave. The final legislation and the Statement of Administrative Action \nwere introduced very late in the congressional session. Although, as a \nmember of the Finance Committee, I had a chance to review most of the \ndraft bill before it was introduced, many of my colleagues did not have \nsuch an opportunity, and they should have been given more time to \nreview it. While the special session has afforded more time to examine \nthe final details. A lame-duck session is certainly not the best \ncongressional process for deciding the final fate of such an important \nissue facing the Nation.\n  Nevertheless, after careful examination of the trade agreement, the \nlegislation to implement it, and the concerns that have been raised, I \nbelieve that, on balance, we must approve the Uruguay round. I am \nconvinced that to do otherwise would be a grave mistake and a detriment \nto the people of Delaware as well as to folks throughout the country.\n  My decision to support the Uruguay round is based on the recognition \nthat our Nation's economic health is dependent upon the global economy \nand that it is in our fundamental interest to have an international \ntrade regime that is built on three pillars: openness and cooperation; \npredictable rules of fair play; and mechanisms to make sure the rules \nare upheld. Creating these conditions has been the essential purpose of \nthe GATT, particularly this Uruguay round. In a sense, creating these \nconditions has been our Nation's objective. For this reason, the United \nStates has been the prime mover behind the GATT's creation and \nevolution. For decades, we have viewed the international trading system \nas an opportunity, not as a threat, and I believe that this is a view \nour Nation should maintain.\n\n\n        importance of global trade to delaware and u.s. economy\n\n  I have often said that whether we like it or not we cannot shut \norselves off from trading with the rest of the world; this is more true \ntoday than ever before. We are the world's largest trader. Last year we \nexported $465 billion in manufactured goods and agricultural products, \n$650 billion in you add services. Over 25 percent of our economy is \ntrade-related and millions of our jobs depend on trade. In my State of \nDelaware, exports have grown 27 percent since 1987 to $3.5 billion in \n1993. The Port of Wilmington and the longshoremen that work there, \nDelaware's workers at chemical, pharmaceutical, and auto plants, as \nwell as poultry growers, just to name a few, have seen their exports \ngrow. Over the last 5 years, in fact, 50 percent of U.S. economic \ngrowth has been due to exports.\n\n\n                some key benefits from the uruguay round\n\n  The GATT has been a critical reason for the enormous expansion of \nworld trade since the post-World War II era and the economic growth \nthat has accompanied it. Through seven so-called rounds of negotiation, \nwe have eliminated tariff and other barriers to trade in goods and have \nnegotiated predictable rules to help facilitate this trade. And that is \nwhat is at the heart of the Uruguay round, the eighth round of trade \ntalks held under the GATT. It is an integral part of our Nation's \nlongstanding trade policy to open markets to our exports, and to \nestablish a transparent, rules-oriented trading system which eliminates \nthe law of the jungle.\n  The Uruguay round, in fact, goes much further than previous GATT \nnegotiations in opening trade. it will cut tariffs worldwide by one-\nthird, by almost $750 billion. Tariffs really are no more than a tax \nthat is imposed at the border. A global tax cut of $750 billion will \nlower consumer and producer costs and will be a huge stimulus to \neconomic growth here at home and abroad. All studies of the agreement \nhave shown major economic benefits. According to some estimates, the \nagreement could add as much as $100-$200 billion annually to our \neconomy once fully implemented, and create as many as 1.4 million new \njobs.\n  Aside from this huge tariff cut, the Uruguay round improves existing \nGATT rules and principles, creates important new ones, and tackles \nnontariff trade barriers that the United States has been battling for \ndecades. For the first time ever, we will have international trade \nrules to protect intellectual property rights, to reduce distortive \nagricultural subsidies, and to govern trade in services. Our workers, \nfarmers, industries, and firms excel in each of these areas and we will \nreap enormous benefit from these new agreements. In one fell swoop, \nover 120 countries are expected to agree to these rules, something \nwhich would take much longer to achieve if we were to negotiate one-on-\none with each of these countries.\n\n  The new rules on intellectual property rights, for example, will \nfinally raise standards worldwide to protect U.S. copyrights, patents, \ntrademarks, and other critically important intellectual property. We \nhave, for years, been trying to eliminate the piracy of our \nintellectual property, which costs the U.S. economy billions of dollars \neach year. Our computer software and pharmaceutical producers, among \nother industries, spend millions creating their innovative products and \nrely on strong intellectual property protection for their competitive \nsurvival. Anyone spending millions on R&D to create a new product \nobviously cannot compete for long against another company that has \nsimply copied the product at little cost by stealing patents and \nignoring copyrights. Few dare to do that in the United States because \nof our strong laws protecting intellectual property, but the same is \nnot true in many markets overseas, particularly in developing \ncountries. The Uruguay round will help reverse this situation.\n  In agriculture, our farmers, who exported over $40 billion last year, \nwill finally see some relief from the subsidy and other unfair trade \npolicies that have plagued world agricultural trade for far too long. \nThe Uruguay round agreement on agriculture will move us down a path of \nfairer and freer trade. Although it does not go nearly as far as I \nwould have liked, we are the world's largest agricultural exporter and \nwill be a major beneficiary of liberalized trade in this critical area. \nThe Department of Agriculture estimates that the Uruguay round could \nexpand farm exports by as much as $8.7 billion, create as many as \n190,000 farm-related jobs, and add as much as $2.5 billion in net farm \nsector income.\n  There is one area of the agricultural trade that must be further \naddressed by the administration as soon as the agreement goes into \neffect. This, of course, is making sure that Canada upholds its free \ntrade commitments to us by eliminating all tariffs to trade, including \npoultry products. Now that the Uruguay round commits Canada to \nconverting its very restrictive quota regime for poultry into tariffs, \nit must now agree to eventually eliminate them altogether. We have had \na free-trade agreement with Canada since 1989, but in my opinion that \nfree-trade agreement is not completely free until Canada eliminates the \nrestrictions it places on United States poultry products. The time has \ncome for our administration to start paying more attention to resolving \nthis problem.\n\n\n                       concerns over sovereignty\n\n  I would like to turn to two of the issues that have captured the most \nattention in the debate on the Uruguay round: The impact of the WTO and \nthe strengthened dispute settlement rules on U.S. sovereignty. I have \nexamined these important issues very closely and they have been an \nactive part of the Finance Committee's implementation process. Based on \nmy review, and the safeguards that Congress has required in the \nimplementing bill, I have concluded that U.S. sovereignty remains \nintact under the WTO, the GATT's successor regime.\n  That is not to say that a major international cooperative agreement, \nsuch as the Uruguay round, does not entail obligations on our part. It \ncertainly does, but it is an exercise in sovereignty in agreeing to \nadhere to them voluntarily because, on balance, we believe they are in \nour best national interest.\n  There are important safeguards in the actual implementing legislation \nthat address the concerns that have been raised and clear up some of \nthe misunderstandings about the agreement's effect on U.S. sovereignty. \nFor example, the bill clearly states, in section 102, that if there is \nany conflict between United States law and a Uruguay round agreement, \nonly United States law applies. The only changes to U.S. law as a \nresult of the Uruguay round are those that are contained in the \nimplementing bill we are now considering. After that, any future \ndecision on whether and how to change United States law in relation to \nany possible inconsistency with our Uruguay round commitments can only \nbe made by Congress. The WTO cannot change U.S. law; only the Congress \ncan do that. What we are considering here is not a self-executing \nagreement which has the direct force-of-law.\n  The implementing bill also addresses the State-related concerns that \nwere expressed earlier by establishing elaborate Federal-State \nconsultation procedures regarding possible obligations and dispute \nsettlement proceedings affecting State laws. Both the Governors and \nAttorneys General Associations, as well as other State organizations, \nhave endorsed this approach as meeting their concerns. The Governors \nAssociation unanimously endorsed passing the GATT agreement this year.\n  In looking at the WTO and the new dispute settlement rules, it is \nvery important to keep in mind that they essentially build on the \nexisting GATT, which has been in place since 1947. Article 9 of the WTO \nexplicitly provides that the decisionmaking process will continue the \nGATT practice of operating on the basis of consensus. The last time \nthere was a vote on a policy issue was in 1959. As under the GATT, \nvoting procedures can be used in the absence of consensus, based on a \none-country, one-vote process, but they are now more protective of our \ninterests than they were under the GATT. Most importantly, we do not \nhave to accept any future amendment affecting our fundamental rights \nand obligations if we choose not to.\n  There are other important safeguards in the bill. One is that both \nCongress and the private sector will have a much greater role in \nproviding input and oversight on the general operation of the agreement \nand on any future dispute settlement panel. There is also a built-in, \nexpedited procedure for a congressional vote on whether to continue \nU.S. participation in the WTO 5 years after it goes into effect, and \nevery 5 years after that. Our future majority leader, Senator Dole, has \nalso devised an earlier review process of the new dispute settlement \nrules, which could lead to our withdrawal from the WTO sooner than 5 \nyears. We can, of course, withdraw voluntarily at anytime after 6 \nmonths written notice.\n  I believe these and other provisions will ensure that the new WTO's \noperations do not impinge on our sovereign powers. While no one can \npredict precisely how the new WTO will work in practice, if the new \nsystem does indeed harm our sovereign interests, I do predict that we \nwill not remain as members for very long.\n\n\n                            budgetary impact\n\n  Before concluding my statement, I would like to make just a couple of \npoints on the budgetary impact of the agreement. The first point is \nthat Congress gave little or no thought to major trade-liberalizing \nagreements when the latest budget rules were enacted, because if it \nhad, I am convinced that these agreements would have been the exception \nto the rule. It is an historical fact that lowering tariffs and \neliminating trade barriers have major positive, dynamic economic \neffects which ultimately lead to increased revenue. Lowering tariffs \nare not a cost to the taxpayer, they are a decrease in producer and \nconsumer costs. This agreement goes much further than any previous GATT \nagreement in cutting global tariffs by almost $750 billion. It will put \nmore money in consumer pockets and will be a boon to the United States \nand world economy.\n  That is what the economic studies of the agreement show. The \nRepublican staff of the Joint Economic Committee recently surveyed \neight of these studies and found that the GATT's total fiscal impact \ncould lead to new revenue as high as $115 billion over 5 years.\n  Regardless of these economic and revenue benefits, the Uruguay \nround's tariff cuts do fall within current budget rules requiring that \nany lost revenue be offset, and the implementing bill includes funding \nprovisions to offset the $12 billion in lost tariff revenue that is \nexpected during the first 5 years of the agreement. Some of these \nproposals have been controversial, including the ``pioneer preference'' \nprovision. But the recent agreement between Senator Dole and the \nadministration on this provision should eliminate the concerns that \nhave been expressed about it. Unfortunately, however, the bill cannot \nbe changed at this point and, while I do not support these extraneous \nand controversial funding provisions, the agreement should not be \ndefeated because of them.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the time to move forward is now. It took 7 long years \nof negotiation to conclude the Uruguay round. The agreement itself was \nfinalized almost 1 year ago. There has been ample time to examine its \ncontents. The Finance Committee alone has held 25 hearings on one or \nmore aspects of the agreement.\n  It is essential that we approve this precedent-setting trade \nagreement. Current GATT rules are antiquated and have not kept pace \nwith the rapid changes in the global trading system. The GATT also does \nnot cover many areas of critically important trade to the United \nStates, such as services and intellectual property rights. And the \ncurrent GATT leaves in place major tariff and nontariff barriers that \nslow down or prevent the expansion of U.S. exports. We export well over \n$600 billion of goods and services and we need the Uruguay round's \ntrade rule improvements and greater worldwide market openings to \nfurther our export and economic growth. A stable, predictable and open \nglobal trade regime is in our Nation's best interests.\n  Failure to approve the Uruguay round through procedural points-of-\norder maneuvers or by voting against the implementing bill itself would \nbe a blunder of historical magnitude and would set our Nation's trade \nagenda in a harmful, backward direction. I cannot believe that this \nbody would choose that direction. I hope that it moves along the same \npath it did when it considered the last major GATT negotiation--the \nTokyo round. It passed the Senate overwhelmingly by 90 to 4. I hope \nthis latest agreement garners the same level of support, and I urge my \ncolleagues to strongly support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I yield 15 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. METZENBAUM. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the passage \nof the GATT because I think it is a bad deal for America. I think it is \na bad deal for American workers. I think it is a particularly bad deal \nfor the children of America. Unquestionably, one of the most prodigious \nand well-respected magazines in all the world is the Economist. The \nEconomist in its April 9, 1994, issue had a picture of a child carrying \nheavy cement blocks in India. The editorial is ``Free trade or foul.''\n  I believe the significance of that magazine, so totally well \nrespected throughout the world, addressing itself to the subject to \nwhich I addressed myself yesterday is important for people of this \ncountry to know about.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Economist, Apr. 9, 1994]\n\n                          Free Trade or Foul?\n\n       It was supposed to be a sunny coda to end years of \n     discordant haggling. Now it seems that next week's gathering \n     of world trade minister in Marrakesh, Morocco, may be a \n     darker affair. They are meeting to sign the agreement \n     hammered out during the seven-year Uruguay round of world \n     trade talks. But the prospects for world trade have become \n     clouded since the final negotiating session in Geneva in \n     December. This cloud, no bigger yet than a man's hand, is \n     growing fast.\n       In recent weeks America and France have been pressing for \n     an addition to the declaration from Marrakesh. Their demands \n     are unclear, but at a minimum they want a promise that the \n     new World Trade Organisation (the successor to the GATT) will \n     examine how labour standards and workers' rights ought to \n     affect trade rules. The proposal sounds innocuous, even \n     benign. Yet it has caused anger in the developing world. \n     India's prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao (whose efforts to \n     liberalise the Indian economy were difficult enough already, \n     said this week that such moves could become ``an alibi for \n     raising protectionist trade barriers''.\n       Peter Sutherland, the GATT's director-general, hopes that a \n     compromise (Japan proposed a vague reference to ``social \n     conditions'' in the Marrakesh communique) will allow the \n     celebrations to go ahead. But the subject will not go away. \n     The charge that developing countries are engaged in ``social \n     dumping''--competing unfairly by denying their workers basic \n     rights and decent conditions--is potent. It appeals equally \n     to rich-country self-interest and self-righteousness. The \n     competitive threat from third-world exports is likely to \n     increase over the next few years; as it does, social dumping \n     will challenge environmental protection as the issue most \n     likely to force radical change on the global trading system.\n\n\n                    crude disguises and flying pigs\n\n       Some complaints of social dumping hardly deserve to be \n     taken seriously. Those who regard it as ``unfair'' for \n     Chinese workers, say, to be paid less than American ones, and \n     who call for tariffs to redress the balance, are in truth \n     opposed to all trade between rich and poor countries. This is \n     extreme protectionism in the crudest possible disguise. When \n     its advocates claim as well to have the best interests of \n     developing-country workers in mind, they are surely \n     hypocrites too. Countries cannot pay their workers more \n     merely by deciding to do so. They must first produce more, \n     and the best way to spur growth is to trade.\n       What goes for wages applies as well to other labour costs. \n     To insist on a levelling of ``working conditions''--closer \n     equality in hours worked each week, standards of health and \n     safety in the workplace, entitlements to holidays, health \n     care, sick-pay, pensions and so forth--would be in every case \n     to insist on a standard of living that poor countries, being \n     poor, cannot afford. Legal rights over such terms of \n     employment may exist in most industrial countries, but rights \n     under the law (which are freely modified as circumstances \n     dictate) should not be confused with more basic human rights \n     (which are not).\n       Other concerns, however, cannot be so easily dismissed. \n     Slavery, which is wicked, is still practised in some \n     developing countries. Children should be educated, not sat at \n     looms or made to carry bricks all day. Workers should have \n     the rights of assembly and free speech--which, in some \n     developing countries, they are denied. In cases such as \n     these, basic freedoms are at stake. You do not need to be \n     rich to outlaw slavery or grant the rights of free speech and \n     assembly; education is costly, but curbing the cruellest \n     sorts of child labour is widely affordable. Therefore, is it \n     not right to put pressure on offending third-world \n     governments to change their ways? If there is a reasonable \n     chance that the pressure will work, and if it does not put \n     other interests at risk, the answer is Yes.\n       Granting that pressure may sometimes be justified, why not \n     let trade policy be the means? Free-traders, such as this \n     newspaper, would like to answer that pressure of this kind \n     never works. In fact, it often does. Against large countries \n     and small, America has often got its way by threatening trade \n     restrictions. The case against such a policy is not that it \n     cannot achieve its narrow objective, but that it puts other \n     interests--America's own, as well as those of the rest of the \n     world--in jeopardy.\n       The difficulty can be stated simply enough: governments \n     cannot be trusted with trade policy. If, as trade-policy \n     activists implicitly assume, governments were competent and \n     dedicated to the public good, there would be less to worry \n     about. The case for trade policy in pursuit of basic human \n     rights would be more persuasive (though low-flying pigs would \n     be a terrible nuisance). The institutions that liberal \n     democracies use to rule themselves are needed precisely \n     because governments in the real world are often incompetent \n     and always subject to demands from narrow, organised \n     interests. The GATT is one of these needed institutions--an \n     especially necessary one, because trade policy is an area in \n     which governments, left to themselves, are especially \n     unreliable. The GATT was created in the first place because \n     its founders understood that the pressure to protect \n     producers is intense; without an occasional exchange of \n     multilateral trade concessions, governments would find \n     liberal trade impossible to achieve.\n       They were right: only consider how close the Urguay round \n     was to collapsing last year, or the ferocity of opposition to \n     the North American Free-Trade Agreement, or the sharp rise \n     during the 1980s of new forms of non-tariff protection. \n     Liberal trade is under perpetual attack. To beat it back, \n     governments need to strengthen the GATT and at every \n     opportunity undermine its enemies.\n       If industrial countries insist on bringing labour-related \n     rights into the multilateral trade task, they will do the \n     opposite. The GATT will be weakened because its agreement-by-\n     consensus approach cannot accommodate such controversial \n     issues. At the same time the GATT's foes will be strengthened \n     by each new admissible ground for trade restrictions. For \n     instance, a trade rule on child labour might keep countries \n     in which that practice is common (whether or not legal) out \n     of the WTO; on the other hand, if a country joined the WTO \n     after signing up for the rule, but was then unable to enforce \n     it, it would be prey to every species of rich-country \n     projectionist, henceforth equipped with new grounds to seek \n     trade sanctions. In the battle between liberal trade on one \n     side and the protectionism that helps to keep poor countries \n     poor on the other, the balance would have shifted decisively \n     in the wrong direction.\n       Those who truly seek to advance the cause of human rights \n     in the third world should weigh this carefully--and \n     reluctantly conclude that the costs of pressing for new links \n     between trade and basic human rights outweigh the likely \n     benefits. They should call for diplomatic pressure instead; \n     and tell rich-country consumers about human-rights abuses, \n     then let them make up their own minds about whose goods to \n     buy. That is bound to strike many as inadequate. But in \n     reality most lobbyists seek to use human rights as just \n     another way to raise old-fashioned barriers against poor \n     countries' exports, caring little for human right, caring \n     nothing for the plight of the third world's poor, caring \n     nothing for the freedoms of industrial-country consumers. The \n     argument is ugly--but it will run and run.\n\n  Mr. METZENBAUM. Madam President, I had spoken yesterday at some \nlength about the whole issue of child labor and products pouring into \nthe United States. Today I will not repeat those arguments. But I will \ntalk about my other concerns with GATT.\n  I am frank to say that I wish I could support the agreement. I \nbelieve in and I want to support expanded trade. I believe that \ninternational trade agreements can be beneficial both to America and to \nthe entire world. But I believe that free trade must occur between \nequals. I do not believe that you can mix countries and markets of \nunequal status and unequal standards and expect all to benefit. Just \nlook at our own trade deficit. The whole idea is that NAFTA has been \nsuch a wonderful thing. That is just not true. We keep entering into \ntrade agreement after trade agreement and our trade deficit continues \nto increase. Last year our trade deficit was $130 billion. We are \nmaking a lot of progress. This year it is expected to exceed $160 \nbillion, and GATT will only increase that deficit.\n  Our recent experience with the NAFTA agreement further confirms the \nproblems of trade among unequals. Since the enactment of NAFTA, during \nthe first 6 months of 1994, our trade surplus with Mexico has declined \nby 50 percent. Sixty percent of Mexico's new capital is coming from the \nUnited States to build factories in order to make products which will \nbe sold back into the United States markets.\n  In addition, the jobs that NAFTA was going to create just have not \nmaterialized. The administration claimed that 100,000 jobs would be \ncreated by NAFTA. But so far only 500 have been created. Over 30,000 \nworkers have already filed for trade adjustment assistance because they \nclaim they lost their jobs by reason of NAFTA. Walk into any store in \nAmerica, in any of the shopping centers or in the smaller communities \nof America, wherever, the larger communities. It is nearly impossible \nto find products made in America anymore. Shoes from Brazil, clothes \nfrom China, India, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Taiwan, tools from Mexico and \nTaiwan, TV's and computers from Japan and Korea. Instead of entering \ninto endless free trade agreements that help our corporate community \nbut decimate our labor force, we should be investing in our own \nindustries to create American products and American jobs.\n  The GATT agreement will only accelerate the demise of American \nproduction. The average American has not the slightest idea what this \nagreement is about. Walk down the streets of any town, be it Dayton, \nOH, or Cody, WY, or Natchez, MS, or Eugene, OR. Ask the first person \nyou meet. ``What is GATT about? Are you for GATT or against it? Explain \nto me in one sentence or two sentences or a paragraph.'' He or she does \nnot have the slightest idea, but the professionals who are interested \nin our passing this bill have some idea what it is about.\n  But if the average citizen knew what was in this bill, they would be \nskeptical that American workers will benefit from some international \ntrade agreement about which they know practically nothing. We have an \nobligation to explain this major international agreement to the \nAmerican people. But we have no chance to do that. We must act within 2 \ndays. Great. I am in favor of always moving forward as promptly as we \ncan. But that means that the average American will not know what it is \nall about until he or she gets her termination notice. I am realistic \nenough to know that if this matter were debated for 2, 3, or 4 more \ndays more, that would not change the facts.\n  Unfortunately, however, this agreement is flawed in many ways.\n  The biggest problem is what is not in this agreement.\n  This agreement contains no protections for workers.\n  We should be considering international working conditions together \nwith trade.\n  It is basic common sense that if trade is based primarily on price \nwithout any other standards, America will lose out.\n  Labor, capital, and raw material costs determine the price of most \ngoods and services. And if American labor receives on average $15 an \nhour, and Korean, Indian or South American labor receives only $1 an \nhour, it is obvious what is going to happen.\n  The only way for America to compete against dramatically different \nlabor costs is to have significantly better quality. And some would \nargue that is the way we solve the problem. We produce better products. \nBut many foreign products are not that inferior to American made \nproducts. Whether it is clothing, toys, games, radios, TV, tools, or a \nhost of other products, it is difficult even without GATT to buy \nAmerican made products. With GATT we will only exacerbate the problem.\n  Blindly opening up American trade to the cheapest price without any \nlabor protections will only force countries to lower their labor costs, \nnot raise them.\n  American wages in real dollars, have declined almost 10 percent over \nthe past 20 years when adjusted for inflation.\n  In large part what Americans were worried about during this past \nelection cycle was the problems they face in their working lives.\n  Most Americans do not see that their working lives are getting \nbetter.\n  Americans are working longer hours for less pay.\n  They are watching their standard of living erode.\n  There is a relationship between increased international trade and \ndeclining American wages.\n  We must look at these issues together.\n  Unfortunately, too many who negotiate trade agreements know nothing \nabout wage and working conditions.\n  And I do not say that to slight any particular individual or group. \nToo many know about trade and trade only.\n  The only two places that working conditions are even mentioned in the \nGATT legislation are on pages 14 and 70. That is 2 pages out of more \nthan 2,000 pages. And the words on these two pages do not help American \nworkers.\n  On page 14 it states that--\n\n       Nothing in this act shall be construed to amend or modify \n     any law of the United States relating to worker safety unless \n     specifically provided in the act.\n\n  American workers need help. They need protection. GATT does not do a \nsingle thing for them in that statement. It actually only addresses \nitself to worker safety.\n  There are a whole range of labor laws that protect American workers \nin addition to worker safety.\n  Does this mean that our minimum wage and civil rights laws are not \nprotected under GATT?\n  Or our child labor laws?\n  Our labor relations laws?\n  Our antidiscrimination laws?\n  The sad fact is that this statement is stated the wrong way.\n  It should not just be that GATT does not undo other Federal laws.\n  We should affirmatively state that all of our labor laws are \nprotected as part of GATT.\n  Pages 70 says the President shall seek the establishment of a working \nparty to explore the relationship between internationally recognized \nworker rights and GATT.\n  It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is \nmeaningless mumbo jumbo. What is a working party? And what does it do \nafter it explores this relationship?\n  The reality is the United States and France already tried to get a \ncommittee on workers' rights and were rebuffed by India and most of the \nSouth American countries.\n  A lot of Third World countries do not want to raise the wages of \ntheir workers nor improve their working conditions. Their ruling elites \nwant to keep the benefits of trade for themselves.\n  But as long as we do not bring the working standards in these \ncountries up, they will continue to bring American workers' wages down.\n  If we could not get a committee on workers rights before GATT, \nimagine trying to get a committee after GATT becomes a reality.\n  It is disgraceful that a 2,000-page trade agreement contains barely 2 \npages even mentioning worker rights.\n  We need an international trade agreement but one that improves the \nlives of working men and women, not one that undermines it.\n  There is too much that we do not know about how this agreement will \nbe applied and much to be feared.\n  And quite honestly, I cannot help but conclude that the GATT \nagreement will undermine our framework of environmental laws.\n  Last fall, when the European automakers such as Mercedes, Ferrari, \nand Jaguar objected to U.S. CAFE standards, a GATT panel recommended \nthat the United States bring CAFE regulations into conformity with the \ntreaty's free trade obligations.\n  The CAFE standards law had been on the books since 1975.\n  It was passed in the grips of an oil shortage, when auto emissions \nwere rapidly deteriorating our air quality.\n  And in spite of that the panel concluded that this energy \nconservation law was a thinly disguised restriction on trade.\n  Quite frankly, this is just a shot across the bow for our \nenvironmental laws.\n  And I only wonder how other laws protecting the air, water, and \nenvironment will fare if the GATT treaty is approved.\n  Finally, too many of the financing provisions for this agreement \nsmell of corporate pork.\n  This bill contains sweet deals for the Washington Post, Cox \nEnterprises, Omnipoint Communications, GM, Ford, and Chrysler as well \nas public utilities.\n  In 1986, I stood on the Senate floor exposing and stopping dozens of \ntax breaks hidden in the Tax Reform Act for individual American \ncorporations.\n  Now the same type of shenanigans are going on again--only this time \nin an unamendable bill.\n  Why do good companies do this? They do not need these special breaks.\n  This agreement would raise even more revenues if it did not contain \nsuch special deals.\n  It undermines our credibility and that of these companies when they \nseek unnecessary special breaks.\n  It is especially shocking when the beneficiaries of these deals \ninclude some of the newspapers that generally editorialize against \ncongressional pork and special perks.\n  I was shocked to learn that the final GATT bill included the so-\ncalled pioneer preferences deal for the Washington Post, Cox \nEnterprises which owns the Atlanta Constitution, the Dayton Daily News, \nand Omnipoint Communications.\n  The administration cut a deal with these companies. They will receive \ncommunications licenses for a total of $400 million even though the \nfair market value of the licenses is estimated at $1.2 billion.\n  Under the Dole negotiations, it is my understanding that there is \nsomething about they might be able to reopen and rediscuss the subject \nat some later point. Do not hold your breath.\n  The FCC had been planning to auction the licenses on the open market \nthis December where they were estimated to sell for a total of $1.2 \nbillion.\n  But at the last minute, the administration and the companies cut a \nback room deal to sell the licenses for a total of $400 million. Who \npays?\n  The American taxpayer gets ripped off for $800 million.\n  There are other secret deals in this bill as well.\n  Senator Danforth extended an expiring provision to permit companies \nsuch as McDonnell Douglas in his State to transfer workers' pension \nmoneys to pay for health benefits. The Danforth provision permits \ncompanies to drain their pension funds jeopardizing both the workers' \npension and health benefits. What does this provision have to do with \ninternational trade? Nothing. And it does not belong in this bill.\n  The bill also contains a variety of pension law changes to speed up \npension funding by underfunded pension plans.\n  These pension changes have no place in a trade bill. We should use \npension reforms to provide better pension benefits to retirees, not to \npay for a trade bill.\n  Furthermore, some companies got special exemptions from the new \npension funding rules.\n  GM, Ford, and Chrysler negotiated special rules so that they do not \nhave to fully fund their pension plans.\n  And Senator Packwood put in a special deal for public utilities \nexempting them for 3 years from having to pay increased PBGC insurance \npremiums. He specifically provided that utilities need not pay \nincreased pension premiums for 3 years unless the utility gets the \nmoney through a rate increase from taxpayers. Again, this provision has \nno place in GATT and was never included in previous pension bills.\n  It is outrageous to include these deals for big business in an \nunamendable trade agreement that will shortchange the American worker.\n  This is not what the fast-track process was meant to be about.\n  These are exactly the types of insider deals that give the \nadministration and us our bad reputation. It amounts to buying votes \nwith taxpayer dollars.\n  In closing, I regret that I cannot support this agreement.\n  A vote ``no'' on the budget waiver is right--right for America, right \nfor balancing the budget, right for our economy, and right for millions \nof children around the world.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Madam President, I want to respond to two things the \nSenator from Ohio said. I have talked with Senator Moynihan, and he has \na response, and Senator Nickles will be speaking next for about 15 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Ohio mentioned two issues. One was the so-called \npioneer preference and the other was the regulated utilities and \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC]. I will explain what \nhappened on both of those, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \nfirst.\n  About 20 years ago, we set up the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation. We were worried about companies promising pensions to \nworkers and going bankrupt or going out of business and leaving the \npension plans underfunded. Workers of 20, 30 years of experience \nsuddenly had no pension. The PBGC was to collect premiums from \ncompanies, put them into a fund, so that if some company went bankrupt \nand could not pay, the Government the--PBGC--would have a fund to pay \nfrom. This is similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for \nbanks which has by and large worked well over the years.\n  We are aware that any number of companies have underfunded pension \nplans. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation advised us from time to \ntime that not enough money is going into the fund to pay the promised \nbenefits. So in this bill the administration suggested, and we agreed, \nto revamp that so that the companies with the highest level of \nunderfunding will pay more to the PBGC fund. None are going to pay \nless. They would pay more into their funds to guaranty the solvency of \ntheir pension funds.\n  Among the companies that we directed to increase their payments were \na number of regulated utilities--electric, water, transportation, and \nsewage companies. The one problem with many regulated utilities is that \ntheir prices are regulated by State law. So that if we increase a cost \nto the utility, they cannot immediately collect the money to pay it. \nThey have to go to the local public utility commission and say: The \nFederal Government said we have to pay more money into the PBGC, and we \npetition you to raise the rates to get the money to pay.\n  That is why we gave a 3-year grace period to the regulated utilities. \nThey are different from other companies because they cannot go out and \nautomatically increase their rates to recoup the premium costs. There \nis a company in Oregon that is so affected, and this came from a list \nthat the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation gave us. There were five \nin Ohio on the list that were similarly affected. There are several \nscores of these companies around the country that also benefit from \nthis provision. It is not a rifle shot for a company in Oregon.\n  Second, there is pioneer preference. This is an unusual situation. I \ncan understand the frustration of the Senator from Ohio. But let me \nexplain what happened.\n  Up until a few years ago, the Federal Communications Commission used \nto issue licenses on comparative applications, and if they had a radio \nfrequency to give out--and nowadays there are wireless communications--\nthey would give a frequency that your company could have to use for \nwireless communication, and you had what you called comparative \napplications. A number of companies would apply for a frequency. And \nthese applications were very expensive. You had to be a pretty well-\nfinanced company to even apply, by the time you got all of your \ntechnical experts and lawyers and say why you are better than some \nother company to get this. The Tom, Dick, and Harrys of this world \nsimply could not afford to get into the competition.\n  So after a number of years at congressional direction, we said this \nis not fair. We are getting into the area of wireless communication, \nand only the giants should be able to afford to even compete. So we \nsaid, instead of doing that, we want you to give these licenses by \nlottery, so everybody could apply. It does not cost much to apply if \nyou do not have to prove you are fit or unfit. Minimal qualifications. \nIf you win the lottery, you get a license. One unusual thing happened \nthat we did not foresee. Actually, there were two. A lot of very clever \nlawyers in this country, who were knowledgeable in the ways of the \nFederal Communication Commission, began to prepare scores of \napplications for the licenses. It did not cost a lot to file. They \nactually began to syndicate a piece of the application. Say you are a \nmechanic, a garage mechanic in Steubenville, you can put up $50 or $100 \nto get a piece of the application. If the lottery hit your number, \nthere is a big payoff. But the little guy did not get it anyway. As \nsoon as somebody won the lottery, one of the big giants went and bought \nit up from the person. So the mechanic who put up $50, $100, or $150, \nhit the jackpot. The big company bought it up. There was an after-\nmarket in these licenses.\n  So the Congress said this is ridiculous. If the big boys are getting \nit anyway, why do not we at least go back and have them auctioned off \nby the FCC and we will get the money?\n  Now, while this process was going on, before it got to Congress \nsaying we think we do not want these lotteried off anymore, we want \nthem auctioned off, a number of large companies came to the FCC and \nsaid, ``We have some very innovative ideas that are going to cost us \nmillions of dollars to develop. We are prepared to put up millions of \ndollars of research and innovation if our chances of getting a license \nare not based on lottery. Why should we put up $40 million to come up \nwith something innovative and no hope at all other than winning the \nlottery of getting the license?''\n  So the FCC said, all right. We will make you a deal. We will have a \npioneer preference and here are the standards. The FCC set up a bunch \nof standards, and there were competitive applicants for these pioneer \npreferences. A lot of companies put up a lot of money on research. And \nthe FCC picked three and they said: We think what you have shown is \njustifiable, and research is good, and we think it is innovative and is \ngoing to advance the communications of this country, and we award \nthese.\n  Three licenses. Interestingly, some people did not like the process. \nTheir application did get picked in pioneer preference. They are now \ncomplaining.\n  At this stage there was never any talk of paying for these licenses \nbecause if you won a license in the lottery, you did not pay for it \neither. You got it for nothing.\n  So when we said to pioneers, if you put up millions of dollars and if \nyou will come up with something innovative, you get a license, we did \nnot think of charging them. We were not charging anybody for any \nlicense, whether they won in the lottery or otherwise.\n  But then Congress said to the FCC, change your practice, do not \nlottery them off anymore; auction them off. At that stage the Federal \nCommunications Commission had already said to these pioneers, if you \nput up a lot of money and do research and meet our standard as to what \nis innovative, we will give you a license even though Congress said \nauction.\n  Then, the Federal Communications Commission felt somewhat honor bound \nto go ahead and award some of the pioneer licenses. The FCC awarded \nthree even after Congress told them to auction the licenses off. And \none of them happens to be a company that is 70 percent owned by the \nWashington Post and another is Cox Communications and another is \nOmnipoint.\n  The big flap came around the Washington Post. Why does the \nadministration cut a deal with the Washington Post, and what is going \non?\n  The administration did not cut the deal. Think of the sequential \nsituation. We lottery off all these licenses and you pay nothing for \nthem. We say to the pioneers, well, the chance of winning the lottery \nis not very great. If you put up a lot of money we will give you a \nlicense. We do not charge anybody for licenses anyway. So we will not \ncharge you. Then Congress says charge and the Federal Communications \nCommission says it is not fair. These companies put up all this money, \nwe will give them three free licenses. This occurred on about December \n1993.\n  A couple months later the Federal Communications Commission, after a \nlawsuit was filed, changed its position and said, no, we are not going \nto give or even let these pioneers have these licenses for nothing. We \nare going to charge them a certain amount.\n  At this stage one of the three companies sued and said, ``You \nviolated the contract. You promised this. We relied on it. We put a lot \nof money in for research. Now you are changing the rules for us.''\n  The case is in the court of appeals. It has not yet been decided. For \nthe moment the court has simply remanded it to the Federal \nCommunications Commission and is holding it to see what Congress and \nthe Federal Communications Commission are going to do because as of yet \nthe Federal Communications Commission has not charged them. They said \nwe are going to charge you, they have not done it yet. So from the \nstandpoint of the court, the case is not what you call ripe. It is not \nquite ready for decision.\n  But if this company wins the case in court, then the Government gets \nnothing, and none of the three companies will have to pay us anything--\nif they win. This case has not been decided.\n  This is a common situation with lawyers in court. Do you go ahead, \ntake your case to the jury and take your chances, win or lose, zero or \na hundred, or do you settle and not take the chance of possibly losing \neverything?\n  So the administration worked out arrangements with these three \ncompanies and said, all right, let us reach a settlement. You pay us a \nminimum of $400 million plus interest, a minimum. It may be more than \nthat because it is going to be based upon a percentage of the auction \nprice of these new licenses. And the auction starts on December 5 and \ngoes for about a month. It is going to be based upon a percentage of \nthat auction price, but in any event they will pay $400 million plus \ninterest. And if they accept that offer they have to drop the lawsuits.\n  They accepted the offer. So now the Government is guaranteed at a \nminimum of getting $400 million plus interest. We might get more if the \nauction price is a lot more, but no one knows what the auction price is \ngoing to be. That is the trouble with pioneer licenses.\n  You can argue whether we ever should have had the policy, or the \nFederal Communications Commission was right or wrong in what they did. \nYou can argue whether standards were correct or not correct. But at the \ntime they set it up, they set it up because people were not going to \nput up millions of dollars for research and innovation in \ncommunications if the chance of getting a license was based upon the \nlottery with 60,000 or 70,000 applicants in the lottery. That is it.\n  Was this a sellout to the Washington Post? No, it was not a sellout. \nIt was a settlement, a settlement in the hopes of getting some money, \nand a settlement of avoiding the risk of getting no money and having to \njustify these three licenses anyway.\n  The administration has now agreed, and Senator Dole got them to \nagree, that after the new Congress comes in they will reconsider this, \nand the Federal Communications Commission may have the power to undo \nthis. I am not quite sure what happens to the lawsuits in that case, \nbut we have to see when we get there. Apparently it is going to be \nreconsidered in the next Congress. There certainly was not any malice \nby the Federal Communications Commission or by Ambassador Kantor or \nPresident Clinton or the Washington Post or anyone else in how this \narrangement was arrived at.\n  I thank the Chair. I believe Senator Moynihan wanted to say something \nand we will then go to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and future chairman.\n  Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may require, and it is \nnot much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I regret the tone in which I will have to speak, but it \nis one of sincere regret.\n  There is not a more honorable Member of this body than the Senator \nfrom Missouri, Senator Danforth. The idea that there is any provision \nin this measure that is put there as some kind of backroom deal for \nSenator Danforth is completely unfounded. Senator Danforth has been \ninterested for some time in the use of excess pension assets to fund \nretiree health benefits. It is a perfectly logical, reasonable case to \nmake--that where moneys are not needed for this employee benefit, they \nmay be used for this other employee benefit. He persuaded us \ncompletely, and it stands, in my view, and I am sure the Senator from \nOregon shares it--it was the entirely proper proceeding as open as the \nmorning sky.\n  I am sure the Senator from Ohio did not mean anything personal in \nthis regard. I see he is standing, and I yield to him.\n  Mr. METZENBAUM. Madam President, the Senator from Ohio pointed out \nthe deals not as a reflection upon either Senator Packwood, Senator \nDanforth, or any individual Member. I think everybody's conduct is \nentirely above board and I have no fault with it at all.\n  My point of reference is that these measures do not belong in the \nGATT treaty, and it is in that respect that I criticized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is a perfectly legitimate argument, Madam \nPresident, and yet the paygo provisions required us to pay. The \nprovision in question raises substantial revenue.\n  May I also say with respect to the idea there was some backroom deal \nwith respect to the Washington Post or such, in no sense can it be so \ndescribed in my view.\n  My friend from Oregon, the future chairman--who has the distinct \nadvantage of having attended the New York University law school, and \ntherefore is a far more formidable man in this regard--spoke that the \nGovernment was faced with the prospect losing a court challenge and \ngetting no money at all.\n  I wonder if he would not agree from the point of view of a lawyer, \nbecause I have distinguished attorneys here, we have many of them with \nthe Finance Committee--Mr. Joseph Gale, our chief tax counsel--I know \nwhat his view is, that it was not a risk. It was a probability about \nhow a court would decide.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Whether it was a probability, a possibility or a risk, \nthere is no question but what the court of appeals was sitting on this \ncase and was going to wait to see what we did or what the Federal \nCommunications Commission did. But had that case gone to conclusion I \nam not sure but what a court would not have said, ``If the FCC said you \ndo ABC you get a license for nothing,'' and you did ABC-plus, you might \nhave a pretty good case.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Now we have, if there is anything--I hesitate to say \nthis at this point in the debate--if there is anything involved here, \nit might just possibly be an abuse of Government authority. It is \ncertainly not a backroom deal.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. METZENBAUM. Will the Senator from Oregon yield for a question?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Yes, I yield for a question.\n  Mr. METZENBAUM. Who won in the lower court?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. There was no lower court decision because you appealed \ndirectly from the Federal Communications Commission to the court of \nappeals, so there has been no decision yet. The court of appeals is \njust holding it pending further action by the Federal Communications \nCommission, because as yet the FCC has not charged them. So they do not \nreally, exactly, have a pending case.\n  Mr. METZENBAUM. Would the Senator from Oregon, who I know is a fair \nman and scholar, agree that this matter, as well as some of the other \nmatters that are in the bill, do not really belongs in a GATT treaty?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Let me answer this question this way. They are not \nexactly in the GATT treaty.\n  In other words, the pioneer preference was not negotiated in Geneva \nin the GATT treaty. The administration and Congress will come up with \nmoney to pay--and we have a number of provisions in here--by raising \nmoney. And I think anybody can probably say that most of the things \nthat are in here to raise money really have no relation to trade.\n  So, are they related to trade? No. Are they in the treaty? No. Did we \nhave to come up with some money under our scoring rulings to pay? Yes, \nwe did. And this was one of the ways we come up with some money.\n  Mr. METZENBAUM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Before turning to Senator Nickles, Senator Wallop has a \nstatement. I think it is about 1 minute long.\n  Mr. WALLOP. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. As he \nwill recall, last summer during the Finance Committee consideration of \nthe administration proposals for changes to antidumping and \ncountervailing duty law, we considered an amendment to deal with \nsituations of ``no supply.'' This amendment would have created a \nprocedure to allow for temporary and quantity-limited relief from \norders where a particular product needed by U.S. industry is not \navailable domestically.\n  The amendment did not pass. However, during the consideration of the \namendment the Department of Commerce submitted to the Finance Committee \nan explanation of authority to consider the lack of domestic \navailability in deciding issues that would come before the Commerce \nDepartment and the International Trade Commission in antidumping and \ncountervailing duty cases.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed \nin the Record at the appropriate point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1994.\n     Hon. Michael Kantor,\n     U.S. Trade Representative,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor: During the Finance Committee's \n     consideration of the GATT implementing legislation this \n     summer, I proposed an amendment to the antidumping and \n     countervailing duty laws to establish a procedure for ``no \n     supply,'' under which the Commerce Department could \n     selectively waive the application of dumping or \n     countervailing duties in cases where domestic producers were \n     unable to meet domestic demand for a particular product. A \n     considerable coalition of American manufacturing companies \n     strongly supported this amendment. The Administration, for \n     reasons that are still unclear to me, vigorously opposed the \n     amendment. As a result, it did not pass.\n       However, during consideration of the amendment, the \n     Department of Commerce submitted to the Finance Committee a \n     carefully worded explanation of its current authority to \n     consider the lack of domestic availability in deciding issues \n     that come before the Commerce Department and the \n     International Trade Commission in antidumping and \n     countervailing duty cases. A copy of this explanation is \n     attached.\n       I would very much appreciate your consulting with the \n     Secretary of Commerce, and others whom you consider \n     appropriate, to inform me if the Administration concurs that \n     the Commerce Department has the authority to consider lack of \n     domestic supply in proceedings under the antidumping and \n     countervailing duty laws, as outlined in the attached paper \n     from the Commerce Department. I would greatly appreciate a \n     response prior to the Senate's vote on the GATT, given the \n     relevance of this issue to my consideration of the GATT \n     implementing legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Malcolm Wallop,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    The U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Malcolm Wallop,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wallop: Thank you for your letter of November \n     17, 1994 concerning the ``no supply'' amendment that you \n     proposed during the Senate Finance Committee's consideration \n     of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Your letter asks for \n     confirmation of the statement provided by the Department of \n     Commerce on the exclusion of products from an investigation \n     or order.\n       After consulting with the Department of Commerce, I can \n     confirm all of the information provided in the statement. In \n     particular, I can confirm that the lack of domestic supply \n     may motivate interested parties to request that Commerce \n     consider the scope of an investigation or order or conduct a \n     changed circumstances review. The Department has the \n     authority to define the scope of an investigation and to \n     clarify the scope of an order to exclude products where \n     coverage would not serve the purposes for which the petition \n     was brought. In a changed circumstances review, the \n     Department has the authority to revoke an order in part if \n     maintaining the order as issued is no longer of interest to \n     the domestic producers.\n       The lack of domestic supply is relevant to the \n     International Trade Commission's injury determinations in \n     initial investigations as well as sunset reviews. As noted in \n     the Department's earlier statement, the fact that a product \n     is not made in the United States is reflected in the \n     Commission's determination of whether the imports are a cause \n     of injury to the domestic industry.\n       The Clinton Administration recognizes the importance of the \n     upcoming vote on the Uruguay Round Agreements Act to you and \n     your constituents. We are fully prepared to answer any \n     further questions about the proposed implementing legislation \n     as quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Kantor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Exclusion of Products From an Investgation or Order\n\n       There are mechanisms under current law by which a product \n     can be excluded from an order without undermining the overall \n     effectiveness of the antidumping and countervailing duty \n     laws. Proposals have been made from time to time to depart \n     from this structure to create discretion to waive application \n     of antidumping and countervailing duties. It is the \n     Administration's view, given the existing provisions, that \n     such authority is inappropriate, would undermine the \n     effectiveness of the law, and would result in undue \n     discretion to favor different industries.\n\n\n                        Investigation Procedures\n\n       Throughout the investigation, the administering authority \n     has the ability to define and clarify the scope of the case \n     to exclude products where coverage would not serve the \n     purposes for which the petition was brought. In addition, in \n     making the injury determination, the ITC must define ``like \n     product'' based on consideration of whether the \n     characteristics and uses of the domestic production are \n     similar to those of the imported product. The fact that a \n     product is not made in the United States will be reflected in \n     the ITC's determination of whether the imports are a cause of \n     injury to the domestic industry. If petitioning companies are \n     not producing a competing product, there will be no lost \n     sales, or adverse price impact with respect to the particular \n     merchandise and this will be a factor taken into account in \n     making the overall injury determination.\n\n\n                         Post Order Procedures\n\n       After an order is in effect, the administering authority \n     can clarify the scope of an order. If a product has \n     substantially different characteristics or uses than the \n     merchandise covered by the order and it is unclear whether \n     the order included the specific product at issue, it can be \n     declared outside the scope of the order. Furthermore, the \n     Department will continue to have the authority, based on a \n     changed circumstances review, to revoke an order in part when \n     maintaining an order as issued is no longer of interest to \n     the domestic producers.\n       Finally, an order will not continue indefinitely if it is \n     not continuing to provide a needed remedy to the domestic \n     industry. Under the new sunset review procedures required by \n     the GATT, if injury is not likely to continue or recur, the \n     order will be revoked. The goal of defining the scope and \n     duration of orders through these procedures is to ensure that \n     the petitioning industries are provided an adequate remedy \n     while not unnecessarily inhibiting trade.\n\n  Mr. WALLOP. Based on this information, a number of Senators may have \nconcluded that the current authority of the Commerce Department and the \nInternational Trade Commission to address no supply situations was \nadequate and that further authority was unnecessary. Specifically, \nunder that antidumping and countervailing duty law, the nonavailability \nof a product from a domestic source is a relevant factor that the \nCommerce Department may consider in defining the scope of an \ninvestigation, in clarifying the scope of an order, and in deciding \nwhether to revoke an order, in whole or in part. The fact that the \ndomestic industry is unable to supply a particular product is a good \nindication of lack of domestic interest in including that product in \nthe scope of an investigation or order. In addition, nonavailability is \na relevant factor in situations such as the International Trade \nCommission's like product, injury causation, and revocation \ndeterminations.\n  So my question, Senator Packwood, is, do you concur that the Commerce \nDepartment and the International Trade Commission possess the authority \nto consider the nonavailability of merchandise and antidumping and \ncountervailing duty investigations and orders?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I confirm, Senator Wallop, that the antidumping and \ncountervailing duty statute authorizes the Department of Commerce to \nconsider a number of factors in deciding the issues you have had \ndescribed, and that among these is whether a product is available from \na domestic producer. For example, the Department of Commerce or the \nInternational Trade Commission may consider unavailability of a product \nin clarifying the scope of an investigation or order in making like \nproduct and causation determinations and considering whether an order \nshould be revoked in whole or in part. There is little sense including \nwithin an antidumping or countervailing duty remedy products that U.S. \nusers cannot get from domestic producers. I expect that the Commerce \nDepartment will exercise this authority when appropriate.\n  Mr. WALLOP. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his response.\n  I point out one last thing: That even the greatly protectionist \nEuropean Union included the no supply provision in its application.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I now yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, first I wish to congratulate Senator \nPackwood, the future chairman of the Finance Committee, and also \nSenator Moynihan, the chairman of the Finance Committee, for an \noutstanding job on this piece of legislation. And also my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Wallop, who will be casting his last vote later \ntonight in the Senate. His service for the last 18 years to the Senate \nhas been a real asset, not only to the State of Wyoming, but also to \nthis country as well.\n  Madam President, I rise today in support of GATT. But first let me \nsay I do not rise in support of a lot of things that are happening in \nthis process. I strenuously object to the fast-track process. I object \nto the fact that we are having implementing legislation that we are not \nable to amend. It is 600-some-odd pages and it touches several things. \nThe Senator from Ohio raised some of those issues and I think Senator \nPackwood addressed them very well. But I would like to have the \nopportunity to amend them. We do not have that opportunity now but we \nwill next year. I have some problems with some of the provisions in the \nimplementing legislation.\n  I might mention, too, Madam President, as far as the GATT, the trade \nagreement itself, that is not amendable. I know even one of our major \nnewspapers in my State said, ``Let's put it off until next year. \nCongress can amend it next year.''\n  Well, that is not possible. We signed an agreement with 123 nations, \na trade agreement to reduce tariff and nontariff barriers. I think that \nis positive. It is probably not perfect. Anything that is thousands and \nthousands of pages long leaves a lot to be desired. The fact that it \nhas a general reduction in tariff and nontariff barriers I think is \nvery positive. But I do not like the process.\n  Also, I compliment the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, \nwho delayed this somewhat and caused some concern amongst the \nadministration. I think he is to be complimented. Because of his action \nwe did have more hearings. I think we needed those hearings.\n  I am also critical of the administration, because this trade \nagreement was agreed to on December 15, 1993. It took the \nadministration until the last week that we were in session to say we \nwant to pass it this year. I think that is one of the reasons GATT has \nhad some trouble. It is one of the reasons it had some trouble with \nthis Senator. I do not like this process. I do not like being told that \nwe cannot amend the implementing agreement, and I do not like being \ntold we have to pass something very quickly. As a matter of fact, I \nprobably would have voted against it if they had tried to pass it in \nthe last 3 or 4 days of the session, just because I do not like being \nrailroaded. I do not like being forced into action without having a \nchance to review it.\n  Well, we have had a month or so and Senator Hollings has had \nsignificant hearings that, I think, exposed some of the strengths and \nsome of the weaknesses of the underlying agreement.\n  I also think it has taken too long to get here. The GATT process \nstarted in 1986. Basically, it started under the Reagan administration \nand continued during the Bush administration. I compliment the Bush \nadministration because it made significant gains. They included \nagriculture. Many countries did not want agriculture to be included in \nGATT, and it had not been in the past. They had all kinds of \nrestrictions. But they were successful in November 1992 in including \nagriculture in the GATT agreement. I think it is a very positive thing \nfor agriculture, and any agriculture State needs to look very closely \nat this. It has a lot of positive things. So I compliment the Bush \nadministration for its success in that.\n\n  But that was in November 1992. This administration took another year \nto finalize the agreement, all the way to December 15, 1993. Then it \nhas taken us now almost a full year to get to where we are voting on \nit. I think that is too long, and I regret the fact that the Clinton \nadministration waited until the last few days of the session.\n  But it does not change the fact we are voting on GATT. And we are \nalso voting on the implementing legislation. We cannot separate the \ntwo. Some of us may not like some of these provisions, either, to \nfinance this package, as was mentioned. Special provisions dealing with \npioneer preferences; we can reopen that. Senator Dole has already made \nmention of that, and has an agreement with the administration to do so \nif it is determined that those prices were too low. I think that was a \nstep in the right direction. I was concerned about that, so I agree.\n  But I look at the overall thrust of the agreement of GATT, a \nreduction in tariffs and nontariff trade barriers, and I support that. \nI support that wholeheartedly. I think that is a positive move for our \ncountry. I think it is a positive move for other countries.\n  Some people say, well, other countries will benefit more than the \nUnited States. I disagree. Trade is a two-way street. We do not compel \nanybody to trade in this legislation. Trade is a voluntary effort. If \nsomebody wants to sell a product, they can sell it. If somebody else \nwants to buy it, they will buy it. It will be mutually beneficial. It \nis not one winner and one loser, or somebody wins and somebody loses.\n  That is not the case in trade. Trade can be and should be mutually \nbeneficial. If you get Government barriers and tariffs out of the way, \nthen you are allowing free individuals to be making those decisions and \nI think that is positive.\n  I also think it is real positive that agriculture now has access. I \nnotice in my State--the cattle industry is probably our biggest \nagriculture commodity--the National Cattlemen's Association supports \nGATT, the Farm Bureau associations support GATT, the Wheat Growers and \nthe Grain and Feed Associations support GATT, mainly because they see \nthis as increasing markets. And that makes sense. We produce a lot more \nthan we can consume in my State and in this country. We are a very \nproductive country in agriculture, and we should be proud of that. We \ncan compete with anybody in the world.\n  So this general agreement with 123 countries says we are going to \ntear down some of those barriers. The barriers are a lot higher in \nthose countries than they are in our country, so they have a lot more \nto reduce. That is to our gain, and I think it is to the gain of the \nother countries as well. I think it is mutually beneficial. And that \nmeans that people in the cattle industry, the wheat industry, or people \nin the high-technology industries in my State, California, or Oregon, \nare going to be able to sell more. And that creates jobs, and those are \ngood jobs. Exports do create thousands of jobs. GATT is estimated by \nsome to create 700,000 jobs; some estimate 1.4 million jobs. I do not \nknow which is correct, but I do know increased trade will increase \njobs. This will increase jobs, and I think that is positive. The \nreduction of tariffs is positive.\n  Some people say they have had reservations about it. I have had \nreservations about it. I have had reservations about the sovereignty \nprovision because many people said this infringes on our sovereignty. I \ndo not want to do that. I will not do it. Am I an expert in that area? \nNo.\n  I did notice this letter by Robert Bork. I will just read the first \nsentence or two. He writes:\n\n       This letter is in response to opponents of the ratification \n     of the Uruguay round agreement, the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, who argue that GATT undermines U.S. \n     sovereignty by creating the World Trade Organization. The \n     opponents' charge is simply false.\n\n  I respect Judge Bork.\n  I also look at the implementing legislation, and on page 14 it says:\n\n       United States laws to prevail in conflict. No provision of \n     the Uruguay Round of agreements, nor the application of such \n     provisions to any person or circumstance that is inconsistent \n     with any law of the United States, shall have effect.\n\n  That is pretty plain. It is pretty simple. They cannot overturn U.S. \nlaws or State laws in GATT.\n  Some people have alleged that, and I even read it in one of the \nnewspapers today. That is not the case.\n  Again, maybe the implementing legislation will be changed, but I know \nthat is one provision that will not be changed, so I feel comfortable \nwith that.\n  Some people said, well, they are going to support the agreement but \nthey do not support the budget waiver because they do not want to \nincrease the deficit. I respect that statement a lot. I probably voted \nto object to waiving the budget as many times as anybody on the floor. \nI do not want to waive the budget order that allows us to increase \ndeficit spending. But, likewise, Madam President, I think we should \ntake into account the economic consequences of our decisions.\n  Some people have estimated that we are going to be increasing trade \nby GATT. Again, I do not know if this is factual or not. I have not run \nthis through computers and so forth. But they estimated that by passing \nGATT, we are going to be increasing trade, to the benefit of the United \nStates, by a $100 billion to $200 billion increase in economic activity \nevery year. That is going to create jobs. That is going to have people \npaying taxes. There will tax revenue generated.\n  I think we should take that economic effect into consideration, and \nat least give it some credit. We do not give it any credit right now. \nWe analyze budgets with a static model instead of a dynamic one. And I \nthink GATT will have a positive impact and probably produce far more \nrevenue than it would lose by a small reduction in these tariffs.\n\n  Again, keep in mind our trading partners are reducing their tariffs \nmuch, much more than we are. So I think that is positive.\n  Some of the other provisions that were mentioned--Senator Metzenbaum \nmentioned one concerning pioneer preferences. I listened to Senator \nPackwood's analysis of that. He has done a lot of homework on it. I \ncompliment him. Maybe what is in the implementing legislation is just \nright but it may not be right, so maybe we will have to take a look at \nthat next year. We are willing to do that. We can do that. We cannot \nreopen GATT and rewrite GATT. We cannot call the 123 countries that \nhave been working on this since 1986 and say let us do this all over \nagain, we do not like one provision. That is not possible. Several \ncountries have already signed on. But we can review the implementing \nlegislation and if we do not like something in it, or if it is not \nenough, or if it is not fair, let us review it. We can do that. We will \nreview it and Congress can do that and hopefully we will.\n  Madam President, I think it is important that we pass GATT. It is \nalso important we do not fail to pass it. What would happen if we fail \nto pass it? Some people say wait until next year. I do not think we \ncan. I do not think we can rewrite GATT. We can rewrite the \nimplementing legislation. We cannot rewrite GATT.\n  What would happen if we do not pass it? All the other countries have \nbeen looking to the United States to be the leader of the free world. \nWe have been espousing free trade for decades, and especially during \nthe Reagan-Bush years. They were the leaders. They were the ones. \nReagan and Bush were telling everybody we want to tear down barriers. \nSo we passed the Canadian-Free-Trade Agreement, we passed a free trade \nagreement with Israel. Now we passed NAFTA. In every case we have \nincreased trade. It has been to the mutual benefit of all countries to \ndo that.\n  If we do not pass GATT I am afraid the opposite will happen. A whole \nlot of those countries that have been looking to the United States for \nleadership will start moving back and say, ``Wait a minute, we are not \ngoing to do that. We are going to close our doors to agriculture.'' So \nSouth Korea is not going to allow us to sell beef or rice there, or \ninto Japan. Or in France, where they have made restrictions time and \ntime again on various agriculture exports, they would start building \nthose walls. You can see this happen, country by country. Again, that \nwould happen because the United States, which is supposed to be the \nleader in world trade and free trade, failed to ratify an agreement \nthat we have been negotiating for 8 years. I think it would be a \nserious mistake.\n  So for the above reasons I hope my colleagues, one, will vote to \nwaive the budget and, two, vote to pass the GATT agreement.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I yield to my friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, 10 minutes to speak to the \nmomentous question before us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeCONCINI. I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Moynihan, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Packwood, ranking \nmember, and compliment them on the work they have done on trade matters \nover the many years I have been here with them.\n  Madam President, I followed the Uruguay round negotiations of GATT \nover the past 7 years with great interest, and I have been very pleased \nwith some results, and very displeased with others. I have carefully \nconsidered the implementation legislation before us today. This is a \nvote which will have great implications for the future of our economy. \nThough there are many areas which trouble me, in weighing the pros and \nthe cons, I have to come down in favor of voting to waive the Budget \nAct and vote in favor of the legislation to implement the Uruguay round \nagreement.\n  I believe the GATT has served our Nation and the international \neconomy well since we became members in 1947. It has opened up \ninternational markets, brought down trade barriers and reduced tariffs, \nfrom an average of 40 percent in 1947 to an average of 4.7 percent \nbefore the Uruguay round. In short, by bringing rule and order to the \ninternational trading system it has allowed international trade to \nflourish. It is not a perfect system. There have been rulings against \nthe United States with which I did not agree and which deeply troubled \nme. But as the largest economy in the world, I believe the United \nStates has benefited greatly from the GATT.\n  One of the failings of the current system is that, prior to the \nUruguay round, sectors greatly important to the United States, such as \nservices, agriculture and intellectual property, were not included in \nthe GATT rules. While there are provisions in the Uruguay round where I \nhad hoped the United States would get a better deal and there are \nprovisions in the implementing legislation which deeply concern me, \noverall I believe being a member of the World Trade Organization and \nimplementing the Uruguay round agreement is far more beneficial to the \nUnited States than remaining outside this system.\n  Failure of the United States to join the WTO and the unraveling of \nGATT would have disastrous consequences. An international trade \nenvironment not governed by comprehensive agreements would leave \nindividual countries to put up trade barriers at will, set tariffs \narbitrarily and force individual industries to scramble around the \nglobe to cut deals with every country in which they wanted access. This \nwould be a chaotic system which, I fear, would bring international \neconomic growth to a grinding halt.\n  I am supporting the implementing legislation not because I believe \nthe Uruguay round agreement is perfect in all respects but because \noverall I believe this trade agreement will lead to economic growth for \nour country by opening foreign markets to American goods and lowering \ntariffs on American goods sold abroad. The agreement will be good for \nAmerican workers whose products will be more accessible overseas, will \nhelp U.S. exporters compete for Government infrastructure projects \noverseas and will help American consumers by lowering the tariff on \ngoods they purchase.\n  Lower tariffs is one of the significant achievements of this \nagreement. Tariffs will be reduced to zero on many important items such \nas construction, agricultural and medical equipment and pharmaceuticals \nand will be reduced 50-100 percent on electronic items. Overall, \ntariffs will be cut by one-third. In essence, this is a huge tax cut \nwhich will stimulate new opportunities for American products abroad and \nwill allow American consumers to pay less at home for goods and \nservices.\n  One tariff in which I had a particular interest during the Uruguay \nround negotiations was on refined copper products, in which Arizona is \na world leader. I pushed for zero tariffs on refined copper products. \nWhile Ambassador Kantor worked hard to get zero tariffs, the Japanese \nwere unwilling to go to zero on this product. In the end, however, \nsignificant tariff cuts were made which will allow expanded access to \nthe Japanese copper market which will benefit Arizona and United States \ncopper in general.\n  In agriculture, another area important to my home State, this \nagreement does much to allow American farmers to compete globally as \nthe GATT for the first time addresses trade in agriculture. U.S. \nfarmers have long been hurt by countries which limited imports and \nsubsidized exports. This agreement cuts export subsidies and internal \nagricultural supports, both of which distort trade and have hurt \nAmerican farmers as the Europeans have subsidized their farmers higher \nthan the United States. This cut in subsidies, along with provisions \nwhich will allow the use of funds for the Export Enhancement Program to \nenhance exports, will greatly help American farmers including Arizona \ncotton growers. Arizona citrus growers will greatly benefit by lower \ntariffs by Japan and Thailand, among other countries and by the \nreduction in export subsidies by the European Union.\n  In addition to agriculture, another important element of this \nagreement is the fact that it covers trade in services for the first \ntime. The service sector represents 60 percent of U.S. output and 70 \npercent of U.S. jobs.\n  It is enormously important that the service sector was brought into \nGATT for the first time with the Uruguay round.\n  The agreement provides that countries not discriminate among foreign \nservice providers, and that foreign service providers be treated the \nsame as domestic providers.\n  As I mentioned, there are areas of the agreement which concern me. I \nshare the concerns of some about the World Trade Organization. In \nparticular, I am troubled by the meetings of dispute panels in closed \nsessions and that the panel deliberations will be confidential.\n  In addition, I am troubled by the idea that U.S. laws designed to \naddress environmental concerns or child labor concerns could be \nchallenged--and I say could be--as trade barriers by the WTO members. \nAt the same time, however, I believe that the WTO also improves upon \nprevious dispute settlement practices by achieving a more effective and \nexpeditious dispute settlement mechanism. Furthermore, no WTO decision \ncan affect U.S. law unless the Congress of the United States changes \nthe law.\n  Since historically the United States has brought more cases to the \nGATT than any other country and we have seen many rulings favorable to \nthe United States be blocked, the WTO procedures could well work to our \nadvantage.\n  Another area where I have had strong concerns is in the area of \nintellectual property. My concerns are the lack of national treatment \nand recognition of contractual rights with certain copyright revenue, \nexclusion of plants and animals from patents, pipeline protection for \npharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals and shortening the \ntransition periods. Certain countries, especially in Europe, impose \nlevies on the sale of blank audio and visual recording media and \nequipment which can be used to make private, unauthorized copies of \nmotion pictures and sound recordings and they do it for millions and \nhundreds of millions of dollars each year.\n  The problem is that the U.S. right holders do not share fully in the \nrevenue distribution. This is not a fair deal for the United States \ncopyright industries. However, having said that, there are benefits for \nthe United States in this agreement in that area. These include \nestablishing minimum standards for the protection of intellectual \nproperty rights which was not there before; ensuring procedures to \nenforce those rights; procedures for dispute settlement regarding \nmembers' obligations to establish minimum standards and mechanisms to \nenforce those procedures.\n  While I am concerned about those areas I mentioned above, the \nagreement does address the $15 to $17 billion loss in 1993 by the U.S. \ncomputer software, motion picture, music, recording, and book \npublishing industries due to piracy worldwide. This is a big black \nmarket which needs to be shut down.\n  While the TRIPS measures are not perfect, they will reduce the piracy \nnow devastating American companies. And these companies are vital to \nthe United States. In value added to GDP, the copyright industries \ncontribute more to the U.S. economy than most any other industrial \nsector.\n  I also have concerns about the revenue provisions of the implementing \nlegislation. I am troubled by the fact that the implementing \nlegislation does not contain offsets for the loss in tariff revenues \nfor the full 10 years.\n  I am troubled by the fact that the implementing legislation does not \ncontain enough revenue but I have been around here long enough--for 18 \nyears--to realize what has to be done to pass this trade agreement, and \nI am willing to do it. It is not something that I do easily, because I \nhave been out on this floor arguing for a balanced budget amendment and \nother reductions in Federal expenditures. I am confident that in the \nlong run the agreement will result in gains to the Treasury, not \nlosses.\n  I am also concerned about the inclusion of the so-called ``pioneer \npreference provisions'' in the GATT implementing legislation that was \nargued a few minutes ago. I do not believe these provisions concerning \nFCC licenses belong in this legislation.\n  Other financing provisions which concern me are the pension \nprovisions, which has also been discussed here this morning. Why this \nis part of the implementing legislation is just beyond me and almost \nbrought me to the conclusion not to vote for it. I hope that in the \nfuture we would not have these kind of things put in a trade agreement.\n  But despite these concerns which I cannot minimize, I share the view \nof leading economists that in the long run, implementation of the \nagreement will bring much more to the U.S. Treasury than reduction in \ntariffs will cost the Treasury. It is estimated by the Treasury that \nthe Uruguay round will raise money and holds down the deficit by $60 \nbillion over the next 10 years and the agreement will add $100 to $200 \nbillion to the U.S. gross domestic product when fully implemented. That \nis impressive, and I think that is the most important part of this \ndebate.\n  Madam President, I weighed this decision carefully. This agreement is \nnot perfect. Nobody will stand here and say it is, but our economy, our \nworkers, and our consumers will be much better off with the Uruguay \nround agreement than without it. The Uruguay round helps us to continue \nto open markets for U.S. goods, stimulate economic growth at home and \ncreate jobs for Americans.\n  It is for these reasons that I will vote for waiving the Budget Act \nand vote for the implementing legislation and the agreement this \nevening.\n  I thank the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Breaux). The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend. Mr. President, I should note, in \nlistening to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, how much I have \nenjoyed serving here with him. Senator DeConcini and I have ancestors \nfrom the same part of northeastern Italy, we have served as prosecutors \nin our States before coming here. We both came from the prosecutor's \noffice to the U.S. Senate. We were good friends before we were in the \nSenate. We remained good friends throughout our Senate tenure and will \ncontinue to be in the years to come. He has been a voice of reason and \nconcern for his part of the country and the country itself in service \nas a Senator from Arizona, as chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, and all the other areas that he has served. I have been \nproud to be associated with him in the U.S. Senate, and I am going to \nmiss him when he leaves.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to vote on implementing the \nUruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, I do have \ngrave concerns about this agreement. I said in October that I expect \nthat I would have to oppose it, and I will oppose it.\n  I have also listened carefully to the Senate debate on whether to \nwaive the Senate budget rules. I had grave concerns about the budget \nwaiver and after listening to the debate, I feel it is inappropriate to \nvote in favor of the budget waiver to assure the passage of the Uruguay \nround agreement. I believe it is going to add billions of dollars to \nour deficit.\n  I am concerned because in the past 2 years, President Clinton and the \nCongress have made great strides in getting our fiscal house in order. \nIn fact, President Clinton is the first President since Harry Truman to \npreside over a budget that 2 years in a row has decreased the Federal \nbudget deficit. In fact, as a share of our gross domestic product, the \ndeficit has been cut in half from 4.9 percent in 1992 to a projected \n2.4 percent in 1995.\n  Our strict Senate budget rules have helped in that, and that is why I \ncannot vote to waive the Budget Act in this matter. If GATT passes, as \nmany now predict it will, it will have some benefit on the U.S. \neconomy. I am going to be the first to admit that. By lowering tariffs \nworldwide, the agreement should allow U.S. companies to compete and win \nanywhere in the world. These tariff cuts should stimulate U.S. exports \nby making U.S. goods more competitive, and they are going to add high-\nwage jobs here at home. I also hope that the minimum in intellectual \nproperty protection that has been included in this agreement can \nbenefit our computer, entertainment and other copyright industries, \nalthough I continue to have concerns in those areas.\n  But despite these benefits, despite the work and the herculean \nefforts by Ambassador Kantor, one of the finest trade negotiators I \nhave ever seen in any administration, Republican or Democrat, I am \nconvinced that this is a fatally flawed agreement. I believe that GATT \nis fatally flawed for a number of reasons, and I say this as one who \nbelieves in free trade, as one who has encouraged international trade \nto create jobs in the United States.\n  I am one who believed in NAFTA and strongly supported NAFTA. But I do \nnot believe in GATT. It is not what GATT does, it is what it fails to \ndo that creates a problem.\n  GATT fails to provide fair rules for our dairy exports--a billion-\ndollar industry in my home State of Vermont. Under this agreement, we \nwill export fewer dairy products, and import more subsidized dairy \nproducts. I am unwilling to expose Vermont dairy farmers to these \nrisks. We could have worked that out. Senator Jeffords and I made every \neffort to work with the administration to provide U.S. milk producers \nwith the tools they need to be successful in a post-GATT world. But the \nadministration decided it did not want to, and an agreement that does \nnot provide increased access to foreign markets for Vermont dairy \nfarmers is not free trade for Vermont.\n  As I stated, I believe in fair trade. I voted for the North American \nFree Trade Agreement, and I did it willingly and with enthusiasm. It \nhas been an overwhelming success across the country and in Vermont. In \nfact, in the first 9 months since NAFTA went into effect, United States \nexports to Mexico jumped 22 percent. NAFTA has been an economic boon to \nVermonters. It opened up markets and spurred Vermonters to add more \nhigh-quality jobs to their payrolls.\n  I wish GATT was more like NAFTA, but GATT is not NAFTA. The two are \ntotally different. GATT, unlike NAFTA, does not adequately address \nlabor, environmental and food safety concerns. I am one Vermonter who \nis concerned about these areas, and in today's global economy, the \ninteraction between trade and these issues cannot be ignored. We can \nnever ask U.S. citizens to jeopardize their standard of living in the \nname of free trade.\n  Unfortunately, GATT moves away from the crucial link between trade \nand the labor environment and food safety issues we fought so hard to \nforge in NAFTA. We were able to do it there. We were unable to do it in \nGATT. I am unwilling to support this trend. We need to go back, learn \nthe lessons from NAFTA, and incorporate them into GATT.\n  President Clinton and others have hailed GATT as an engine for our \neconomic growth for the rest of this decade and into the 21st century. \nI hope they are right. I know that President Clinton has been more \ndedicated than any President I have known in his efforts to create jobs \nand encourage our trade worldwide. I believe GATT's tariff cuts should \nstimulate U.S. exports and add U.S. jobs. But there are still too many \nunanswered questions. I really wish we could go back and close the gap \nin these areas. Then I could support this agreement. Unfortunately, the \ngaps are still there.\n  So I must oppose this agreement not for what it is, but I oppose it \nfor what it is not.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a statement of mine given as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Senator Patrick Leahy on Section 514 of the Uruguay Round \n                             Agreements Act\n\n       As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been \n     involved with Senators DeConcini, Biden, Hatch, and others in \n     working on the intellectual property provisions contained in \n     title V of the bill. Among the more controversial provisions \n     is section 514 of the bill, amending section 104A of the \n     Copyright Act, which ``restores'' copyright protection for \n     foreign works that are not in the public domain in their \n     country of origin but not currently protected in the United \n     States.\n       Ownership of the restored copryight vests first in the \n     author or in the initial rightholder of the work as \n     determined by the law of the country of origin. Such initial \n     rightholder could be, for example, the producer of a sound \n     recording or the producer of a motion picture where rights \n     are vested therein by foreign law. Those that had acquired \n     these rights through contract would also be recognized as \n     rightholders.\n       In attempting to achieve a degree of fairness, we include \n     protection for reliance parties, those who have relied on the \n     foreign works having fallen into the public domain. These \n     protections extend to those who are successors, assignees or \n     licensees of ``significant assets'' of a reliance party which \n     assets could include multiple copyrights, several titles, a \n     back list, imprints or tangible inventory, even if less than \n     all of the holdings of the company or of a division of the \n     initial reliance party.\n       We have also tried to ensure fairness for those who \n     continue to exploit ``derivative works''--as that concept is \n     used elsewhere in the Copyright Act and its case law--based \n     upon foreign works subject to restored copyright protection.\n       Section 514 of the bill also makes clear that section 412 \n     of the Copyright Act applies to actions for infringements of \n     restored works. The meaning of ``commenced'' is intended to \n     be governed by existing case law under section 412 without \n     the addition of any new element or test.\n       This is among the more complicated set of changes to our \n     law. It is being proposed in order to ensure that others will \n     treat U.S. works similarly within their countries and grant \n     them the copyright protections to which they should be \n     entitled.\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if someone had asked me a year ago what my \nfeelings would be in debating the GATT Uruguay round agreement and \nlooking toward its potential passage, my guess is I would have said \nthat this would be one of the high points of my career in the U.S. \nSenate. I am a firm believer in trade. I believe trade is critically \nimportant to job creation and to freedom and independence.\n  While I am going to vote for GATT today, and while I am going to vote \nto jump the procedural hurdle that stands in the way of GATT today, I \nwould have to say that the irresponsibility of this administration, the \narrogance and irresponsibility of the Clinton administration in the way \nit has structured the debate, the way it has written the enabling \nlegislation, and the way it failed to deal with budget requirements, \nhas made it very difficult for me, and very difficult for a lot of \nother people who normally would have been for GATT, to be strongly \nsupportive and to be excited about it.\n  The bottom line of the debate is, however, that despite what I \nbelieve has been the arrogance of the administration and the \nirresponsibility of the administration on GATT, the GATT agreement is \ncritically important to the future of the people who do the work and \npay the taxes and pull the wagon in Texas and in America. And while you \ncan find a lot of reasons to be against it, there is one overriding \nreason to be for it. That reason is that it is the right thing to do \nfor America and for its people.\n  I want to try to address very briefly some of the issues that have \nbeen raised. Let me start with the whole sovereignty issue. It is a \nfraudulent issue. Anyone who understands the American constitutional \nsystem understands that the Congress of the United States, even in \nconcert with the President, cannot give up sovereignty. The \nConstitution is very clear on this point. Nothing we can do, alone or \nin concert with the President, can change the Constitution or can limit \nAmerican sovereignty.\n  If anything, based on a study of the whole World Trade Organization \nprovisions of the Uruguay round agreement and looking at the existing \nGATT agreement, the new agreement has more built-in protections of \nAmerican sovereignty than the current trade agreement we are operating \nunder. If you are driven only by concerns about sovereignty, this new \nagreement is an improvement over the current GATT, an improvement over \nthe trade agreement that we have operated under since the Second World \nWar. Not only am I saying this, but no less of a constitutional \nauthority than Judge Bork has concluded the same thing.\n  I also want to thank Senator Dole. As I have said, I personally \nbelieve that there is not a sovereignty problem with GATT. But there \nare many Americans who are concerned about it, and I think an important \nstep to take in dealing with an agreement like this is to allay \npeople's concerns. Senator Dole sought to do that. He has reached \nagreement on a mechanism involving a panel of Federal judges to monitor \nthe process and to report to the Congress. And he provided for \ntriggering mechanisms. I think in terms of guaranteeing Americans that \nthey are not going to lose sovereignty in this agreement, that is a \ngood proposal.\n  I will have to say that, like any other proposal, it holds out some \npotential for mischief. That is something that we are going to have to \nwatch very closely. Every greedy special interest in America that wants \nto steal from the American consumer is going to come here and argue \nthat somehow America is being hurt because Americans are being allowed \nto buy goods competitively and under price competitive conditions.\n  So I want to thank Senator Dole. I am going to watch the mechanism to \nsee that it does what we set out for it to do. But I think, again, if \nyour concern is sovereignty, this agreement, especially with the Dole \nprovision, is a dramatic improvement over current procedures and \npractice.\n  Second, in terms of the budget waiver, let us be very clear what we \nare talking about here. We are talking about an agreement that every \nreasonable budget authority, every financial planner, and every \neconomist in the country that is not on the payroll of some special \ninterest group has concluded is going to promote more trade, more job \ncreation. And, since the Government, like a leech, can draw more blood \nout where the heart is pumping strongly, this agreement is going to \nmean more revenues coming into the Federal Treasury because it will \nmean a stronger economy.\n  We are debating a budget waiver here only because OMB, in its \nprojections, and our Congressional Budget Office, act as if trade, job \ncreation, and consumer behavior have nothing to do with the revenues of \nthe Federal Government.\n  Second, in their initial estimate, the administration did pay for the \nprovisions of the bill for the first 5 years. Moreover, if we were \nvoting on lowering the capital gains taxes, if we were voting on \nrepealing the earnings test for Social Security, I would vote to waive \nthe Budget Act on those issues. I will vote to waive it today because \nbasically it is the same fundamental issue.\n  In terms of extraneous matters, let me say the Clinton administration \nhas been totally and absolutely irresponsible on this bill. I am not \naware that in the past has an administration ever included matters in a \ntrade bill that clearly had absolutely nothing to do with the trade \nbill. I believe that in the process that the Clinton administration has \nprobably killed the fast-track process as we know it. I think we are \ngoing to have to write a new fast-track process that will have a clear \nrule against extraneous matters and that will set out in the most \nminute detail the requirement that never again will a President put \nextraneous matters in a bill that is dealt with under special \nprocedures where those extraneous provisions cannot be changed.\n  I think the fact that in this bill we are extending Super 301 of the \ntrade bill, which is a rotten provision and which has absolutely \nnothing to do with GATT, is outrageous. I think the fact that we are \neven getting into a question about settling a court case on licensing \nfees for communications is something that has nothing to do with GATT \nand should have never been in this agreement and should have been dealt \nwith in legislation next year or dealt with through the courts.\n  The provision on rules of origin on textiles was nothing more than a \nprovision that was meant to buy votes for this agreement. It is an \noutrageous provision which is going to steal billions of dollars from \nworking families in this country who are going to pay more to put \nclothing on the backs of their children. That extraneous provision was \nput in this bill which should never have been in here. Under no \ncircumstances would I ever support it if it were a freestanding \nmeasure.\n  Let me tell you why today I am going to take a deep breath and look \nbeyond the outrageous and irresponsible manner with which the \nadministration has dealt with GATT. I am going to do that because we \nare talking about something that is vitally important. I take trade \nvery seriously. The growth of world trade, which we promoted as a \nmatter of American foreign policy beginning in earnest under Eisenhower \nand Kennedy and under every President, Democrat or Republican, since \nthat day, was the great engine which tore down the Berlin Wall, which \nwon the cold war, which liberated Eastern Europe, which transformed the \nSoviet Union, and which freed more people than any victory in any war \nin the history of mankind.\n  We created a wealth machine with trade that rebuilt Europe and \nrebuilt Japan after the war. We created a wealth machine that created \nvast amounts of productive capacity in places like Taiwan and Korea \nthat had never known prosperity. And America benefited every step of \nthe way. No country in the world has benefited more by the growth of \ntrade than has the United States of America.\n\n  We are talking about more than jobs, more than growth, more than \nopportunity. We are talking about freedom. Does it not abridge my \nfreedom when my Government, in protecting a special interest, imposes a \ntax or sets a quota that stops me from buying goods which are better \nthan the goods I could buy on the domestic market, or cheaper? If the \nobjective is not to raise revenues to pay for essential Government but \ninstead to limit my right to buy goods because some politically \npowerful special interest in America is for limiting that right, does \nthat not infringe on my freedom? I say it does.\n  So there are not many issues, Mr. President, I say in conclusion, \nthat are important enough that they would induce me to accept all of \nthese extraneous add-ons, the arrogance of the whole approach that has \nbeen followed by an administration which does not support trade as much \nas I do. There are very few issues that are important enough that I \nwould look beyond all these problems in this bill, but trade is one of \nthose issues.\n  Let me say to the few colleagues that are undecided on this. This is \none of those issues that comes along once in awhile where all the \npolitics is on one side and all the right is on the other. It would be \na great tragedy for America if this bill failed today.\n  We could blame Bill Clinton. We could point out all this stuff he put \nin this bill. We could point out his arrogance in the whole process. We \ncould do all those things. We could dump this baby right at his \ndoorstep. But the baby would be dead, and we love the baby ourselves.\n  In fact, it is our baby. We created this baby. Six of the 8 years of \nnegotiations occurred under Republicans, and except for this one \nprovision that the Clinton administration put in on green-light \nsubsidies--which again is a bad provision, which I am not for--this is \na good agreement.\n  So I want to urge my colleagues when they are getting all these \ntelephone calls about sovereignty, when they look at all the politics, \nwhen they are outraged about the way the Clinton administration has \nhandled all these issues, I simply ask them to look at what would \nhappen if we rejected the GATT Uruguay round.\n  If I thought we could reject this agreement, kill all these \nextraneous matters, get rid of these green-light subsidies, and do this \nbill again 2 years from now when there is a Republican in the White \nHouse, I would do it in a heartbeat. But I do not think we can get \nHumpty-Dumpty back together again. I think if we reject this agreement, \nno other major country in the world will approve it.\n  We all know how much protectionist sentiment we have right here in \nthis body, in our own country. It is strong all over the world, and it \nis something that people who understand trade, on a bipartisan basis, \nhave to stand up to. Today I am joining those who have stood up to it. \nI am going to vote for this agreement. It is important that it be \nadopted.\n  I say to my colleagues that, in the next few days, the next few \nweeks, a vote for this bill will probably be unpopular, but I believe \nthat a year from now or 5 years from now or 10 years from now you will \nbe able to look back and say, ``I did the right thing.'' I do not want \nmy children, 20 years from now, to be looking through some \nCongressional Record and see my name down as voting against trade and \nsay, ``I wonder why my dad was such an ignoramus.''\n  Let me tell you, this is important to the future of America and to a \nfree people, and that is why I am for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I first express to the Senator from Texas my \nadmiration for what he said, and to say that the Senator from New York \nhas nothing like the competence as a economist that he has. But I share \nmore of his reservations than he might know, or I might be willing to \nadmit. But I am absolutely, firmly with him. It would be a tragic \nmistake.\n  Sixty years of American trade policy--which really got energized \nunder Eisenhower, but it began with Cordell Hull--is at issue and will \nbe resolved at 6 o'clock tonight. This is a momentous vote. It is a \ngreat way to end up the century.\n  Now I have the great pleasure to yield 10 minutes to my friend from \nMew Mexico, Senator Bingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, thank you, and I thank the Senator from \nNew York for his leadership on this issue as well as on many others and \nfor yielding me the time.\n  Mr. President, the main goal we should have in considering the GATT \nis maintaining and increasing the number of high-wage jobs in the \nUnited States. Increased trade with other countries can help us to do \nthat. But in order for us to grow new high-wage jobs, we must be able \nto maintain some balance in our trade relationships with the rest of \nthe world, and we must be allowed to export to other countries the \nproducts and services in which we have a competitive advantage.\n  The question is whether going forward with GATT at this time helps us \nor prevents us from maximizing the high wage job creation that we want \nin future years.\n  Our trade deficit is the largest in the world. It appears to be on \nthe rise and primarily it is caused by two large unaddressed problems:\n  The first is imported oil, and the second is imported manufactured \nproducts from the Far East, which are not offset with sufficient \nexports by us to those Far Eastern countries.\n  The imported oil problem is of our own doing. We have lacked the \nnational will to pursue energy independence and the chronic deficit \nthat we carry in oil and petroleum products is the obvious result of \nthat lack of national will. GATT will not address this problem.\n  The imbalance in trade with the industrializing countries of the Far \nEast--Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia--\nis both our own fault and the fault of those we trade with. It is a \ndirect result of those countries pursuing policies of export promotion \nand import restraint and also the direct result of our own country's \nmaintaining a policy of relative free trade while those countries are \nengaged in this persistent import restraint. In my view GATT will only \nmarginally address this problem as well.\n  Under U.S. law today there are tools available to the administration \nto achieve more equitable trade treatment from these countries; \nantidumping laws, counterveiling duties, section 337, section 301. \nUnfortunately, however, either those tools are inadequate or no \nadministration in the 12 years I have been in Washington has been \nwiling to use them effectively. The consequence has been the continued \nunfair treatment we receive at the hands of these governments and their \nkey industries and the growing trade deficit we suffer with these \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, I understand that we should not expect to have \nperfectly balanced trade with each country, but we cannot allow the \nimbalances with certain countries to become so great that they cannot \nbe offset for by trade elsewhere. That is precisely what we have \nallowed to happen with these Asian countries.\n  The proponents of GATT are running television ads which say that GATT \nwill require over 120 countries to trade by the same rules we do. My \nown reading of GATT indicates that it will reduce tariffs but that it \nwill not prohibit other countries from continuing to play by their own \nrules in most important respects. For example, it will not prevent \nJapan from maintaining a distribution system for its domestically \nmanufactured cars that is closed to foreign manufactured cars. \nSimilarly, it will not prevent cartels of foreign manufacturers from \nremaining in effect, and it will not prevent foreign governments from \nproviding generous financial support to their domestic companies to \nsupport their efforts to export.\n\n  Those countries have made it clear they will not play by our rules, \nand GATT does not require them to. Rather, the real question for us as \na country is not whether other countries will play by our rules; \nwhether we will have the clear-headedness, the pragmatism, and the \ncourage to begin playing by some of the rules which the rest of the \nworld has adopted and still insist on. Those rules include creating tax \nincentives for domestic manufacture of products to be sold in domestic \nmarkets, supporting government industry partnerships in strategic and \ntargeted industries, aggressively supporting efforts by domestic firms \nto export, and most importantly, taking any and all steps necessary to \nproduce reasonable balances of trade with other huge world economies.\n  That is the real challenge we face in a post-GATT world and I \nconclude that the adoption of GATT will do little to help us in meeting \nthis challenge.\n  Whether the adoption of GATT will prevent us from maximizing the \nhigh-wage job creation we want in future years is another question \naltogether. In fact, subject to key assurances and assumptions, I agree \nwith proponents of GATT who say that it will not prevent us from \nachieving our job creation goals.\n  Mr. President, on balance I have concluded that adoption of GATT at \nthis time by the Congress is the responsible thing to do. The 10 years \nof preparation that have gone into this agreement and the leadership \nrole this country should play in world trade make it imperative that we \nmove ahead.\n  On balance, I believe that GATT is also a responsible choice for New \nMexico. Like the Nation as a whole, New Mexico will have losers and \nwinners. I believe, however, that the potential for increased exports \nis great in New Mexico. In 1992, New Mexico exported $247 million in \ngoods. In 1993, this figure jumped to $397 million, an increase of \napproximately 60 percent. GATT can help sustain this trend in \nexporting, and support good, high-wage jobs in New Mexico. Our leading \nexport industries, which include electric and electronic equipment, \nindustrial machinery and computers, and refined petroleum products, are \nall likely to reap the benefits of lower tariffs abroad.\n  In reaching this conclusion I believe that certain assumptions and \nassurances are critically important. My vote in favor of GATT today is \nonly being cast based on assumptions and assurances in four major \nareas:\n\n  First, my vote is based on the assumption that the United States will \nstill have the ability to retaliate against unfair trade practices for \nactivities not specifically covered by a rule in GATT;\n  Second, my vote is based on the assumption that the United States \nwill continue to resist the admission of China to GATT until China \nagrees to be bound by the rules that apply to other industrialized \nnations; and\n  Third, my vote is cast with the expectation that if the new World \nTrade Organization operates in ways that are inimical to U.S. interests \nwe can, and in fact will, exercise our right to withdraw.\n  And finally, my vote is based on assurances from the President that \nhe shares my concern about the enormous trade deficits we currently \nhave with Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and \nIndonesia and that he will work with me over the coming days to find an \neffective way to review the cause of those deficits and their impact on \nthe retention and creation of high-wage jobs in this country, and to \ncome up with specific action steps we can take to deal with that very \nreal problem.\n  Mr. President, let me just show one chart to my colleagues here to \nmake the point which I have tried to make here in my statement about \nthe growing imbalance in trade deficits with Far Eastern countries.\n  This chart shows in 1983 the combined trade deficit we suffered with \nthe seven nations that I have cited was $32 billion. Ten years later, \nin 1993, it was $105 billion. This year it is anticipated to be $117 \nbillion.\n  I point out to my colleagues that the ability of China to manufacture \nfor export is just now developing.\n  We have a serious problem in this area, Mr. President. I have \ndiscussed it with the Trade Representative and I have discussed it with \nothers in the administration, and I believe strongly that after GATT is \nadopted--and I believe it will be adopted today by the Senate--we need \nto give attention to this growing trade imbalance with Asian countries.\n  This is a problem that is not going to fix itself. It is not one that \nis going away. It does impact on those working families in this country \nwhich are trying to maintain their standard of living and hope for \nbetter wages in the future.\n  First, my vote is based on the assumption that the United States will \nstill have the ability to retaliate against unfair trade practices for \nactivities not specifically covered by a rule in GATT.\n  One area of concern which I share with many others relates to the \nability of signatories to GATT to pursue unilateral retaliation for \ntrade practices not required by a GATT rule to be handled by a dispute \nsettlement body. According to a July GAO report, the European Union \ntakes the position that governments that subscribe to GATT commit not \nto use trade retaliation except as authorized through the WTO legal \nsystem.\n  I have raised this issue directly with Trade Representative Kantor, \nand he assures me that the GAO report does not reflect the correct EU \nposition on the issue. He further assures me that this administration's \nposition is solidly to the contrary, that is, the administration's view \nis that practices and policies of other GATT members which are not \nspecifically covered by a GATT rule can be retaliated against by the \nUnited States and that all U.S. trade laws remain in effect even under \nGATT.\n  In my opinion the main trade obstacles we face are not covered by any \nGATT rule, and accordingly it is vitally important that we maintain the \nability to act unilaterally against unfair trade practices which we \nbelieve require retaliation.\n  Second, my vote is further based on the assumption that the United \nStates will continue to resist the admission of China to GATT until \nChina agrees to be bound by the rules that apply to other \nindustrialized nations.\n  Although the chronic trade deficit we run with Japan is clearly the \nlargest single country component of our overall trade deficit, another \ncause for alarm is the enormous increase in our trade deficit with \nChina in recent years. In 1989, the first year of the Bush \nadministration our trade deficit with China was $6.24 billion. By 1992, \nat the end of President Bush's term it had risen 193 percent to $18.26 \nbillion. Last year in 1993, it grew to $22.77 billion and this year it \nis expected to reach over $28 billion.\n\n  Experts point out that the cause for these increases are many, \nhowever, it is indisputable that one of those causes is the conscious \npolicy of the Chinese Government to limit imports, and promote exports. \nThe growth of Chinese exports in excess of imports is primarily into \nthe United States market. And a particularly troubling fact is that \neven with those large exports, only a small fraction of China's GDP is \ndevoted to exports today. To put it bluntly, we are on our way to \nimporting even more from China than we import from Japan by the end of \nthis decade.\n  Again, this is a concern that I have raised with Trade Representative \nKantor. He has assured me that he shares this concern, not only about \nthe size of our trade deficit with China but also about the Chinese \npolicies and practices that have partially caused that deficit.\n  He has also assured me that this administration will block the \nadmission of China to GATT until China has shown credible evidence of \nits willingness to abide by the rules that apply to other industrial \nnations. Blocking China's admission to GATT will not solve the problem \nwe have today in trade with China, but it will help to maintain a focus \non their unfair trading practices, until those practices are corrected.\n  Third, my vote is cast with the expectation that if the World Trade \nOrganization operates in ways that are inimical to U.S. interests we \ncan, and in fact will, exercise our right to withdraw.\n  Many have pointed out the potential problems that exist in the \nstructuring of the WTO. The U.S. economy accounts for about 25 percent \nof world trade today, but under the proposed WTO we will have the same \nvoting weight as those countries with the least amount of world trade. \nThis is a serious problem which will only be alleviated if, in fact, \nthe WTO can operate on a consensus basis as the GATT has in recent \nyears. Time will tell whether this arrangement is a fatal flaw in the \nWTO which will require us to withdraw. But we need to put all countries \non notice that the possibility is real, and I may well support such \nwithdrawal if the need arises.\n  Finally, my vote is based on assurances from the President that he \nshares my concern about the enormous trade deficits we currently have \nwith Japan, China, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan and \nthat he will work with me over the coming days to find an effective way \nto review the cause of those deficits and their impact on the retention \nand creation of high-wage jobs in this country, and to come up with \nspecific action steps we can take to deal with that very real problem.\n  Mr. President, it is my view that the approval of GATT will not \ndramatically improve our ability to export, although it will result \nin tariff reductions over a period of time. GATT neither solves our \nmajor trade problems nor significantly impedes our ability to solve \nthem in coming years. Without trying to criticize or demean the \nimportance of GATT, I see it largely as secondary to the central trade \nissue which we confront.\n\n  The central trade issue which cries out for attention is this large \nand growing trade deficit with Asian countries. In 1993 when you add up \nthe cumulative trade deficit the United States ran with the seven Asian \ncountries of Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and \nIndonesia, it exceeds $105 billion. Our trade deficit with all nations \nby contrast was only $116 billion. American workers see downsizing and \nstreamlining and plant closings and they see more and more of the \nmanufactured products bought by Americans being produced abroad. That \nincrease in imports from abroad can be accepted as long as the jobs we \nlose are being replaced with jobs of equal worth in sectors of our \neconomy which are exporting. But the existing trade imbalance reflects \na job creation imbalance as well. And even though the U.S. economy has \nbeen successful at creating many new jobs in the last few years, too \nfew of those jobs are high-wage jobs committed to export.\n  Japan has built the world's second largest economy by pursuing a \npolicy of manufacturing for export. This has worked to Japan's benefit \nbut has harmful effects on our own ability to retain manufacturing \njobs. And now other Asian countries are following the model of Japan. \nThe United States cannot remain strong and U.S. workers cannot maintain \ntheir standard of living if we continue indefinitely as the one truly \nopen market for Asian manufactured goods, and Asian retains a maze of \nimpenetrable barriers to our own exports.\n  My concern about this crucial trade problem has prompted me to urge \nthe President to work with me over the coming days to find an effective \nway to review the causes of these deficits and their impact on the \nretention and creation of high-wage jobs in this country. That review \nwould result in recommendations of specific steps we should take to \nreverse the adverse trends in our trade relations with these countries \nand to bring our trade relations into reasonable balance by the turn of \nthe century in such a way that we maximize the creation of high-wage \njobs in the United States. It is my hope that this review could provide \nthe basis for real progress in the 104th Congress in dealing with the \nchallenge we face of making trade support our efforts to create a high-\nwage economy here in the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, before concluding, let me also address the arguments \nthat U.S. ratification of GATT will cede U.S. sovereignty to others or \nwill inundate U.S. laws in the areas of environmental and consumer \nprotection. My reading of the agreement and the implementing \nlegislation lead me to conclude that these arguments are soundless. If \nan adverse decision is rendered against the United States under GATT, \nthis does not invalidate any Federal, State, or local laws. The result \nis rather that the successful complaining country will be authorized to \ntake retaliating action against us. Of course any country has that same \noption at the present time.\n  In conclusion, based on the assumptions and assurances I have just \noutlined, I will support the GATT with my vote today. But the approval \nof GATT by the Congress should not be interpreted as an indication we \nbelieve that all is well in world trade. I believe the trade deficit we \nare experiencing as a nation are intolerable and I hope that the \napproval of GATT and the other steps I refer to above will lead us \ntoward a resolution of this problem. For only a reversal of these trade \ndeficit trends will allow the working men and women of this country to \nhope once again that they will have access to the high-wage jobs that \ncan produce more prosperous and economically secure lives than they \nhave today.\n  So in conclusion, Mr. President, I will support GATT with my vote \ntoday. But the approval of GATT by the Congress should not be \ninterpreted as an indication that we believe all is well in world \ntrade. I believe the trade deficits we are experiencing as a nation are \nintolerable. I hope that the approval of GATT and the other steps I \nhave referred to will lead us toward a solution to the problem. For \nonly a reversal of these trade deficit trends will allow the working \nmen and women of the country to hope once again that we will have \naccess to the high-wage jobs that can produce more prosperous and \neconomically secure lives than they have today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \na compelling case. May I say that the caveats he suggested about would \nthe United States be able to retaliate for trade practices not covered \nin the GATT, the answer is yes. We have section 301 and we will \ncontinue to do so.\n  But I note that 60-percent increase in exports over 1 year. That is \nthe prospect we have in America. And those are good jobs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I certainly agree. Again, I thank the Senator from New \nYork for yielding me the time.\n\n\n              substantial understatement penalty amendment\n\n  Mr. RIEGLE. I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman for a \nclarification on section 744 of this legislation, which amends section \n6662(d) of the tax code. Am I correct, Mr. Chairman, that this \namendment is not intended to alter the definition of a tax shelter for \npurposes of the substantial understatement penalty?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. RIEGLE. And is it the understanding of the Chairman that, under \ncurrent law, only those entities or other arrangements that have as \ntheir principle purpose the avoidance or evasion of Federal income tax \nare considered tax shelters?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. RIEGLE. Am I therefore correct that an entity, plan, or other \narrangement that has as its purpose the claiming of tax benefits, such \nas the low-income housing tax credit under section 42 of the Code or \nthe credit for producing fuel from nonconventional sources under \nsection 29, in a manner consistent with the statute and Congressional \npurpose is not considered a tax shelter for purposes of the substantial \nunderstatement penalty and will not be affected by the proposed \namendment?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. RIEGLE. I thank the Chairman for this clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bradley). The Senator from Idaho is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for free \ntrade and the proposed $750 billion reduction of tariffs around the \nworld. I know that the American worker, the American farmer and \nprofessional, can compete with anyone in the world, and I am confident \nthat the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would make a major \ncontribution to economic growth in the United States and around the \nworld.\n  If I could vote for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \nwithout voting for the budget waiver and without voting for the World \nTrade Organization, I would do so without any hesitation. But I cannot \ndo that.\n  While I strongly support free trade and a reduction in world tariffs, \nI am also determined to do everything I can to protect the sovereignty \nof the Federal Government and our 50 states. Despite the acknowledged \neconomic benefits that will result from GATT, I have carefully weighed \nthe evidence and I have come to the inescapable conclusion that the WTO \nthreatens to do more harm than good. Let me be specific. I am convinced \nthe voting arrangements for the World Trade Organization will \njeopardize the sovereign right of our State governments and the Federal \nGovernment to affect the lives of Americans. While the agreement will \nnot change our governments' right to make laws, it will, in my view, \ncreate a situation that puts pressure on State governments to change or \nrepeal their laws and regulations to abide by WTO mandates. And within \nthe WTO, our vote will be equal to the vote of Rwanda, Cuba, or Fiji. \nThis voting arrangement and the enforcement powers given to the WTO \nlead me to the conclusion that this agreement poses far more risks than \nbenefits to the American way of life.\n  Under the current GATT procedures, trade disputes are settled by \nconsensus among the relevant parties. While this system has not worked \nwell every time, it has preserved the U.S. ability to veto GATT \ndecisions contrary to our interests. Under the Uruguay round of GATT \nnow before the Senate, this veto power will be lost.\n  If passed, the World Trade Organization would replace the current \nGATT consensus structure. In a letter to President Clinton, Harvard Law \nPro. Lawrence Tribe stated ``the proposed WTO would have authority to \nimpose major financial sanctions on jurisdictions whose laws, either \nnational or local, are found by WTO tribunals to restrict trade in \nunacceptable ways.'' The WTO is clearly difficult from the current GATT \nstructure.\n  More specifically, under the dispute resolution powers given to the \nWorld Trade Organization, a WTO panel will meet, in secret, to settle \ntrade disagreements. During the panel's deliberations, the U.S. \nGovernment will be represented by an official from the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's office. Although a state law may be challenged by the \nWTO panel, the affected state will not be allowed to defend itself \nbefore the WTO panel. In addition, the decisions of the WTO panels will \nbe binding and the United States has no ability to veto these \ndecisions. In the event that a WTO panel rules against the United \nStates we are left with three options: change the offending law, reject \nthe WTO ruling and suffer trade retaliation or pay compensation to the \noffended parties. Under this system it seems likely that the certainty \nof trade retaliation or penalties will lead the U.S. Government to \npressure a state to change a law that the WTO considers an impediment \nto trade.\n  Concerned about the ability of the WTO to pass mandates onto the \nStates, 42 State Attorneys General contacted President Clinton, in \nJuly, about GATT. They stated that they had concerns about how some of \nour State laws and regulations would fare under the WTO and its dispute \nresolution panels. The Attorneys General noted some countries had \nidentified U.S. State laws that they intend to challenge under the WTO. \nThe Attorney General from Idaho, Larry Echohawk, signed that letter.\n  At the end of July, after several meetings with the USTR and a few \nchanges to the GATT agreement, several of the Attorneys General sent a \nletter to Ambassador Kantor announcing their support for GATT. The \nAttorney General from Idaho did not sign this letter. In fact, Mr. \nEchohawk stated in an August 1 letter to me that ``the GATT agreement \nstill raises serious concerns for the rights of states in our federal \nsystem of government.''\n  Mr. Echohawk acknowledged that the changes negotiated between the \nUSTR and the Attorneys General were significant. However, he went on to \nstate that ``they are all in the nature of damage control after-the-\nfact. None of the changes provides the kind of protection that is due \nto a sovereign state under the federal form of government guaranteed by \nthe United States Constitution.'' I agree and I believe States should \nbe concerned. In the same letter to the President on GATT, Professor \nTribe stated that ``the basic thrust of the Uruguay Round is that it \nwould empower international tribunals effectively to override state \nlaws protecting local workers, consumers, or the environment on the \nground that those laws interfere with world trade.''\n  In addition, in a letter I received today, the Idaho State Tax \nCommission stated ``we believe that the dispute resolution process to \nbe effected by the World Trade Organization risks a serious diminution \nof traditional state sovereignty.'' Moreover, the Commission recognized \nthe importance of the changes brought about by the negotiations between \nthe USTR and the Attorneys General. However, the Commission stated that \n``these protections * * * do not change the main fact that GATT \nrepresents a significant shift of sovereign authority away from State \nand local governments.''\n\n  The Idaho State Tax Commission and the Attorney General of Idaho have \nidentified numerous State laws that the WTO might call impediments to \ntrade. For example, the Idaho legislature has enacted an investment tax \ncredit which allows companies to deduct plant investments. It is not \nhard to imagine a WTO panel determining that this investment tax credit \nfavors Idaho industries over foreign competition. Likewise, the State \nof Idaho has sent the United States Trade Representative 350 pages of \nIdaho laws that might be challenged by the WTO as trade impediments.\n  The United States economy is one of the largest markets in the world. \nCurrently, the size of our market gives us increased clout in trade \ndisputes with other countries. Under the one-nation one-vote formula of \nthe WTO, our influence will be dramatically reduced. This reduced \ninfluence poses a direct threat to the sovereignty of State laws. \nIndeed, many of the health regulations, worker protection laws, \nincluding child labor laws, and environmental protection enacted by the \nvarious states might be challenged as trade impediments by the World \nTrade Organization.\n  As a United States Senator for the State of Idaho, I understand the \nimpact of allowing others to control a State's destiny. This great \nNation of ours was formed by a collection of sovereign states and we \nshould reject any agreement or treaty that proposes to cede power and \nauthority to a world organization.\n  I believe that this agreement should be considered by the Senate as a \ntreaty, which is amendable and, under the U.S. Constitution, requires \nthe support of two-thirds of the Senate body. Harvard Law Professor, \nLawrence Tribe, also believes that this agreement should be voted on as \na treaty. Speaking on the treaty question, Professor Tribe has stated \n``GATT, as presently structured, would entail so substantial a shift of \nsovereignty from State and local governments to the proposed WTO that \nthe agreement requires Senate ratification as a treaty.''\n  I am also troubled by the proposal to waive the Budget Act to make up \nfor the lost revenue that would result from enactment of the GATT \nagreement. The Congressional Budget Office originally estimated that \nover 10 years GATT will cost the Federal treasury around $30 billion. \nThe administration has now put forward some offsets that are said to \npay for all but $15 billion of the lost GATT revenue. But these offsets \nare questioned by a number of opponents of GATT. In addition, even with \nthese offsets every Senator will be asked to add $15 billion to our \nnational debt if he or she wants to support the Uruguay round of GATT. \nI cannot go back to my State and tell the people of Idaho that I just \nvoted to increase our deficit by over $15 billion.\n\n  If this agreement is as good as its supporters suggest, then we ought \nto pay for it up front. That is why I joined a small number of my \ncolleagues to sign a letter to President Clinton urging him to pay for \nall of the lost revenue that would result from the passage of GATT. But \nthis request was not agreed to. I also wrote to Senators Mitchell and \nDole requesting that the Senate vote on the budget waiver if the \nPresident would not pay for all of the lost revenue from GATT. As we \nall know, our first vote on today will be concerning this budget \nwaiver.\n  In conclusion, I would like to just quote from that letter I received \nyesterday from the Idaho State Tax Commission. They say in their \nclosing paragraph:\n\n       One of the historic and traditional roles of the U.S. \n     Senate is to represent and protect the interests of state in \n     our federal system of government. It is unfortunate that this \n     legislation is before the Senate under rules that require an \n     all-or-nothing vote. The laudable goals of free trade and \n     reduced tariffs are made inseparable from the more lamentable \n     dispute resolution procedures provided by GATT.\n\n  They say it very clearly. I wish I could vote for GATT but vote \nagainst the World Trade Organization.\n  The United States must continue to be a leader in GATT. The \nadministration and Congress should continue to reduce tariffs in the \nUnited States and urge their reduction around the world. However, I \nstrongly believe that United States participation in the WTO is a \ndetriment to our 50 States and this Nation, and I oppose passage of the \nGATT-WTO agreement.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may assume \nunder the direction of Senator Moynihan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the new GATT \nagreement and in support of the jobs and prosperity that it will bring \nnot only to the United States but also to my State of Louisiana which I \nproudly represent. Today's vote is a vote between--and a choice \nbetween--old versus new. It is a question of whether we want to return \nto the days of the Smoot-Hawley or whether we want to march into the \n21st century. It is a question of whether we build walls around the \nUnited States or whether we tear down the walls around other countries \nof the world.\n  The international trade train of tomorrow is leaving the station and \nthe question is whether we will be on it or whether the United States \nwill be left at the station, surrounded by walls of protectionism. Some \nsay we should reject GATT because it is too risky. They say our \nsovereignty is at risk, our jobs are at risk. These are the same people \nwho see a half-filled glass of water and say it is half empty. While \nthis agreement may not be perfect--and it is not--I know it is a much \nbetter agreement than one that is only half full. It is as close to \nfull as an international trade agreement can ever be.\n  For example, how else are we going to get an agreement with over 120 \ncountries of the world that expands Louisiana farmers' ability to sell \ntheir products abroad by limiting foreign Governments from unfairly \nsubsidizing their own crops? How else are we going to get an agreement \nwith over 120 countries of the world to open their markets to Louisiana \nchemical manufacturers, our industrial machinery, our processed foods, \nlumber, wood products, and, yes, our textile industries as well? How \nelse are we going to get an agreement with 120 countries of the world \nto respect and pay for the use of Louisiana's creativity, found in our \nmusic, our movies, our computer software, our medical drugs, and our \ninventions?\n  Under current GATT rules, a country that closes its market to \nLouisiana products and goods can thumb its nose at a GATT ruling \nagainst it. But under this new agreement, our exporters can get \ndeserved relief and Louisiana jobs will grow accordingly. As the world \nchanges and the economic power of other countries grow, international \ntrade rules will become more and more important. While we should not \nand will not give up our ultimate market leverage to resolve trade \ndisputes as a country established under the rule of law, we should not \nfear the new trade rules. We will, instead, use these rules to our \nadvantage.\n  Fruit Of The Loom, the largest employer in the State of Louisiana, \nAvondale Shipyards, Riverwood International, Procter & Gamble, Dow \nChemical, the Louisiana Farm Bureau, the Port of New Orleans and other \nports of Louisiana and countless other Louisiana employers and \nemployees support this agreement as a positive step to improve the \nstandard of living in Louisiana, and so do I.\n  This agreement is not a final answer to our economic prosperity. A \nlevel playing field is only as good as the players on that field. But, \nby leveling the playing field we can now focus our attention on \nimproving the quality of our players as well.\n  During the 1980's, U.S. companies paid the price to become \ncompetitive in the global markets. Now we are ready to seize the \nopportunity of expanded world trade.\n  Finally, this effort is an example of how Government should work. It \nis bipartisan. It is Ronald Reagan, it is George Bush, and it is Bill \nClinton working together over two decades to reach the same agreement: \nGATT.\n  It is Mickey Kantor and James Baker, it is Ron Brown and Jim Miller, \nit is Tom Foley and Newt Gingrich and George Mitchell and Richard Armey \nand also, to their great credit, Pat Moynihan and Bob Packwood, all \ntogether in support of the same package.\n  At the same time it is an all-American solution which benefits all \nAmericans. It says to Mr. and Ms. America that you are going to win one \nfor a change.\n  Our choice is very clear: Old versus new. Build a fence around \nourselves or knock down the fences of other countries and sell our \nproducts overseas. The Senate should pass GATT.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Louisiana for his comments, generous personal comments. May I ask \nhim, Louisiana continues to be an important rice producer, does it not?\n  Mr. BREAUX. We are one of the largest in the United States.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And will be larger, because for the first time ever, in \nthis agreement rice imports are open--in Japan, in Korea, and all parts \nof Asia. They do not like it one bit, but it is about time and you will \nhave helped bring this about.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the chairman for his comments. It is something we \nhave been working on for over 25 years and now we can obtain that goal.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Twenty-five years. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask the time reserved for me, 10 minutes \nunder the time allotted to Senator Hollings, be enacted at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of a \nWashington Post editorial be printed at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Breaux). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. EXON. Mr. President, the question before the Senate is an \nimportant and difficult one. Should the Senate approve or disapprove or \ndelay the implementing package to the agreement reached under the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? Like all pieces of legislation, \nthis bill has its good features and its bad features. Unlike other \nbills which come before the Senate or the House, the so-called fast-\ntrack rules, Members of both bodies are prevented from seeking to \nremedy the shortcomings of this legislation or to enhance its good \nfeatures because amendments are not allowed.\n  In my view this process and the implementing legislation is a mixed \nbag. I have spent a great deal of time in committee hearings, \ndiscussions and study of the details.\n  First, I would like to discuss and acknowledge the very good features \nof this agreement. The proposed GATT agreement does advance important \nU.S. priorities, including better protection of intellectual and other \nproperty rights, including some protection for leadership in advanced \ntechnology.\n  I applaud our trade negotiators for this achievement. It is an area \nin which I have long sought change.\n  In the area of financial services, it is generally agreed that this \nnew GATT agreement is a success. Trade in financial services is one of \nAmerica's strongest suits. Progress in this area bodes well for the \nAmerican banking, financial and insurance industries.\n  There are clearly some improvements and some measure of success for \nsome of our agricultural producers. Others are not likely to fare well \nat all.\n  Mr. President, these important successes have been weighed against \nwhat I consider shortcomings of the GATT agreement. My long-held \nconcerns are manyfold. My hopes of receiving satisfactory explanations \nand assurances from administration officials and colleagues strongly \nsupporting approval have failed. The more I study it, the more \nconvinced my conscience dictates ``no.''\n  The structure of the World Trade Organization [WTO] is a serious \nproblem. Granting an international organization of 130 foreign \ncountries the authority to object to any Federal, State, or local law \nby filing a trade violation charge and seeking counterbalancing tariffs \nis no small matter.\n  It is a loss of power, or sovereignty, when our law could be found to \nbe contrary to GATT and the subject of the WTO trade sanctions.\n  I am very concerned about the structure of the new World Trade \nOrganization and its methods of dispute resolution. Under this new \norganization, member nations agree to subject their laws to the view of \nthe WTO. The proponents don't want to concede this. If negotiations \nbetween nations fail, a dispute between the two countries, say the \nUnited States and Bangladesh, would go to a three member panel for \nexperts to review.\n  If for example, the United States loses before that panel, the panel \ncould approve trade sanctions by Bangladesh against the United States \nin an amount equal to the injury caused by the offending United States \nlaw. The three-member panels meet in secret and their decisions are \nbinding unless the entire WTO membership--and I emphasize entire-- \nincluding the country who filed the action unanimously agree to \noverrule the panel decision. Such a structure will clearly stack the \ndeck against the United States, since most countries want unlimited \naccess to the coveted U.S. market. Virtually every country will have an \ninvitation to challenge indirectly U.S. law which impedes any imported \nproducts.\n\n  Yes, as the proponents preach and preach and preach again, only the \nUnited States can change its laws in response to a WTO dispute \nresolution. But it must also be said that only the WTO has the power to \ndetermine if another country is justified in imposing trade sanctions \nagainst the U.S. law. This they do not preach. My concerns about the \ndispute resolution and decisionmaking process procedures are both about \nsovereignty and fairness.\n  Another structural problem with the WTO is its decisionmaking process \nabove and beyond dispute resolution. Under the new agreement, decisions \nwill be made on a one country, one vote basis.\n  Contrary to that, in the United Nations, the United States has an \neffective veto power over major actions of the United Nations because \nit is a member of the security council. In the World Bank and the \nInternational Monetary Fund, the United States has voting power \nweighted toward its financial contributions to these institutions. The \nUnited States will likely contribute 20 percent of the WTO budget and \nwill bring the largest and most important consumer market to the world \ntrading system, but will have a vote in that organization only equal to \nthe smallest nation.\n  It is interesting to note that when President Eisenhower proposed \nanother form of the WTO, it included a security council-type body which \ntook into account market size. There is none of this balance in the \nproposal before us.\n  I must also observe that it is, if nothing more, ironic that the \npresumed Senate majority leader of the next Congress, swept into power \nby promises of deficit reduction and a reduced government, asks that \nhis party members in the Senate waive the budget act; support the \ncreation of a new international bureaucracy and later support a new \nFederal bureaucracy to watch over the international bureaucracy.\n  This legislation, over the next 10 years, handles the $30 billion \nloss in tariff revenues by raising the Government's take by $15 billion \nand raising the national debt by $15 billion.\n  I have serious reservations about the agriculture portions of this \nagreement. While many farm groups support passage of this agreement \nit seems we have been down this road before. The promise of a pot of \ngold for American farmers in foreign markets has been a promise \nunfulfilled. I am troubled that even after the adoption of this \nagreement, some of our European competitors will still have higher \ndomestic subsidies than the United States. Yes, this agreement is \nprogress, but faulted.\n\n  There are several other nonhighlighted potential problems, \nsuch as the provision that allows our competitors to employ higher \nsubsidies by the use of so-called mix and remix of agricultural \nsubsidies.\n  Mr. President, it is my best judgment that my constituents are \nprobably evenly split on this proposal.\n  The largest number of corn, hog, cattle, and milo producers support \nit. They believe, as they always have, that foreign markets are the \nreal chance that they have to escape low commodity prices. They have \nalways believed that they can produce their way to prosperity. They are \nunder serious financial stress. I feel for them. Their investments are \nhigh and their returns are low and frequently below the cost of \nproduction.\n  The Farm Bureau is in support. The Farmers Union is opposed. The \nsoybean producers are opposed. My wheat producers are generally \nopposed. The milk producers are opposed since they know that, for some, \nGATT is near the end of their troubled road. I have not heard a great \ndeal from our sugar beet producers but GATT surely is a dead end for \nsome of them.\n  Mr. President, these are all good folks. They are hard pressed. I \nwish I could agree with all of them. Given the circumstances, it is not \npossible.\n  I am fearful passage of this trade agreement will give opponents of \nagricultural and rural programs one more arrow in their quiver to fire \nin the heart of American farm families. Mark my words, during \nconsideration of the 1995 farm bill, some of the most innovative \nreforms will be met with protestants that reform is ``GATT illegal.'' \nNote the editorial of November 30, 1994, from the not-so-farmer-\nfriendly Washington Post which is printed following my remarks. As a \nveteran of many congressional battles for family farmers, I predict \npassage of this agreement holds nothing but peril for the new 5-year \nfarm bill that must be passed in 1995.\n  Mr. President, every trade agreement involves a give and take. \nUnfortunately for many years the United States gave and gave and gave \nof its rich consumer market. The United States has allowed the near \ndestruction of some industries in the name of free trade. That is not \nfair trade.\n  For the last 20 years working Americans have seen their standard of \nliving slip or remain static. In spite of the recovering economy, \nAmericans feel less secure in their jobs. The idea that children and \ngrandchildren will have a better life than their parents is an open \nquestion.\n  I think cheap foreign labor puts Americans jobs at severe risk. It \nshould not be applauded. It should be condemned.\n  The proponents of this agreement will try to portray the opponents as \nprotectionist. The choice is not between the World Trade Organization \nand Smoot-Hawley. There are a number of other options.\n  America is already the world's most open market. GATT opponents do \nnot advocate unilaterally closing the American market. We should simply \ninsist that the rest of the world catch up or risk their access to the \nAmerican market. This was the idea behind the 1988 Trade Act. I believe \nthat it is no accident that with this tough message, the U.S. trade \ndeficit declined in the several years following the enactment of the \n1988 Trade Act. The downward trend in trade deficit was reversed with \nthe current GATT-mania. The trend I talk about from 1988 up to now, was \nreversed by the GATT mania.\n  Trade should not be the only value the United States holds dear. \nThere are other values--decency, dignity, fairness and conservation of \nthe resources which may and should take precedence over unfettered \ninternational trade. Our Nation's abhorrence of tyranny, child labor, \nand environmental destruction should not be subordinated to the GATT \nprinciple of the least trade restrictive measures.\n  How many Americans and Nebraskans know this agreement prohibits \nexports of goods made by prison labor but allows exports made by \nchildren of, say, 12 years of age working for 50 cents per hour. Now \nthat is something that we all can be proud of. We protect criminals but \nnot the kids.\n  In closing, let me say that the free trade gurus that live in the \nworld do not seem to understand where the treatment of workers starts \nand when we should leave workers to their own volition to do what is \nright. I do not apologize for being concerned about the Nebraska \napparel workers, sugar beet growers in the panhandle, and workers in \nsmall and large factories throughout the State. They are real live \nNebraskans and Americans all. I represent them too.\n  I am profoundly troubled with the way GATT enthusiasts view low wage, \nlow skill workers as disposable. I remember an America where hard work \nwould earn a decent wage. Today, hard work and good will do not seem to \ngo as far as they once did. The depiction of low skill workers by some \nGATT supporters demeans the hard work of many Americans. These workers \nare the families that so many politicians laud. Here is a chance to \nvote for them. Who's listening?\n  It is interesting that this same Congress just passed a massive crime \nbill and the next Congress will consider welfare reform. It is often \nsaid there are few of our social ills which could not be solved with a \ngood job. Thousands of entry level jobs will be in peril with this \nagreement. But lest we forget, they don't vote.\n  The problem with the fast track procedures is that the Senate has no \nway to change the bad parts of this agreement. If we had more time, \nperhaps next year, absent the fast track we possibly could correct it. \nBut as is, it is an all or nothing proposition. Having carefully \nweighed the benefits with the risks, I have concluded, Mr. President, \nthat I can not lend my support to this agreement.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 30, 1994]\n\n                         Next Year, a Farm Bill\n\n       A major task of the Clinton administration and the \n     Republican Congress next year will be to write a new farm \n     bill. It's a huge undertaking; here will come a five-year \n     bill involving billions of dollars in likely subsidies and \n     other forms of support to an entire sector of the economy at \n     the start of a new era in world trade. But this time the \n     problem is compounded. The administration has no discernible \n     farm policy, has never developed one and seems most unlikely \n     to do so now, when it has been politically weakened and will \n     shortly lack even an agriculture secretary. The Republicans, \n     perhaps particularly in the House, are likewise untested. \n     It's clear enough that they want to cut federal spending and \n     regulation, but not so clear that they want to cut farm \n     spending and regulation--not the elaborate regulatory \n     structures that prop up prices, at any rate.\n       The major farm support programs are trade-offs of price and \n     income supports for production restraints. The strongest \n     believers in free markets among the Republicans would do away \n     with them. Majority leader-to-be Richard Armey has been among \n     this group in the past. Some urban Democrats have also tried \n     to kill or cut back some of the lesser programs, though for \n     different reasons. There's likely to be a revival of such \n     talk this time around, particularly if Republicans, who tend \n     to be strong in farm states, also pass a balanced budget \n     amendment and begin to make heavy cuts in other spending. If \n     only for political reasons, members not from farm states will \n     try to force them to cut farm spending, too.\n       The farm state members of both parties can be expected to \n     resist. They have already indicated they will once again try \n     to do no more than make some modest further reductions in \n     support levels. But that, too, can eventually lead to a \n     dissolution of the system, because as support levels drift \n     below break-even points, farmers will be inclined to withdraw \n     from the programs rather than submit to the production \n     limits.\n       That will be the broadest battleground--how much and how to \n     cut the principal programs. There will also be some lesser \n     battles. Dairy price supports have become dysfunctional; what \n     helps one region hurts another. The system has been so \n     patched over the years that the price of milk is now almost \n     entirely a federal artifact. A truly deregulatory Congress \n     would strike the system down. It would do away with such \n     anti-competitive constructs as the sugar program as well, in \n     which import and now even domestic marketing limitations are \n     used to keep U.S. prices artificially high.\n       The farm bill also presents environmental issues. What \n     happens next to the conservation reserve program, in which \n     farmers are paid to idle supposedly fragile land? To what \n     extent will either the administration or Congress seek to use \n     the farm bill to make pesticide and/or clean water or \n     wetlands policy?\n       The administration may not propose a bill. Instead, it is \n     said to be considering a statement of principles, mostly of \n     the steady-as-you-go variety, the effect of which would be to \n     leave the writing of the bill to Congress, which has the \n     power anyway. That would be a bow to political reality as \n     well as a way of preserving the president's options and \n     avoiding blame, all of which might be shrewd. But it still \n     wouldn't constitute a farm policy.\n\n  Mr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 6 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senate will shortly be voting on \nH.R. 5110, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] \nimplementing legislation. As my colleagues know, I have always \nencouraged and supported international trade and will continue to do so \nin the future. Expanding and developing export markets will not only \ngive Vermonters, but all Americans, the opportunity to gain access into \nworld-wide markets.\n  As a firm believer in free and fair trade, I regret that I am unable \nto support the GATT agreement. On first inclination, I am prone to \nsupport this agreement which has such worthy goals and intentions. \nThere is no doubt, our economic future depends on the ability of this \nNation to compete in the international marketplace. But this agreement \nis flawed. Upon detailed review of the sections pertaining to the dairy \nindustry, the potentially devastating impact of GATT is clear.\n  Vermont's dairy farmers have for too long suffered at the expense of \nour trade policies. This agreement removes protections for Vermont \nfarmers and puts them in direct competition with foreign farmers who \nreceive massive government subsidies, making fair competition an \nimpossibility.\n  There are few States that take advantage of international trade \nopportunities more than Vermont. This is a statistic which I think we \nshould be quite proud of, and one which I will work to increase.\n  Still, this issue is far more complex than just simply reviewing \nState trade statistics. Back in 1991, we took up the issue of so-called \nfast-track authority for negotiating the GATT agreement. I opposed this \nauthority because dairy interests have been routinely ignored in trade \nnegotiations. Once again this is true, our trade negotiators have given \naway the farm on GATT, and I am afraid Vermont's dairy farmers will be \nthe ones to pay for it.\n  Within GATT, section 22 protections for dairy farmers are eliminated. \nIn addition to that, a 5-percent minimum on food imports is mandated, \ndomestic farm programs, including Federal dairy programs are reduced, \nand our domestic food safety laws are weakened. So what do we get in \nreturn? Canada is dragging its hooves on opening its dairy markets, and \nthe Europeans are only required to scale back their exports by the same \npercentage we do.\n\n  This may be fair on its face to anybody who does not know dairy, but \nthe Europeans have been massively subsidizing their exports while the \nUSDA seems to regard dairy exports as a nuisance.\n  Senator Leahy and I tried to work with the Clinton administration to \nmake GATT fair to Vermont's farms and all dairy producers. I commend \nSenator Leahy for his efforts in working with me on a dairy export plan \nto be included within GATT. This plan was supported by most farmers who \ncould see the benefits of creating worldwide markets for their \nproducts.\n  On numerous occasions, I urged the Clinton administration to give our \nfarmers a fair chance in a market open to so many countries and include \nour export plan. Unfortunately, the President denied our request to \ninclude our export plan onto the enabling legislation of the worldwide \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, I also have concerns on the effects the GATT agreement \nwill have on the world's environment. Primarily, arguments have been \nmade that GATT will undermine implementation and enforcement of our \ndomestic environmental protection standards. But just as importantly, \nGATT will interfere with international efforts to protect the \nenvironment, potentially reducing the effectiveness of international \nenvironmental treaties.\n  Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed that the President does \nnot value the interests of the U.S. dairy farmers within the world \nmarket, along with supporting our strong environmental standards, as I \ndo. Therefore, I cannot accept a trade agreement that will further \nburden our dairy farmers, weaken environmental standards and limit \nchild labor protection.\n  I think it is time for the President to stand up for the U.S. dairy \nindustry and value the importance of these farmers to our Nation. He \nhas done it for cattle, and he has done it for wheat. It is high time \nhe pay attention to dairy as well.\n  Whatever happens here today, I plan to go home having supported the \nenvironment and dairy farmers, in Vermont and throughout the Nation. \nFairness demands nothing less, Mr. President. For these reasons, I will \nnot vote for this agreement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from New Jersey who has the distinction, among many, of having \nbeen a member of the study committee on the GATT in the mideighties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, we have been debating the Uruguay round \nagreement for nearly 20 hours now. I believe the proponents of this \nlegislation have made a compelling case.\n  I do not think it is any exaggeration to say that America's \nprosperity depends on our vote. Failure to pass this legislation would \nbe a profoundly self-destructive act. It would close us out of world \ntrade and deny us the export engine for economic growth and remove our \nvoice from the councils that will shape the 21st century and national \neconomic system.\n  Failure to pass the agreement would be a vote of no confidence in our \nown future. I think it is trite but true to say that the only constant \nin the world today is change. Our vote is an indication of how we will \nreact to change. We can seize it and shape it to our advantage. That is \nthe response of a self-confident, vigorous nation, and that is the \ntraditional American response. Or we can put our heads in the sand in \nthe vain hope that change will pass us by.\n  That is the response of a nation without a future.\n  It is about that future that I would like to talk today. For even as \nwe debate the Uruguay round, we should look ahead to the next round of \nnegotiations that will move the international trading system to the \nnext level.\n  The world economy did not stand still while our negotiators hammered \nout the Uruguay round. It changed in ways unimagined by the ministers \nwho first gathered in Punta del Este in 1986. For example, the end of \nthe cold war combined with broad acceptance of the capitalist model in \nthe developing world introduced billions more consumers and competitors \ninto the global economy. The liberalization of capital movements led to \nan explosion in foreign investment and unleashed daily currency flows \nthat dwarf trade in goods. The information revolution both changed the \nway we create and measure value, and increased the importance of \nintellectual property rights. Meanwhile, our environmental problems \ncontinued to mount as an unintended consequence of our economic \ndynamism.\n  When we ratify this today, we need a new round, sooner rather than \nlater, to adapt the world trading system to these and other \ntransformations shaping the global economy. I see five major areas for \na new round to address:\n  First is trade in services. Advanced economies rely on service \nindustries for new growth. We have made progress in disagreement but \nthere is much more to do.\n  These already produce over 53 percent of American GDP and provide 70 \npercent of U.S. jobs. We exported about $200 billion in services in \n1993, with a surplus of $68 billion. The new round should address \nservices. It should return to the issue. We have not exhausted it in \nthis agreement.\n  Second is investment. With the increase of capital mobility and the \ntriumph of market economics, foreign investment has exploded. This \nmatters because investment is essential to economic growth, and because \ntrade follows investment. For example, studies indicate that over 20 \npercent of American goods exports are made to foreign affiliates of the \nAmerican exporter.\n  The Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures, TRIMS, is a tiny \nfirst step toward bringing investment under the disciplines of the \nworld trading system. APEC and the OECD are working on this issue now. \nThe next trade round should use their thinking as a basis to advance \nbeyond the TRIMS agreement, or the current investment policy of this \nparticular bill.\n  Third is competition policy. Some of the fiercest debates in the \nFinance Committee, as in Geneva, where over the dumping and subsidies \nrules. Our ability to make sense of unfair practices and counter them \nis severely hamstrung by the disconnect between trade policy and \ndomestic competition policy. These two sides of the same coin currently \nreceive separate treatment, leading to the illogical result that \ncompetition within borders is treated differently than competition \nacross them. The next round needs to look at ways to integrate \ncompetition and trade policies into a more effective whole that \nrecognizes that business activity now takes place in a global market.\n  Fourth is labor rights. Improving worker rights has been an objective \nof U.S. trade policy for over a century. However, we are still groping \nto understand the connection between humane labor practices and trade. \nTrade policy must not deny developing countries their natural advantage \nin cheaper labor. At the same time, we cannot condone practices that \nviolate basic human rights. We all want workers to reap the fruit of \ntheir labors, but we do not yet agree on where to draw the line between \nhuman rights and protectionism.\n  We need more work to help us understand which labor practices \nconstitute human rights violations, which afford unfair trade \nadvantages, which represent legitimate comparative advantage, and which \nare simply the result of underdevelopment. The OECD is doing some work \non this issue. We need to do more and integrate the findings into the \ninternational trading system.\n  Finally, there is the environment. We now find ourselves in the \nuntenable position of developing two parallel trade/environment \nstructures. On the one hand, we have our environmental commitments, \nsuch as the Montreal Protocol, the Global Climate Change Convention, \nthe Biodiversity Convention, and our obligations under the Stockholm \nand Rio Declarations. These all have trade effects. On the other, we \nhave our GATT/WTO commitments, which have an impact on the environment.\n  These structures intersect in many places. They contradict in others, \nas demonstrated by the problems we have had with the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act.\n  Arthur Dunkel once told me he thought the next GATT round would be a \ngreen round. Clearly, we need to build a conceptual framework to bring \ntogether environmental policy and trade policy. The next round must do \nso.\n  I have listed a number of issues, identified a number of problems, \nand provided no answers. That pretty well reflects the current state of \nthinking. It is incumbent upon the first Director General of the WTO, \nwhoever he may be, to follow Arthur Dunkel's example and, as his first \nact, appoint a new eminent person's group to lay the conceptual \nframework for a new round, just as we laid the conceptual framework for \nthis round in the 1985 group.\n  In order to participate in new negotiations and meet these new \nchallenges, we must renew the President's fast track negotiating \nauthority. We must make a fast-track bill one of the first priorities \nof the new Congress. There are many contentious issues to work out, but \nwith a vote in favor of free trade this week we will have the \nfoundation to work out an acceptable negotiating famework.\n  Still, Mr. President, these are issues for tomorrow. The task at hand \nis to pass the legislation before us implementing the Uruguay Round \nAgreement. Before we can move ahead on these issues for the future, we \nmust reaffirm our own commitment to the international trading system.\n  Some say that we are not ``the'' economic superpower. Japan is. If we \nturn down the Uruguay round, that may become a selffulfilling prophesy. \nIf we approve this Agreement, continue our efforts to bring the budget \ndeficit under control, provide worker education, fix our pension \nsystem, and retain our leadership in the world trading system, the \nUnited States will remain what it now is--the world's largest, most \nproductive economy.\n  In the NAFTA debate, a number of my colleagues began their \nstatements, ``I'm a free trader, but * * *'' Some said, ``* * * but \nwe'll hear a giant sucking sound as jobs go south.'' Others said, ``* * \n* but the Mexicans aren't democratic enough.'' Although I disagreed \nwith them on NAFTA these were legitimate concerns, given complexity of \nthe commitment we were undertaking.\n  Well, the returns are coming in, and they show that NAFTA was a good \ndeal for America. There has been no sucking sound of jobs going south, \nand we have an adjustment program in place for the 10-15,000 workers \nwho could be displaced by NAFTA this year. Instead, the main sound has \nbeen the steady ``whoosh'' of goods, services, and profits crossing our \nborders in all directions.\n  Gary Hufbauer, of the Institute for International Economics, \nestimates that, because of lower import prices NAFTA will put $600 \nmillion into the pockets of American consumers. American business will \nhave more in gross margin to cover their fixed costs.\n  In my state of New Jersey alone, a recent study has found that NAFTA \nhas already led to $287 million in increased exports and over 5000 net \nnew jobs. And the Uruguay Round dwarfs NAFTA in economic size.\n  NAFTA also served as an anchor to the Mexican political and economic \nsystem when it was shaken by the assassination of the ruling party's \npresidential candidate. It created new economic and financial \nconstraints on the ability of old-style politicians to fix the \nelection. As a result, Mexico ran the cleanest presidential election in \nits modern history and is poised to do even better next time.\n  There are no ``buts'' in the matter before us. We have a clear choice \nbetween prosperity and stagnation. We have a choice between enjoying \nthe benefits of a developing international trading system, or \nretreating into autarky, poverty, and irrelevance. We have a choice \nbetween national self-confidence and national decline.\n  I hope that we will pass this GATT agreement. Opponents have made a \nnumber of arguments, one of which is low wages; all the jobs will go to \nlow wage countries. If that were the case, Mr. President, Bangladesh \nwould be an economic superpower. Clearly low wages are not the only \ncriteria for investment around the world.\n  They have also made the point that we have the problem of child \nlabor.\n  Mr. President, if there is a problem of child labor in this country, \nchild labor of illegal immigrants in our own country in factories \nacross this land, we have a law now that says if an employer hires an \nillegal immigrant, whether that is a child or not, he should had been \nfined and sanctioned.\n  We do not fund adequately employer sanctions and because we do not \nfund adequately employer sanctions there are literally thousands of \nillegal immigrant children at work in this country today. So those who \ncome to this floor and puff about child labor, let us make sure that we \nfund the economic sanctions that are already in law.\n  An estimate is that they require an additional 10 times what we are \nnow funding to enforce economic sanctions under the immigration law. We \nhave $28 million to do that. Estimates are it would cost $280 million \nto $300 million.\n  So those who are concerned about child labor in Bangladesh or China \nor somewhere else why not be concerned about child labor in your State, \nin your town, because it is there today with illegal immigrants and if \nyou want to stop child labor stop it in the United States first.\n  GATT is a good agreement. We are the most open economy in the world \nand we will benefit the most from opening other economies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleague from \nOregon.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the debate over the GATT and the legislation \nbefore us today has raged for many months now. I have been following \nthis very closely both in the public debate and the debate in Congress \nand the debate in homes and coffee shops and community centers around \nthe country. It is clear that this is an issue that has raised \npassions, as well as fears, among a large segment of our population.\n  The arguments on both sides of the debate have been presented \nforcefully and extensively as they have here. I have listened to the \nobjections of those who oppose the agreement, and I think I have \nconsidered each one of them very closely. I would like to take just a \nmoment to review those objections.\n  First is the budget implication of this bill. Opponents argue that \nthis bill will increase the Federal budget deficit by tens of billions \nof dollars over the next decade. If that were the case, I would be \nvoting today against the budget waiver and against the bill. The bottom \nline, however, is that the charge is simply not true. It is based on \nstatic budget assumptions which fail to take into consideration the \nhuge impact the new GATT will have on our Nation's economy. By lowering \ntariffs worldwide, the agreement will result in hundreds of billions of \ndollars of added economic activity. It is not a zero sum game. It is \nnot just slicing up the pie different. It is slicing up a larger pie.\n  That agreement that we will approve today, I hope, will generate \nsignificant new tax revenues, which will almost certainly reduce, \nrather than increase, the deficit.\n  A second argument that continues to be raised in opposition to this \nagreement is that it creates a new World Trade Organization which will \ngive unfair power to tiny foreign countries, to tiny dictatorships, and \nwhich will have the power to overturn U.S. laws. Again, I have looked \nat these charges carefully. If they were true, I would be down here \ntoday arguing strongly against this agreement. It is clear to me, \nhowever, that they are not true. The WTO is a new organization that the \nUnited States pushed for to give the GATT more muscle to resolve trade \ndisputes and enforce settlements. The reason we pushed for it is \nbecause we are the country which most frequently brings complaints \nbefore the GATT. Since we are the ones most often asking for relief, it \nmakes sense to ensure that the GATT has the ability to make its \ndecisions stick. Too often it has been the U.S.A., our farmers, our \nexport workers, our creative producers who have been the losers when \nGATT did not have the clout to stop unfair practices directed at us. It \nis time we had a stick instead of a wet noodle to enforce those \nagreements. This agreement makes a major stride in that direction.\n  Many opponents have suggested that the United States will find itself \non the losing end of a trade dispute--perhaps as a result of many \nsmaller countries ganging up on us in the WTO--and that we will be \nforced to forfeit our sovereignty by modifying our laws or lowering \nhealth and safety standards. I simply do not accept that. That is not \ntrue.\n\n  The United States is the world's largest economy. The goal of every \nother country in the world is to sell as much as possible in our great \nmarket. They know that they cannot attack us unfairly with impunity. If \nthey try, we will retaliate and their economy--not ours--will suffer. \nFurthermore, Congress has put the world on notice that we will monitor \nthe WTO like a hawk, and that we are prepared not to comply with an \nunfair ruling, or even to withdraw if necessary. We are unlikely ever \nto see such a situation, however. The GATT has worked over the years by \noperating through consensus. There is every reason to expect that \nconsensus will continue to be the rule.\n  With regard to the issue of sovereignty, it is just not true that \nthis agreement will infringe on our right to set our own laws. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has made very clear that the Government can choose to \nignore treaty provisions when it desires. Further, the legislation \nitself clearly states that no part of the agreement which is \ninconsistent with U.S. law shall have effect. And finally, we have the \nright to withdraw from the agreement at any time with only 6 months \nnotice.\n  There has also been much criticism of the wide range of non-GATT \nprovisions in this legislation which were included to help offset the \ntariff cut. Many Missourians have called my office to express their \nconcern about giveaways of their tax dollars. I have looked at as many \nof these provisions as have been brought to my attention and, although \nI can see how some might oppose the policy behind them, I cannot agree \nthat they are a giveaway of our tax dollars. It could be argued that \nthe Government could have received more for some of these radio \nspectrum license sales, and that is something the administration has \nagreed to review, but clearly it is not a giveaway to tax dollars.\n  After reviewing those concerns, one must then look at the other side \nof the equation--the benefits that would result from approving the new \nGATT accord. In my opinion those benefits will be huge both for the \nUnited States as a whole and for my State of Missouri.\n  This agreement will provide the largest tariff--or tax, because that \nis what a tariff is--reduction in history. That will mean more money in \nthe pockets of Americans as well as citizens of other countries. That \nis money that can be saved or that can be spent. Regardless of how it \nis used, it is certain to result in the creation of thousands of new \nAmerican jobs.\n\n  The benefits of GATT can be seen very clearly just by looking at its \nimpact upon Missouri.\n  The new agreement will be a boon to Missouri's farmers who already \nexport a quarter of their output. We know that if you take down the \nbarriers they can export more because they are the world's most \nefficient producers. That percentage is certain to surge as other \ncountries are forced to lower unfair trade barriers which currently \nkeep out Missouri commodities such as rice, corn and beef.\n  The largest manufacturer in Missouri--McDonnell Douglas--will benefit \nsignificantly from rules designed to limit unfair Government subsidies \nto its overseas competitors in the commercial aerospace field.\n  Companies like Monsanto, Sprint, Hallmark, Leggett & Platt, and \nRalston Purina will find it much easier to sell their products \noverseas, as well. The tens of thousands of Missourians who make up \nthese companies, and the employees of the small Missouri businesses \nthat supply them, will be the true beneficiaries as new jobs are \ncreated, and existing jobs become more secure due to increased \nworldwide sales.\n  But it is not just Missouri's large companies that will benefit from \nGATT. The growing world market will provide tremendous opportunity to \nthe thousands of small companies across the state. As we enter the 21st \ncentury, we are truly entering a global economy, and all companies--\nlarge and small--will have to participate to survive. This agreement, \nwhich lowers tariffs worldwide and helps to level the playing field, \nonly serves to make it easier for smaller companies to succeed.\n  The bottom line is that the U.S. economy is inextricably tied to the \nworld economy. For that reason, we have to use our power and prestige \nas the largest market and most powerful economy to move the world \ntoward more open and fair trade. That is the best way to ensure \nprosperity for the greatest number of Americans.\n  Having said that, I would hasten to add that in working for free and \nfair trade, we must be careful not to be played for patsies. We have \nthe muscle to see that the game is played fairly and that our interests \nare protected. We must do that and, if we find that others are not \nplaying by the rules, then we should retaliate or withdraw from the \nagreement.\n  Having considered all of the arguments before us, it is clear to me \nthat this agreement makes sense for the United States. We will be the \nbiggest beneficiary of its approval. For that reason, I will today \nsupport the budget waiver and passage of the implementing legislation, \nand I ask my colleagues to do so.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I do not see anyone else here on either \nside of the aisle to speak.\n  Then, I might speak a bit to elaborate further on a point that I \nmade.\n  When we talk about world trade, there are two kinds of trade. One is \nin merchandise. Merchandise is what we might call goods--cars, \nrefrigerators, jet airplanes, nuclear reactors, hard goods for lack of \na better term. The other is services, insurance, credit cards, and \ntourism.\n  The United States is without question the world's leader in services. \nTake credit cards, for example--Visa, Master Charge, American Express. \nThese are all American-centered companies, but they sell licenses \nthroughout the world to provide these cards. The licensees pay money \nfor the license and that money flows back to the United States. We are \ntalking dollars, the same kind of dollars you get when you sell an \nairplane. It just happens to be a different kind of business.\n  Last year, 1993, we had a $57 billion surplus in services--surplus, \nmore coming in than going out.\n  In merchandise, the goods, the refrigerators, the cars, we \nunfortunately had a $116 billion deficit.\n  Now we exported a lot last year. We exported almost $450 billion, but \nwe brought in a lot more.\n  So the first question is, why? And I think I can guess why, although \nI cannot prove it.\n  At the end of World War II, we were the only major industrial country \nleft that was relatively unscathed. Japan was devastated. Up until that \ntime, Japan had not been a major factor in world trade anyway. Germany, \ndevastated; France, devastated; Italy, devastated; Russia, which never \nhad been a factor in world trade, and really not much of a factor \ntoday, devastated.\n  So, after World War II, we could sell almost anything we wanted in \nthe world and there was a market. It really did not matter if they were \ngood products or bad products; they were the only products. For years \nthereafter, we had a tremendous surplus in the merchandise trade \nsector, the goods sector. It may have been a Caterpillar tractor--and I \nmight say Caterpillar today does very well. But it did not matter what \nit was, we sold it around the world. It did not matter if the \nmerchandise was relatively shoddy; you either bought ours or you bought \nnothing.\n  The service industry, on the other hand, was an industry that almost \ndid not exist at the end of World War II. I think most of the people \nlistening to me today can remember an era when there were no credit \ncards, period, we did not have any; when insurance was by and large \nlocal. Other than the maritime industry, there were no large \nconglomerates of insurance companies selling insurance around the \nworld.\n  But the whole business of services and high-tech goods like computers \nhave really grown up only in the last 20 to 30 years.\n  Take a company like Intel, which is the largest private employer in \nOregon. The company was founded in 1969. It was not around during World \nWar II.\n  Look what happens when you are an older company--and this was true of \nthe auto companies, true of the steel companies. They came out of World \nWar II having produced tanks and steel and were the only one left in \nthe world in business. They had no incentive to change, for one thing, \nand they had no competition for probably 20 years, up until the mid-\nsixties.\n  Take cars, for example. The only foreign cars that were sold in this \ncountry of any consequence, probably until 1970, were those little \nVolkswagen beetles, which Germany developed in the mid-1950's. They had \na small portion of our market, not a large portion. But they had a \nlittle cadre of people who liked the beetles--I liked the beetles--and \nthey had sold a fair number. They did not have a large percentage of \nour market, but they had hard-core followers.\n  Then there was also the big imported cars, the Mercedes, Rolls \nRoyces, the very expensive cars. We did not make anything in this \ncountry comparable to the Rolls Royce. Therefore, there was a market \nfor them. Again, a small market. They did not have a significant impact \non our auto industry.\n  It was not until really the 1970's that two things happened. One was \nthe Arab oil embargo and the sharp increase in the price of oil from \nabout $3 a barrel to $12 a barrel in 1973-1974 and then again from \nroughly $12 a barrel to about $35 a barrel in 1979 and 1980. That \npushed up our gasoline prices tremendously. It was almost coincidental \nthat in about 1971 and 1972, the Japanese were starting to introduce \ninto this country high-mileage, good, small cars. And I emphasize \n``good.'' They were good. From the standpoint of repair and \nmaintenance, they were a superior car to our small cars. It is probably \ncoincidental that they were just hitting the market as the oil stock \nand the gasoline prices went up. The result was Americans flocked to \nthese cars in droves.\n  I can remember when we first passed the mileage standards in this \ncountry which required cars to get to a certain minimum mileage each \nyear. There was tremendous opposition from the American auto industry \nto these standards. They had two arguments. One, it would take them 5 \nto 7 years to develop that kind of car and get it on the market; two, \nAmericans did not want those kinds of cars anyway.\n  Well, 5 to 7 years, this from an industry that in 6 months went from \ncars to tanks in World War II. And pretty good tanks. We did not get \nreally into the war until Pearl Harbor and by the summer of 1942 we \nwere turning out tanks instead of cars and turning them out in droves.\n  But the argument the Americans did not want these kind of cars was \njust fallacious. We wanted cars that got good gas mileage. Amazingly, \nwe liked good cars. We liked cars that were dependable and that did not \ntake a lot of repair.\n  The Japanese stole the market from us. Wrong word; we gave it away; \ngave it away.\n  Now, to their credit, American manufacturers are now catching up. The \nJapanese are building cars in this country. I think it will only be \nanother 4 to 5 years until they build more cars here for the American \nmarket than they import from Japan. But Ford, GM, and Chrysler are now \nturning out superior cars, every bit as good as the Japanese, cheaper \nthan the Japanese, as good mileage as the Japanese, and Americans are \nbuying them.\n  But it took competition over 20 years to force American manufacturers \nto catch up.\n  If you read the Wall Street Journal yesterday, you will note that \nsteel has also caught up. Steel went through the doldrums in the 1970's \nand 1980's. It could not compete with the low-wage Japanese, could not \ncompete with the Koreans. Today we are the lowest cost producer of \nsteel in the world. We are competitive every where. But it took us a \nlong time to catch up.\n  Having said all that, what is going to happen and what can we do to \nnarrow this terrible trade deficit we keep hearing about?\n  First, when you calculate the trade deficit, you have to take the \nmerchandise deficit, our deficits in the cars, VCR's, and television, \nand, against that, offset the services surplus. Our trade deficit for \n1993 is about $60 billion when you offset the surplus of services \nagainst the merchandise deficit.\n  Of that $60 billion, $44 billion is oil, imported oil; $43 billion is \nimported cars. You get rid of just those two items, cars and oil, and \nwe have a total trade surplus. I should point out, however, that the \ndeficit in cars is starting to shrink.\n  Now I will pose the question what we should do about oil. I am \nindebted to the Library of Congress for this information. I have to \nsay, the Library of Congress' Congressional Research Service is the \ngreatest research organization in the world. I would not trade them for \nall the rest of the research organizations put together. I only put \nthem on this issue yesterday to see if they could find out if what I \nthought was probably true is, and they verified that it is true.\n  Now, I am going to make a bold statement. We import oil because it is \ncheaper than making oil in this country out of coal. What do I mean by \nthat?\n  This country has a cornucopia of natural resources. Japan has no \nnatural resources, no oil, no coal, no natural gas, and no great rivers \nto dam up to make electricity. They have to import all of their energy. \nThis country has a cornucopia of energy. We have a 400-year supply of \ncoal. We have a 200-year supply of oil shale. If you count all of North \nAmerica, including Canada and Mexico--and I will add that we are all \ninvolved now in this North American Free-Trade Agreement--there is more \nnatural gas than we know what to do with and we are finding more than \nwe are using. But we are short of oil, crude oil, the kind you bring \nout of the ground in liquid form.\n  I say we are short. I am not sure, because every time we think we \nmight find some oil, we just have a devil of an environmental argument \nas to whether we should look for it in Prudhoe Bay or in the Outer \nContinental Shelf. Should we drill? Should we even do experimental \ndrilling to see if oil is there? The answer from the environmental \ncommunity very often is no. We do not want to look because, if we look, \nwe might find, and if we find, then somebody may want to bring it out. \nSo we import it instead.\n  But let us assume for the moment there is no oil there. What could we \ndo? It is what South Africa did for the better part of 30 years, \nbecause their government had a trade boycott against it and they could \nnot buy oil of any quantity overseas. Well, South Africa, which is, \nagain, a country rich in natural resources, took to making gasoline out \nof coal. You can do it. Transform the coal into oil, transform the oil \ninto gasoline. It is expensive, but it can be done.\n  I asked the Library of Congress yesterday and they gave me the answer \ntoday, could we make coal into oil in this country? Do we have enough \ncoal? The answer is, yes, we have more coal than we know what to do \nwith. Could we turn the oil into gasoline? Yes. Is it much more \nexpensive? Yes, it is much more expensive. How much? And I said put it \nin terms that are understandable to me, the layman. They answered that, \nif we were to take our coal, turn it into oil, turn the oil into \ngasoline, the equivalent price of gasoline, in their estimate, would be \n$3 to $4 a gallon, instead of what we currently pay. In addition, all \nother oil prices would go up equivalently. Whatever you pay for fuel \noil, whatever you pay for oil to turn the generators to produce \nelectricity, all throughout the economy, you would have these price \nincreases and inflation. But we could get rid of the $44 billion trade \ndeficit in oil.\n  Now, the question is: Do we want to do that?\n  Coal is a problem. Coal burns dirty. It takes a lot of money to burn \ncoal clean. If you are going to turn it into oil it is a lot more \nexpensive and a lot dirtier than just pumping it out of the ground. But \nif we are so all-fired worried about this trade surplus, would we be \nwilling to get rid of $44 billion of it by making our own oil out of \ncoal? If you say to the American public: Yes, this trade deficit is so \nbad that I think we should have gasoline at $3 to $4 a gallon, we \nshould have fuel oil for our homes, at whatever the equivalent increase \nwill be, we ought to have the inflation it will bring, and the increase \nin bond prices and mortgage interest rates that come with inflation, we \nare willing to have all of that to get rid of this $44 billion \ndeficit--that is a fair debate, whether or not we want to trade that \noff. We should not say we cannot do it. South Africa did it. Japan \ncannot do it. They do not have the resources.\n  I am going to predict what is going to happen over the years. I do \nnot think we are going to turn to making oil out of coal. However, our \nservices sector is the fastest growing segment in all of the industrial \ncountries of the world. We keep hearing that our manufacturing base has \ndisappeared. It has not disappeared. It has become more productive. I \ncount agriculture as one of our industrial bases. It is a separate \ncategory but it is very capital intensive. We put more money per person \ninto farm equipment and farming than we do any other industry.\n  At the turn of the century it took about one farmer to produce food \nenough for seven people. Today one farmer produces enough food for \nabout 82 to 83 people. I would wager by the turn of the century one \nfarmer in this country will produce enough food for 100 people. That is \na tremendous increase in productivity. It is expensive.\n  A new combine for cutting wheat costs between $145,000 and $150,000. \nA new tractor to pull that combine is about $130,000. Yet, with that \ncombine and that tractor and a lot of other expensive equipment that \ngoes with it, a husband and wife and a couple of kids and a hired hand \ncan farm a multithousand-acre wheat farm successfully and compete \nanyplace in the world. That is the situation in agriculture.\n  The same thing that has happened in agriculture has happened in \nautomobile manufacturing and steel manufacturing--especially for the \nlast 20 years we have gotten so much better at it that we can turn out \nmore cars with fewer people, more steel with fewer people. We have \nlearned how to become more  productive. It is not that we are producing \nfewer cars. When people say we have lost our industrial base--we have \nnot lost our base. We are producing more cars with fewer people, more \nsteel with fewer people. We are producing more wheat with fewer people. \nThat is also true in Germany. Not in their agricultural sector which is \nheavily subsidized and inefficient, but it is true in Germany for \nsteel. It is true in Japan in cars. It is true in all of the \nindustrialized countries of the world. Their manufacturing sector, in \nterms of manufacturing employment in relation to their total \nemployment, is shrinking. The number of employed stays about the same \nbut their production increases tremendously and the number of employees \nin manufacturing in relation to the number of employees in services \ngets smaller and smaller as a percentage because it is the service \nindustry that is growing. And it is the service industry that we are \nthe best at.\n\n  Example: 5 years ago the trade surplus in services was $25 billion. \nFive years later it is $57 billion. I will make a bet 5 years from now \nit will be $100 billion in our favor. And the merchandise deficit will \ngo down. There will be an irreducible minimum in my judgment below \nwhich it cannot go if we do not do something about oil. If we want to \ncontinue to import oil, I do not know if we will ever get to a trade \nbalance in merchandise, no matter how hard we try. But to the extent we \ncan make up that deficit in merchandise with a surplus in services \nthere is nothing wrong with that. Credit cards are not un-American. \nInsurance is not un-American.\n  We have almost a death wish fascination with manufacturing, that \nsomehow you cannot be a great country unless you are the world's \ngreatest producer of things: Steel, autos, refrigerators, locomotives. \nYou cannot be a great country because you are the best producer of \nthese little computer chips. I held up one yesterday. Intel--I will \ngive an example. I mentioned Intel once before. Intel is the largest \nprivate employer in Oregon. It is a company that was founded in 1969. \nWhen I was elected to the Senate in 1968, this company did not exist. \nThey are now investing close to $2 billion in Oregon--about $700 \nmillion to expand an existing plant and about $1.2 billion to build a \nnew plant and turn out computer chips. They are now the world's largest \nmanufacturer. They have overtaken the Japanese. They are outselling the \nJapanese around the world. These are chips for export--this counts as \nservices--export.\n  How can Intel compete with Bangladesh? Oregon is a relatively high-\nwage State and a relatively high-tax State.\n  Do you know what the answer is? And this is true of all of the high-\ntech industries. You ask them what are your floor labor costs? By floor \nlabor they mean the production laborers, the hands-on workers, not the \nresearch and development which they do not plan to move anyplace, nor \ntheir management. How much of a percent of your total cost is your \nfloor labor? Seven percent. Eight percent. They are not going to move \nto Bangladesh where they can pay somebody 50 cents an hour when labor \nis 7 percent of the total cost anyway.\n  It is much more critical to them that they have good transportation \nto get their products around the world. It is more critical to them \nthey have a clean atmosphere. I was in their plant not 2 months ago and \nyou ought to see it now, what they call the clean room. When I started \nmy business a clean room was a white smock. In their clean room today \nyou would swear you were looking at something out of Star Wars. People \nclothed almost like an astronaut on the Moon. Their breath being \nmonitored through a tube and through a recirculator on their backs so \nthat their breath does not get on the chips that are being made.\n  Immense temperature control equipment to keep these rooms almost at a \nperfectly even temperature. They would have to have these things in \nBangladesh, and they cost just as much to put them in Bangladesh as \nhere. Bangladesh does not make machines like that. They are not going \nto move to Bangladesh.\n  So, can we compete? You bet we can compete. And the things that we \nwill compete at best are very frankly the things that have the lowest \npercentage of labor cost to total cost. I did not say lowest labor \ncost. Lowest percentage of labor cost to total cost. Those things that \nhave a high labor cost we may not be able to compete in.\n  One of those is low-end apparel. I do not mean high-cost apparel. I \nthink even in this country we can compete in apparel made here that is \nvery expensive apparel, but can we compete making a $1.99 T-shirt or a \ncheap men's suit when we have not yet learned how to automate the \nmaking of a man's suit? I doubt it.\n  Japan learned that lesson 20 years ago. Thirty years ago, Japan was \nin the top five in the world in the export of apparel and the export of \ntextiles--apparel being the clothing and textiles being the cloth--30 \nyears ago. Today I defy you to go to a clothing store, look at the \ngarments, look at the ``where they are made'' tags, and see if you can \nfind one that says made in Japan. Thailand--yes, Bangladesh--yes, \nSingapore--yes, Honduras--yes. Japan? No. Japan got out of the apparel \nbusiness because they figured they do not compete. There was too much \nhand labor. Japan is still in the top five in the export of textiles. \nAnd the difference? Textiles is a highly capital-intensive business. By \nthis I mean it needs machines run by relatively few people. And the \nmachines, just like the Intel machines, cost a lot of money. They cost \njust as much to put them in Bangladesh, which does not make them, as it \ndoes to put them in Kyoto or Tokyo.\n  Japan also realized something. If we are going to get Thailand to buy \nour television sets and pay us in yen, they have to be able to make \nsomething to sell us to get yen. Why do we not let them sell us \napparel? If we want to sell Boeing 747's, General Electric and \nWestinghouse nuclear reactors, farm products--the biggest single item \nsurplus that we have in our trade is agriculture. We have $19 billion \nsurplus in agriculture. We are the world's best farmers without \nquestion. But if Mexico is going to buy wheat, or if Brazil is going to \nbuy Westinghouse nuclear reactors, what are they going to pay us with? \nWe want dollars.\n  To pay us, they have to sell us something that we give them money \nfor, so they can buy back what we want to sell them. Mr. President, as \nsure as we are here we are going to win this battle because time and \ntide are on our side. In every country that is the big purchaser of \nanything, it is the services sector that is growing. That is the sector \nwhere we compete the best. In the merchandise sector we have become \nmuch more competitive than we were 20 years ago.\n  Oil is an ultimate problem and we have to make a decision there as to \nwhether we would like to buy oil from Venezuela, Indonesia, Saudi \nArabia, at $15 to $16 a barrel--which is roughly what the price is \ntoday--and have a $40 billion to $50 billion trade deficit in oil, or \nwhether we want to produce the oil here at the equivalent of anywhere \nfrom $32 or $33 to $45 a barrel, get rid of the trade deficit, and have \ngasoline at $3 to $4 a gallon. Because those are both fair \nconsiderations. But for anyone to say that America cannot compete is \nreally saying: America, I do not want to compete.\n  To my fellow Senators, for better or for worse, we are in a \ncompetitive world. We may choose not to compete. We can put up the \nbarriers. We can make all of our own clothing here, all of our own cars \nhere, all of our own video cassette recorders here; sell nothing \noverseas and buy nothing overseas. Consumer prices will be higher. \nProducts will be shoddier and America will be poorer. But we will not \nhave to worry about competition.\n  There is an old saying, ``If you think you can or if you think you \ncan't, you're right.'' If we think we cannot compete in the world, we \nwill not compete. But if we think we can, then we will develop the \nIntels of the world and all of the equivalent companies that go with \nit, and we will master the world in trade.\n  The choice is ours, and the vote on the bill that is before us today \nis perhaps a more significant vote for or against competition, \ndepending which way you vote, than any other vote we will make in this \ndecade. I, for one, am going to opt on the side that America can \ncompete; that we have not scratched the surface of what we can do in \nterms of competition in this world when we are pushed. This bill gives \nus not only the push we need but it also lowers barriers in markets \noverseas that we need to get into. We will never have a better \nopportunity to improve this country.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). Who yields time?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I yield 11 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina for 11 minutes.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, yesterday during debate on this issue, I \noutlined my opposition to waiving the budget agreement to pass this \nbill. Today, I would like to summarize some of the other parts of the \nGATT implementing legislation that concern me.\n  Before elaborating on the GATT agreement, I would like to take a \nmoment to talk about how those who oppose this measure have been \ncharacterized. It has been said that we are against trade; that we are \nisolationists and protectionists. As far as this Senator is concerned, \nnothing could be further from the truth. I support trade because it \nhelps increase our employment and provides economic growth. I have \nworked to support efforts which expand our country's exports. However, \nour trade with foreign manufacturers who are subsidized by their \nGovernments and who have primitive labor laws and ridiculously low \nwages. Unfortunately, the agreement before us does not address these \nissues and, therefore, places our workers at a major disadvantage in \nthe global marketplace. Consequently, I cannot support the passage of \nthis bill.\n  In addition, Mr. President, significant problems exist that are \nassociated with this agreement which go beyond the pure trade \nprovisions of the pact.\n  For instance, a major concern that I have with this agreement is the \nestablishment of a new international body, called the World Trade \nOrganization, known as WTO. This supranational bureaucracy will \nadversely affect the sovereignty of our Nation.\n  The WTO establishes a ministerial conference and a general council. \nThe ministerial conference will meet every 2 years and receive \ndecisions on matters covered by trade agreements. The general council \nwill govern the WTO on a daily basis. The dispute settlement body, \nwhich will be established under the general council, will be the \nultimate arbitrator of trade disputes. The decisions handed down by the \nWTO will be voted on by the member countries.\n  Each country gets one vote regardless of the population or the value \nof trade by a country and, unlike in the United Nations, the United \nStates will not have a veto power over WTO decisions. Further, the \nUnited States will finance up to 20 percent of the budget for operating \nthe WTO.\n  The WTO will be the arbitrator of trade disputes between signatory \ncountries. By adopting this bill, we will allow our trade disputes to \nbe settled behind closed doors by bureaucrats that are accountable to \nno one. Let me quote what Ralph Nadar said in testimony before the \nSenate Committee on Commerce about how the WTO will work:\n\n       This is a tribunal in which three trade specialists preside \n     over a totally secret deliberative process. The press is \n     excluded. Nongovernmental organizations are excluded. All \n     citizens are excluded, State attorneys general are excluded. \n     Only representatives of national governments that are parties \n     to a dispute are given a role. Furthermore, all submissions, \n     all briefs and materials that must be open in our courts, can \n     be kept secret.\n\n  Mr. President, we should not let trade disputes be settled by \nsecretive panels of specialists who are accountable to no one. I want \nto repeat that. We should not let trade disputes be settled by \nsecretive panels of specialists who are accountable to no one. Our \ncountry was founded on a principle of openness. Our Senate proceedings \nare open to public scrutiny. We have sunshine laws that require us to \nhave an open and accountable Government.\n  At the very least, if the United States is to consider entering into \nthe WTO, then this matter should be considered as a treaty. Article 16, \nparagraph 4 of the GATT agreement states that ``each member shall \nensure the conformity of its laws, regulations, and administrative \nprocedures with its obligation as provided in the GATT.'' By changing \nour laws to satisfy this supranational trade organization, we are \ngiving away our power to make our own laws. By definition, sovereignty \nis the ability of a country to make and enforce its own laws. When the \nWTO rules against us and then tells us to change our laws, we are \nlosing our rights as a country.\n  One argument used to justify the WTO is that other countries would \nnot impose harsh penalties against the United States since we have such \na lucrative marketplace. However, I do not think any of us can really \nbe sure how the developing nations of the world, which account for 83 \npercent of the WTO membership, will vote when a situation arises. \nDuring 1993, more than three-quarters of the WTO members voted against \nthe United States and the other G-7 countries on at least half of the \nvotes on matters before the United Nations. What makes us think that \nthey will not vote against us in trade related matters?\n  Mr. President, those of us who were serving in the Senate during the \nTokyo round of GATT talks have heard many of the same arguments that \nthe Clinton administration is currently making in regard to this \nagreement. The claims regarding the Uruguay round are strikingly \nfamiliar to those made by the Carter administration at the close of the \nTokyo round talks in the late 1970's. At that time, we were told that \nthe bold new steps which were incorporated into the Tokyo round were \nneeded to eliminate our trade deficit and to make America more \ncompetitive in the global marketplace. Yet, history and our trade \ndeficit show that the exact opposite happened. After implementation of \nthe Tokyo round, the United States trade deficit grew from $14 billion \nin 1979 to over $115 billion for 1993. Further, we saw a major decline \nin the viability of the steel, textile and apparel, and electronics \nindustries. These industries have struggled to survive in spite of the \nclosed markets that they encountered in other countries.\n\n  Mr. President, in my travels around the State of South Carolina, I \nget the opportunity to talk to many people. My constituents voice \nconcerns about where our country is headed. They realize that they are \nworking longer, but their hard work is not showing up in their \npaycheck. Wages are stagnant. They are fearful that their jobs are \ngoing to be exported. With this fear comes the loss of hope that they \nwill ever be able to improve their economic status in the current \nenvironment.\n  According to Department of Labor statistics, no single U.S. job has \nbeen created in industries exposed to world trade for more than 20 \nyears. Every job created has been in areas that do not face foreign \ncompetition, such as health care and retail sales.\n  During this debate, many proponents of this agreement will use the \nargument that for each $1 billion of goods exported, 20,000 jobs are \ncreated. I would then ask how many jobs are lost for each billion \ndollars worth of merchandise trade deficit that the United States \nincurs? Using the same 20,000 jobs and with our current trade deficit \nof over $160 billion in 1994, our country could lose over 3 million \njobs this year. As I previously stated, with the last GATT agreement, \nour trade deficit has continued to climb. I doubt that this trend is \ngoing to magically reverse itself with the passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to carefully study this agreement \nbefore deciding to disregard our budgeting procedures and eroding our \nsovereignty to accept the dubious benefits of this agreement. Further, \nI would ask that they not vote to approve this trade agreement.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that related materials be \nprinted in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 14, 1994.\n     President Bill Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As advocates for openness in \n     government, we would like to register our deep concern about \n     the dispute settlement process proposed as part of the World \n     Trade Organization agreement. As it now stands, this proposal \n     is riddled with provisions denying access to government \n     deliberations that are an affront to the democratic \n     traditions of this nation.\n       This unprecedented secrecy is particularly offensive, given \n     the vast powers to punish and penalize that this body will \n     hold, not over just the federal government, but state and \n     local ones, too. Maximum access should be required in this \n     dispute resolution process for the following reasons:\n       (1) The proposed process would have the power to determine \n     the legality of a wide variety of laws at the local, state \n     and federal levels, although officials from all levels would \n     not be able to take part in the deliberations.\n       (2) The deliberations affect not only trade issues, but \n     consumer, worker and environmental protections as well.\n       (3) Penalties exacted in this process could be severe.\n       We urge you to insist that signatories to this agreement \n     understand that when state and federal laws are subjected to \n     an international authority to the extent proposed in this \n     document, that citizens of the United States have a \n     constitutional right to access to those deliberations. Here \n     are some of the secrecy and confidential provisions of the \n     agreement that we hope will be revised to conform with \n     democratic practices and traditions:\n       (1) The public and press should be able to monitor \n     deliberations of the dispute settlement panels. Under the \n     present proposal, those sessions would be closed to both the \n     public and the press.\n       (2) Documents presented during panel deliberations should \n     be made available to the public as they are in the U.S. \n     judicial proceedings. The decisions of the panels in this \n     process have the force of law, with serious penalties for a \n     non-complying nation, yet the only concession to demands for \n     openness on this point has been a proposal to provide a \n     summary of this information. That falls far short of the \n     public's needs in such critical matters.\n       (3) The American public's First Amendment right to petition \n     the government should be made a part of this proposed \n     agreement. As it stands, there are no means of direct input \n     from the people, no right of public comment or amicus briefs.\n       (4) Provision should be made for conflict-of-interest \n     disclosure requirements. As the proposal stands, there is no \n     way for the public to determine whether panelists deciding an \n     issue have economic or other interest in that matter. You may \n     recall that the NAFTA dispute settlement panel operates like \n     the one proposed for the WTO, and during a recent timber \n     subsidy case between Canada and the United States it was \n     discovered belatedly that two attorneys on the panel worked \n     for the Canadian lumber industry.\n       (5) Documents relating to appeals of WTO panel decisions \n     should be made public. Under the current proposal, all of the \n     appeal process is conducted in secret.\n       The First Amendment advocates whose names appear below take \n     no position, as a group, on the World Trade Organization \n     agreement itself. Some may support it, others may oppose and \n     still others may be undecided. But all of us, as a group, \n     urge you and your negotiators to restore democratic openness \n     to this crucial process.

The terms of this Agreement raise serious \n     questions about the plight of children in many nations placed \n     in factories and fields under regrettable conditions.\n       Child labor may be cheap, and an international marketplace \n     which functions solely based upon price competition may allow \n     those who most use child labor to have a concomitant market \n     advantage. Such an advantage drives others into similar \n     practices in order to reduce their costs and preserve \n     marketplace. Unless major consuming nations refuse to buy \n     products produced by inappropriate child labor, or \n     international compacts preclude it effectively, competition \n     will drive producers down to the lowest common cost \n     denominator. That may well mean child labor as a \n     competitively pressured alternative.\n       In some parts of the world, child labor already means \n     irreparable harm to children. While work is also a part of \n     growing up, some children are now forced into sweat shops \n     which may approximate the worst abuses of slavery. Many are \n     deprived of the lost opportunities that an education can \n     bring. Most lose the simple joys of childhood as we have \n     known them.\n       One counterforce has been the possibility of rejection of \n     products produced by abusive child labor practices by \n     consuming nations, particularly the United States. Nations \n     can, individually or collectively, set standards to assure \n     the protection of children from cruelty and abuse, and \n     enforce them with potent pocketbooks.\n       But the Congressional Research Service has recently opined \n     in writing that a national statute which bars purchase of \n     products based upon child labor abuses would be \n     ``inconsistent with GATT articles prohibiting quantitative \n     restrictions on imports * * * and that, further, it may be \n     difficult to justify a ban under GATT exceptions.'' \n     [Congressional Research Service, American Law Division, \n     Report to Hon. Tom Harkin, July 15, 1993] The Report \n     indicates that the GATT drafters did not consider child labor \n     issues in the draft agreement now pending.\n       As advocates for children within the United States, we are \n     concerned about long standing child labor abuses within many \n     nations selling products. We do not support the reward of \n     child labor exploitation by American purchase. If an \n     international treaty binding the United States does not \n     reliably protect children, we would hope that our nation \n     would not surrender its sovereign right to do so.\n       Thus far, the debate on GATT has not involved substantial \n     consultation with those of us who focus professionally on the \n     status of children. We have not had an opportunity to debate \n     fully the momentous implications of this measure as it \n     affects children. We need the time and opportunity to do so.\n       We ask that you not vote precipitously on a measure with \n     such far reaching and potentially permanent implications \n     without opportunity for full debate, particularly as to \n     issues affecting children.\n           Very sincerely,\n     Robert C. Fellmeth,\n\n                                           Executive Director,\n\n                                    Children's Advocacy Institute,\n                           California's Statewide Child Advocates.\n     Rosalind McGee,\n\n                                           Executive Director,\n\n                                                    Utah Children,\n                                           Utah's Child Advocates.\n     Eve Brooks,\n         President, National Association of Child Advocates, The \n           Nation's Umbrella Organization of State-Based Child \n           Advocates for 37 States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Playing the GATT Numbers Game\n\n       The Clinton Administration and cohorts are promising better \n     returns than the neighborhood bookie as the Congressional \n     vote on the U.S. implementing legislation for the Uruguay \n     Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) \n     nears. Before U.S. consumer, labor and environmental \n     protection laws and sovereignty are gambled away to the whims \n     of a secretive, undemocratic tribunal in Geneva, the U.S. \n     public, the press, and Congress should look behind those \n     promises. Let's consider five of the predictions:\n\n\n          how treasury created $200 billion in gatt gdp gains\n\n       The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) will increase by $153 \n     billion in the tenth year alone of the Agreement, according \n     to the U.S. Treasury Department. To calculate that $153 \n     billion, Treasury started with ``static gains'' of $88 \n     billion, based on economic models that took for granted \n     improved allocation of resources as a result of GATT. Never \n     mind that most of the model-based estimates were computed \n     before the Agreement was concluded and the final terms known, \n     or that the models assumed full employment and perfect \n     competition. Next, Treasury added $27 billion in ``guesses'' \n     about the GDP impact of nontariff and service trade \n     agreements, an $11 billion estimate for so-called ``model \n     aggregation'' from the Administration's chief GATT \n     cheerleader, $11 billion from the industries most likely to \n     benefit from intellectual property rules in the Agreement, \n     and, to appease the U.S. GATT negotiators, $11 billion for an \n     ``improved'' dispute resolution system. The fantasy was \n     topped off with $53 billion in ``dynamic gains,'' the latest \n     euphemism for supply-side economics. Even the Council of \n     Economic Advisors couldn't swallow the lofty total and \n     demanded a ``cushion'' of a negative $55 billion. (Other \n     estimates range as low as $7 billion in GATT-related GDP \n     gains for the entire first 10 years of the Agreement.)\n\n\n               gatt is no $744 billion worldwide tax cut\n\n       This Agreement will create a $744 billion worldwide tax \n     (tariff) cut over the next 10 years, according to the U.S. \n     Treasury Department. The estimate assumes that all Uruguay \n     Round reductions in tariff and nontariff barriers would take \n     effect immediately. In fact, the decreases would be phased in \n     over a 10 year period. Additionally, the Administration \n     counts as GATT cuts, tariffs that are lowered or removed as \n     the result of unrelated and unaffected agreements such as \n     NAFTA. According to the Economic Policy Institute, adjusting \n     for these two errors brings the tariff cut down to $200 \n     billion, or $3.51 per person per year. The actual cut is even \n     less than $200 billion because the calculations ignore tariff \n     increases that are part of the Uruguay Round Agreement. Even \n     Treasury admits that some of the benefits of tariff cuts will \n     not be passed on to consumers, but will simply line corporate \n     coffers.\n\n\n     88 percent of gatt funding is unrelated to international trade\n\n       The $12 billion in tariff income lost by the Treasury \n     during the first five years of the Uruguay Round cuts would \n     be offset with increases in revenue and reductions in \n     spending in other areas, according to the Senate Finance and \n     House Ways and means committees. More than half of those \n     offsets generate no money to replace the real dollar tariff \n     losses, but instead rely on accounting gimmicks and PAYGO \n     surpluses. For example, the Congressional committees claim \n     to have created $1.207 billion in additional revenues \n     simply by collecting excise taxes in September, before the \n     end of the fiscal year, instead of October, when the taxes \n     would have been due. According to the Joint Tax Committee \n     of Congress, more than $2.5 billion in PAYGO balances (by \n     law intended to reduce the federal deficit) also will be \n     used to offset tariff losses. (PAYGO balances are \n     generated from past legislation that reduced expenditures \n     or increased revenues.)\n\n\n          ``no'' vote on gatt won't cause a stock market crash\n\n       Failure to ratify the implementing legislation will cause \n     the stock market to crash. Some GATT proponents have even \n     gone so far as to attempt to generate fear of a crash by \n     comparing GATT to NAFTA. They blame stock price decreases \n     prior to the November 1993 NAFTA vote solely on ``anti-\n     NAFTA'' events and increases on ``pro-NAFTA'' developments, \n     even though interest rates, inflation fears, and the release \n     of economic reports had an impact. At the time, a chief \n     technical analyst predicted, ``As soon as the NAFTA vote is \n     done, people will be back to worrying about quarterly \n     earnings and interest rates. The NAFTA vote is just an \n     emotional thing.'' The day after Congress passed NAFTA, stock \n     prices buckled in response to a big retreat in bond prices.\n\n\n             gatt dispute statistics refute kantor's claims\n\n       The U.S. wins 80 percent of the trade disputes deliberated \n     by GATT panels, according to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey \n     Kantor. In fact, the U.S. has won 80 percent of the time only \n     when the U.S. has accused other countries of GATT violations. \n     When other countries have charged that U.S.laws were GATT-\n     illegal, the U.S. has won a comparatively minuscule 21 \n     percent of the time. GATT disputes involving the U.S. have \n     tripled since 1980, compared to the previous fifteen years. \n     The EEC has recently published its Report on United States \n     Barriers to Trade and Investment, which will ``serve as a \n     means of monitoring US measures to implement the Uruguay \n     Round agreement.'' At risk are consumer protection rules of \n     the Food and Drug Administration, incentives for small and \n     minority-owned businesses, recycled content requirements, \n     restrictions on purchases of defense products from foreign \n     suppliers, etc.\n       The implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round is \n     scheduled for a vote in a lame duck session of Congress next \n     week. Under fast track rules, debate is limited and no \n     amendments may be proposed. The House has even adopted \n     special rules which allow no points of order (such as \n     challenging the use of PAYGO) to be raised. The Senate will \n     need to vote to override its balanced budget requirements. \n     Now's the time for the public, the press and Congress to \n     challenge the GATT proponents' numbers game. Otherwise, in \n     response to false promises and threats, U.S. sovereignty may \n     be surrendered to an international bureaucracy whose \n     operating procedures guarantee that consumer, labor and \n     environmental laws will be reduced to the lowest common \n     denominator.\n\n\n      potentially gatt-illegal senate bills of the 103rd congress\n\n       Following is a list of bills introduced in the 103rd \n     Congress that are particularly susceptible to successful \n     challenge under the proposed World Trade Organization if they \n     are signed into law. If WTO dispute panels ruled against the \n     measures, the United States would face a cruel choice: repeal \n     the WTO-illegal measure or pay trade sanctions. Just the \n     threat of such challenges would have a chilling effect on \n     legislative initiatives raised by federal and state \n     legislators.\n       Buy American bills: S. 1359 Intro. 8/4/93 by Leahy with \n     Harkin, Simon, Moseley-Braun, Wofford, Pryor, Kerrey, Baucus, \n     Johnston;

Since the U.S. trucking lobby likes the bigger \n     Mexican rigs that have a 175,000-pound ceiling, which image \n     do you think your rear-view mirror will reflect in a few \n     years?\n       As a governing regime, the WTO's 123 member-nations are \n     each given one vote. Two dictatorships can outvote the United \n     States, which has no veto. This is why the Bush \n     administration itself opposed this WTO idea before leaving \n     office in December 1992.\n       Remarkably, countries that mistreat their workers, \n     consumers and environment (including condoning brutalized \n     child labor) do not violate the GATT-WTO. But our country, \n     with more humane standards than many other countries, can be \n     charged at those secret tribunals with restricting trade.\n       That is why the proposed WTO is a ``pull-down,'' not a \n     ``pull-up,'' trade agreement.\n       Fifteen years ago, when the prior revision of GATT called \n     the Tokyo round was completed, Washington made similarly \n     inflated promises of more jobs for the United States.\n       Since then, our country has suffered from even larger \n     annual trade deficits, including a deficit in manufactured \n     goods.\n       Even with a cheap dollar, this year's deficit will exceed \n     $150 billion. That is exporting lots of American jobs from a \n     nation experiencing falling real wages for the past two \n     decades.\n       Congress should defeat the GATT-WTO and return it to Geneva \n     for renegotiation under democratic processes and ``pull-up'' \n     standards of prosperity.\n       This would also avoiding busting the federal budget and \n     overcentralizing unaccountable power in Geneva, and it will \n     prevent the foreign regulation of America.\n       This lame-duck Congress, with more than 90 defeated or \n     retiring job-seekers, needs to hear by next Tuesday from \n     concerned Americans, who may call their senators and \n     representatives at 202-224-3121.\n\nBrief Response to Some Senators Who Employ the Argument That the United \n       States Can Always Get Out of the WTO on Six Months Notice\n\n                            (By Ralph Nader)\n\n       Given the array of power pressing the Congress to get into \n     this World trade pact, consider the unlikelihood that we \n     would ever get the Congress to get out of this Pact. Giving \n     notice and getting out means surrendering 50 years of trading \n     rights with other nations. It is not going to happen in this \n     town.\n       Moreover, the U.S. cannot get out of parts of this Pact. \n     Article 16, Par. 5 of the agreement stipulates that no \n     reservations may be made in respect of any provision of this \n     agreement. The U.S. and all other nations are not permitted \n     any exceptions the way the old GATT (now operating) permits.\n       Therefore, if exiting the Pact is politically impossible, \n     can we fix the trade pact from inside--regarding the \n     autocratic secretive processes, the one-nation-one vote, no \n     veto etc? Can we amend this agreement given the way the \n     voting power is overwhelmingly stacked against the U.S. and \n     the supramajorities needed for such changes? We have less \n     than one percent of the vote, and shrinking as new large and \n     tiny countries are added to the rolls. Maybe someone can \n     explain how we can fix this agreement, as many Senators have \n     been saying, to try to minimize the disadvantageous \n     provisions that are in the text against the interests of the \n     American democracy and economy. Will any of these Senators \n     stand up and explain the practical points?\n       1. Can we really quit the WTO once we are in it?\n       2. Can we really fix the WTO, given the voting odds, once \n     we are in it?\n       3. And isn't it better to reject the WTO proposal (as a \n     prior Congress\\1\\ did when it was called the ITO and a \n     renegotiation occurred in 1947) and send it back to Geneva \n     for renegotiation while we have some bargaining power left. \n     For without the approval of Congress, the Pact would have to \n     be renegotiated--our major trading partners have acknowledged \n     this reality.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\Congress did not actually vote to reject; its members \n     signalled that the ITO would not be accepted.

Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for \nyielding this time. I may not take all of that.\n  I just wanted to state for the record that since 1975 when I first \nentered the House of Representatives I have worked assiduously and \ntirelessly on behalf of human rights. The first amendment dealing with \nhuman rights and foreign policy was in fact an amendment I offered in \n1975 in the House of Representatives.\n  I do not believe there is any more pressing issue regarding human \nrights in the world today than the exploitive and abusive use of child \nlabor, whether it is in manufacturing, mining, textiles, rugmaking, \nshoes, et cetera. I have a bill pending in the Senate which I will \nintroduce again next year, S. 613, which basically would cut off the \nimportation into this country of any items that are made by child \nlabor.\n  For the record, on September 23, 1993 the U.S. Senate went on record \nunanimously with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution supporting that \nlegislation. That was just about a year ago. I will read the \nresolution. It says:\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the economic exploitation of children, especially the \n     practice of bonded child labor should be strongly condemned;\n       (2) it should be the policy of the United States to not \n     allow the importation of products made by children who are \n     employed in industry or mining; and\n       (3) the President should take action to seek an agreement \n     with governments that conduct trade with the United States \n     for the purpose of securing an international ban on trade in \n     products made with child labor.\n\n  Mr. President, that was just over a year ago when the Senate went on \nrecord with that resolution. Last year, I funded through my \nSubcommittee on Appropriations a study by the Department of Labor of \nthose industries and countries that use exploitive child labor. \nNineteen of our trading partners were identified. The study documented \nsome of the more serious abuses of child labor. There are more than 19 \ncountries involved in abusive child labor practices. But that was the \nlimit of the study.\n  The documentation is irrefutable--millions of children 8 to 14 years \nof age, bonded labor, working 10 to 12 hours a day 6 to 7 days a week \nfor mere pennies. The facts are clear that as international \ncorporations seek low-wage workers they push down the cost of labor to \nthe lowest level. The lowest level, obviously, is slavery. But since we \ndo not sanction slavery in any country, and to utilize slavery would \nmake a country a pariah, slavery is not utilized.\n  The next rung up is prison labor. We do not allow prison labor \neither. As the distinguished Senator from Nebraska said a few moments \nago--I repeat what he was said, it was very, very good--we protect \ncriminals but we do not protect the kids. We do not allow the products \nof prison labor to come in but we do of children. So we protect \ncriminals but we do not protect the kids. What an odd set of \ncircumstances.\n  So we have a situation that we have to address. Again, what is \nhappening is that so many of these products are now produced overseas.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, an article \nfrom Harper's magazine, August 1992, entitled ``The New Free-Trade \nHeel.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Harper's magazine, August 1992]\n\n  The New Free-Trade Heel--Nike's Profits Jump on the Backs of Asian \n                                Workers\n\n                         (By Jeffrey Ballinger)\n\n       Her only name is Sadisah, and it's safe to say that she's \n     never heard of Michael Jordan. Nor is she spending her \n     evenings watching him and his Olympic teammates gliding and \n     dunking in prime time from Barcelona. But she has heard of \n     the shoe company he endorses--Nike, whose logo can be seen on \n     the shoes and uniforms of many American Olympic athletes this \n     summer. Like Jordan, Sadisah works on behalf of Nike. You \n     won't see her, however in the flashy TV images of freedom and \n     individuality that smugly command us to JUST DO IT!--just \n     spend upward of $130 for a pair of basketball shoes. Yet \n     Sadisah is, in fact, one of the people who is doing it--\n     making the actual shoes, that is, and earning paychecks such \n     as this one in a factory in Indonesia.\n       In the 1980s, Oregon-based Nike closed its last U.S. \n     footwear factory, in Saco, Maine, while establishing most of \n     its new factories in South Korea, where Sung Hwa Corp. is \n     based. Sung Hwa is among many independent producers Nike has \n     contracted with. Nike's actions were part of the broader \n     ``globalization'' trend that saw the United States lose \n     65,300 footwear jobs between 1982 and 1989 as shoe companies \n     sought non-unionized Third World workers who didn't require \n     the U.S. rubber-shoe industry average of $6.94 an hour. But \n     in the late 1980s, South Korean laborers gained the right to \n     form independent unions and to strike. Higher wages ate into \n     Nike's profits. The company shifted new factories to poorer \n     countries such as Indonesia, where labor rights are generally \n     ignored and wages are but one seventh of South Korea's. (The \n     Sung Hwa factory and others like it are located in Tangerang, \n     a squalid industrial boomtown just outside Jakarta.) Today, \n     to make 80 million pairs of shoes annually, Nike contracts \n     with several dozen factories globally, including six in \n     Indonesia. Others are in China, Malaysia, Thailand, and \n     Taiwan. By shifting factories to cheaper labor pools, Nike \n     has posted year after year of growth; in 1991 the company \n     grossed more than $3 billion in sales--$200 million of which \n     Nike attributes to Jordan's endorsement--and reported a new \n     profit of $287 million, its highest ever.\n       The words printed on the pay stub are in Bahasa Indonesia, \n     a language created by fusing Roman characters with a dominant \n     Malay dialect. The message, however, is bottom-line \n     capitalism. ``Per hari'' is the daily wage for seven and a \n     half hours of work, which in Sadisah's case is 2,100 \n     Indonesia rupiah--at the current rate of exchange, $1.03 per \n     day. That amount, which works out to just under 14 cents per \n     hour, is less than the Indonesian government's figure for \n     ``minimum physical need.'' A recent International Labor \n     Organization survey found that 88 percent of Indonesian women \n     working at Sadisah's wage rates are malnourished. And most \n     workers in this factory--over 80 percent--are women. With \n     seldom more than elementary-school educations, they are \n     generally in their teens or early twenties, and have come \n     from outlying agricultural areas in search of city jobs and a \n     better life. Sadisah's wages allow her to rent a shanty \n     without electricity or running water.\n       ``Pendapatan'' is the earnings column, and five lines below \n     the base pay figure for the month (50,400 rupiah) is one for \n     overtime. Sadisah and the other workers in this factory are \n     compelled to put in extra hours, both by economic necessity \n     and by employer fiat. Each production line of 115 workers is \n     expected to produce about 1,600 pairs of Nikes a day. \n     According to the column at left, next to ``OT (JAM),'' \n     Sadisah worked 63 hours of overtime during this pay period, \n     for which she received an extra 2 cents per hour. At this \n     factory, which makes mid-priced Nikes, each pair of shoes \n     requires .84 man-hours to produce; working on an assembly \n     line, Sadisah assembled the equivalent of 13.9 pairs every \n     day. The profit margin on each pair is enormous.\n       Here are Sadisah's net earnings for a month of labor. She \n     put in six days a week, ten and a half hours per day, for a \n     paycheck equivalent to $37.46--about half the retail price of \n     one pair of the sneakers she makes. Boosters of the global \n     economy and ``free markets'' claim that creating employment \n     around the world promotes free trade between industrializing \n     and developing countries. But how many Western products can \n     people in Indonesia buy when they can't earn enough to eat? \n     The answer can't be found in Nike's TV ads showing Michael \n     Jordan sailing above the earth for his reported multiyear \n     endorsement fee of $20 million--an amount, incidentally, that \n     at the pay rate shown here would take Sadisah 44,492 years to \n     earn.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Harper's magazine article shows the \nlabor cost to manufacturing. For a pair of Nike's made in Indonesia, \nthe cost of labor is 12 cents. They sell for $80 in the United States.\n  I have here also an article about a rug made in Morocco. The 13-year \nold girl that made it got $19.34. It sold in Macy's for $499. That is a \nlittle better than the Nike shoe example but not much.\n  I just want to read the last sentence of this article. It says \nquoting:\n\n       Someone in Morocco says we cannot compete with them in \n     India because in India they pay with a bowl of rice for two \n     rugs.\n\n  So that is really what is happening. Companies are bidding down the \nprice of labor. And as they do that, since we do not sanction slavery \nor prison labor, the next rung up on that ladder is child labor. That \nis what is happening around the world today. It is becoming a more and \nmore serious problem. It is not alleviated.\n  I am hopeful that we can do something in this country to address the \nchild labor issue. The only way we can do it is through our market \nsystem. We can say to those countries: If you are going to use child \nlabor you will not have access to our markets. That kind of provision \nis not in the GATT agreement.\n  I have had discussions with Ambassador Kantor and people within the \nadministration. They say they are going to work in the WTO preparatory \ncommittee this month to establish a work program on child labor, labor \nrights. They are going to work with us to get a bill enacted regarding \nimports made with child labor. They are going to work with us to deal \nmore effectively with child labor in the GSP, the Generalized System of \nPreferences, which will be up for reauthorization next year--covering \n140 countries, many of them abusing child labor. That is where we ought \nto also attack this issue of the child labor in other countries. And \nthey have promised to address child labor in future negotiations on \nregional trade agreements.\n  Mr. President, I do know that the U.S. must take the lead in reducing \nand ending exploitive and abusive child labor. Only we can do that \nbecause of our longstanding advocacy and support for human rights.\n  Mr. President, I also want to make a few remarks specifically on the \nbudget point of order that is expected to be raised against this \nlegislation later today.\n  In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a letter signed on July \n15, 1994 to the President, signed by 19 Members of the Senate, be made \npart of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1994.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: We write to ask that you join us in \n     opposing any effort to waive provisions of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act for the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade (GATT) implementing legislation and avoid the \n     requirement that such legislation be fully funded.\n       Some of us support GATT, others of us oppose the agreement, \n     and still others of us have yet to make a decision, but we \n     are united in our concern about the precedent waiving the \n     provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act could set, \n     undermining our ability to make further progress in lowering \n     the deficit now and in the future.\n       We are confronted on a regular basis with having to make \n     tough decisions on worthy programs because of our budget \n     rules, and rightly so. The federal budget deficit must be \n     brought down.\n       That GATT is significant is clear, but the importance of an \n     issue should not determine whether or not it should conform \n     with the budget rules we have set for ourselves. Indeed, the \n     true test of our resolve to bring the deficit under control \n     is our willingness to apply the budget rules to the important \n     issues.\n       We recognize your commitment to passing GATT implementing \n     legislation. Your support for making that legislation comply \n     with the budget rules will be all the more meaningful because \n     of that commitment, and we hope you will join us in this \n     effort to oppose any effort to dodge this responsibility.\n           Sincerely,\n         Russ Feingold, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Chuck Grassley, \n           Jesse Helms, Dirk Kempthorne, Dale Bumpers, Strom \n           Thurmond, Larry Pressler, Dave Durenberger, Lauch \n           Faircloth, Larry E. Craig, Trent Lott, Robert F. \n           Bennett, David Boren, John Warner, Hank Brown, Byron L. \n           Dorgan, Alfonse D'Amato, Herb Kohl.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the letter sent on July 15, 1994 to the \nPresident was signed by 19 Members of the Senate saying that they \noppose any GATT implementing bill requiring us to waive the budget \nrules to provide for deficit spending. I will read one sentence. It \nsays:\n\n       Indeed, the true test of our resolve to bring the deficit \n     under control is our willingness to apply the budget rules to \n     the important issues.\n\n  Now I understand that some of the people who signed the letter now \nsay they are going to vote to waive the budget rules.\n  I want to make it clear that I believe we ought not to be waiving the \nbudget rules to provide for the GATT agreement.\n  Therefore, I cannot and I will not vote to waive the budget rules to \nprovide for deficit spending to enact the GATT agreement.\n  There is nothing wrong with bringing this agreement up next year when \nit should be brought up, once the funding is worked out. I believe that \nif we want to, if the people really want to enact a GATT agreement, we \nwill find a way to raise the money, to cover the sum of $14.6 billion \nthat we will increase the deficit by in the present GATT implementing \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I just do not see how Senators can waive the Budget \nAct to provide for deficit spending, to provide for the enactment of \nGATT this year. It should be done next year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask that the time be allocated to each side accordingly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time \nnot be allocated to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll. The time will not be allocated to either \nside.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Am I correct in my understanding that unless otherwise \nagreed to, a quorum call is charged equally against all of those who \nnow hold remaining time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The quorum call is normally charged against \nthe Senator putting in the quorum call. If a quorum call is not put in, \nit will be charged equally. Of course, that can be changed by unanimous \nconsent as it was in this instance. In this instance there was a \nunanimous consent request asking that the quorum call not be charged to \neither side.\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time of the quorum call be charged half \nto each side and proportionally on the Democratic side equally among \nthe proponents and opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The time will be charged as requested in the unanimous-consent \nrequest by the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Half to us and half to them; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is correct.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will ask the Chair to inform me of how much time this \nside has remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The side has 1 hour and 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me yield to the distinguished Senator from Florida 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you. I appreciate my good friend and \ncolleague from Louisiana yielding me time to make a brief comment on \nthe matter which is before us.\n  Mr. President, I speak strongly in favor of the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade and hope that our colleagues will approve this \nhistoric agreement later today.\n  I would like to talk about this issue from two perspectives. First, \nthe perspective of my State of Florida, a major export State, and the \nbenefits that it will derive particularly in the area of agriculture \nand, second, to the importance of this to relations within the Western \nHemisphere.\n  Mr. President, yesterday there was a press conference held in the \nCapitol. ``Ag for GATT.'' Representatives of the major agricultural \norganizations in America stood together in support of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n  American farmers, as represented by those gathered yesterday, want to \ndo what they are best able in the world to do, which is to produce food \nand sell it at competitive prices around the globe.\n  GATT will help Florida farmers in three ways. First, it will increase \naccess to foreign markets. Second, it will reduce export subsidies. \nThird, it requires countries to base their sanitary rules on sound \nprinciples of science.\n  Florida's $6 billion agricultural industry will benefit under the \nGATT. Florida is expected to gain from the Clinton administration's \nrecent pledge of $600 million in additional funding for agricultural \nexport programs which are acceptable under the GATT.\n  As a result of GATT, U.S. agricultural exports are projected to reach \n$4.7 billion by the year 2000, an increase of $1.6 billion from today. \nAgricultural exports are expected to reach $8.7 billion by the year \n2005. The increased agricultural exports created by the GATT will \ncreate as many as 112,000 jobs--112,000 jobs--in the United States, Mr. \nPresident, by the year 2000, and 190,000 jobs by 2005.\n  As a specific example, GATT will greatly benefit Florida's citrus \nindustry. The European Union, Japan, Korea, Switzerland and Thailand \nhave all agreed to lower tariffs on various citrus products upon the \npassage of the GATT.\n  Mr. President, there have been considerable statements of concern \nmade relative to the World Trade Organization and some of the powers it \nwill have. I would concede that a consequence of the World Trade \nOrganization is that the United States is going to be less sovereign in \nterms of its ability to control trade. But the same statement is made \nabout every other country. They are giving up some of their sovereignty \nand we, Mr. President, have been the targets of some of the \nmisapplication of other nations' economic sovereignty.\n  As an example, it was not very many years ago that there were \nboatloads of Florida citrus products, particularly grapefruits, tied up \nat a particular Pacific nation's ports, unable to be unloaded because \nthat nation was holding that a particular form of treatment which these \ngrapefruits had received, a treatment which is applied on a worldwide \nbasis, did not meet their sanitary standards. There was no scientific \nbasis for that country's sanitary standards. It was an economic effort \nto exclude from that market Florida grapefruit products. The \nconsequence of that was that the boatload of grapefruit was lost, the \neconomic gain was denied to our farmers, and access to those quality \nproducts was denied the citizens of that nation.\n  It is that type of abuse that the World Trade Organization provisions \nare intended to rectify.\n  Mr. President, this agreement will also be especially important to \nFlorida and to our many other States which have substantial economic \ninterests in what happens within this hemisphere, because the GATT will \npromote better trade opportunities among the countries of North and \nSouth America and the Caribbean. The potential for economic prosperity \nwithin this hemisphere has never been fully realized, even though Latin \nAmerica is the only region of the world in which the United States \ncurrently enjoys a substantial trade surplus. Last year, we had about a \n$3.5 billion trade surplus with the Caribbean and South America. Prior \nto the break up of the Soviet Union, the United States looked upon \nLatin America and the Caribbean primarily as a security concern rather \nthan an area of economic opportunity. Now that focus is changing.\n  Last year, we passed the North American Free Trade Agreement. That is \nnot a book, but rather a chapter in a much larger book of expanding \neconomic relations within the Western Hemisphere. Next week, in Miami, \nthe summit of the Americas will meet, the first time in over a quarter \nof a century that the heads of Government of all the Nations that are \ndemocratically ruled in this hemisphere will meet together. A principal \ntopic of that meeting, Mr. President, will be economic expansion and \nthe particular role which expanded trade will have in increasing the \neconomic opportunities of all the people within this hemisphere.\n  The United States prospects for trade with the Caribbean and Latin \nAmerica are good today, and with the passage of GATT will be better \ntomorrow.\n  Latin America has a need for the technologically advanced products \nthat the United States produces. In Mexico, for example, there are 7.3 \ntelephone lines per 100 people. That compares to the United States \nwhich has 56.2 telephone lines per 100 people. We have a tremendous \nopportunity to meet those types of needs which not only will utilize \nU.S.-produced products, but will also help build a stronger economic \ninfrastructure for our neighbors.\n  The fastest growing segment of U.S. trade with the Caribbean and \nLatin America has been in precision equipment, exactly the type of \nequipment which is necessary in order to enhance the economy of that \nregion, while also producing jobs and opportunities in the United \nStates. This meeting of an identifiable need has already resulted in a \nsubstantial increase in trade between the United States and the \nCaribbean and Latin America.\n  This year, Latin America, including Mexico, will buy 18 percent of \nU.S. merchandise exports. And, according to U.S. Trade Representative, \nAmbassador Mickey Kantor, Latin America will purchase 25 percent--25 \npercent--of all U.S. exports, totaling $232 billion by the year 2010.\n  Mr. President, within 15 years Latin America and the Caribbean will \nhave a greater share of U.S. export than will Europe and Japan \ncombined. That is the scale of the opportunity that is available to the \nUnited States through an invigorated economy in Latin America and the \nCaribbean and our ability to sell effectively into those stronger \neconomies. The United States direct investment in Latin America and the \nCaribbean has tripled since 1986 and now accounts for 13 percent of all \nU.S. investment abroad. Latin America is the second-fastest-growing \neconomic region in the world with a projected growth of an average of 5 \nto 6 percent a year over the next 10 years. Sales to Latin America \nincreased by $48 billion between 1958 and 1993. This growth created \n900,000 new jobs in the United States.\n  As Latin America becomes more prosperous economically, the demand for \nU.S. consumer goods will grow. The growing relationship between the \nUnited States and Latin America and the Caribbean can be reciprocal. \nWhile the United States responds to demands for products in Latin \nAmerica and the Caribbean, that same region can assist in providing us \nwith much needed natural resources.\n  Latin American countries have recognized an opportunity for improved \ntrade with the United States and have begun to dismantle barriers to \ntrade and foreign investment. Latin American countries have lowered \ntheir tariffs on U.S. goods from an average of 56 percent just 9 years \nago, to 15 percent last year. There is still room for improvement.\n  As tariffs remain higher in Latin America than in most developed \nnations, the GATT will further Latin American Governments' efforts to \nderegulate sectors of their economy, reduce subsidies in price \ncontrols, private state enterprises, establish antitrust and \nintellectual property regimes and institute democratic political \nreforms.\n  Mr. President, at this point I would like to indicate that it was \nonly a matter of a few years ago that you could count on the fingers of \nyour hand the number of democratic regimes in Latin America and the \nCaribbean. Today every nation in the Latin American and Caribbean \nregion is a democracy, except for Cuba.\n  So, Mr. President, I say in summary that Latin America and the \nCaribbean are a significant but underappreciated sector for U.S. \neconomic growth. The GATT will increase Latin America's economic \nprosperity and thus contribute to the economic prosperity of the United \nStates and jobs for Americans.\n  I urge the passage of the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Florida has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. President, the global economy is here and offers \ntremendous opportunities for us.\n  I was encouraged to find at the two international trade conferences I \nheld in Maine this year that there were literally hundreds of Maine \nbusinessmen and women who already are succeeding in the world economy. \nMost of these businesses are small and their export efforts often go \nunnoticed, but they are out there. I think it is important to help \nthese small businesses to take full advantage of export opportunities. \nSmall businesses simply do not have the resources to secure foreign \nsales on their own. The Federal Government, through its export \nassistance programs, has been helping and must continue to do so.\n  At issue today is the largest trade agreement in the history of the \nworld. It is not something that can be approached lightly. It is \ncomplex and voluminous. Many legitimate questions have been raised.\n  In particular, as was just expressed by my colleague from Florida, \nthere is great concern that the World Trade Organization could \nundermine U.S. sovereignty. And that allegation must be taken very \nseriously. Undoubtedly, the WTO will have more power than the existing \nGATT accord, and people understandably are concerned about the WTO's \npower. However, after careful consideration, I am not convinced that \nthe WTO poses a threat to U.S. laws.\n  The only laws that could be challenged under the WTO are unfair and \nillegal trade barriers. The United States has nothing to fear under the \nWTO because it is other countries, not the United States, that have a \nrecord of enacting trade barriers thinly disguised as health or public \nsafety laws. For instance, Japan has continually justified its ban on \nthe United States rice imports on the grounds that our rice poses a \nthreat to the health of Japanese population. Of course, this is a \nludicrous argument. There is no evidence to support this outrageous \nclaim, and the WTO would expose Japan's law for what it is--trade \nbarrier masquerading as a health law.\n  Moreover, it is important to note that the WTO does not have the \nauthority to strike down U.S. laws, even if they are found to violate \ntrade law. The WTO does not have powers like the U.S. Supreme Court. \nWhen the Supreme Court finds that a law violates the Constitution, that \nlaw is automatically declared void. The WTO, on the other hand, has no \nsuch power. The most severe action the WTO could take would be to \nimpose fines on countries that refuse to take down their trade \nbarriers. Again, since the United States is already the most open \nmarket in the world, we have little to fear from the WTO and much to \ngain if it can reduce trade barriers elsewhere in the world.\n  Finally, the United States reserves the right to withdraw from the \nWTO at any time after providing 6 months notice. And Congress has the \nability to vote once every 5 years as to whether or not we should \nremain in the WTO.\n  I think, like others who have stood on the floor today and yesterday \nto express their reservations, that while there are areas certainly \nwhere the GATT could be improved, on balance, I think the agreement is \nin best long-term interests of American workers. Export-related jobs on \naverage pay 17 percent more than other jobs. Therefore, we must \nencourage and take advantage of our export opportunities.\n  The principle goals of GATT are to open foreign markets to American \ngoods and to lower tariffs by one-third.\n  In a very important way, the GATT agreement is really about shifting \npower from governments to individuals. By reducing tariffs, money that \nwould have been coming to Washington will stay in the pockets of \nconsumers. Furthermore, by reducing trade barriers, individuals--rather \nthan governments--will decide where they buy their products from and \nwhere they sell them. The cornerstone of free trade policy is that \nindividuals--not governments--should make consumer choices. I believe \nthe GATT agreement makes significant progress in this regard.\n  In embracing GATT and the global economy, however, we must make help \nthose for whom the new economy poses more of a challenge than an \nopportunity. Federal job training programs and other outreach efforts \nare essential to help those in need. The debate over free trade must \nnever focus solely on the benefits to the Nation as a whole. We must \nalso focus on those who are adversely affected by trade, because if \ntrade policies do not in the long term benefit all Americans, there \nwill be a tremendous backlash against efforts like GATT in the future.\n  So, Mr. President, I am supporting GATT today because I believe it \nwill benefit American families over the long term, but I also intend to \nassure that we do not forget those who, as the result of freer trade \npolicies, may be adversely affected.\n  Let me just conclude by stating that I recently returned from a trip \nto Southeast Asia. To my colleagues, let me say: We are succeeding. We \nare penetrating markets. Barriers are coming down. Products made in \nMaine and elsewhere are now penetrating those markets that previously \nhad been barred to United States and Maine-made products. So we are \ncompeting effectively. We are the most efficient, the most productive \nNation in the world.\n  It seems to me if we want to continue to promote prosperity on a \nworldwide basis, from which we can only benefit, this is an agreement \nthat we should support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I thank my good friend from Maine very, very much. I am \nmust confess when I talked with him yesterday I had some nervous \ntrepidations, but I am delighted with his statement today. I thank him \nvery much.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and request we charge the time half \nto the Republican side and half to the Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who \nyields time? From whose time does the Senator from Indiana seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. LUGAR. I am a proponent of the bill, so I ask the manager who is \nmanaging that side to yield me time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Indiana is \nyielded time from that of the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, there should be no doubt about the proper \ncourse of action for the Senate today: We should approve the Uruguay \nround trade agreements by an overwhelming margin. At a time when many \npeople around the world are wondering aloud about the future of U.S. \ninternational leadership, we have today an opportunity--and an \nobligation--to reaffirm our leading role.\n  The Uruguay round will allow the United States to increase our \nexports by as much as $150 billion a year by 2004. It will boost \neconomies worldwide, accelerating growth in both developed and \ndeveloping economies.\n  Among the most significant achievements of the Uruguay round is the \nagreement on agriculture reached after 7 years of arduous negotiation. \nAs incoming chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, I would like to point out to my colleagues that this \nagreement subjects agricultural trade to rules and disciplines which \nhave been the norm for industrial products over many decades, but have \nbeen applied haphazardly, if at all, to trade in agricultural \ncommodities.\n  The Uruguay round will require export subsidies to be cut by 36 \npercent in budget terms, and by 21 percent in terms of subsidized \ntonnage. This provision helps the United States because for most \nheavily subsidized commodities, we can export at a competitive price \nbut our European rivals--the major practitioners of export subsidies--\ncannot.\n  The round will also require that import quotas be turned into \nequivalent tariffs. The resulting tariff levels--and indeed all other \nagricultural tariffs--must be reduced an average of 36 percent, with \neach individual tariff cut no less than 15 percent.\n  Finally, the round also recognizes for the first time the trade-\ndistorting potential of domestic farm subsidies, and provides new \ndisciplines in this area. At the same time, countries will receive \ncredit for cuts they have already made; in the United States, having \nindeed made some cuts, we will not be compelled by GATT to make more.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture projects a rise of up to $4.7 \nbillion in exports by 2000, along with a gain of 112,000 new jobs and \nan increase of $1 billion in farm income. USDA's projections for the \nfollowing 5 years are even more dramatic.\n  Mainstream American agriculture agrees. My colleagues have probably \nreceived a letter of support for the Uruguay round signed by an \nunusually large and diverse agricultural coalition: about 300 different \ncompanies, grower association, and other groups.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter and its \nsignatories be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  AG for GATT,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 28, 1994.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: Very soon you will vote on the GATT \n     implementing bill, one of the most important pieces of \n     economic legislation since the end of World War II. Passage \n     of the bill will mean more U.S. exports, more American jobs, \n     lower taxes and a real stimulus to our economy. Defeat of \n     this bill would be nothing short of a victory for \n     protectionism both here and abroad.\n       The nearly 300 farm groups, associations and agricultural \n     businesses that make up the Ag for GATT coalition urge you, \n     in the strongest terms, to vote for the GATT and for a better \n     future for American farmers, ranchers and their allied \n     enterprises. With record or near record production of nearly \n     all farm products this year, we need the benefits that GATT \n     will bring to our sector and we need them now, not at some \n     unspecified time in the future.\n       Agriculture will benefit from expanded export markets, \n     lowered export subsidies and an improved ability to challenge \n     unfair foreign trade barriers. It is estimated that the GATT \n     agreement will increase U.S. farm exports by anywhere from $5 \n     billion to $14 billion per year by the end of the transition \n     period. It will also increase net farm income by over $1 \n     billion and create over 100,000 new jobs throughout the food \n     chain. Quite simply, without the GATT agreement, more farmers \n     will be forced to leave farming and government expenditures \n     in agriculture will rise.\n       The direct benefits to agriculture have been well-\n     documented. However, there are two other issues in the GATT \n     debate that we would like to address because they have \n     received a great deal of attention and because they have \n     agricultural implications.\n       The World Trade Organization and U.S. Sovereignty--American \n     agriculture has suffered under exiting weak and often \n     ineffectual GATT dispute settlement rules. We support the \n     improved enforcement of international trade commitments that \n     will come with the WTO. We would not support the agreement if \n     it weakened U.S. sovereignty and we are satisfied that it \n     does not.\n       The bill itself ensures that U.S. laws and regulations are \n     totally protected. Section 102 reads in part:\n       Relationship of Agreements to United States Law.\n       United States Law to Prevail in Conflict. No provision of \n     any of the Uruguay Round Agreements, nor the application of \n     any such provision to any person or circumstance, that is \n     inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have \n     effect.\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to amend or modify \n     any law of the United States, including any law pertaining to \n     the protection of human, animal, plant life or health, the \n     protection of the environment, or worker safety, or to limit \n     any authority conferred under any law of the United States . \n     . .\n       The Budget Issue--A vote against the budget waiver is a \n     vote against the GATT. If the budget waiver is rejected, \n     there will be no vote on GATT and all of the benefits to \n     agriculture from the GATT agreement will be lost.\n       It is essential to recognize that a vote for the waiver is \n     not a vote to increase the budget deficit. The GATT will \n     result in increased revenues to local, state and federal \n     treasuries, by stimulating economic growth and creating jobs. \n     In fact, rejecting the GATT could be a budget buster. In \n     agriculture alone there are a number of budgetary impacts \n     that are receiving little, if any, attention. For example, \n     without the new markets to be opened by the GATT agreement, \n     U.S. surplus farm production will cost the government more in \n     storage costs, higher deficiency payments and larger export \n     subsidies to continue the ag subsidy battle with the European \n     Union. These are just a few examples of how rejecting the \n     GATT could hurt, not help, efforts to reduce the budget \n     deficit.\n       The following organizations therefore, urge you to vote for \n     the budget waiver and for the GATT implementing bill, to help \n     American agriculture compete in world markets and in the \n     years to come.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      AG for GATT.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         AG for GATT Coalition\n\n\n                         NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS\n\n

I thank the Chair. Mr. President, these groups state in \ntheir letter that Congressional approval of the Uruguay round ``is \nessential if U.S. agriculture is to remain a growth industry.'' They \nhave put their finger on the key benefit of the round for U.S. farmers \nand agribusinesses: It will safeguard our future. That is because it \nwill allow the United States agriculture and food industry to use its \nmany comparative advantages: The ability to deliver products in large \nvolumes; the ability to deliver commodities consistently year-round; \ncutting-edge plant and animal technology and research; the franchise \nvalue of many American fast-food firms; U.S. advantages in food \npackaging, manufacturing and marketing. At the same time, the Uruguay \nround will bring disciplines in an area where the United States does \nnot have a comparative advantage: subsidies. Here, other countries seem \nmore willing to transfer wealth from their national treasuries and \ntheir consumers to their farm sectors. The lesson for the United States \nis not to copy them, but to work for change in their policies so that \nour own market-based advantages will have a chance to work. The new \nGATT accords compel such changes and afford us just such an \nopportunity.\n  For my State of Indiana, the Uruguay round offers many benefits \nbeyond agriculture. The agreement will reduce tariffs to zero or very \nlow levels for important industries like steel, farm equipment and \nchemicals--basic American industries. It will afford new protection for \nthe intellectual property of pharmaceutical companies, medical device \nmakers and other firms in those allied industries. For insurance \nproviders and other services within GATT disciplines for the first \ntime, although more work remains to be done here. All in all, the \nagreement promises to be in the economic interest of Hoosier \nbusinesses, consumers, workers and farmers.\n  I do want to express my concern about some of the budget offsets \nincluded by the administration in this bill. These provisions are not \nnecessarily bad policy in every case, but they now come before the \nSenate without any opportunity for amendment, for deletion, or even for \nvery much debate.\n  As one Senator, I wish we could have a more thorough debate on the \nmerits of several of these revenue items: not only the ``pioneer \npreference'' and savings bond provisions that have been mentioned often \nin this debate and about which many of my colleagues have expressed \nconcern, but the changes in pension law as well, which will have \nsignificant effects on some retirees.\n\n  On some of these topics, Senator Dole has obtained useful assurances, \nbut I am more concerned about the state of the fast-track process \ngenerally. I believe this legislation illustrates that over the years, \nthe fast-track privilege has come to be seen as a vehicle for side \ndeals, special-interest accommodations and provisions of questionable \nmerit--none of which can be changed once included in the implementing \nlegislation, unless a Senator is prepared to defeat the entire \nagreement, which I certainly am not.\n  We will continue to need fast-track authority for future trade \nagreements, but our recent experience suggests we should make some \nchanges when we renew this authority next year. First, we should set \nout clear negotiating objectives that must be met before any agreement \ncan be submitted under the fast-track privilege.\n  Second, we should allow amendments to provisions of fast-track \nlegislation that are included only to offset apparent budget costs of \nthe trade agreement. In this way, Senators would be able to change \nrevenue provisions they did not favor, or even delete them altogether. \nSince these provisions are typically unrelated to the substance of the \ntrade agreement itself, there seems to me no compelling argument to \ngive them absolute insulation against amendment. However, the total \ntime for debate and amendment on a bill under fast-track procedures \nshould continue to be limited.\n  Third and finally, the President should be allowed to include in \nfast-track legislation only those provisions that are absolutely \nnecessary to implement the agreement. Current law allows provisions \nthat are ``necessary and appropriate,'' and in the real world the \nlatter word constitutes an enormous loophole of which both the \nPresident and the Congress have taken full advantage.\n  These reforms will help build public confidence in our trade policy \nby opening up the fast-track process and making it exceedingly \ndifficult to add special-interest provisions. It is essentially these \naspects of the current process that have drawn the most criticism from \nmembers of the public. Significantly, much of the opposition to the \nUruguay round has focused not the specifics of the agreement, where the \nUnited States clearly stands to gain, but on the allegedly closed and \ncorrupt nature of the congressional fast-track process. Opponents have \nexaggerated much, but where they make legitimate points, we should not \nbe afraid to make changes.\n  Again, I hope to work with my colleagues, especially those who serve \non the Finance Committee, to introduce or join in the introduction of \nlegislation incorporating the principles I have outlined. I welcome the \nreaction of my colleagues and the public to the changes I have \nsuggested.\n  Whatever the shortcomings of the fast-track process, they do not \noutweigh the manifest benefits of the Uruguay round for our economy. To \nraise questions about some aspects of this agreement is understandable; \nto reject it would be unthinkable. We should vote for it without \nhesitation, for it is a good agreement for the United States as we \nenter a new century in which our Nation must continue to lead.\n  I will add, Mr. President, that I am heartened by reports that \npassage of this agreement today will lead to conversations involving \nthe President of the United States, President Clinton, and President \nFrei of Chile. Chile, for a long time, has looked forward to either a \nfree trade agreement with the United States or accession to the NAFTA \ntreaty or to some other way in which the free trade principles espoused \nin both of our countries might be enhanced promptly. I am hopeful that \nstimulus and momentum will continue promptly.\n  I commend President Clinton for that intent and, likewise, the \npatience of the Chileans who have waited a long time. I know the \noccupant of the Chair, who has been involved in many such \nconversations, will undoubtedly welcome that momentum also of a \nconference that will occur soon in his great State.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask that the quorum call might be \ndeferred and I can go forward with my remarks. I thank my friend from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Uruguay round agreements of \nthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT. This debate, much \nlike the NAFTA debate, has been riddled with myth and misinformation. I \nhave heard thoughtful arguments against GATT-- indeed I have--as well \nas for it. And I have also heard some alarms which seem to verge nearly \non the hysterical. One would think that some of us are here preparing \nto bargain away our national sovereignty instead of trying to negotiate \naway foreign trade barriers. But sadly, that is the level of some \ndiscourse.\n  I admire the people on both sides of this issue. There is no one who \nspeaks with more passion than my friend from South Carolina, Senator \nHollings. His position is so clear to us. And the wisdom of our ranking \nmember on the Finance Committee, Senator Packwood, has given necessary \nbalance to the debate. This has been a very good debate.\n  The fine people of my State, like those of any State, are deeply \nworried about their jobs and about the economic future facing them and \ntheir children. There are, of course, no simple prescriptions available \nto create prosperity. One thing is very clear: Jobs are not destroyed \nby trade; jobs are created by trade. And the more plentiful and fair \nand open that trade is, the more jobs are created here at home.\n  We do not--I repeat, not--produce jobs at home by refusing to \nparticipate in the difficult work of dismantling foreign trade \nbarriers. I cannot stress strongly enough that I would never support \nany piece of legislation that would adversely affect the people and the \neconomy of Wyoming. The GATT agreement is good for the economy, it is \ngood for the people of Wyoming, it is good for the people of America. I \nwould not say that it, or its financing mechanism, is perfect, but it \nis far, far preferable to the fallout and lost opportunities that would \ncome from rejecting it.\n  The United States took a responsible step last year when it approved \nthe North American Free-Trade Agreement. That agreement opened the door \nto greater exports to our biggest and best trading partners, Canada and \nMexico. Exports to these NAFTA partners last year alone accounted for \nalmost two-thirds of our export growth. The exports to Canada and \nMexico surpassed exports to Asia and even Europe, and the benefits of \nthis expanded trade are now a matter of record. They are on the record. \nThe GATT agreement gives us the opportunity to build on that success \nand extend those principles now around the world.\n  I want to commend Mickey Kantor. Ambassador Kantor has been superb. \nHe has done a tremendous job. I admire his work. And he has always been \naccessible and receptive to things I have shared with him about issues \nin Wyoming that have to do with grain and agricultural products. The \nU.S. Trade Representative calls the Uruguay round a $750 billion global \ntax cut. That is a direct reference to the tariffs that consumers \naround the world will no longer have to pay.\n  Indeed, it is estimated that this trade agreement will be responsible \nfor a gain in global income of more than $500 billion by the year 2005. \nThis is an important decision for our foreign policy, as well as for \nour domestic economic interests. What sort of a message would the \nrejection of GATT convey to the world? I believe the answer is very \nclear. If we choose to reject GATT, then Germany, France, Japan, China, \nand the rest of Asia will go right back to their old protectionist \nways, ways that kept U.S. exporters out of their markets. Our export \nopportunities will evaporate before our eyes. We will face the same old \nobstacles to trade as we have in the past.\n  We should well remember and recall the stated belief by the Japanese \nthat only Japanese downhill skis worked on Japanese snow. I remember \nthat one. We in Wyoming knew that not to be the case, especially with \nWyoming powder. But how about that one? We do not want to go back to \nthat. Japan is one of our finest allies, and one of our finest trading \npartners. We do not want to hear any more things like that.\n  During the 7 years that the GATT was negotiated I had the opportunity \nto receive the opinions of more than several hundred constituents. My \nconstituents are not fainthearted. They discussed GATT. Some of the \ndiscussion came from individuals who had been fed some fallacious \ninformation sent to them by individuals with a big stake in defeating \nGATT who had been led to fear for their own job security if GATT is \npassed. I will make a brief comment on those. But first, for the most \npart, I have heard in great detail about the benefits GATT would \nprovide to my State.\n  Let me just say that all of us are guided often by provincial energy. \nLet me say that I represent a State of 473,000 human beings. My good \ncolleague to my immediate left, Senator Patrick Daniel Moynihan, \nrepresents a State of millions of human beings. I want to commend the \nsenior Senator from New York for the work he has done on this issue. He \nhas been intrepid, dedicated, and completely forward in his support of \nit. His energies, I hope, will be met with success this evening.\n  But in this State of 473,000 people in 93,000 square miles, if we do \nnot have the ability to export, we will perish. We are the largest \nproducer of trona, which is soda ash, which is in every piece of glass. \nOne-third of the world's trona comes from southwest Wyoming. And this \nwill reduce tariff barriers in Belgium and France on soda ash which \nwill be of tremendous longterm benefit until the end of the reserves in \nthat part of Wyoming. This is the greatest benefit to an entire \nquadrant of my State that you could ever have had. That is what it will \ndo with the big boys in Brussels and France and the soda ash producers, \ncompletely reducing those tariffs.\n  We are the largest producer of coal in the United States, bigger than \nWest Virginia, bigger than Kentucky, bigger than Pennsylvania. This \nwill help. We produce pork, beef, sugar beets, lamb, and wool. These \nare things that Wyoming emphasizes; also, chemical and MTBE production. \nThese are commodities and goods that GATT will benefit.\n  So our whole economy is based on trade. That means fair trade. It \nmeans the elimination of trade barriers that will continue to exist if \nGATT is defeated.\n  We trade in all of these things, including timber, and a great array \nof manufactured goods. We are a State rich, rich indeed, in raw \nmaterials that amount to far more than whatever we could consume. \nWithout access, without these openings, we would dry up and disappear. \nThis is our export opportunity. This is our future. This is the way we \nkeep our young people in Wyoming to work, and live and play there.\n  I believe GATT has made some tremendous advancements toward the \nobjective of free and fair trade. Certainly there are key elements that \nare somewhat disturbing. But I think we have had those answered.\n  The key is tariffs, reduction in foreign tariffs, either fully \neliminated or significantly cut on approximately 85 percent of world \ntrade including construction, agricultural equipment, even beer--which \nis a very lucrative world market I might add.\n  The General Agreement on Trade and Services, which is GATS, will \nassist in opening export markets and ensuring fair foreign investment \nrules for American service companies and professional, business, \ncommunications, financial, health, tourism, education, environmental \nfields, industries which employ millions of Americans.\n  Agriculture will be included for the first time in a GATT agreement. \nHere is the one issue that has messed up international trade for \ndecades. Agricultural support systems and the burning of commodities on \nthe Champs-Elysees in Paris, getting rid of potatoes here, grain here. \nThat is absurd.\n  Finally, we deal with that. Finally we get to that. We increase these \ntrade opportunities. We are going to reduce agricultural export \nsubsidies by a total of 36 percent, which is $8 billion, over half of \nwhich is accounted for by the European unit.\n  Member nations are going to cut $35 billion in support for \ndomestically consumed agricultural products; 18 percent reduction. But \nit is going to benefit wheat, barley, beef, pork, sugar. And I will \nhave to tell my constituents because somebody has them all worked up \nand giving them erroneous information. I will be very glad to help \neducate them and tell them what we are doing here, and that it is not \nabout the loss of sovereignty. It is not about the World Trade \nOrganization. I wish they had picked a different name for it. It seems \nto have connotations that led to most sinister references. There is a \ngross misunderstanding about that. Clarifying these misconceptions is \nvery important. And I shall do that because they will wonder why I am \nvoting and so strongly helping to pass GATT.\n\n  The Uruguay round would also extend significant protection to \nAmerican producers, in the realm of intellectual property. The GATT \nwould finally offer some substantial protection for U.S. companies that \nmanufacture pharmaceutical drugs, computer programs and games, \nsemiconductor chips, books, films, and compact music disks. Not only \nwould it provide for recognition of U.S. patents, copyrights and \ntrademarks abroad, but it also requires foreign governments to provide \neffective enforcement of them. This is an area of unquestionable \nimportance for U.S. exporters. Protections in this area are absolutely \ncritical for preserving the global integrity of those industries.\n  One issue on which many people have expressed concern is the \nestablishment of the World Trade Organization [WTO]. I believe there is \na gross misunderstanding about that and I would like to try to clarify \nsome of the misconceptions as I mentioned earlier, since the formation \nof the GATT in 1948, member nations have renegotiated the global trade \nrules approximately every 5 years. As a result of the Uruguay round, \nthe rules have been substantially expanded and extended to most trading \nnations on an equivalent basis.\n  Because of this expansion, it has become necessary to formally \nreorganize the current GATT officiating body. The WTO would simply \nreplace that current body. The WTO will provide the world with \nprocedures for negotiating additional reductions of trade barriers and \nfor the prompt resolution of trade disputes between countries.\n  I strongly believe that no trade agreement, whatever its economic \nbenefits, should be approved if it infringes upon State or Federal \nsovereignty. But provisions in the GATT agreement clearly state that \nU.S. law prevails in every situation under the WTO. There are \nsignificant safeguards in the implementing legislation--including an \noutright statement that gives primacy to U.S. laws--to ensure that our \nsovereignty is fully protected.\n  But let me just read one section of the legislation because we are \ntalking about sovereignty. Here it is, section 102(A)(1) of that \nlegislation which clearly States this:\n\n       No provision of any of the Uruguay round agreements, nor \n     the application of any such provision to any person or \n     circumstances, that is inconsistent with any law of the \n     United States shall have effect.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Period.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I appreciate the emphasis from my colleague from New \nYork, ``period.'' There it is. That is it. You cannot say it. It could \nhave been a little better syntax, I think. But, nevertheless, in its \njumbled version it says exactly what people have been concerned about, \nand I think that is very important.\n\n  I believe that this provision fully recognizes the fact that the \npower to create and abolish U.S. law is ultimately reserved to Congress \nand the State legislatures. That power is derived directly from the \nU.S. Constitution and I can assure my listeners that there is no method \nby which those legislative duties will be relinquished to some \ninternational trade court in Switzerland. Suggestions to the contrary \nreveal only how cynical many have become about the patriotism and good \nfaith of those in government, particularly those who negotiated the \nagreement.\n  Second, the implementing legislation sets up procedures by which \nCongress will maintain oversight of WTO actions as they relate to the \nUnited States. It also ensures that the administration will always \ncoordinate with Congress in its responses to upcoming WTO voting \nissues. That is a very important element which will ensure that \nCongress--and the public's--voice with regard to U.S. positions on \ninternational trade is clearly heard. All briefs and decisions made by \nthe WTO and dispute settlement panels will be available to public \ninspection. Secret tribunals will not exist nor are they authorized \nunder the WTO.\n  Furthermore, in the event that Congress becomes dissatisfied with WTO \ndecisions at any time, the bill sets up a special, expedited procedure \nby which we can decide every 5 years whether or not to revoke the \nagreements. There is also a safety hatch that allows us to withdraw at \nanytime with six months notice.\n  Finally, Senator Dole has negotiated an additional safeguard in the \nform of an agreement with the President to establish a WTO Dispute \nSettlement Review Commission. The Commission would consist of five \njudges appointed by the President and the leadership of both Houses. \nThe Commission will review all final WTO dispute settlement reports \nwhere the report rules against the United States. If the judges \ndetermine on three occasions that the WTO exceeded its authority or \ndiminished the rights of the United States, any member of either House \ncould introduce a resolution to disapprove U.S. participation in the \nWTO. Three strikes and we're out of the WTO.\n  In order to pass GATT, the Senate is required to waive the Budget \nAct. The budget waiver is required even though most experts agree that \nthe benefits of GATT greatly surpass any losses which would result from \nreduced tariffs. Our own budget rules here in the Senate require strict \ndeficit neutrality over a course of 10 years as ``scored'' by static \nscoring models--models which do not account for changes in behavior \nwhich may result from the change in law.\n  The $11.7 billion tax cut from the GATT legislation for the first 5 \nyears is paid for with $11.1 billion of deficit reduction measures and \n$600 million of previously enacted budgetary savings. Moreover, because \nthe GATT financing package is mostly outlay reductions, not revenue \nincreases, the net effect of the package is to provide for a \nsubstantial net tax cut for Americans.\n  Nonetheless, GATT still requires a waiver of the Congressional Budget \nAct. A failure to approve the budget waiver for GATT will mean that the \nbill is dead. A vote against the budget waiver is a vote against the \nGATT.\n  This morning we were at the White House and I wanted to conclude with \nwhat our leader, George Mitchell, said, if I may paraphrase correctly. \nHe said something like this: I thought it was devastatingly \nappropriate. He said: I think everyone will admit that already the \nUnited States of America is the most open trading country in the world. \nThat is a given. We have less restrictions, less tariffs, less games, \nless punishment, less all the things that become tricky in this, and \ncountervailing duties, and so on.\n  So if we are already the most open trading country on the Earth, and \nGATT is about opening trade, how can we miss? We cannot miss. America \ncannot miss on this. If we are already the most open country on Earth \nand the sole purpose of this legislation is to open trade around the \nworld, that is good for America and good for Wyoming. It is plain and \nsimple. The agreement will open up important foreign markets for \nWyoming, and it will reduce hideous tariffs around the world. We have a \nchoice to chart a course forward, a fairer and more profitable choice.\n  I am proud to make that choice and to support this historic \nagreement.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I congratulate the distinguished Republican whip \nfor his thoughtful, analytic, factual statement. If we could hear what \nhe has said and extend it to our own States, as is easily done, the \ncase has been made. I thank him for his graciousness and his courtesy, \nwhich is unfailing, and the skilled cowboy knows his international \ntrade.\n  Now I have the pleasure to yield 10 minutes to my friend and neighbor \nfrom Massachusetts, the Honorable John Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have been listening to a number of my colleagues who \npaint a very grim picture of diminishing U.S. sovereignty; the \nweakening of environmental laws; and the withering away of the U.S. \nmanufacturing base that would result if we pass this bill.\n  Well, Mr. President, I think those fears, as a number of my \ncolleagues have articulated, are misplaced. This agreement will not do \nany of these things.\n  Indeed, with respect to the sovereignty issue, it is interesting to \nnote that a cross-section of American institutions--the American Bar \nAssociation, the Consumers Union, and the Heritage Foundation, which I \nthink rarely agree on anything--all agree that the Uruguay round will \nnot harm the sovereignty of this Nation one iota. The ABA stated, ``In \nparticular, the Uruguay round dispute settlement provisions leave \nUnited States domestic legal powers totally intact.''\n  In point of fact, if the WTO did begin to hand down a number of \ndecisions adverse to the United States, we would have the ability to \nwithdraw from this agreement--by merely providing 6 months' notice.\n  A second concern is the impact this agreement will have on the \nenvironment, but there, too, the GATT recognizes specifically the right \nof each country to protect human, animal, and plant life; and the \nhealth, the environment and consumers. It allows each country to set a \nlevel of protection for health, and the environment and consumers that \nthe particular government deems appropriate.\n  The third concern, and the most important, is that this agreement \nwill reduce jobs. However, by forcing other countries to play by the \nsame rules of fair play that the United States has always abided by, \nthe agreement will increase--by 300,000 to 700,000 over 10 years. \nMoreover, annual U.S. income will increase $100 to $200 billion over \nthe same period.\n  We are 4 percent of the world's population; 96 percent of the world's \npopulation is where 90 percent of the development and growth will take \nplace over the course of the next years. If we do not pass this \nagreement, we deny ourselves access to that market and we invite our \nmost voracious competitors--the French, Germans, Japanese, Taiwanese, \nSingaporese, and a host of others--to rush in where we fear to tread.\n  In fact, not only will the passage of the Uruguay round not threaten \nour sovereignty nor our prosperity, but on the contrary, I believe that \nfailure to pass it would in fact subject us to these very fears--by \nforcing us to confront the inevitable continued globalization of the \nworld's economy, unregulated by a set of multilateral rules.\n  Why do so many people oppose this agreement then? I suppose it is \nbecause so many do not want to acknowledge that continued globalization \nof the world economy that we have witnessed is inevitable. It is going \nto continue whether we like it or not, and whether we pass the Uruguay \nround implementing legislation or not. We cannot turn back the clock.\n  In many ways it is good that we cannot. The jobs created by exports \ntraditionally pay 17 percent higher than the U.S. average. Eleven \nmillion people in the United States owe their jobs to exports--one-\nquarter of our workforce. This number is expected to increase to one-\nthird of our work force in the next 10 years.\n  This agreement is an opportunity for us to make this change work for \nAmerican workers--by increasing U.S. exports.\n  I was just in India, where I met with the Finance Minister, the \nMinister of Telecommunications, and the Foreign Minister. I gave each \nof them a Polaroid camera made in Massachusetts, with two packets of \nfilm. I said, ``When you finish these packets of film, you will not--\nunless a friend brings you more--be able to buy more in India because \nthey are kept out by tariffs of 50 percent. Despite the fact that no \nIndian company manufactures these cameras --and therefore there is no \ndomestic industry asking for protection--you maintain one of the \nhighest tariffs on film in the world.''\n  I hope that the Government of India will decide to reduce this tariff \nin the next several months.\n  Under GATT, similar tariffs would be reduced, creating enormous \nopportunities for companies like Polaroid, and their employees.\n  That, Mr. President, means jobs for Americans. In Fall River, MA, \nthere is a company called Quaker Fabrics. They have increased their \ncapacity to make textiles in America and sell them abroad. Of the 500 \npeople they have Hired over the last few years, 300 of them are \ndirectly related to the increase in export capacity. They support GATT.\n  In addition to those examples as to why GATT is important, let me \njust quickly summarize a few others. It is the largest tax cut --by \nvirtue of the reduction of tariffs--in world history. It will eliminate \nmajor foreign barriers to the export of our goods.\n  It will permit--and in some cases actually strengthen--the United \nStates's ability to enforce its laws against foreign unfair trade \npractices.\n  It will protect intellectual property of United States entrepreneurs \nfrom piracy in world markets.\n  And it will boost the currently stalled world economy, thereby \ncreating even more export opportunities for U.S. firms.\n  The benefits to my home State are especially large. In addition to \nthe direct benefits of the jobs I just mentioned, it will eliminate \nduties for medical equipment and printed matter. It will lower \nsignificantly tariffs on fish and fish products, which are a mainstay \nof Massachusetts.\n  It will provide strong intellectual property rights protection which \nwill benefit particularly exports of semiconductor manufacturers, \ncomputers and software.\n  Finally, I will say this is not a perfect agreement. No agreement is. \nThere are obviously deep concerns that we have about labor standards in \nother countries. There are concerns that we have about the ability of \nthose countries to meet some of the environmental standards we consider \ncritical.\n  Therefore, we must bear in mind that with this vote our job is not \nfinished.\n  Opening up opportunities in the new global economy is important. But \nwe must also prepare all our citizens for the impact of that \nglobalization.\n  Some of our most vulnerable citizens will be hurt in the transition \nprocess. It is a tragedy that in this Nation we have not fully funded \nworker training and adjustment programs. As some benefit, it should not \nbe at the expense of others.\n  Further, we must make certain that we ensure that international labor \nstandards are protected and increased through the World Trade \nOrganization. This will entail a major effort by the United States, but \nwe are obliged to make it.\n  We also must do everything we can to ensure that textile markets \naround the world are opened so that our textile manufacturers, who will \nbe newly challenged under this agreement, do not find themselves \nrelinquishing the protection of the multifiber agreement without \nfinding fairness in foreign markets. I am convinced that it is through \nthe GATT that we can help them to achieve that equity in the \nmarketplace. This agreement will help us to open up those last \nbarriers.\n  Lastly, we must follow the progress of the new Environment and Trade \nCommittee of the WTO to ensure that the goal of sustainable development \nis not relegated to the marketplace in Geneva.\n  In all of these cases, if we find that the new agreement and the WTO \nare not working to our benefit and are undermining our labor and \nenvironment standards, we should be prepared to exercise our option to \nwaive.\n  These are the tangible steps that we can and must take in order to \nguarantee that GATT is not a hollow victory today and that we continue \nto be concerned for the workers of this country.\n  But like NAFTA, Mr. President, this agreement is a good one, and it \nis good for U.S. workers.\n  I urge my colleagues to acknowledge the facts, to recognize that we \nare better off with a world community trading by global agreement \nrather than the chaos of individual bilateral arrangements. It is \nprecisely those arrangements that have created some of the worst \ninequities in the marketplace today, and it is precisely this agreement \nthat attempts to redress that.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished chairman both for the time and for \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I congratulate the Senator from \nMassachusetts, first for his enterprise in bringing Polaroid cameras to \nNew Delhi and making a very proper neat point.\n  I can add that the President of Kodak, which is of course a New York \nfirm, has made the point that there are 4 billion people on Earth who \nnever snapped a photograph and he would like to sell them cameras.\n  I would like to make the point that we surely are heading for the \nmoment where a third of our work force will be in export industries, if \nwe adopt the GATT. If we do not, remember dollar week, remember 1933. \nThat is what Cordell Hull and Franklin Roosevelt tried to take us out \nof on this very important point about displaced workers and there will \nbe, and multifiber agreement. It happens I was one of the three persons \nwho negotiated for President Kennedy the long-term cotton textile \nagreement in 1962 which made possible the Trade Enhancement Act of that \nyear that led to the Kennedy round.\n  That was involved. The original cotton textile agreement became \nmultifibers. It had been in place 32 years now and we have another 10 \nyears in this agreement, about half a century, but it also provided for \ndisplaced workers and that commitment was made and that is when the \nlabor movement was behind us then and we have not kept faith with them.\n  The Senator's commitment is a very important one which I think we \nshould all undertake to keep.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I see our distinguished friend from \nColorado, and I am happy to yield 10 minutes, if that is agreeable, on \nSenator Packwood's time.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, it is quite clear that this measure is going to pass, \nthat the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, and others, \nhave made an excellent case.\n  I rise out of concerns over the GATT, and I want to raise a couple \nspecific points that I hope at least in the record of this debate will \nbe reflected upon at some point.\n  Americans used to take great pride in being called Yankee traders. It \nwas an aggressive term. It was one we liked to call ourselves, and we \nthink it implied that not only were we capable traders when we were \ninvolved in the international marketplace, but we were at least savvy \nabout the way we did it, as well as that in the trades we put together \nwe thought of ourselves of at least capable of holding our own and \nperhaps even at times outtrading everybody else in the world. Perhaps \nthat is part of the American mystique. While we are made up of few from \naround the globe, we also pride ourselves in having something a little \nbetter than the rest of the world.\n  How will we evaluate this GATT agreement? Some will say this is \nsimply a free trade agreement that benefits all and so the discussion \nneeds to end there. I have read many editorials lately that have \nreflected that viewpoint. How could you possibly oppose GATT because \nyou ought to be in favor of free trade?\n  Mr. President, I am in favor of free trade. I am in favor of reducing \ntrade barriers. I do think it is an advantage to our economy and other \neconomies around the world. I think it is a plus for consumers.\n  But, Mr. President, the issue that is before us is not free trade. \nHow can I say that? It is in the agreements themselves, in agreement \nafter agreement after agreement, and as I think the distinguished \nMembers know there are a number of agreements included in this measure. \nIt calls on the United States to open its markets but allows other \ncountries to keep their markets closed or exempts them from the \nrequirement to open their markets or exempts them from the marketing \nopening provision. Please do not confuse this with the free trade \nagreement that opens both markets. It does not.\n  Many of the agreements have a specific provision for countries of the \nfree world. What they say is, the United States, you open your market \nbut countries in the Third World can keep it closed for 5 years. For \nsome it is 7 years and for some it is 8 years. In another agreement it \ngoes to 10 years and even one it goes to 12 years.\n  Does anybody think that is a good trade? Would anybody be happy to be \nthe U.S. Trade Representative and come back and say look what I got \nyou; I got you the right to make your concessions immediately, but the \nother ones do not have to match them until a dozen years from now. That \nis not being a Yankee trader. That is being a chump.\n  This is not a good agreement. Those who are advocates of free trade \nought to understand there is more involved than simply slogans, that \nthey have to look at the agreements to evaluate them.\n  Some will say, ``Well, OK, we will suffer for 5 years or a dozen \nyears, but then at least at the end of that time we will have achieved \nsomething great. We will have opened those other markets, too.''\n  Mr. President, everybody who believes that I hope will go down and \nregister their name, because we have some real estate in Florida or \nperhaps Colorado we would like to sell them.\n  The truth is, what is included in the WTO, included in this \nagreement, is an empowerment of the general council or the ministerial \nconference by a vote to amend the rules.\n  Well, some will say, ``Well, Heavens, that takes a supermajority to \namend the rules.'' Surely no one would come forward after giving those \nspecial privileges to Third World countries and would waive the \nrequirement that they eventually come into line.\n  Mr. President, people need to read this agreement. This agreement \ndoes give that power. There is the ability to amend the rules. What \ndoes it take? Three-quarters. How can anybody, for such a difficult \nposition to defend, assume that you could amend those rules. One reason \nmight be that people who vote in the World Trade Organization are going \nto vote for their interests. Most of those countries are not what we \nwould call free traders. And, as a matter of fact, if all of the Third \nWorld countries join in the WTO, they will have 83 percent of the vote. \nMaybe they all will not join. Ninety have joined already. They have by \nnow already three-quarters of votes. All they have to do is vote for \nthemselves and they will be able to extend these provisions.\n  Has anybody talked about it? Yes, they have. There are references to \nextending them.\n  Mr. President, this is not a good bargain. And it has nothing to do \nwith whether you like free trade or not. It has to do with a lousy job \nof negotiating a contract and making sure that the other side has to \nlive by the same rules we live by. If anybody is proud of this \nagreement in terms of negotiation, I hope they will come down and \ndefend it. They may be proud of the concept, and I am all with them. \nBut when you look at the text of the agreement, they have nothing to be \nproud of.\n  Some discussion has been made with regard to the expense of GATT, and \nI want to share this with Members because I want to make a forecast. \nThe United States cost to administer GATT has increased 181 percent \nfrom 1984 to 1993. That is because the GATT expenses have increased 72 \npercent. Is it a lot of money? Well, not in terms of the Federal \nGovernment. But $9 million is a lot to some people.\n  What are the chances that it is going to increase? I want to draw the \nMembers' attention to a couple of things. Currently, each country's \nshare of the total annual expense of GATT is equal to the country's \nportion of total trades in goods and contracting priorities and \nassociated governments. In other words, it is a trade figure. We get to \npay between 14 and 16 percent. Currently it is about 14.6, as the \ndistinguished chairman pointed out yesterday, of the cost to operate \nGATT.\n  However, there is this change and our source for this change is from \nFocus--an official GATT newsletter published by the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade, Geneva, Switzerland.\n  Beginning in 1996, every country's assessment will reflect its share \nin international traded goods, services and intellectual property. \nTherefore, the U.S. contribution to WTO will significantly increase \nbecause we have the largest trade in services and intellectual property \nin the world. In other words, 14.6 percent is going to go up, not down.\n  But, Mr. President, in addition to that, we have been in discussion \nwith people from the State Department and they indicate that the \nprovisions that allocate costs along with the size of the gross \ndomestic product, or the gross national product that incidentally is \nused in the United Nations, is under consideration here. If we do that, \nour share to the WTO will clearly go up to about 23 percent.\n  Some will say, ``Well, wait a minute. We have to have votes on that \nfirst.''\n  Let me draw the Members' attention to this question. One, in this new \nagreement it is not spelled out. We have not been guaranteed what the \nallocation will be nor are we guaranteed what the costs will be.\n  But, Mr. President, we do know the process. The ministerial \nconference elects the director general. The director general will \nreflect that majority. Keep in mind that the countries that will be \nvoting, a majority of them, have voted against the United States in the \nUnited Nations over 50 percent of the time. This is not a benign group. \nThis is a group that has opposed us in policies in the United Nations \nconsistently. They will elect the director general, not the United \nStates. The director general helps set up the secretariat and the \nsecretariat is the one that appoints the people who will be judges. We \ncall them panelists, dispute settlement body panelists. But the budget \nis proposed by the director general.\n  That budget is then forwarded to the committee on budget, finance and \nadministration. Once they have made their recommendation it goes to the \ngeneral council. The general council will have over 80 percent, perhaps \nas high as 83 percent of its members from the Third World. It only \ntakes two-thirds to approve budget matters. Does not the Third World \nhave the opportunity to skew the budget and to give us a \ndisproportionate cost? Absolutely. Do not kid yourself. Do not kid \nyourself. They have the votes.\n  Now, would they possibly do that? I have heard Members convey to me \nin private, ``Look, we are so influential on trade matters, no one \nwould stick us with a disproportion of the cost.''\n  Please take a look at what happens in the United Nations. If any \nMember of this body is comfortable with the share of the costs we pay \nin the United Nations, if anybody feels it is proportional to what it \nought to be, I would love to have them come forward and say so. It is \nmy impression that it is not anywhere near close. We get taken. We pay \nfar more than our share of the cost.\n  Is that a good trade? Of course not.\n  What we have had is a negotiation where the United States gave up on \nmost of the key important points and signed a bad deal. And now we are \ngoing to ratify it. To have bad negotiators go and represent this \ncountry may not be our responsibility, but if we vote for this measure \nit is our responsibility.\n  Americans, Yankee traders, ought to be able to do better than that. \nThey ought to be able to do better in a negotiation than have this \ncountry not get equal access. I think it is fair to insist that we have \nthe same access to other countries as they have here. It is not in this \nagreement. It is the opposite.\n  I think it is fair for us to have a weighted vote as we do in the \nInternational Monetary Fund, or vetoes as we in the United Nations, or \nat least something that is proportional. We do not have that in this \nagreement. That is not a good trade.\n  Mr. President, the way the courts are administered does not include \ndue process. No one claims it does. It has the potential of being very \nabusive to Americans and American interests. That is not a good trade.\n  Whether it is the cost of the operation, whether it is the trade \nagreements themselves, whether it is the mechanism that is established, \nwhether it is the quasijudicial procedures that are set up, whether it \nis the votes in the general council, this country came out on the short \nend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and I thank the floor managers for \nallowing me to come in at this time.\n  Mr. President, later this afternoon, we will be casting the 328th \nvote, and possibly the 329th vote of this second session of the 103d \nCongress. These will be historic votes not only because they will be \nthe last votes of this Congress, but because on these votes, unlike all \nof the other votes we have cast, the entire world is watching and \nawaiting the outcome.\n  In reaching my decision, I have tried to balance the positive \neconomic components of the agreement against the uncertainties \nassociated with the idea of creating a supranational body--the World \nTrade Organization [WTO]--to govern international trade disputes.\n  I have always believed that an open trading system is in the best \ninterests of citizens of Alaska and the Nation as a whole. And so I \nwanted to give the proponents of the agreement every opportunity to \nmake their case and help me overcome my very serious reservations about \nthe WTO.\n  Many Alaskans have asked me why I have waited until today to make my \ndecision on the agreement. The reason I have waited so long is that I \nhad very specific concerns about certain aspects of the agreement, and \nhow they would affect my home State of Alaska. One of my principal \nconcerns was whether Alaska's unitary tax system is protected under the \nnew agreement.\n\n\n                      alaska's unitary tax method\n\n  Many Alaskans have expressed concern that the State's unitary method \nof corporate taxation could be challenged by one of our trading \npartners, and if the WTO ruled against Alaska, the State would either \nhave to dismantle its tax system or the United States would face \nretaliatory penalties. Last week, I wrote to the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, Ambassador Mickey Kantor, concerning the potential of a \nchallenge to Alaska's unitary system. Three days ago, Ambassador Kantor \nresponded and assured me that ``Alaska's unitary tax system if fully \nprotected under the new Uruguay round agreements.''\n\n  According to Ambassador Kantor, Alaska's unitary tax system is \nexcepted from the agreement and ``WTO member countries would have no \nground on which to suspend Uruguay round trade concessions in response \nto Alaska's unitary tax system.'' In addition, Alaska's Governor has \nexamined this issue and reached a conclusion consistent with Ambassador \nKantor's analysis.\n  Although I am satisfied that Ambassador Kantor's interpretation of \nthe agreement is correct, nothing precludes another country from \nattempting to challenge the unitary tax systems in my State or the 15 \nother States that use this method. I would hope that such a challenge \nwould be summarily dismissed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to \nAmbassador Kantor, his response, and a letter from John Katz, director \nof State/Federal relations for the State of Alaska, be included in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, what made my decision so difficult is \nthe fact that there are clear economic benefits that will flow from the \nagreement. The agreement that was hammered out with our trading \npartners is designed to enhance international trade in industrial and \nhigh-technology products by cutting tariffs by $744 billion over the \nnext decade.\n  By some estimates, if the agreement is approved, U.S. exports will \nincrease by $150 billion, creating 500,000 new jobs and increasing the \nincome of the average U.S. family by $1,700 per year over the next 10 \nyears, and the agreement could increase our gross domestic product by \n$100 billion to $200 billion a year.\n\n\n                          benefits for alaska\n\n  For the citizens of Alaska, especially those involved in the fishing \nand wood products industry, the GATT Agreement promises new jobs and \nnew export opportunities. As the largest producer of fisheries products \nin the United States, Alaska seafood exports currently account for 48 \npercent of total seafood exports, accounting for more than $1.5 \nbillion. Under this agreement our seafood exports are likely to \nincrease because Japan has agreed to cut its fishery duties by 24.5 \npercent and South Korea and other Asian nations will cut their tariffs \nby 35 percent.\n  Wood products exports from Alaska, which currently account for more \nthan $540 million, are likely to increase because the principal markets \nfor our wood products--Japan, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea--have all \nagreed to cut their lumber and solid wood tariffs by an average of 28 \npercent. In addition, in Brazil, where Alaskan wood products have been \neffectively blocked by tariffs as high as 52 percent, tariffs will be \ncut by three-fourths to 14 percent.\n  These potentially positive elements of the agreement are compelling, \nespecially when one considers how important international trade is to \nAlaska.\n\n\n                        ISSUEs OMITTED FROM GATT\n\n  But it should be noted that this agreement falls far short of \nachieving the goals we originally sought when the Uruguay round began. \nWe failed to eliminate governmental subsidies for civil aviation and \nagriculture. We failed to establish workable rules that would allow \nfree trade in financial services and telecommunications, and were \nunsuccessful in breaking open the European broadcasting and movie \nindustry. These are all industries where the United States clearly \nmaintains a competitive advantage; yet our negotiators were unable to \nachieve any major breakthroughs with our trading partners in these \nareas.\n\n\n                                THE WTO\n\n  What is of serious concern to the citizens of Alaska and to me is the \ndispute settlement process authorized by this agreement. I have heard \nfrom many Alaskans over the last several months who have expressed \nlegitimate and serious concerns that the newly created World Trade \nOrganization [WTO] could represent a threat to our Nation's \nsovereignty. As all of my colleagues know, there is real concern \nthroughout the country that a group of faceless foreign bureaucrats \nwhose interests are inimical to the United States will issue rulings in \nsecret that will penalize American business and force Congress to \nrewrite our laws to conform to the arbitrary whims of other countries.\n  If this agreement were not being considered under the fast track \nprocedure, I would certainly offer an amendment to strip out the WTO \nand maintain GATT as the body for governing trade disputes. That, in \neffect, is what our predecessors did in the late 1940's when the Senate \nrefused to approve an organization similar in concept to the WTO--the \nso-called International Trade Organization. World trade has flourished \nsince GATT was implemented in 1948 and I think it was a mistake for our \ntrade negotiators to replace GATT with the WTO. Make no mistake, world \ntrade will continue to flourish GATT or no GATT. The world market is \ntoo competitive to stop now.\n  Instead of creating the one-country, one-vote WTO, our negotiators \nshould have used the U.N. Security Council as a model for dispute \nsettlement. Using the Security Council model, the major trading \ncountries--the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Great Britain, \nItaly, and Canada--could have retained a veto over any decision that \nwas contrary to their interests.\n  Although the Republican leader, Senator Dole, should be commended for \nwinning a commitment from the administration to support legislation \nthat will create a WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission here in the \nUnited States, this review commission does not have the authority to \noverturn WTO decisions.\n  If the Commission finds that the WTO exceeded its authority in any \ncase involving the United States, all Congress can do is adopt a \nresolution calling on the President to negotiate new dispute settlement \nrules. If the WTO issues three such decisions, Congress could adopt \nlegislation requiring the United States to withdraw from the WTO. That \nis not totally satisfactory to this Senator.\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET WAIVER\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I believe the administration made a \nfundamental mistake when they sent the implementing legislation to \nCongress without fully complying with our budget rules. Since the \nadministration has claimed $1.7 billion in savings from unrelated \nlegislation passed since the 1993 budget, and since the financing \npackage only offsets 5 years' tariff reductions, the GATT Agreement is \nsubject to a budget point of order.\n  Our Federal debt is approaching $4.7 trillion. Interest to service \nthat debt will exceed $225 billion this year. With this extraordinary \namount of fiscal red ink, it is fundamentally irresponsible for the \nadministration to have submitted unamendable legislation that is not \nfully funded. We should not be adding to the debt and the deficit in \norder to finance this trade agreement.\n  Instead, the administration should have submitted a series of real \nspending cuts to finance this entire package. We all know the \nsignificance of the debt and what we are doing here is basically \nadditional deficit financing. That is something I abhor.\n  I refuse to support any legislation that adds a further debt burden \nto our children and grandchildren.\n  In the final analysis this is a vote about winners and losers--\nAmerican winners and losers. Depending on who is counting, either the \nwinners are in the majority or the losers are. The irony of this loud, \nemotional, and well-meaning debate about free trade is that we lose \nsight of what we do to ourselves regarding free trade. How can we urge \nfree trade, presumably urging our trading partners to lower their \nbarriers, as we seek entry for our products, when we prohibit by our \nown laws, the export of our products?\n  How can we prohibit the export of our own Alaskan North Slope oil for \n20 years and yet plead for fairness from our trading partners.\n  In the old saying, we have met the enemy and it is us.\n  This would be a very close call on the merits and the issues. I hope \nwe will have an opportunity to send this back for improvements, and I \nespecially hope we will be honest about paying for the agreement with \nspending cuts before final consideration.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 22, 1994.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor: Concerns have been expressed by \n     some individuals in Alaska that under the terms of the \n     uruguay Round GATT agreement, the state's unitary tax system \n     could be jeopardized. In particular, there is concern that \n     the state's unitary tax system could be challenged before the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO), and if the WTO ruled that \n     this method of taxation is inconsistent with the principles \n     of national treatment, the state would have to dismantle its \n     tax system or face retalatory penalties.\n       GATT Article XIV, subsection (d) provides that nothing in \n     the agreement prevents the adoption of a taxing system \n     ``aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition of \n     direct taxes in respect of services or service suppliers of \n     other Members.'' The footnote to subsection (d) attempts to \n     define tax measures that are designed to ensure the \n     ``equitable or effective'' collection of taxes. Included in \n     this list are tax systems which ``determine, allocate or \n     apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of \n     resident persons or branches, or between related persons or \n     branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the \n     Member's tax base.'' (FN 6, (vi). Although this definition \n     appears to encompass a unitary tax system, it does not \n     clearly and specifically approve the unitary tax system.\n       Because of the uncertainty surrounding this issue and its \n     importance to my state, I would appreciate if you would \n     provide me with a written answer to the following questions \n     before the Senate's scheduled vote next week on GATT.\n       1. What is the status of worldwide unitary tax systems \n     adopted by states such as Alaska under the GATT?\n       2. Can the state's unitary tax system be challenged before \n     the WTO?\n       3. If the WTO determines that Alaska's unitary tax system \n     is inconsistent with the principles of national treatment, \n     what sanctions can be imposed on the state, or kthe United \n     States, as a result of this determination?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Frank Murkowski,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    The U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 28, 1994.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: Thank you for your letter of \n     November 22, 1994, expressing concerns from some of your \n     constituents that Alaska's unitary tax system might be \n     vulnerable to challenge in dispute settlement proceedings \n     under the proposed World Trade Organization (WTO). I want to \n     assure you that Alaska's unitary tax system is fully \n     protected under the new Uruguay Round agreements.\n       As you may know, the two Uruguay Round agreements that most \n     directly apply to taxation measures are the General Agreement \n     on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) and the General \n     Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). For the reasons \n     explained below, neither agreement provides a basis for \n     challenging state unitary taxation measures.\n       The relevant provisions of GATT 1994 apply to taxes \n     assessed on the goods rather than on income. Thus, GATT 1994 \n     could not be successfully used to challenge Alaska's unitary \n     tax system. I would point out that the GATT 1994 rules on \n     this subject are no different than those that have been in \n     effect under the GATT since 1948.\n       With respect to the GATS, its relevant provision--the \n     national treatment (nondiscrimination) rule--does apply to \n     income taxes, subject to a broad exception under Article XIV, \n     which you cited in your letter. The United States insisted on \n     the broad carveout in Article XIV(d) and the language in \n     footnote 6(vi) precisely in order to protect both our federal \n     and state income tax systems, including state unitary tax \n     regimes. In addition, we ``reserved'' (that is, specifically \n     excluded) from our commitments under the GATS all:\n       ``Sub-federal tax measures which afford less favorable \n     treatment to services or service suppliers of another Member \n     based on the method of allocating or apportioning the income, \n     profit, gain, losses, deductions, credits, assets or tax \n     based of such services suppliers or the proceeds of a \n     services transaction.''\n       Accordingly, even if Alaska's unitary tax system were found \n     to treat foreign service suppliers less favorably than \n     domestic service suppliers, it would be protected from \n     successful challenge both by the exception in Article XIV(d) \n     and by this reservation.\n       Our negotiators took great pains to ensure that state \n     unitary tax systems, such as Alaska's, will be fully \n     protected when the Uruguay Round agreements take effect. As a \n     result of their efforts, I am pleased that I can respond to \n     your specific questions as follows:\n       First, Alaska's unitary tax system is excepted from the \n     relevant provisions of the GATT and GATS;\n       Second, Alaska's unitary tax system is protected from \n     successful challenge to WTO dispute settlement proceedings; \n     and\n       Third, therefore, WTO member countries would have no ground \n     on which to suspend Uruguay Round trade concessions in \n     response to Alaska's unitary tax system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Kantor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  State of Alaska,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator: Thank you for your letter of earlier today \n     regarding the potential impact of the GATT on the State's \n     collection of income tax based on the `unitary tax' method. \n     As you know, the importance to the State of Alaska of \n     maintaining this manner of taxation cannot be understated.\n       We have reviewed this question with the Governor's office \n     in Juneau, with the Departments of Law and Revenue, and with \n     the MultiState Tax Commission. Our assessment at this hour, \n     as it has been previously, is consistent with the analysis \n     shared with you by Ambassador Kantor.\n       However, notwithstanding a protected status, the United \n     States could be challenged based on Alaska's use of the \n     unitary tax. In such an instance, reliance must be placed on \n     the Federal government in defending its position and upon the \n     World Trade Organization in upholding the reservation.\n       If we can be of any further assistance, please let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 John W. Katz,\n\n       Director of State/Federal Relations and Special Counsel to \n                                                     the Governor.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the Senator from North Dakota 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, during this debate I heard a number of \npeople referring to NAFTA, saying the information we received about \nNAFTA is that it is working very well. We have already created \nsubstantial new jobs. They know that because they have been given part \nof the story.\n  Let me give it to you in automobiles. They say we have sent 30,000 \nmore automobiles to Mexico under NAFTA during the first 9 months of \nthis year. That is true. They did not tell the rest of the story, that \n70,000 additional cars came into this country from Mexico. That means \nwe lost jobs.\n  I asked the Joint Economic Committee to do an evaluation of the net \njob situation between here and Mexico with NAFTA. They said it is hard \nbut they put together a staff study. I just got it yesterday. It says \nthe following. I want to read the paragraph.\n\n       This analysis summarizes U.S. trade data with Mexico \n     through the first 9 months of 1994. It provides a preliminary \n     and partial perspective on the effects of NAFTA on the U.S. \n     This analysis will show that, while increased exports have \n     created jobs during the period, changes in the overall trade \n     balance with Mexico have resulted in a net deficit of 10,000 \n     U.S. jobs since the agreement went into effect.\n\n  The overall trade balance changes have resulted in a net deficit of \n10,000 U.S. jobs since the trade agreement went into effect. So the \nnext time someone stands up and says, ``Boy, this NAFTA is really \nworking well,'' it is because somebody gave them a part of the story. \nThe rest of the story is here. NAFTA, like GATT, means that companies \ncan access cheap labor and that is what the next paragraph says:\n\n       This analysis demonstrates that NAFTA has not increased \n     U.S. employment but rather increased global access to \n     Mexico's low-wage labor supply, as reflected in growing \n     shipments of capital goods and production inputs to Mexico \n     from the U.S. and foreign countries and rapidly rising \n     imports of finished products from Mexico to the U.S.\n\n  That is the full story. That is NAFTA. And that is what we are going \nto read about GATT, after this GATT agreement passes.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota for the astute approach that he has made to the problem at hand. \nThere is no question with respect to that sucking sound. We can only \nlook at the facts with respect to electric machinery, sound, TV \nequipment--since NAFTA was enacted a deficit of $671 million. Optic \nphoto medical-surgical equipment, a deficit to the United States of \n$241 million; an 87 percent increase over the same period of last year. \nVehicles and parts, $218 million.\n  The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, that what we have had is \n244 industries apply for adjustment assistance, representing the loss \nof 35,000 jobs. I do not question the Joint Economic Committee study \nabout the loss, but we know when 35,000 people lose their jobs, by past \nexperience, less than half will get their jobs back. And if they do get \nanother job it pays 20 percent less.\n  So down to Mexico, they go with their automobile factories. I \ncounseled a friend from Michigan. I said, ``Look, there is no question \nabout their intent after NAFTA, Volkswagen says they are going to \nexpand the plant to produce a million cars to sell in the United \nStates.'' You do not have to wait for economic projections. Nissan, \nFord, Chrysler, General Motors have all announced new facilities. We \nknow that recently General Motors has downsized 71,000 jobs. They are \nall moving down there.\n  With respect to the productivity, the biggest mislead is when they \ntalk about low income, they think of low skill. The fact of the matter \nis, they are very high skilled. J.D. Powers made a study of all \nautomobile productivity in the world and found that the most productive \nFord plant was not in Europe, not in Detroit, but in Mexico right this \nminute.\n  So we know, as we can train them to make automobiles productively, as \nwe never have done before but now have just started in South Carolina, \nhard common sense says you can do that in Mexico. Fiat has a plant in \nthe Ivory Coast and the automobile industry will move around and go \nthat way.\n  And, incidentally, BMW has moved to our State, and has also announced \na $180 million new facility investment in Mexico--in Mexico under \nNAFTA. So we have had, yes, an increase in exports of 17,000 cars, but \nwe have had imports of cars of 154,000. Since the distinguished Senator \nfrom Oregon started talking about trucks, the overall we have imported \n176,000 cars and trucks. So there is no question in my mind that that \nsucking sound is there, but, of course, the Fortune Fifth Column in the \ntrade war continues to muffle it.\n  To try to get into this debate, they said in the Wall Street Journal \nthat trade was not an issue in the last election. You could not get \nthis to be an issue. You could not get on a program. You could not get \nin a news column. I publicly thank the Christian Science Monitor which \nfinally accepted a column from this particular Senator. Now, in my \nhometown, I get one this morning after they have been editorializing \nfor the past 3 months against my position; they finally put in an \narticle today.\n  Now, Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New York talked \nabout textiles in the Kennedy round. I want to emphasize that just \nexactly, because in the Kennedy round, we had cotton in the 7-point \nKennedy program. Before President John Kennedy could institute that \nparticular program, we had to get Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg \nand Secretary Dillon from Treasury and Dean Rusk--actually George Ball \nsubbed for Dean Rusk over there at the State Department--Luther Hodges \nat Commerce, and our friend Orville Freeman from Agriculture. The five \nof them got together, and I happened to bring a good many of the \nwitnesses before them.\n  We found that next to steel that textiles was the second most \nimportant industry to our national security. I pointed out how it \nbrings down the crime in the city. Those are good, valid sewing jobs. \nThose are the enterprises that we have in the enterprise zones. People \ndo not seem to understand it here: 96,000 of those jobs are in the \ninner city of New York; 63,000 in Watts in Los Angeles. And you pass \nthis GATT; yes, those sewing jobs are bound to leave to the Pacific \nrim. And when they leave, you have unemployment, you have unemployment \ncompensation, you have increased taxes there, health costs go up, \nwelfare costs go up and, of course, the crime rate goes up. We have \nthose running around all over the country saying what we ought to do in \nthe inner city is get enterprise zones and give businesses more tax \ncuts to get them there, as we affirmatively this afternoon remove them. \nThat is the tragedy of this entire debate.\n  When it comes to the competition we are in, the best headline is from \nNovember 23--today is December 1--exactly a week ago: ``Japan Defends \nPlan to Erect Textile Barriers.''\n  This is the crowd they are talking about dealing with on free trade. \nThis GATT does not open the market in Japan, Malaysia, Korea--you can \njust go right on down the list. Anybody that believes that is whistling \nDixie. Come on, let us wake up.\n  The Senator from Oregon said on Crossfire that we did not have a \nstudy showing job loss. We put the study in the Congressional Record. \nAccording to this study, we lose 1,390,000, almost 1,400,000 textile \njobs, under this GATT. Very, very important jobs. But they say, ``Oh, \nhere comes the textile Senator.'' Well, here comes a Senator who is \ninterested in those high-technology jobs in the aircraft industry. \nBoeing fired 28,000. Or high technology jobs in computers. Well, IBM \nfired 60,000. But before I get to the high-technology jobs, I want to \nget particularly to some of these things that get passed over.\n  With respect to the $500 billion increase to the world GNP, we had a \nhearing--eight hearings, actually--before the Committee on Commerce. \nThey started out with an OECD study that said $200 billion. When they \nwere told that that meant only .07 percent to the world GNP, they came \nup with $500 billion. Then the Special Trade Representative came up \nwith $1 trillion. So you can see how statistics are irresponsibly \nthrown around.\n  With respect to the $750 billion tax cut, Mr. President, let us get \nright to that one because what it says is really a $750 billion tariff \ncut. If you cut the tariffs, the Senator from Ohio brought out that \nthey are not getting the garments any cheaper. Similarly, with the \nSenator from Iowa, he pointed that out. I pointed it out time and again \nthat when Nike moved offshore from the United States and out of Oregon, \nthe price of shoes did not go up, the profits went up. So, yes, we hope \nit will give you a cheaper price, but we know that the retailers, part \nand one of the main troops in the Fortune Fifth Column in this trade \nwar, are only interested in bigger profits. They are not interested in \nyour job and my job or middle America. They are interested in more \nmoney.\n  I want to thank Senator Brown. I am hissing along here. He talked \nwith respect to the intellectual property. Yes, but they have \nexceptions in there, for developing countries, of 10 years. On \nagriculture, but the Europeans have subsidies greater than ours. What \nkind of agreement is that? It leaves the United States economy wide \nopen and it keeps their particular economies closed.\n  Now, with respect to specifically 301, if I was a trade lawyer, I \nwould say the whole thrust of this Uruguay round is to eliminate United \nStates unilateralism under section 301 and super 301. We know from the \nfinding already made by the European commission, and I will read:\n\n       The GATT does not allow for any unilateral interpretation \n     of the rights and obligations of the contracting parties, nor \n     for unilateral action by any one of the contracting parties \n     aimed at inducing another contracting party to bring its \n     trade policies in conformity with GATT.\n\n  Then, of course, on the next page it says specifically:\n\n       Accordingly, for the United States, this means that section \n     301 and its hybrids will have to undergo revision in order to \n     ensure compliance with the new WTO dispute settlement \n     structure.\n  They say no laws are changed. But, nevertheless they mentioned here a \nminute ago, the Senator from Massachusetts, the Consumers Union, and \nthe American Bar Association--they are wonderful groups. But, \nnevertheless they are not the judges. The World Trade Organization and \nthe dispute resolution panels--they are the judges. It is said we \nselect them and the opposition selects one, and then WTO. We do not \nhave a veto over that deciding party. We do not have a veto over the \nGATT agreement itself and the World Trade Organization. We have one \nman, one vote. Castro cancels us out.\n  Article 16, section 4, each member shall ensure the conformity of its \nlaws under the obligations of the agreement. That is very simple and \nclear. Oh, it does not change the law automatically, Mr. President. \nBut, nevertheless I tell you what it does do. It says you play along \nwith this agreement that you signed and confirmed in a national \nCongress or you pay. You pay or play. You pay with sanctions that can \nbe cross-indexed to other particular industries not even in the \nparticular dispute.\n  I asked them in the committee hearings, Mr. Ambassador Kantor, or any \nof them who came up, all of the officials. I said show me the page, the \nline that has the veto. I asked them today on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. Show me the page, the line and do not give me this gobbledygook \nabout consensus because they say, yes, it goes to consensus, and the \nnext line says you cannot get together by consensus. Then the World \nTrade Organization, one man, one vote, one country, one vote.\n  With respect to the budget itself, a moment ago when they talked \nabout the $750 billion tax cut. Of course, it is a tax. I mean it is a \ntax increase. Here we have a $31 billion deficit that they are going to \nhave a waiver on the point of order, my distinguished colleague from \nWest Virginia.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter of \nJuly 15 by 25 Senators, asking that you join us in opposing any effort \nto waive the provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1994.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: We write to ask that you join us in \n     opposing any effort to waive provisions of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act for the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade (GATT) implementing legislation and avoid the \n     requirement that such legislation be fully funded.\n       Some of us support GATT, others of us oppose the agreement, \n     and still others of us have yet to make a decision, but we \n     are united in our concern about the precedent waiving the \n     provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act could set, \n     undermining our ability to make further progress in lowering \n     the deficit now and in the future.\n       We are confronted on a regular basis with having to make \n     tough decisions on worthy programs because of our budget \n     rules, and rightly so. The federal budget deficit must be \n     brought down.\n       That GATT is significant is clear, but the importance of an \n     issue should not determine whether or not it should conform \n     with the budget rules we have set for ourselves. Indeed, the \n     true test of our resolve to bring the deficit under control \n     is our willingness to apply the budget rules to the important \n     issues.\n       We recognize your commitment to passing GATT implementing \n     legislation. Your support for making that legislation comply \n     with the budget rules will be all the more meaningful because \n     of that commitment, and we hope you will join us in this \n     effort to oppose any effort to dodge this responsibility.\n           Sincerely,\n           Russ Feingold, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Chuck Grassley, \n             Jesse Helms, Dirk Kempthorne, Dale Bumpers, Strom \n             Thurmond, Larry Pressler, Dave Durenberger, Lauch \n             Faircloth, Larry E.

Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pressler: Thank you for your letter to the \n     President of July 15th, requesting that the President oppose \n     any effort to waive the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) for the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) implementing \n     legislation. The Administration shares your concern about \n     such efforts.\n       The Administration firmly believes that the recently \n     completed Uruguay Round accords under the General Agreement \n     on Tariffs and Trade will increase economic growth, here in \n     the United States and around the world. We know that our view \n     is shared by many others in the economic and international \n     trade communities. This Administration has continued to work \n     to bring those negotiations to a conclusion to increase \n     economic growth in the future.\n       Nonetheless, we do not believe it is necessary to sacrifice \n     budget discipline to pass GATT in the Congress. In fact, we \n     fear that if Congress were to reverse the progress that has \n     been made on budget discipline over the past few years, we \n     could lose more than we would gain from the GATT accords.\n       Instead, I hope that we can work with you and other Members \n     of Congress to find offsets for the costs of GATT \n     implementation.\n       Thank you again for your letter. I hope to be working with \n     you soon on these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin,\n                                                  Acting Director.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there it is as the Senators see it, at \nleast 20 of them.\n  Here we go. Alice M. Rivlin, a letter dated August 8 to Senator \nPressler. ``Nonetheless,'' says Ms. Rivlin, the Acting Director at that \nparticular time, and now the Director of the Executive Office of the \nPresident Office of Management and Budget.\n\n       Nonetheless, we do not believe it is necessary to sacrifice \n     budget discipline to pass GATT in the Congress.\n\n  But that is what they are doing, fixing the jury. I have talked to \nthe Senators. ``The President just called me.'' That is not what his \nBudget Director said. We do not believe in sacrificing the discipline \nwith respect to export jobs.\n  Fifty companies in that Fortune 500, the top 50 companies account for \nover half of the total U.S. manufacturing exports. As a result, we look \nto see whether they are increasing as they talk, increasing the jobs.\n  Under those export industries, aircraft parts, since 1987 lost 67,000 \njobs, industrial machinery, 284,000, electronic and electrical \nequipment, 694,000, transportation equipment, 278,000.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the list be printed in \nthe Record. I can read them all.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we print in \nthe Record, the Business Week 21st Century, this weekly edition of \nBusiness Week entitled ``High-Tech Jobs All Over the Map.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Skills Explosion--High-Tech Jobs All Over The Map\n\n       As training and experience in less developed countries \n     rapidly improve, the West's workers may be left behind.\n       If any megatrend kindles hopes of producing megajobs for \n     skilled Americans, it is the coming of age of the Information \n     Revolution. U.S. companies are already setting industry \n     standards and pioneering virtually all of the key \n     technologies. Plus, America possesses the wealth of creative \n     talents needed to lead the coming wave of newfangled \n     software, multimedia gadgetry, and ingenious programming. \n     There will be jobs enough, it would seems for anyone with a \n     decent education.\n       But trek out to the laboratory of Kenneth Chou in a new \n     business park on the outskirts of Beijing, and you begin to \n     wonder. There 30 artists, software engineers, and computer \n     programmers at Chou's Bilingual Educational Computing Inc. \n     are busily designing interactive CD-ROM programs, complete \n     with voice and animation, for teaching English. Since 1991, \n     Bilingual has sold 50,000 sets of its First Aid English \n     multimedia lessons, now $55 apiece, to institutes from Japan \n     to Germany.\n       In fact, practically anywhere you go in Asia these days, \n     local workers can be found doing the same highly skilled \n     tasks you would expect to find in Palo Alto, Boston, or \n     Tokyo. At a Silicon Graphics Inc. joint venture in Bangalore, \n     India, software designers earning $300 a month are developing \n     programs to produce three-dimensional images for diagnosing \n     brain disorders. In a sleek industrial park in Singapore, \n     engineers design future generations of personal digital \n     assistants for Hewlett-Packard Co. In Taiwan, Hong Kong, and \n     South China, research and development teams are at work on \n     multimedia gizmos ranging from digital answering machines to \n     interactive computers for children.\n       New World Order. The message is that anybody who still \n     thinks the only competitive edge of developing countries is \n     cheap, unskilled labor has a lot of catching up to do. One of \n     the less-heralded developments in the emergence of a global \n     economy is that there is an increasingly better balance of \n     skills in the world. The worldwide shift to market economies, \n     steady improvements in education, and decades of overseas \n     training by multinationals are all producing a global \n     workforce in fields ranging from product development to \n     finance and architecture that is capable of performing tasks \n     once reserved for white-collar workers in the West.\n       What's more, dizzying advances in telecommunications are \n     making these workers more accessible than ever. As a result, \n     just as Westerners learned in the 1970s and 1980s that \n     manufacturing could be moved virtually anywhere, today it is \n     getting easier to shift knowledge-based labor as well.\n       Conventional notions of comparative advantage are getting \n     blurred in the process. In electronics, cities such as \n     Taipei, Edinburgh, Singapore, and Penang (Malaysia), which \n     are far away from the end-user and technological \n     breakthroughs, already have emerged as global product-\n     development hubs.\n       Service providers, too, can now spread across the globe. \n     Citibank taps local skills in India, Hong Kong, Australia, \n     and Singapore to manage data and develop products for its \n     global financial services. Houston-based M. W. Kellogg Co. \n     farms out detailed architectural-engineering work for power \n     and chemical plants it builds around the world to a partner \n     in Mexico. And everyone from law firms to U.S. nonprofit \n     groups cuts costs in managing and analyzing documents by \n     hiring ``outsourcers'' such as International Data Solutions \n     Inc. in Herndon, Va., which employs thousands of workers in \n     the Philippines.\n       What makes Third World brainpower so attractive is price \n     (charts). a good computer circuit-board designer in \n     California, for example, can pull down $60,000 to $100,000 a \n     year. Taiwan is glutted with equally qualified engineers \n     earning around $25,000. In India or China, you can get top-\n     level talent, probably with a PhD, for less than $10,000.\n       Tedious tasks. Where the big savings can come is in the \n     ``back end'' of product development--the painstaking work of \n     turning a conceptual design into blueprints, computer code, \n     or working models and in testing the final product. Take \n     Bilingual's cd-roms. With wages ranging from $75 a month for \n     a Chinese keypunch operator to $400 for a good artist, \n     Bilingual can produce a cd-roms product for anywhere from a \n     quarter to one-tenth of the cost in the U.S. In a business as \n     tough as cd-roms, where the few titles that succeed can have \n     a shelf life of less than a year, keeping costs under control \n     is critical.\n       It doesn't matter that few of the staff speak English. \n     Bilingual writes the scripts, the most creative part, in \n     Taiwan. The rest of the work, from, animation to voice-over \n     recording, is done on the mainland. ``When you get down to \n     it,'' says Chou, ``about 80% of the labor in producing \n     software is very tedious.''\n       Since marketing and creativity will always be in hot \n     demand, graduates of Stanford University business school or \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology probably needn't worry. \n     Trouble is, the back end happens to be where millions of \n     Americans are employed. And they're well-paying jobs: \n     software designers, bookkeepers, mechanical engineers, \n     draftsmen, libraries. Most require a bachelor's degree or at \n     least a few years in a polytechnic institute. Yet in theory, \n     at least, none of these jobs can be regarded as secure from \n     foreign competition. ``Just as with the move of manufacturing \n     overseas, you're going to see a increasing flux of technical \n     jobs out of the U.S.,'' predicts Intel Corp. Chief Operating \n     Officer Craig R. Barrett. ``We don't have any protected \n     domains anymore.''\n       New view. Policymakers have only begun to ponder what all \n     this means for American, European, and even Japanese white-\n     collar workers. Until recently, it seemed the impact would be \n     minimal. Groups such as the National Science Foundation have \n     been warning that as the Digital Age makes industries \n     technology-intensive, there will be an acute shortage of \n     technicians in the West. Skilled workers displaced by \n     outsourcing would simply move on to higher value-added \n     sectors.\n       But this view is being challenged. In a jarring keynote \n     speech to the annual convention of the Institute of \n     Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in September, Edith \n     Holleman, counsel to the House Science, Space & Technology \n     Committee, warned that exciting new high-tech jobs ``are \n     not reserved for you in the First World.'' What's more, \n     she said, high-tech breakthroughs in the U.S. ``cannot be \n     counted on to spin off into domestic manufacturing \n     facilities providing employment for many engineers and \n     skilled workers.''\n       Consider what already has happened to the PC motherboard, \n     the circuit card loaded with chips that runs every computer. \n     Five years ago, most motherboards--regarded as the guts of a \n     PC--were produced in-house by U.S. computer makers. Today, \n     some 60% are subcontracted to Taiwanese companies and their \n     army of 150,000 information-technology engineers. And now, \n     the Taiwanese are becoming a major force in customized \n     computer-chip design and local-area networks. Little wonder, \n     it would seem, that unemployment among U.S. electrical \n     engineers hit a record 5.9% this summer, according to the \n     IEEE, and the situation is expected to get worse.\n       Still, a host of factors suggests that the outflow of \n     skilled work to cheap Third World havens is only a temporary \n     phenomenon. For one, the wage gap is bound to close \n     eventually, as technicians and engineers in the developing \n     world command more. Also, the Information Superhighway is a \n     two-way street, allowing U.S. and European engineers to \n     compete for work in Asia as well as the reverse. Moreover, \n     experts fear that education systems in Thailand, Malaysia, \n     Indonesia, and Mexico, among others, are not producing enough \n     skilled workers for those nations to guarantee advancement up \n     the industrial ladder.\n       ROBO-TECH. What's more, as factories in the Third World \n     turn to state-of-the-art automation to stay competitive with \n     domestic rivals and meet international quality standards, \n     that automation could threaten Third World job growth. \n     Meanwhile, technological leaps in areas such as text and \n     voice recognition and computer-aided design software that \n     reduce the time-consuming code-writing process will wipe out \n     jobs in service industries.\n       But for now, the ground is shaking under skilled workers as \n     Western companies take advantage of big wage disparities. \n     Anyone who has witnessed the exceptional performances of \n     Chinese, Indian, and Vietnamese emigres in U.S. schools and \n     labs knows that developing countries are loaded with talent. \n     The rapid growth of Asia's economies means they can now apply \n     their skills at home.\n       A wild card in the global skills game is \n     telecommunications. Consider Hong Kong's Johnson Electric \n     Holdings Ltd., a $195 million producer of micromotors that \n     power hair dryers, blenders, and auto features such as door \n     locks, windshield wipers, and automatic windows. With \n     factories in South China and an R&D base in a Hong Kong \n     industrial park, Johnston is thousands of miles away from a \n     leading auto maker.\n       This hasn't stopped the company from virtually cornering \n     the market for the electric gizmos it makes for Detroit's Big \n     Three. ``My customer is right here,'' says Managing Director \n     Patrick Wang Shui Chung, pointing to a videoconferencing unit \n     in the midst of hundreds of engineers. For two hours each \n     morning, design teams ``meet'' face-to-face with their \n     customers in the U.S. and Europe. Concepts are transmitted \n     from R&D centers in North America and Europe to Hong Kong, \n     where 200 engineers on a network of workstations develop the \n     motors using CAD/CAM software.\n       Their specifications are programmed directly into Hong Kong \n     production lines. The process is so streamlined that Johnson \n     can take a concept and deliver a prototype to the U.S. in six \n     weeks. To cut that time even further, the company is \n     investing in more advanced telecommunications to link its \n     9,000-worker operations in China. ``Today, your location \n     doesn't matter,'' says Wang. ``It's turnaround time. I want \n     to be the fastest gun in the world.''\n       Knowhow. The pioneers in bringing foreign technicians into \n     the global workforce are multinationals such as Motorola, \n     Hewlett-Packard, and Philips Electronics. Originally, they \n     set up plants in Asia chiefly for cheap labor. But many of \n     these assembly shops have gathered so much knowhow that they \n     now do critical design-and-engineering tasks.\n       A good example is Motorola Inc. Its paging-device plant in \n     Singapore boasts 75 local engineers and a new $35 million \n     building dubbed the Motorola Innovation Center. There, the \n     Scriptor pager was developed almost entirely by Singaporean \n     industrial designers using Singaporean software.\n       Hewlett-Packard has gone even further. It encourages each \n     of its manufacturing sites around the world to become the \n     global base for its product. Penang, Malaysia, has become a \n     global center for many components used in HP's microwave \n     products and is taking over responsibility for computer hard-\n     disk drives from Palo Alto. And in Singapore, a plant HP \n     opened in 1970 to assemble keyboards is now the global R&D \n     and production center for its line of portable ink-jet \n     printers. It is also the base for all handheld devices, such \n     as persona digital assistants and calculators.\n       Intensive training by multinationals is another reason that \n     skills are rising rapidly. A key training locale is the \n     Penang Skills Development Center, a 360-student \n     polytechnic institute funded by 57 foreign companies and \n     the government for local high school and university \n     graduates. Intel donated a $140,000 microprocessor lab. A \n     20,000-square-foot ``team building park'' for leadership \n     training and a clean room for vacuum technology came \n     courtesy of Seagate Technology Inc., which has a big hard-\n     disk plant nearby, Motorola Inc. kicked in $320,000 for PC \n     software training and a bachelor-of-science program.\n       India, China, and Russia are closely watching the successes \n     of Malaysia and Singapore. The potential of all three is \n     staggering given the heavy emphasis their schools place on \n     math and basic science. In these countries, notes Intel's \n     Barrett: ``I see a ton of people who are as technically well-\n     educated as people in the U.S.''\n       India has the second-largest pool of English-speaking \n     scientific talent in the world, after the U.S. This includes \n     100,000 software engineers and technicians and hundreds of \n     companies, many locally owned, that supply software to \n     Western customers. The number of engineers could double by \n     the end of the decade. And a monthly salary of $800 for an \n     engineer with five years' experience is enough to place a \n     worker squarely in India's upper-middle class.\n       Central Europe also is peppered with brilliant scientists \n     rapidly being discovered and unleashed. The most promising \n     spots as production bases by 2020, according to a study of \n     404 European locations last year by Cologne-based market \n     researcher Empirica, are Bratislava (in Slovakia), Western \n     Bohemia (in the Czech Republic), Gyor-Sopron (Hungary), and \n     Poznan (Poland).\n       Germany's Robert Bosch has been making engine parts in the \n     Czech Republic since last year. ``Czech engineers have the \n     technical competence we require,'' says Heinz G. Grewe, \n     Bosch's head of management systems for gasoline engines. \n     Despite added startup and training costs, industry \n     analysts say, auto-parts makers can still save 30% by \n     outsourcing to Central Europe. Farther east, in Russia, \n     most multinationals have been slow to exploit the huge \n     pool of technologists who worked in the former Soviet \n     Union's defense industries. But pioneers such as Sun \n     Microsystems Inc. and ABB Asea Brown Boveri (Holdings) \n     Ltd., which already employ thousands of Russians, are \n     bullish, particularly about the hard-driving younger \n     generation that is eager to get rich (page 128).\n       Well-stocked waters. The deepest pool of untapped skills is \n     in China. Dataquest Inc., the research firm, estimates that \n     there are at least 350,000 information-technology engineers \n     in Chinese research institutes, state companies, and \n     universities. The average salary: about $105 a month. And \n     with the Chinese government placing electronics, \n     telecommunications, and software industries high on its list \n     of priorities, colleges across the country are preparing to \n     train hundreds of thousands more (page 126).\n       Multinationals are fishing in these well-stocked waters. \n     Northern Telecom Ltd. just opened a lab at the 10,500-student \n     Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications that will \n     soon employ 250 engineers. NT will work with faculty and \n     students on cellular phones, multimedia-transmission devices, \n     and software. In the northern city of Tianjin, Motorola will \n     have 3,000 workers making semiconductors and telecom \n     equipment by yearend. Meanwhile, AT&T, which is just getting \n     started in China, plans to link up the telecom plants it has \n     scattered across the country.\n       For now, these facilities will focus on the enormous \n     telecom needs of China. But it's only a matter of time before \n     Chinese engineers start playing key R&D roles in products \n     sold globally. ``All of our joint ventures can be technical \n     centers in their businesses,'' says AT&T China Inc. Human \n     Resources Director Albert Siu. ``I've never found people more \n     open to learning. They soak up everything.''\n       Many of the lessons companies are learning in high tech can \n     also be applied to the West's other big job generator; \n     services. There, the potential of offshore skilled labor is \n     just beginning to be tapped. For more than a decade, \n     companies such as American Airlines Inc. and Citicorp have \n     been loading tons of ticket stubs, credit-card receipts, and \n     insurance forms onto planes headed for places such as the \n     Dominican Republic or the Philippines, home of low-paid \n     keypunch operators.\n       Many experts think high-end services can also be farmed out \n     to overseas workers. Why not let specially trained Filipino \n     accountants do much of the grunt work in preparing tax \n     returns for multinationals? Or how about outsourcing the \n     legal research for expensive product-liability cases? Using \n     CD-ROM libraries, paralegals in India could churn out the \n     mountain of writs and affidavits for such cases at a deep \n     discount. Anupam P. Puri, managing director of McKinsey & \n     Co.'s Bombay office, says such task transfers are long \n     overdue. ``Most of our multinational clients are still very \n     behind in seeing how they can redistribute service work \n     around the world,'' he says.\n       Regulatory hurdles remain, of course. But the technological \n     barriers are falling fast. International Data Solutions, for \n     example, scans case and client files for U.S. law firms and \n     transmits them in digital form via satellite to the \n     Philippines. There, workers organize and index the documents \n     so they can be readily retrieved by a computer network in the \n     U.S. International Data employs two full-timers in Virginia--\n     and up to 3,000 Filipinas. ``With the Information \n     Superhighway revolution, this trend is accelerating \n     dramatically,'' says International Data President Kenneth R. \n     Short. ``It really doesn't matter where the work is done as \n     long as quality, price, and service are right.''\n       Broader View. In the construction industry, Houston's M. R. \n     Kellogg has teamed up with Mexico's Bufete Industrial on \n     contracts to build petrochemical-refining systems worldwide. \n     After developing conceptual drawings on a computer, Kellogg \n     transmits them to Bufete, of which Kellogg owns 21 percent. \n     The Mexicans turn the drawings into detailed blueprints. The \n     arrangement, says Kellogg Manager Robert Salazar, ``makes us \n     competitive all over the world.''\n       While this flexibility sounds great for corporations, it \n     could be traumatic for professionals who are not well-\n     equipped for a global economy. As gaps between experience \n     levels and wages narrow around the world, skilled workers \n     will compete on a more equal footing. To profit from the \n     emerging trends, workers will require broader training than \n     is now provided by most education systems--in both the East \n     and the West.\n       Rather than focus on one discipline, for example, \n     professional workers will need to understand the economics \n     and technologies that are revolutionizing their industries. \n     In the banking world, ``the pure technologist is already \n     dead,'' says George P. DiNardo, Singapore-based chief \n     technology officer for Citibank's Asian consumer business. \n     ``And so is the pure businessperson.''\n       In electronics and telecommunications, engineers discarded \n     by Corporate America are taking advantage of cheaper access \n     to data and video networks by forming their own design houses \n     for Asian manufacturers. In many other fields, professionals \n     may have to similarly redefine their jobs in order to prosper \n     from the globalization of work rather than be at its mercy.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the message is that anybody who still \nthinks the only competitive edge of the developing countries is cheap \nunskilled labor has a lot of catching up to do.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Oregon referred to Intel. Well, here \nis what is happening at Intel. ``Just as with the move of manufacturing \noverseas, you are going to see an increasing flux of technical jobs \noutside of the United States,'' predicts Intel Corporation chief \noperating officer, Craig R. Bennett, in Business Week.\n  ``We don't have any protected domains anymore.''\n  Then it goes on to say,\n\n       ``Consider what already has happened to the PC mother \n     board, the circuit card loaded with chips and runs of \n     computer. Five years ago most mother boards, regarded as the \n     guts of a PC, were produced in-house by the U.S. computer \n     makers. Today, some 60 percent are subcontracted to Taiwanese \n     companies and their army of 150,000 information technology \n     engineers.\n\n  On and on, Mr. President. Dispelling that myth, I read from the \nBusiness Week of December 17, 1990. Here it is. I quote:\n\n       From all the fuss about the United States becoming more \n     export oriented, hardly any additional industries have joined \n     the exporting sector in the past 10 years.\n\n  Do not keep coming up here talking export jobs.\n\n       Moreover, success overseas is not translating into job \n     creation at home.\n\n  I quote then not reading the entire article, but quoting word for \nword:\n\n       These trends show no sign of abating. Using government \n     employment forecasts Business Week is projecting an increase \n     of 9.6 percent in the size of the exporting sector over the \n     next 10 years, far less than the projected national \n     employment growth of 14.6 percent. True, the exporting sector \n     could expand faster if import competing industries such as \n     machine tools, some domestic industries' machine tools and \n     our tools regain market share in the United States or if some \n     domestic industries learn how to be big exporters. Barring \n     these competitive gains, the proportion of Americans \n     producing for world markets will just continue to shrink in \n     the 1990's.\n\n  Mr. President, why can't we understand what is going on? We are in a \ndecline.\n  Mr. President, Vermont is due to lose 6,100 jobs this year under \nGATT. The total loss from the trade deficit is 3,100,000 jobs.\n  With respect to being in decline, we have none other than Lee Kuan \nYew, and I quote:\n\n       America is not the surplus country. It is Japan and \n     Germany. It is New York with the expertise but Tokyo and Bonn \n     with the actual cash.\n\n  ``The greatest problem for Americans,'' he said, ``was coming to \nterms emotionally with this shift, accepting in our guts that there is \na permanent change in competitive position.''\n  Mr. President, read this language and listen to it very, very \nclearly. Talking about GATT agreements, ``These agreements, saying it \nword for word, offer new opportunities for all Americans. For American \nfarmers the agreements expand world markets for American farm products. \nFor American workers the agreements offer more jobs, higher income and \nmore effective responses to unfair competition.\n  That was none other than Robert Strauss in 1979, the Tokyo round \nunder which we are in. What did his Texas colleague and our good friend \nand former chairman of the Finance Committee say in 1987 with respect \nto that particular Tokyo round in 1987? I am reading word-for-word, \nbecause we never seem to learn. We listen to the same babble, \ntechnobabble and statistical babble, but we do not look at the reality. \nHere is what Senator Bentsen in the Finance Committee itself reported:\n\n       The Committee is concerned that the Tokyo round trade \n     negotiations and the legislative branch and executive branch \n     actions to implement the Tokyo round trade agreements, have \n     not had the effect of improving the American standard of \n     living as intended. Perhaps worst of all--\n\n  Listing many things.\n\n     the composition of the merchandise trade deficit has changed \n     from mainly an oil deficit--\n\n  Talking about oil jobs, which was bad enough.\n\n     to mainly a manufacturing and agricultural deficit, which \n     strikes at the heart of U.S. export strength.\n       Agricultural exports alone have fallen from about $40 \n     billion in 1980 to about $25 billion in 1987. And if \n     petroleum prices in 1986 had been the same as in 1980, then \n     the 1986 trade deficit could well have been over $200 \n     billion. The mainstays of American trade competitiveness are \n     in trouble.\n\n  This is the now Secretary of Treasury.\n\n       By last year, West Germany surpassed the United States as \n     the world's leading exporter and Japan had 10 percent of the \n     world's exports in 1986, compared so 10.3 percent for the \n     United States, who may well move into second place in 1987. \n     The size and composition of the trade deficit have caused \n     retching adjustments on the American farm and American \n     industry and among American workers. For example, the \n     widening trade deficit reduced real potential GNP by nearly \n     20 percent in 1983 and 1984, according to the International \n     Trade Commission. The National Association of Manufacturers \n     found that 2 million fewer jobs were created as a result of \n     the growth of the trade deficit in this period. The deficit \n     deterioration of American high-wage industrial employment \n     concentrated employment growth this decade in the lower-wage \n     service sector.\n\n  Mr. President, how can you do it any better than that? What happens \nis, as we put in the Record on yesterday from Lars Erik Nelson--and I \nhave the entire article. I will read a paragraph:\n\n       The economists keep foisting their theory on the Clinton \n     administration. No proposition enjoys greater unanimity among \n     economists than the idea that free trade will, on net, be a \n     win-win situation, says Bob Shapiro, a nondogmatic economist \n     at the Progressive Policy Institute. This is why, Shapiro \n     says, economists close their eyes to the social cost of free \n     trade. They don't know how to deal with the problem, but they \n     can't give up the economics of free trade. The fact is there \n     are significant social costs.\n\n  That is what the election in November was all about. Here we have 40 \nmillion living in poverty. Their take-home pay is 20 percent less; they \nare working longer hours and being paid less. We have gone from the \nbiggest creditor Nation to the biggest debtor Nation. Our \nmanufacturing, since 1985, has gone from 26 percent of the work force \ndown to 16 percent. And the inner cities are in turmoil with crime and \ndrugs and deprivation. Yet, they are telling us we are on ``a rising \ntide,'' as they said in the Washington Post. There is no rising tide. \nWe are going out of business, and the social costs are there. Here the \ngroup that came to town for the middle class, Mr. President, is \ndecimating the middle class.\n  I heard the Senator from Texas earlier today say if he had a \nRepublican President, he would vote for this. Well, on this particular \ntrade policy, he has a Republican President, I can tell you this now, \nbecause we are not protecting the middle class, the jobs, and we are \nnot striking out against the social instability caused by the \nunemployment, not striking out against the deficits caused by \nunemployment compensation, increased health and welfare costs, \nincreased crime costs, and the like. We are not doing it. We are \nexacerbating it here with this debate this afternoon and with this \nvote.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeConcini). Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose time does the Senator seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina has assured me that I might have 14 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from South Carolina yield 14 \nminutes?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the time remaining to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, GATT is a budget buster, any way you want to \nslice it. By itself, GATT would increase the deficit by more than $25 \nbillion over the next 10 years. To partially offset this deficit \nincrease, the pending bill includes a number of so-called ``revenue \nraisers,'' several of which I find very questionable.\n  Among those provisions is one which would repeal the 4-percent \nstatutory minimum interest rate on U.S. savings bonds. Under current \nrules, a person can lose, at most, one month of interest. Under the \nrepeal contained in this bill, a purchaser of U.S. savings bonds can \nlose up to 6 months worth of interest.\n  In other words, to help pay for this trade deal, we have gone so far \nas to undermine the U.S. savings bond. That same bond that we have for \ngenerations given to our grandchildren and to our sons and daughters \nwill no longer be quite the dependable, sound investment it has been \nfor decades--so that we can pay for GATT.\n  While this GATT Uruguay round agreement may arguably be good for U.S. \nbusinesses, U.S. workers are placed at a competitive disadvantage under \nthis agreement.\n  For businesses in developing countries, and motivated by a \n``greatest-profits-at-lowest-cost'' mentality, a return to the world of \nDickensonian sweatshops populated by underpaid, overworked, uneducated, \nand uncomplaining children will be irresistible.\n  For example, the export of U.S. jobs overseas has hit my own State of \nWest Virginia hard over the years, as U.S. trade liberalization has \nmade it more advantageous for firms to move manufacturing and assembly \njobs overseas while still retaining easy access to the U.S. \nmarketplace. While part of this decline is due to improvements in \nmechanization that require fewer workers to produce the same level of \noutput, jobs in the coal mining industry in West Virginia have declined \n28 percent just since 1988.\n  The once-thriving glassware and pottery industries in West Virginia \nhave fallen victim to overseas competition as well. Jobs in the stone, \nclay, and glass products industries have declined 68 percent since \n1960, dropping from 22,400 jobs to just 7,100 jobs in 1993, according \nto the Department of Labor. Tariff reductions will not help those \ncompanies.\n  I am not generally opposed to trade agreements if those agreements \nare good for the United States and its workforce. But let me make clear \nthat this country and the U.S. workforce in West Virginia and \nthroughout the Nation are this Senator's paramount concerns.\n  There is a lot of leeway granted in this agreement to developing \ncountries. The aid is to help improve the economies and the standards \nof living in other nations.\n  Free trade is fine, but fair trade should be our goal. Yes, our \nworkers are among the most productive in the world, but how can they \nhope to continue to compete with workers who are willing to toil for 50 \ncents an hour or 25 cents an hour?\n  I cannot support the new, slick trend toward one-worldism which seems \nto be emerging with this agreement. It is almost as if some people in \nthis country feel that the United States should sacrifice so that other \nnations can grow--that Uncle Sam ought to blush if the United States \nprospers much more than other nations.\n  To that point of view I say, beware of the ``idiot who praises with \nenthusiastic tone, all centuries but this and every country but his \nown.''\n  Support for this agreement flies in the face of the results of the \nrecent election. Look at these poll figures. This poll was taken by the \nYankelovich Partners survey, November 23 through November 27, 1994.\n  Do you favor or oppose passing GATT?\n  Fifty-one percent oppose; 33 percent favor; 16 percent not sure.\n  What about the budget wavier on GATT? Is it inappropriate or \nappropriate?\n  Sixty-seven percent inappropriate; twenty percent appropriate; \nthirteen percent not sure.\n  What about deferring GATT over to the 104th Congress?\n  Sixty-three percent say defer it to a new Congress; 29 percent say \nlet the old Congress do it; 8 percent not sure.\n  Then, what about the WTO and U.S. law? Do you think the World Trade \nOrganization should be able to override the laws of member nations?\n  Seventy-two percent say ``no''; 17 percent say ``yes''; and 11 \npercent say ``not sure.''\n  So, Mr. President, the people's view is clear. Only in this \nconvoluted Capitol City could doing what the people want ever be \nperceived as bad for the President.\n  Some Senators have said to me that putting GATT over into the next \nCongress would damage the President if this waiver is rejected. Not \naccording to these polls. Not according to these polls. In my view, \nrejecting this agreement as it presently stands would be doing a \nservice to the President because it would give him time to go back to \nthe table and get a better agreement--one that the people can support, \nas reflected in the poll. Those who support this Agreement now may say \nthat they like what they are getting, but they may, in the final \nanalysis, not get what they like.\n  It is a fig leaf that has been concocted by our distinguished \nRepublican leader and the administration. First, the Review Commission \ncannot even review the record of the GATT panels, since the proceedings \nwill be secret.\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate who read the Scriptures, and I \ntake it that Members do read the Scriptures, will remember Ezekiel and \nthe valley of the dry bones. Senators have probably heard sermons on \nthat scripture. The spirit of the Lord sat Ezekiel down in the valley \nof the dry bones. The Lord told Ezekiel to speak prophecies unto the \ndry bones and God would put sinews and flesh and skin on them; bones \nwould be joined together, the four winds would breathe breath into \nthese bones and they would come to life.\n  Mr. President, the Lord God kept his promise to Ezekiel. Flesh and \nsinews came upon the bones, and they lived, and stood upon their feet. \nThose old dry bones became an exceeding great army.\n  Mr. President, there will be no life breathed into this dry bone that \nhas been worked out between the minority leader and the Administration. \nThis fix will not work. This miracle will not work. This dry bone is a \ndry bone is a dry bone is a dry bone. And no amount of hocus pocus is \ngoing to change it.\n  Here is the dry bone. Here it is in my hand. Here is the dry bone put \nout by the Bureau of National Affairs containing an explanation of the \nagreement between the Clinton Administration and Mr. Dole.\n  Well, this dry bone will only serve as a rhetorical cover for \nSenators to vote for something that is seriously flawed.\n  This is an agreement in disguise. It is the Mrs. Doubtfire trade \nagreement. What you see is not necessarily anything like what you may \nget.\n  Moreover, the WTO cannot be fixed by the Dole legislation. First, the \nReview Commission cannot even review the record of the panels, since \nthe proceedings are secret.\n  Second, the idea that we would withdraw from the WTO after three \nadverse decisions in a five-year period flies in the face of a history \nin which we have never withdrawn from any important international \norganization. It would take a resolution passed by both Houses, and \nmost probably over a President's veto--a highly unlikely scenario.\n  So this is a fig leaf only serving as rhetorical cover for Senators \nto vote for something that is seriously flawed and can be manipulated \nregularly against the best interests of our country and our people.\n  This fix is in the time-honored tradition of such legendary promises \nas, ``The check is in the mail.'' It ranks right up there with, ``Yes, \nI will still love you tomorrow,'' and ``Don't call me, I'll call you.''\n  Unless one's I.Q. is lower than the air temperature, it should be \nplain that none of these so-called promises can be counted on. Neither \ncan the Senate count on this so-called fix.\n  Hanging one's hat or one's vote on this so-called future fix may \nproduce nothing but future shock. It is like trying to hang one's hat \non a greasy flagpole. The hat will not stay and the people will not buy \nthis fix as a cover for a bad vote.\n  The President and others argue that to delay action until next year \nwill kill the GATT.\n  Here we see this headline on Business Week, ``Delay Will Mean the \nDeath of GATT.'' Don't you believe it. Don't you believe it.\n  That is a bogus scare tactic. The thing that might really kill GATT \nis scrutiny by 100 Senators and the discovery that it is a mega-turkey. \nThe implementing legislation can be introduced again next year, and we \nhave until next July to approve it. No other major nation's legislature \nhas approved it--everyone is waiting to see what good old Uncle Sam \nwill do. So there is no rush.\n  We hear the siren song of doom from the rafters of the White House. \nThe dead will live again and flourish. Jesus, according to the \nscriptures, brought Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, back to \nlife. Jesus brought back to life the son of the widow of Nain. He \nbrought back to life the daughter of Jairus. And Elisha breathed new \nlife into the child of the Shunammite woman. Let me assure Senators \nthat miracles are not over. If this budget waiver is rejected today, \nthis matter will only be put over until next year. It will be child's \nplay for the spin doctors, for the trading giants to breathe life into \nthe treaty. Just you wait and see what happens if we sustain the budget \npoint of order. Then the spin doctors will go to work.\n  All our major allies will be brought together, those who have all \nbeen sitting on their hands, like Japan and our European allies, \nwaiting to see what we will do. You can bet that if this Agreement is \nso great for everyone, there will be a rush for airline tickets to get \non planes bound for Geneva. The restaurateurs in Geneva will be putting \nin extra supplies of turkey for the occasion.\n  I would also argue that delay is not always bad. It does wonderful \nthings for a cheese and and old wines and old violins. Delay will not \nkill this treaty. Delay may well improve this Agreement. I have every \nconfidence that our President and our trade negotiators who have \nlistened to this debate could then negotiate a better agreement in the \nmonths ahead.\n  The argument that delay until next year would kill the Uruguay \nAgreement is a G-string under the fig leaf of the so-called ``fix'' we \nhave all heard about. It is the last argument. If all else fails, \nproponents can claim that a delay will kill this Agreement.\n  For these extremely important budget, institutional, and political \nreasons, I believe that the legislation before us today should be \ndeferred until the next Congress, at a time when Senators will have had \nthe time to study the Agreement more closely, and when there is ample \ntime for debate and deliberation. And the way to accomplish this is to \nvote against the waiver.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from South Carolina \nhas expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, how much time is left on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 1 hour and 4 \nminutes. The Senator from New York has 35 minutes.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I think it was Disraeli, but I would not \nbet the mortgage on that, who once said there are three kinds of lies. \nThere are lies, there are damned lies, and then there are statistics.\n  We have heard the statement made over and over that for every $1 \nbillion of imports, 20,000 jobs are lost. That figure is premised on a \nstudy that said for every $1 billion of exports, 20,000 jobs are \ncreated. And those who choose to take that statistic and use it in \ntheir favor on imports has simply turned it on its head, as if 20,000 \njobs for $1 billion of exports means 20,000 jobs lost with $1 billion \nof oil imports.\n  Let me give you just two examples, then I have other points to touch \non, where this just is not true.\n  I have talked several times about the import of oil in this country. \nWe imported last year about $44 billion worth of oil. We import this \noil because we do not have, or have not chosen to look for, in one way \nor another, to get oil out of the ground in this country. We need the \noil.\n  First, the drilling for and the extraction of oil is capital \nintensive, not labor intensive. I doubt that there are 20,000 jobs \nassociated with $1 billion worth of oil exports or $1 billion worth of \noil imports.\n  But I want you to think what would happen in this country if we did \nnot import $44 billion of oil. Do you think if we did not import it, we \nwould create 880,000 jobs? That is 20,000 jobs for every $1 billion of \nimports.\n  I will tell you what would happen if we did not import $44 billion of \noil in this country. We would have an absolutely up- to-your neck \ndepression in this country because this country runs on oil. We \ngenerate electricity with it; our industries run on it; we run our cars \non it. And we do not have the capacity in this country to produce it \nimmediately.\n  I had indicated earlier we could produce it if we wanted to make it \nout of coal. We have a 400-year supply of coal, but it is expensive to \nmake oil out of coal.\n  I had the Library of Congress check for me--and I want to give them \ncredit again, the Congressional Research Service, for the extraordinary \nresearch they do, because I only asked them yesterday.\n  South Africa, of course, has produced oil out of coal for years. They \nhad a trade embargo when the white-only government was in power and \nthey could not import, so they had to produce it. And they have lots of \nnatural resources. They produced oil out of coal and gasoline out of \noil, but it was very expensive.\n  The Library of Congress said, yes, we have enough coal to make oil \nout of it. If we did, the Library of Congress' estimate is--and they \ndid not want me to hold them too closely to it--that the cost of \ngasoline, if we produced it from coal in this country, would be between \n$3 and $4 a gallon instead of what we pay for it now. And, of course, \nhome heating oil would go up equivalently; the oil we use to generate \nelectricity would go up equivalently. I have no idea what that would do \nto inflation. I have not asked the Library of Congress to check about \nthe impact of an increase in inflation, which would in turn increase \ninterest rates, home mortgage rates, and everything else. My hunch is \nthat approach is not going to help this country.\n  So let us put this bogeyman--that because we are importing $44 \nbillion worth of oil, we are losing 880,000 jobs--to rest.\n  Now, let me move to a study my friend from South Carolina, Senator \nHollings, has cited over and over and over again. This is a study by \nCharles McMillion. He is a business consultant who testified against \nthe GATT before the Commerce Committee. Mr. McMillion took this 20,000 \nfigure and he calculated, therefore, what every State would lose in \nterms of jobs based upon $1 billion of imports in that State.\n  States have customs districts which keep track of imports. Oregon \nimported about $1.6 billion in imports through the Portland customs \ndistrict. Therefore, he multiplied 1.6 times 20,000 and said Oregon \nwould lose 32,000 jobs. Mr. McMillion says Oregon will lose 32,000 jobs \nbecause of imports.\n  Well, Portland is the fourth largest importer of cars in the United \nStates. Different ports excel at different things. Portland excels at \nimporting cars. As a matter of fact, we are also the largest exporter \nfor Hondas in the United States. They are made in Marysville, OH, \ntrucked to Portland, and off they go throughout the world.\n  For the moment, just stick with the imports. Do you think that Oregon \nwould have more jobs or fewer jobs in Oregon if we did not import cars? \nWe do not make any cars in Oregon, but we do have longshoremen that \nunload cars and we have teamsters that drive the trucks upon which the \ncars are loaded. We have a rather thriving little industry in Portland \non importing cars. We are not going to lose jobs because of these \nimports. We gain jobs.\n  That is the trouble with statistics. So I want to put aside \nstatistics and I want to talk about real world cases, if I might.\n  Before I do, I want to emphasize the principal thing the United \nStates asked out of this trading negotiation. I am going to quote a \nvery short sentence from the Trade Act of 1988.\n\n       The principal negotiating objective of the United States \n     with respect to dispute settlement is to provide for more \n     effective and expeditious regulation of the disputes and \n     enable better enforcement of United States rights.\n\n  We bring far more cases in the GATT--we have not yet gotten to the \nWorld Trade Organization; it is not established yet--complaining about \noverseas trade practices than are brought against us. Say we get into a \ndispute with Germany and we ask a GATT panel to look into it. The GATT \npanel is a group that listens to the two sides and says who is right \nand who is wrong. Under the current GATT arrangement, even if we win, \nit is not enforceable unless the loser agrees.\n  Well, the loser never liked us to begin with. That is why we are \nhaving this dispute panel settle things. So we insisted in the Uruguay \nround negotiations that these panel decisions involving trade disputes \nbetween countries have some modicum of enforcement.\n\n  Under GATT, and I see no reason it is going to change under the World \nTrade Organization, we won 80 percent of all the cases in which we were \na complainant. It is no wonder we want them enforceable. And it is \nunderstandable why we bring more cases. We are a more open country. We \nallow things easier into this country than other countries allow into \ntheir countries. And we are asking for a level playing field. We want \nin. We want as much access to their countries as they have to ours.\n  The reason we brought all these cases in the past is that we have not \nhad that access and this trade agreement that we are about to enact--\nand I am confident we have the votes to enact it--is going to lower the \nbarriers for our getting into these countries. The agreement makes \nthese panel decisions enforceable unless all of the countries to the \npanel agree not to enforce it. It is just the opposite of what we had \nbefore.\n  Before you had to have all of the countries that are a part of the \npanel dispute agree to enforce the panel decision. Under this new \nagreement, the panel decision is enforceable unless all of the \ncountries disagree. The only reason that would happen is as follows: \nThe United States has a case with Germany. We win. And then Germany \nsays, ``OK, you win. Now we negotiate some kind of agreement. You have \nwon. We concede that, but we really do not want to give up on what you \nhave won but we will give you some other trading preference.'' And we \nnegotiate and say OK. Then both parties would agree not to enforce the \npanel decision. And that is going to happen from time to time with both \nsides. So we have won in the GATT what we hoped we would win.\n  I listened to Senator Byrd from West Virginia talk about industries \nin his State and what is happening. I want to take just a cross-section \nof industries in Oregon. Not necessarily unique, not just timber \nproducts--we are a big timber producer--but a cross-section, and give \nyou an example of what industries big and small can do in foreign \ntrade.\n  Take Smith Frozen Foods, of Weston, OR. Weston is a town 225 miles \neast of Portland in the modestly populated wheat and cattle section of \nour State. Smith Frozen Foods almost went bankrupt 10 years ago. Then \nthe young son of the founder took it over and built it up, now, to 800 \nemployees. It processes frozen peas, carrots, corn, and beans and what \nnot. About 125 of the 800 employees are pretty much directly related to \nthe sale of the products overseas.\n  I might say, the founder's son is an extraordinary man. In fact this \nbody would appreciate his success. He spent 10 years building up this \nbusiness. Then, in 1992, he decided to go into politics and was elected \nto the Oregon State Senate in November of 1992 and took office in \nJanuary of 1993. Perhaps in May or June of 1993 the Republican leader \nin the Oregon State Senate resigned, for whatever reason. And this \nyoung man, Gordon Smith, was selected as the leader in his first 4 \nmonths in the legislature.\n  The Republicans took control of the senate this year and he will be \nthe senate president in his second session of the senate. This is an \nextraordinary talent at business and politics. That is Smith Frozen \nFoods.\n  Another company is Met One of Grants Pass, OR. Grants Pass is a town \nof 15,000, 260 or 270 miles south of Portland and about 450 miles north \nof San Francisco. Again, here we have a very small town with a small \nairport and a trucking service on the interstate. It is not a major \nmetropolitan area. Met One makes indoor pollution monitoring devices, \nespecially lab equipment monitoring devices. It has 110 employees, 35 \nof them related to sales overseas. This business is growing \ntremendously. As we are becoming more pollution conscious throughout \nthe world, both indoors and outdoors, this company is doing very well.\n   Medford Steel, of Medford, OR, is another company 300 miles south of \nPortland and about 400 miles north of San Francisco. It makes \nindustrial parts for mining and manufacturing and has 135 employees, 40 \nof them related to overseas trade.\n  Sabroso, I have talked about so often on this floor, is also located \nin Medford, OR, has 160 employees, about half of them involved in \nforeign trade. This company takes fruit and makes a puree out of it. It \nis the largest supplier of the base for baby foods for the three \nprincipal baby foods in the United States: Beechnut, Heinz and \nGerber's. I used posters yesterday showing labels from their cans: one \nin Arabic, one in Spanish. They sell all over the world. They look at \nthis agreement as an absolute bonanza and an opportunity. Operating out \nof Medford, OR.\n  Wing-Lynch makes photo-processing equipment. It is a small company, \n23 employees; 5 of them responsible for foreign trade.\n  Enway is one of my favorites. Enway, a 20-employee firm, sells \neverything they make overseas. They make frozen processed potatoes and \nthey have found some way--secret or not--of processing them and selling \nthem overseas and doing it wonderfully and successfully.\n  Then let me mention a couple of lumber companies. North Douglas Wood \nProducts in Drain, OR, is 200 miles away from Portland; 65 of their 70 \nemployees were involved in overseas sales. Starfire Lumber in Cottage \nGrove has a similar experience.\n  One of my favorites, though, is Vanport Lumber, because I remember a \nparticular circumstance. You have to understand the humor in some of \nthis, as to how old-line American industries look at things as opposed \nto newer industries. When I first came to the Senate, elected in 1968, \none of the big debates we were having with the Japanese and with other \ncountries was over what we called size standards. We wanted them to buy \nour two-by-fours. Of course, do not worry they are on the metric system \nand they do not measure the same way we do. Any other normal business \nsays, ``What does my customer want? I will make it for my customer.'' \nThe American wood products industry wanted Japan to change its \nmeasuring standards so that they could buy our standard two-by-fours.\n  Japan is very conscious about high-quality wood with their post and \nbeam interior construction and exposed wood. They do not want bad wood \nand they want it exactly measured. We must have gone through 10 years \nof this debate on size standards.\n  Then along comes Adolf Hertrich. I think he was either Swiss or \nGerman by birth and spoke English with a Germanic accent. I do not \nthink he had a background, really, in lumber. I do not know when he \ncame to this country or how, but he forms this Vanport Lumber Co. and \nproduces lumber using relatively outmoded equipment, as a matter of \nfact, then. He was convinced you could crack this Japanese market and \nhe had enough money to last initially 2 or 3 years.\n  He would go over there and explain this is what he could do and he \nwould show the quality he could produce. Then ``no, they were not \nsatisfied yet.'' Finally, in about 1981, he got the Japanese to agree \nthey would send an inspector over and look at his plant. He would have \nto pay for it, have to put him up, have to feed him, but the inspector \nwould come over and look at his plant and maybe they would buy some \nthings if he could do what they wanted. He had a Japanese inspector \nover for a couple of years. Finally, by 1983 he convinced them he \ncould, indeed, produce the wood they wanted. They did not have to have \ntheir inspectors there anymore. And hallelujah, it had taken him 5 \nyears to get to this place.\n  I did not know him at this time. I discovered him in about 1984 when \nhe calls me and he has a problem. Bear in mind he has 220 employees and \nis selling all of his product to Japan. He calls me because the \nInternal Revenue Service refused to let him deduct a Japanese tea house \nhe had built on his property to show buyers when they came over. IRS \nsaid this is not an ordinary and necessary business expense. You do not \nneed a tea house.\n  He says all I do is sell to the Japanese. They use this wood for tea \nhouses. I want to show them what we have.\n  I went out there. Picture this. Here is Adolf Hertrich, speaking with \nhis Germanic English. My chief of staff is an English woman who speaks \nlike Eliza Doolittle at the end of ``My Fair Lady'' with very proper \nEnglish. Then there was a Japanese buyer there speaking in sort of \nJapanese English. And me--whatever. We all sit down with our feet under \nthe table in the Japanese tea house, and are served tea by a woman \ndressed in the Japanese outfit. After hearing English English from the \nadministrative assistant and Japanese-English from the Japanese buyer \nand the German-English, finally the IRS gave up and let him construct \nthe tea house. But we had to go through that. But here is an example of \na guy who says, ``I know I can do it.''\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Yes, by all means.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. On what he has been saying about this combination in \nthe State of Oregon, you are the largest importer of cars on the west \ncoast.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. We are the fourth-largest importer of cars in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And you export.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. We are the largest exporters----\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. It is a practice that has been in place, understand, as \nlong as this Republic. I took the occasion of this debate to read the \nReport on Manufacturers, Communication to the House of Representatives, \nDecember 5, 1791 from Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury. He \nwas saying we cannot, need not remain a simply pure agricultural \nnation. We can manufacture and we can trade. And he spoke the wonderful \nphrase--he had that wonderful language and he was a New Yorker at this \npoint, as you know--he spoke of those who would sacrifice the interests \nof a mutually beneficial intercourse to the vain project of selling \neverything and buying nothing. Have we not heard some of that on this \nfloor?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. As a matter of fact, that is some people's definition \nof a level playing field. They will buy from us, but we will buy \nnothing from them.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We will sell to them and we will buy nothing from them.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Take another company, a big company, Tektronics. This \nis a company founded in the 1940's or 1950's by an Oregonian. The \ncompany invented a state-of-the-art oscilloscope that sold all over the \nworld. This is the kind of business you cannot stay still in very long. \nThey were up 25,000 employees one time at the top of the market maybe \n15 or 20 years ago. They went way down. Now they have branched into all \nother kinds of things. They have about 4,500 employees, which is big \nfor Oregon. It would be big in New York. Two thousand of their \nemployees are directly involved in sales overseas in high-tech computer \nproducts.\n  Morale II is a research subsidiary of United Parcel Service. They \ncame up with a device to keep track of where packages were in the \ndelivery system. I visited them when they were experimenting with the \ndevice.\n  But they thought to themselves, ``Wait a minute, wouldn't this be a \nwonderful thing for police departments,'' or ``Wouldn't this be a \nwonderful thing for any company that delivers to be able to, by \nsatellite, communicate up and back and on your screen have an entire \ngrid of a city you can push buttons and change the grid and exactly \ntell where your truck is in the city.''\n  The police thought it was a wonderful idea. They can tell exactly \nwhere the police car is. Without even having to call them, you know \nwhere it is.\n  This company has been very successful in moving beyond just products \nfor the United Parcel Service. Obviously, navigation equipment is a \nnatural.\n  Lektro is located in Warrenton, OR, on the Oregon coast, about 110 \nmiles from Portland. It is a small company with 20 employees. They make \naircraft towing devices. Those things you see hooked up on the front of \ntrucks that drag planes around. They sell these all over the country \nand are involved in world trade. When I first saw them, they were \noperating out of an old airplane hangar. They are very successful.\n  Yesterday, I mentioned Denton Plastics. They are a fun company. I \ndiscovered, by the way, since yesterday, they have 40 employees. Denton \nrecycles plastics, such as, the sacks from grocery stores, the sacks \nfrom dry cleaners, and plastic wraps from frozen food. They put them \ninto something like a vat and heat it quickly. They turn it, grind it, \ntake all the color out, and it comes out in little black pellets. Then \nthey sell them around the world in Korea, in China. People make toys, \ngarbage pails, et cetera, out of the pellets. Denton, with 40 \nemployees, is the biggest company north of Los Angeles and west of the \nMississippi River in this business. Denton is an excellent example that \nyou do not have to be a big company to be, relatively speaking, a giant \nin an industry.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I have learned that.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. This is the amazing thing we all learned in our States. \nI wager the Senator from New York has had the same experience. You go \naround and run across companies you never heard of that are doing very \nwell in foreign trade, and they have a handful of employees. They have \na niche that they are doing well at.\n  So when people say America cannot compete, I just look at these \nexamples in Oregon of all kinds of different companies. But there is \nalmost one thing they all have in common: Brains and patents, \ntrademarks or copyrights--intellectual property, as we call them--\nthings that they have thought up that nobody else thought up and they \nhave protected with a patent or a copyright and they are selling it \naround the world.\n  If there is any single thing where there is a quantum leap forward in \nthis GATT agreement, it is in the protection of what we call \nintellectual property, patents, copyrights, trademarks around the \nworld. All it can do is benefit these companies.\n  I will make one last comment about these companies. Not a single one \nof these companies is a minimum-wage company. Some of them are not high \nwage, but there is not a single one that is minimum wage. Some of them \nare in the $7 to $8 an hour bracket, some in the $9 to $10, some of \nthem more. But how often have we heard on this floor that you cannot \ncompete with Bangladesh or India paying $1, $1.50 an hour? Without \nexception, every one of these companies is competing.\n  I will use a last example, and then I will close because this is a \ncompany everyone has probably heard of: Freightliner. They make those \nlarge trucks and cabs that you see on the highway. Freightliner has a \nlarge plant in Portland with over 2,000 workers, a large plant in North \nCarolina with over 2,000 workers, and another plant in Cleveland, NC. \nThis is high-wage employment.\n  In Portland, the plant is unionized, organized by the International \nAssociation of Machinists. At the high end of their production floor \nworkers, counting fringe benefits, earn about $25 an hour. About a \nthird of that is fringe benefits, and that is the high end of the \nproduction work.\n  At the moment, there is a 20 percent tariff on trucks going into \nMexico. So Freightliner packages up its trucks in kit form and sends \nthem to Mexico where they are assembled. If you send them that way, the \ntariff does not apply. At the moment, about 10 kits a day are going out \nof the North Carolina plant to Mexico.\n  I talked to the president of the company yesterday morning. He said \nthe 20 percent tariff is scheduled to come down to zero in the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement with Mexico. Around 1998, the tariff will \nbe reduced enough where it will be economically justifiable to make the \nentire truck in the United States instead of the kit.\n  At that stage, they are going to quit sending the kits to Mexico and \nmake the trucks here and send them down in final form. Their U.S. \nworkers make $25 an hour. Do not tell me we cannot compete.\n  Freightliner just landed a contract with Israel for 800 to 1,200 \ntrucks which will be made in its North Carolina plant. That is a big \norder, having to compete with trucks apparently made in India or trucks \napparently made in Brazil, or wherever trucks are made. Do not tell me \nwe cannot compete.\n  Tonight, in about an hour, we are going to have a chance to vote up \nor down on this agreement. A vote for this agreement is a vote to give \nthe green light to the best companies in America--and they are not all \nbig, most of them, as a matter of fact, are small--to compete \nthroughout this world on a much fairer basis than they have been able \nto compete to date.\n  A no vote is a vote to say, no, we really cannot do it when State \nafter State, company after company, even under adverse circumstances \ntoday, are proving they can do it.\n  So I say to the chairman, Senator Moynihan, it has been a thrilling \ntime working with him on this. There are moments when he and I had some \nfears and trepidations, I think. I cross my fingers; I think we now \nhave the votes. For the good of this country, I hope in the next hour \nthat overwhelmingly we pass this agreement.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I congratulate my future chairman \nand past chairman for the extraordinarily important exposition of the \nproposition. We are told that the Fortune 500 have not added an \nemployee in the last 10 years. That is because American enterprise is \nworking. Firms with 20 are going to 30. That is a 50-percent increase. \nAnd they are working all over the world.\n  If I may just one last time invoke that great West Indian, New \nYorker, Alexander Hamilton, and his report on manufacturers, who talked \nabout those misguided nations which sacrificed the interests of a \nmutually beneficial intercourse to the vain project of selling \neverything and buying nothing. It cannot be done. He saw the future, \nand it is here. The future is now. And the future will be ours if we \nseize it this evening. In an hour's time, we shall have the \nopportunity.\n  I have the great honor and pleasure to yield 10 minutes to the \nlearned, indefatigable--a great citizen, a great citizen of \nPennsylvania--Senator Wofford.\n  Mr. WOFFORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Wofford].\n  Mr. WOFFORD. Mr. President, that gentleman from the West Indies and \nNew Yorker, Alexander Hamilton, began the Federalist Papers, as I \nrecall the first sentence, the first proposition, by saying that it is \nreserved to the American people to determine to prove whether our fait \naccompli must be forever controlled by accident and force, or whether \nit is possible to determine it by reflection and choice.\n  I congratulate the Members of this body in these last 2 days of \ndebate for making sure that we make this important decision by \nreflection and choice.\n  Mr. President, after much thought, I rise in support of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade because I believe that on balance, it is \ngood for our country. This agreement is far from perfect. No agreement \nforged in compromise is likely to be perfect, certainly not one \nnegotiated with more than 120 nations.\n  Some of the arguments voiced by opponents of GATT are strong and \ndisturbing. They are right that GATT does not give America enough \nleverage in critical areas such as child labor, human rights, and \nenvironmental standards.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is wrong in trade negotiations for \neconomic concerns to supersede all other concerns. It is wrong for the \nconditions of child labor described by Senator Wellstone this morning \nto be ruled out of consideration in any limitations on trade.\n  On questions of economic justice, human rights, and environmental \nhealth, the world should be able to look to America for leadership. We \nhave a responsibility to provide that leadership--a responsibility that \nis not given adequate scope in the World Trade Organization provided \nfor in this agreement.\n  So in the years to come, as we work within GATT and within the new \nWorld Trade Organization, and as we move forward to negotiate new \nbilateral trade agreements, we must honor that obligation to give \nleadership and work and fight to supplement the trade-only approach of \nGATT.\n  Those of us who will be on the outside of government will have a \nresponsibility to take action in these matters. For not all of the \npressure needed to uphold America's ideals should come from government. \nMuch of it must come from private citizens.\n  When I was head of the International League for Human Rights, I often \npressed the point that the concept of human rights goes beyond just \npolitical rights. It must include abuses of human rights in the form of \nthe child labor portrayed by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Determined support by private citizens helped change our trade \npolicies with South Africa and helped bring about the changes that are \nunderway in that nation today.\n  So concern about the exploitation of labor and the unfair competition \nthat follows from it should not be the province solely of the American \nlabor movement. It should be the concern of this Congress and of the \nAmerican people at large.\n  Let me add another vital point for the future American agenda.\n  While I believe GATT will benefit most industries and most Americans, \nsome industries and some workers and their families will suffer, at \nleast in the short term.\n  In Pennsylvania, the textile and dairy industries--both already hard \npressed--will lose certain protections on which they have come to rely.\n  We should take special responsibility for the fait accompli of such \nindustries. This includes a responsibility to help those men and women \nwho lose their jobs to learn new skills and pursue new opportunities. \nThat will come to the fore when this Congress turns next year to the \nreemployment bill that is before it. These industries need our special \nconcern and help.\n  Despite these strong reservations that I have just added my voice to, \nI will be casting my vote in favor of GATT for the reasons that have \nbeen eloquently given in this body already in the last 2 days because, \non balance, I am convinced it is good for the economy of Pennsylvania \nand good for the American economy, because I believe it will, in not \nmany years, prove not to increase our deficit but to reduce it; because \nI believe it would be wrong to go back to the drawing board after so \nmany long years of negotiations; and because I have faith in America's \nability to compete successfully and to provide leadership, leadership \nfor human rights as well in the global economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask that the time be charged equally to each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, we are in the \nclosing moments now of an epic debate, a defining moment in American \nhistory. It has been said that the vote we will cast this evening is \ncomparable to votes--a half dozen, at most, in the 20th century--such \nas the Marshall Plan, to name but one. We are going to define the \nAmerican future on how we vote this morning.\n  We are about to hear from our leaders, after which time the votes \nwill commence. It cannot be stated too strongly that we are choosing a \nfuture for the United States, and the distinguished chairman-to-be of \nthe Committee on Finance and I feel confident; we feel ebullient, if I \nmay say. Sixty years of American foreign trade policy that began with \nCordell Hull and Franklin Roosevelt in the depths of our Depression and \nthe world depression in 1934, in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, \nculminating now in the Congress--as Cordell Hull called it, a \n``Congress of international trade'' in a speech on the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives in 1916. It is not a large one. The World \nTrade Organization has 450 employees--the GATT, rather--after 40 years. \nIt is contemplated that an additional 15 will be employed now. But a \nworld trading system will be in place for settling disputes, for making \nagreements, and for creating a future.\n  I am confident that we will make the right choice, Mr. President, \nhugely acknowledged not only by your support but by Members on both \nsides of the aisle. I make the simple point that this measure was \nreported from the Committee on Finance 19-0. I do not know that the \nmargin will be quite that emphatic in the next hour, but I hope it will \nbe sufficient so that the world will know that the United States has \nnot only led the world to this moment, but means to continue to do so.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum, the time to be charged equally to the two parties.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague, Senator \nMoynihan, the chairman of the committee, and Senator Packwood. I have \nbeen listening to some of the debate, and I certainly know of the \nimpact their statements have had.\n  Let me say also that we sort of reached the point right now, the \nmoment it is going to happen, now, in the next 30 or 40 minutes. It has \nbeen 8 years in the making, 8 years, a long time.\n  I must say, just having come back from a very brief trip to the \nUnited Kingdom and Brussels, I said to Secretary Bentsen this morning \nat the White House in a meeting with the President and others who were \nundecided on this particular matter--Secretary Bentsen had been telling \nme for some time that the whole world was waiting for America to act in \na positive way--I said, Lloyd, by ``the whole world'' you mean \neverybody is waiting for the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House to vote on \nGATT? He said yes, nearly the whole world.\n  I want to confirm that statement, because while we were in Belgium, \nBrussels, we talked about NATO we talked about Bosnia. But there were \nambassadors there from countries all over the world. When we were in \nLondon, we talked with the Prime Minister. I think his first question \nwas about GATT. We talked to Margaret Thatcher about GATT. I spoke at a \nmeeting last night made up of former Prime Ministers and others, people \ninterested in trade, about GATT.\n  The point I am making is this is a decision we are making today that \nis going to have impact around the world, a positive impact. And if we \ndid not act in a positive way, it would have impact, it would be a very \nnegative impact.\n  So I would start by saying that I want to thank all of my colleagues \nwho are supporting GATT, who are supporting us on the waiver of the \npoint of order, that is the critical vote.\n  I want to thank Secretary Bentsen.\n  I want to thank Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade Representative. He has \ndone an outstanding job and worked with me and others to resolve some \nof the real differences that we have and it has made a difference.\n  I want to thank the President for his efforts, and former Presidents, \nRepublicans and Democrats up and down the line, who understand the \nimportance of trade and the importance of this particular vote and this \nparticular moment, after 8 years.\n  There are a lot of countries involved and like any other big trade \nagreement, it was up and it was down, and people thought it was going \nto break down. People walked away, and they came back. But anyway we \npersevered and finally got it worked out, and about the eighth round of \nnegotiations finally concluded last December.\n  I think it is fair to say, because there are critics--and I have said \nmany times we are getting about 2,000 phone calls a day in our office \nopposed to GATT, two or three slip in in favor of GATT--if you took the \nphone calls that this is a measure of support in America, you could say \nthere is no reason to bring this matter before the Senate. Many of the \ncallers are certainly well-intentioned. Many of the calls are \norchestrated. Many of the callers have a strong point of view. Many of \nthe callers are critical of any of us who even think about even trying \nto fix it, they are just flat against it, they want it killed, they do \nnot want any trade agreement, they are concerned about sovereignty and \nother issues that I will discuss later. But I must say most of the \ncallers are well-intentioned and they are concerned, concerned about \ntheir jobs, concerned about their children, concerned about something.\n  So I think we need to state for the record this is not a perfect \nagreement. On the way back last night I had a big book, it weighed \nabout 10 pounds, briefing material. I did not read the entire document, \nbut I read many, many of the arguments on the pros and cons. It is not \na perfect trade agreement. We never achieve all of our objectives. We \nhave to go back and complete the work in some of the areas, especially \nservices, including financial services, telecommunications and audio-\nvisual.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the overall economic impact of the \nUruguay round agreements I think probably has been overstated. But it \nis always the case around here that with each administration, maybe \noverstatements are made from time to time. But in this case there are \noverstatements in both directions.\n  To hear some of the supporters you would think this agreement cures \neverything but the common cold, and maybe even the common cold. If we \njust vote yes our troubles are over.\n  If you listen to the other stream on the other side, you get a \ndifferent picture.\n  We are told this is going to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, \nmaybe millions of jobs, billions of dollars. And I know for some reason \nWichita, KS sort of became the anti-GATT capital of the world, and I \nhave heard a host of statements and a lot of information, a lot of \nletters from people that I know--a hundred times worse than NAFTA, a \nstealthlike power grab by the bureaucrats, by international \nbureaucrats--and all the other arguments you heard on the floor today \nand before.\n  But I believe on balance that this is a good trade agreement. The \nbenefits certainly are going to be modest or better, but clearly going \nto be a net gain for the American people. No doubt about it, for if our \ntrade policy does not serve the American people, we ought to change it \nor we should not extend it. I am talking about the American people, the \nworking family making $20,000, $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, a year, they \nare ones who are concerned, they are the ones who, in many cases are \ncalling or going to the meetings. Others have different motives.\n  So this creation of a new trade bureaucracy is not our objective. It \nis domestic and economic growth, and increasing the standard of living \nof hardworking American families. Trade should serve the people and not \nthe other way around, and I think this does.\n  It will be tested. We will find it is not complete in many areas, we \nwill find that probably some things will have to change. This is going \nto create jobs and opportunities. I am not going to say how many jobs, \nI will leave that to the experts. But let us face it, we are going to \nbe the big beneficiary, the United States of America. Any way you cut \nit, we are the biggest beneficiary.\n  It is going to bring down tariffs worldwide, and that is why we are \ngoing to be the big beneficiary, because our tariffs are already low, \naround 4 percent. And around the rest of the world they are relatively \nhigh, around 20 percent. One-third cut in global tariffs under this \nagreement certainly means disproportionate benefits to U.S. exports. \nThat is what it is all about.\n  It means tariffs are going to be lowered, some estimate, $744 \nbillion. That is a huge reduction in the most tangible barrier to trade \nthat exists, the direct tax on imports. That is going to be reduced.\n  In some sectors--construction equipment, agricultural equipment, \nsteel, beer, distilled spirits, paper, toys and furniture--tariffs are \nnot just reduced they are eliminated, they go to zero. And these are \nthe so-called zero-for-zero products. These are sectors in which the \nU.S. producers are already very competitive. This trade agreement is \ngoing to make us even more competitive.\n  Overall, U.S. merchandise exports, it is estimated, will be over $150 \nbillion per year over the next 10 years. So maybe it is not $150 \nbillion, maybe $140, or maybe it is $160. They are estimates. But they \nare positive estimates. Let me talk about agriculture.\n  I met last week, or the week before, I guess, with representatives of \n20 different sectors of agriculture--cattle, hogs, wheat, soybeans, \nfarm bureaus, different farm groups, corn growers. There is no doubt \nthat the U.S. farmers are the most productive in the world. They are \ngoing to be forced to compete--or would have been forced to compete--\nprimarily with foreign treasuries had it not been for some changes in \nthis agreement. Because if we lower the subsidies, and we are prepared \nto do that--in fact, our subsidies are already so low it is not going \nto take additional effort from the Americans, it is going to take \nadditional effort elsewhere.\n  But our subsidies are low compared to other countries. So we are \ngoing to require not as much as we wanted to do, do not misunderstand \nme, but we are going to level out the playing field, something \nPresident Bush started and President Reagan announced years ago about \neliminating subsidies so we could compete worldwide. And if we can \ncompete, we will win more than our share of the market. That is what it \nis all about: Market access and market share.\n  Market access, as far as agriculture products that are produced in my \nState and nearly every State in the Nation, are going to increase as \ntariffs come down--we are going to expand--as nontariff barriers are \nconverted to tariffs and then reduced, and as minimum access levels are \nimplemented. These are certainly important goals if you are talking \nabout global agriculture and global agriculture trade.\n  And, again, these are estimates, but again they are expected to \nincrease exports by $4.7 billion to $8.7 billion by the year 2005. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, exports of grains and \nfeeds will increase $2 billion to $4 billion; cotton by nearly $600 \nmillion; meats, dairy, and other animal products by $1.7 billion to \n$2.5 billion. That is real money. Horticultural products by $200 \nmillion to $400 million; and oilseeds and products by $800 million to \n$1.3 billion.\n  What does that mean? It means more farm income. It means that the \naverage farm family, whether it is in New York or Kansas or Oregon or \nNew Mexico, or wherever, is going to have more income. Some estimate--\nand again these are all estimates, and I think this is where much of \nthe problem is, because nobody knows precisely where it is--but the \nestimates are it will increase agriculture income by $2.5 billion by \nthe year 2005. So we are talking about 190,000 jobs in that same \ntimeframe--190,000 jobs. That is a lot of jobs.\n  And I think one thing that we have received assurances on--and I \nwould like to put this in the Record. My colleague in the House, \nCongressman Pat Roberts, from Kansas, who will become the chairman of \nthe House Agriculture Committee starting the next Congress, does an \noutstanding job for agriculture. He is not concerned that agriculture \nmay be cut as other programs are cut, but he did not want agriculture \nsingled out by saying, ``Well, we will take it all out of agriculture \nand more out of agriculture somewhere else.''\n  So at his request, I was able to receive assurances from Leon \nPanetta, the Chief of Staff at the White House, concerning agriculture \nand agriculture programs, important not just to Kansas but other \nStates.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                                       Washington.\n     The Honorable Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: It was good to meet with you on Saturday \n     regarding a number of your concerns about the GATT \n     legislation. Lloyd Bentsen, Mickey Kantor and I felt that we \n     had a constructive discussion and are hopeful that you will \n     be joining all of us on both sides of the aisle who are \n     supporting the GATT legislation.\n       You had raised some specific concerns related to \n     agriculture, which I wanted to follow up with this brief \n     note. Overall, as you know, U.S. agriculture is projected to \n     benefit substantially from the GATT agreement. The coalition \n     of some 265 agricultural organizations who are supporting \n     GATT cite the projections that GATT will lead to increases in \n     U.S. agricultural exports by $5 to $14 billion over the next \n     5 years, which will help to create over 110,000 new jobs in \n     the agriculture sector and help to generate $10-$30 billion \n     in related economic activity throughout the U.S. economy.\n       One of your concerns was whether the Administration was \n     singling out agriculture programs for spending cuts. I can \n     reassure you that is not the case. The Administration will \n     honor the commitments in this area made by Director Rivlin \n     and Secretary Espy in their September 30, 1994 joint letters \n     to the leadership of the Senate and House Agriculture \n     Committees. Those letters committed the Administration to \n     maintaining discretionary spending on USDA agricultural \n     programs at or above the FY 1995 level in the FY 1996 and \n     1997 Budget requests to Congress. Regarding mandatory \n     programs, the Administration will consider potential spending \n     changes only in the context of its overall reviews of \n     entitlement programs and in the farm bill process.\n       You asked specifically about the Export Enhancement Program \n     (EEP) and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). With \n     respect to the EEP program, we are following through on our \n     commitment to use it to the maximum extent allowed, as \n     demonstrated by our recent EEP actions on wheat, barley, and \n     pork. In fact, for the FY 1995 budget just enacted, the \n     Administration requested full funding for EEP and it was the \n     Congress that reduced the funding by twenty percent. We have \n     also decided, as part of the implementation of GATT, to \n     reform EEP to focus on market expansion and promotion, not \n     just for combating unfair trade practices.\n       Regarding the CRP, the Administration strongly supports and \n     will propose reauthorization and extension of the CRP in \n     1995. In addition, we will take further administrative \n     actions as needed to support a continuation of the CRP at the \n     fullest possible level. That will be reflected in the FY 1996 \n     Budget baseline for FY96 and future years.\n       In the context of concerns held by wheat growers, you asked \n     if the Administration is willing to streamline the approval \n     process for EEP decisions. I am happy to report that we \n     already are moving forward on our commitment in the Rivlin/\n     Espy letters to do exactly that. As a result, the most recent \n     EEP decisions were cleared in periods ranging from one to \n     four weeks, in contrast to earlier actions which sometimes \n     took six months.\n       Finally, you raised questions about how the Administration \n     could aid the oilseed industry. Unfortunately, the funds that \n     you identified to pay for purchases of vegetable oil for food \n     assistance programs have already been included in the GATT \n     legislation to help cover the overall costs of the package. \n     However, oilseed products are specifically included in the \n     additional $600 million of ``greenbox'' export promotion \n     program levels that the Administration proposed to carry \n     forward if the GATT passes. Decisions on greenbox spending \n     will be based on criteria such as the importance of programs \n     in promoting value-added products, additionality, and other \n     criteria to be developed in consultation with the Congress.\n       Oilseeds would benefit from further reductions in trade \n     barriers. The U.S. industry took the lead on the oilseeds \n     zero-for-zero initiative in the Uruguay Round, and the \n     Administration, as stated in the Statement of Administrative \n     Action accompanying the GATT legislation, intends to pursue \n     negotiations to achieve duty reduction and elimination for \n     oilseeds. Our negotiations with China are directed in part \n     toward achieving meaningful access for U.S. agricultural \n     products, including oilseeds, to the Chinese market.\n       We appreciate the stong support for GATT that the overall \n     U.S. agriculture community has given over the past weeks. I \n     hope that the information I've provided here will reinforce \n     that support and demonstrate the seriousness of our \n     commitments to the industry.\n       I hope we will have your support in passing the GATT \n     legislation for the good of agriculture and the whole U.S. \n     economy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leon E. Panetta,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. So, on the whole, let me say very clearly that we are going \nto be able to demonstrate next year and the year after that and the \nyear after that that the GATT agreement did help the American farmer, \nthe American producers, the American rancher, and the farm families.\n  The GATT agreement also establishes for the first time rules \ngoverning intellectual property, services, and investment trade. It is \nmy hope that coverage of these areas by trade rules will especially \nbenefit the United States. We have a big trade surplus, nearly $60 \nbillion, and I think this is going to help us with that, as we bring \nrules and disciplines to trade in services that allow us to continue to \nbe the leader in global services.\n  And, again, no country in this case--and I reconfirmed this last \nnight; read it time and again to make certain I understood it. Under \nthis agreement, as opposed to previous agreements, you are not going to \nhave any single country out there be able pick and choose from the \nbenefits of the agreement, sort of ``a la carte.'' For the first time, \nthe selections on the menu must be taken all or nothing. You cannot \npick out what benefits you want and leave what does not benefit you. \nYou cannot do that anymore. So whether it is on subsidies, antidumping, \ncustoms valuation, or standards, everyone will have to observe the same \nrules. This, too, will benefit the United States, since we will not \nhave to change our practices much, while many other countries will have \nto come into conformity.\n  Now, let me say there is one aspect of the agreement that I think we \nhave had more phone calls on, more letters, more concern, more \nfrustration, than any other, and that is the question of the World \nTrade Organization. It is new. Maybe another name would have been \nbetter, any other name. When you start talking about world trade, world \nanything, people are nervous. So perhaps here, too, the benefits and \ndangers I think have been overstated. I think, judging from the \nthousands of phone calls and letters we have received, no aspect of \nthis agreement is of deeper concern to the American people.\n  I have heard from Ross Perot; I have heard from Pat Buchanan; I have \nheard from Ralph Nader; I have heard from Lane Kirkland. They are all \ngood people; all feel very strongly that this agreement ought to be \nkilled on the spot. Do not fix it. Do not fix it; kill it.\n  Well, my intent never was to kill it. My intent was to fix it. If we \ncan fix it, and it is good for America, let us fix it.\n  So while I have respect for their views and their opinions, I hope in \nfairness they will say, ``Well, maybe you did fix it a little. Maybe it \nis a little better.''\n  So there are a couple of major concerns behind the criticism of the \nWTO. One is that the WTO could produce bad decisions that might be \ngrossly unfair to U.S. interests. Now, the more I looked at the issue \nand the more I studied the issue, the less likely I feel that could \nhappen. But the other is that somehow we are diminishing or selling out \nour ``sovereignty'' if we sign up as a member of the WTO; that the WTO \nrepresents ``world government.'' And when you talk about world \ngovernment, as I say, you are fighting a lot of people.\n  The first concern seemed to me to have some real substance, Mr. \nPresident. The WTO is not just an international ``watchdog'' \norganization. It will have judicial powers, in effect. What will we do \nif the WTO decides to exercise those powers in an ``activist'' way? \nHere in the United States, our judiciary has a tradition of judicial \nrestraint, but no such tradition exists in the World Trade \nOrganization. It is a brand new organization.\n  Furthermore, decisions by the WTO dispute settlement panels will be \nautomatically adopted by the WTO, unless all members, including the \nwinning country, agree the decision should not be adopted. This is an \nimportant change from current GATT practice, which permits any country, \nunder present law, to block or veto the adoption of a decision. I \nbelieve that most of the time, this change will benefit the United \nStates since so many times in the past, we have won cases in the GATT \nonly to have the losing countries refuse to comply with the rulings \nagainst them. We win the cases, they do not comply, and nothing \nhappens. The Europeans repeatedly refused to comply with the soybean \ndecision against them, and Japan thumbed its nose at the GATT on beef \nimports. Nevertheless, in cases where the United States is the loser \nand the WTO dispute settlement panel exceeded its powers or simply made \nan arbitrary decision, it seemed to me important to have additional \nprotection.\n  And I want to make this very clear. There was a concern here. We \nbelieved it was real. We understood that people who were calling us \nwere concerned about it. They understand it, or someone else understood \nit, and had them call. So we went to work.\n  I talked to the chairman about it, Chairman Moynihan. I talked to \nSenator Packwood about it. I talked to Mickey Kantor about it. I said, \n``Mickey, what can we do? How can we fix it? I want to support the \ntrade agreement.''\n  So they agreed we needed some additional protection against decisions \nby the WTO that go beyond the WTO's authority. And we agreed that next \nyear, a dispute settlement review commission would be created to review \nWTO actions and determine whether the WTO exceeded its power and \nauthority. After three such cases, Congress would vote on whether to \nwithdraw from the WTO. It is as simple as that, Mr. President.\n  I know, ``you can withdraw in 6 months,'' but that is the Executive. \nThey are not going to withdraw. We wanted Congress to have some say. \nAnd Congress now has some say. It is going to allow us to get out if \nnecessary, if the decision is arbitrary and capricious, and we have \nabout 3 other standards. We can get out of WTO if our rights are being \ntrampled by dispute settlement panels in Geneva. I would like to have \nprinted in the Record at this point the agreement we made with the \nadministration in this area.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    The U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 23, 1994.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: Secretary Bentsen, Leon Panetta, and I \n     appreciated the chance to discuss the remaining issues of \n     concern to you in the Uruguay Round implementing legislation. \n     We believe that your concern can be addressed in a way that \n     enables you to join us in providing the leadership to bring \n     the Uruguay Round effort to a successful conclusion.\n       You have expressed concern about (1) the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO), dispute settlement, and sovereignty; and \n     (2) the change proposed in the term of patent protection. Let \n     me respond on each issue.\n       WTO, Dispute Settlement, and Sovereignty.\n       Critics of the Uruguay Round have charged that proposed WTO \n     and the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) would \n     unacceptably infringe U.S. and state sovereignty. I agree \n     that no trade agreement, whatever its economic benefits, \n     should be approved if it infringes U.S. or state sovereignty. \n     But it is clear, as I have testified many times, that the \n     critics' fears concerning sovereignty are without foundation.\n       Three Administrations--two Republican and one Democratic--\n     steadfastly safeguarded our sovereignty throughout the \n     negotiations. This year, working together on a bipartisan \n     basis, the Administration and Congress established further \n     protections for sovereignty through the implementing \n     legislation.\n       A broad range of individuals and groups of diverse views \n     across the political spectrum support the view that the \n     Uruguay Round agreements do not affect U.S. sovereignty. \n     These include Consumers Union, the Heritage Foundation, the \n     American Enterprise Institute, Judge Robert Bork, the \n     National Governors Association, the National Conference of \n     State Legislatures, Citizens for a Sound Economy, the \n     American Bar Association, just to name a few.\n       Section 102(a)(1) of the implementing legislation \n     unequivocally reaffirms that U.S. law prevails in every \n     situation over any conflicting provision of the Uruguay Round \n     agreements. Further, Articles IX and X of the WTO agreement \n     make it clear that no substantive right or obligation of the \n     U.S. can be altered or changed unless we agree. Article IX \n     establishes that the WTO will operate by consensus--just \n     as the GATT has. The charge that the United States will be \n     outvoted on important issues in a system where each \n     country has one vote is a ``scarecrow'' in the view of \n     Judge Bork. In its recent report on the WTO, the Heritage \n     Foundation posed the question: ``Does the WTO have any \n     power over the United States that could undermine U.S. \n     sovereignty?'' The Foundation's unequivocal answer was \n     ``none whatsoever''.\n       Neither the WTO nor WTO dispute settlement panels will have \n     the power to change, or order any change, in Federal, state, \n     or local laws or regulations. Only we in the United States \n     can change our laws. Longstanding practice of the GATT, \n     continued in the WTO, assures that in disputes, we will only \n     be in front of panelists approved by the United States.\n       Moreover, while the dispute settlement process is not yet \n     as open as the litigation process in the United States, it is \n     far removed from being the ``secret tribunal'' that critics \n     allege. U.S. briefs in panel cases will take into account \n     Congressional advice and the views of the public. In addition \n     we will provide prompt access to our submissions, and access \n     to at least non-confidential summaries of other WTO member \n     submissions. Panel reports will be made public as soon as we \n     receive them, and our response to any panel report will be \n     developed with Congress. Also, section 123(g)(3) of the \n     implementing legislation permits the appropriate committees \n     of Congress to vote on whether the United States should \n     comply with a panel report.\n       We have fully safeguarded the right of federal, state, and \n     local governments to protect human, plant, and animal health \n     and safety at whatever level of protection we see fit. \n     Furthermore, state governments may impose more stringent \n     standards than the Federal government and we will be free to \n     exceed international standards when necessary to achieve the \n     level of protection we believe appropriate.\n       Thanks to extensive consultation with groups of state \n     officials, led by the National Association of Attorneys \n     General and the Multistate Tax Commissioners, state \n     sovereignty is fully protected. This includes the right of \n     the states to participate at every stage of the dispute \n     settlement process if a state law is challenged.\n       Finally, while the Administration believes that U.S. \n     interests are fully protected, the WTO agreement permits the \n     United States to withdraw on six months' notice at any time \n     and for any reason. Additionally, section 125 of the \n     implementing legislation provides an expedited process by \n     which Congress can review U.S. participation in the WTO every \n     five years, and revoke approval of the WTO agreement if it \n     so chooses.\n       Sovereignty has been the central issue in the debate on the \n     WTO throughout this year. When members of Congress or other \n     individuals or groups have come forward with concerns, we \n     have worked hard, and effectively, to address them. \n     Nevertheless, we recognize that concerns remain, in Congress \n     and around the country, about our sovereignty under the WTO, \n     and particularly the impact of a dispute settlement system \n     where ``blocking'' of panel reports is no longer permitted. \n     We believe that it is important to approve the Uruguay Round \n     agreements with the broadest possible bipartisan support and \n     public confidence. Consequently, the Administration wants to \n     ensure that WTO dispute settlement decisions are fully \n     consistent with the Uruguay Round agreements by providing \n     additional guarantees that WTO dispute settlement decisions \n     will be vigorously monitored to ensure that U.S. sovereignty \n     is not adversely affected.\n       To that end, the Administration will support legislation \n     next year to establish a WTO Dispute Settlement Review \n     Commission. The Commission would consist of five Federal \n     appellate judges, appointed by the President in consultation \n     with the Leadership of both Houses and the Chairmen and \n     Ranking Members of the Ways & Means and Finance Committees. \n     Each Commissioner would have a four-year term with possible \n     renewals. Provision would be made for appropriate staggering \n     of the terms of the Commissioners.\n       The Commission will review all final (i.e., adopted) WTO \n     dispute settlement reports (by a panel if the panel report is \n     not appealed or by the Appellate Body) where the final report \n     is adverse to the United States. In each such case, the \n     Commission would determine whether the panel or Appellate \n     Body:\n       1. Demonstrably exceeded its authority or terms of \n     reference or, where the matter concerned the Uruguay Round \n     Antidumping Agreement, failed to apply Article 17.6 \n     concerning standard of review;\n       2. Added to the obligations or diminished the rights the \n     United States assumed under the pertinent Uruguay Round \n     agreement;\n       3. Acted arbitrarily or capriciously, engaged in \n     misconduct, or demonstrably departed from the procedures \n     specified for panels or the Appellate Body in the agreements; \n     and whether\n       4. The action in 1, 2, or 3 materially affects the outcome \n     of the report.\n       The Commission would issue its determination within 120 \n     days after the report is adopted. Three votes would be \n     required for an affirmative determination. The U.S. \n     Government and interested parties would have the right to be \n     heard by the Commission.\n       Following issuance of any affirmative determination by the \n     Commission, any Member of each House would be able to \n     introduce a joint resolution calling on the President to \n     negotiate new dispute settlement rules that would address and \n     correct the problem identified by the Commission. The \n     resolution would be privileged. The resolution would be \n     discharged from the Ways & Means and Finance Committees under \n     the same procedures provided in section 125 of the \n     implementing legislation; floor action would be expedited \n     under the same procedures.\n       If there are three affirmative determinations in any five-\n     year period, any Member of each House would be able to \n     introduce a joint resolution to disapprove U.S. participation \n     in the Uruguay Round agreements under the same procedures set \n     forth in section 125 of the implementing legislation. If the \n     resolution is enacted by the Congress and signed by the \n     President, the United States will commence withdrawal from \n     the WTO Agreement.\n       Term of Patent Protection.\n       You have expressed concern about the provision of the \n     implementing legislation which would change the terms of \n     patents in the United States. Specifically, you have asked \n     the Administration to support legislation next year which \n     would change the patent term to grant patents for a term \n     beginning on the date on which the patent issues, and ending \n     on the later of 20 years from the date on which the patent \n     application was filed in the United States or 17 years after \n     the date of the grant.\n       Under present law, patent rights exist for a term of 17 \n     years measured from the date the patent is granted. The \n     legislation would change our current system to provide for a \n     patent term of 20 years measured from the earliest effective \n     filing date of the application that leads to the patent.\n       This change, which has the strong, bipartisan support of \n     the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, has been \n     recommended numerous times by expert study groups starting as \n     far back as 1967. One reason the Committees support both the \n     change and the approach taken in the implementing bill is \n     that it will address the problem of ``submarine patents''.\n       A ``submarine patent'' can exist when a patent applicant \n     delays grant of the patent, sometimes for years, even after \n     the Patent and Trademark Office has determined that a patent \n     can be granted. In the meantime, an entire industry has built \n     up around the technology, since patent applications are held \n     secret until after the patent is issued. When the patent \n     issues, the inventor often demands high royalties as the \n     price of not suing companies for patent infringement. The \n     proposal of providing a term of the longer of 20 years from \n     filing or 17 from grant of the patent would not address this \n     problem, since there still will be no incentive for the \n     patent applicant to stop delaying patent grant.\n       Under the implementing bill, almost all U.S. patent owners \n     will have a longer term of protection than they now have. \n     There are several reasons for this, but the key point is that \n     we included provisions that would add up to five years to the \n     20-year term provided under the implementing bill if there is \n     delay in getting the patent and that delay is not the fault \n     of the patent owner.\n       For all these reasons, we believe that the case for the \n     change is compelling, and it will bring great benefits to our \n     patent holders and innovators. The proposed change has \n     extraordinarily broad support in the business and \n     intellectual property communities, ranging from manufacturing \n     and chemical companies, such as 3M, Dow Chemical, \n     Westinghouse, MARS, Exxon Research and Engineering Company, \n     Deere & Company, Bridgestone/Firestone, DuPont, Cincinnati \n     Milacron, Pioneer Hybred, and Fisher-Rosemount to the \n     Intellectual Property Law Section of the ABA, the American \n     Intellectual Property Owners' Association (AIPLA), and the \n     Intellectual Property Owners' Association (IPO).\n       We believe that if Congress reconsiders the issue next year \n     it will reach the same conclusion reached by the \n     Administration and the Judiciary Committees over the nine \n     months that we work on the implementing bill. Nevertheless, \n     if the Congress does revisit the issue and reaches the \n     conclusion that a change in accordance with your proposal \n     should be made, the Administration would not oppose \n     legislation to achieve that change.\n       Once again, thank you for discussing this matter with us. I \n     look forward to working with you to secure approval of this \n     historic agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Kantor.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. That is the first concern and it has merit.\n  The second concern in my view has no merit. The World Trade \nOrganization is not world government. Our sovereignty is not threatened \nby this agreement or by the WTO. The WTO has no power to force the \nUnited States to do anything. They cannot make us do anything. It is \nnot a world power.\n  If the WTO finds that U.S. law does not square with the obligations \nwe have assumed under the agreement, we remain totally free to \ndisregard that finding. It does not change U.S. law. It does not change \nState laws, as some of the critics have said. The critics should be \nanswered, and they have been answered. But they keep coming back with \nthe same message.\n  I do not know who you could go to, if you want to talk to somebody \nwho felt strongly about something and you wanted some conservative \njurist to give you a legal opinion. So somebody asked Judge Bork to \naddress this issue. I know it has been recited on the floor before. \nJudge Bork has a pretty good reputation as being a scholar and \nunderstanding the law. As he pointed out, our ultimate compliance with \nthe agreement is a matter of international comity or accommodation, not \nof sovereignty. We are talking about comity or accommodation--not \nsovereignty. Our legislative and executive branches will continue to \nfunction exactly as before. Let me quote Judge Bork. I know he has been \nquoted before, but I want to quote him again because I think the well-\nmeaning people in America who oppose this agreement because of the \nsovereignty issue ought to know about the quote. Maybe they will read \nit. Maybe they will hear it. I would be happy to send them a copy of \nthe letter. This is what Judge Bork said:\n\n       The U.S. constitutional framework safeguards U.S. \n     sovereignty by providing the motion recent action by the \n     political branches of the Federal Government supersedes prior \n     laws or international agreements. As long as the United \n     States can relieve itself of any international obligation \n     that conflicts with U.S. law by enacting a subsequent \n     statute, U.S. sovereignty is protected. Arguments to the \n     contrary distort American law and contradict principles \n     recognized by the Supreme Court for more than one hundred \n     years.\n\n  That is not Bob Dole. That is not Bob Packwood. That is not Pat \nMoynihan. That is Judge Bork. He is not infallible, but he has a great \nreputation. So I would say to those who rant and rave about the \nsovereignty issue, I think it has been answered.\n  I would also note one of the most vocal critics of the WTO's \ninfringement on our sovereignty, Professor Lawrence Tribe, of Harvard, \nrecently reversed his position on the issue. He was a critic. He was on \nthe other side. He was supporting Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan and Pat \nChoat and Ralph Nader and others who feel strongly about this issue. \nThis is the memorandum he sent to me and other Senators dated November \n28, and I quote:\n\n       Although it might be less embarrassing for me simply to say \n     nothing, I regard it as my responsibility, in light of \n     Assistant Attorney General's Dellinger's recent forceful \n     analysis, to say that I believe the Clinton administration \n     has based its position on the Uruguay round agreements on \n     constitutional arguments that are both powerful and \n     plausible.\n\n  Not Bob Dole, not Pat Moynihan, not Bob Packwood--Laurence Tribe.\n  So the sovereignty issue is a red herring. And, if our rights are \nbeing trampled we are going to be able to fix it. We have worked it \nout. We are going to have to pass a law next year and we will have \nadministration support, and bipartisan support in the House and Senate. \nOur sovereignty could not be better protected. No one in this Chamber \nis going to stand up and diminish our sovereignty or somehow sell out \nor diminish some of our sovereignty that I know of on either side of \nthe aisle.\n  Let me finally say this. I know the majority leader is waiting to \nconclude the debate.\n  We were also concerned about some of the measures in the implementing \nlegislation. Frankly, we thought there were too many things added. It \nwas not clean. There were just too many things added to the \nimplementing legislation. So a lot of charges have been made that \nmillions and millions and billions of dollars are being spent. It is \nalmost like a reconciliation bill. You cannot amend it. All you can do \nis debate it and vote it up or down.\n  So we raised some of those questions with the administration. I think \nit is clear that one reason the fast track process may be in danger \nfrom now on is we have to clean up our act. We cannot load up the \nimplementing legislation with extraneous provisions that have nothing \nto do with trade because this bill is not subject to the normal rules \nof debate. As I said, you cannot amend it. You debate it and vote it up \nor down. So it has a whole variety of things in there that benefit \ncertain people, probably certain interests that should not be there at \nall. And I have addressed those.\n  I ask at the appropriate time those letters be printed in the Record. \nOne is a pioneer preference provision. I am just trying to find out if \nit is fair. If it's fair that is fine with me. But we are going to \ntry--going to review it next year. We have a promise from the \nadministration to work next year with the administration to ensure that \nGovernment is fully and fairly compensated for the licenses in \nquestion. That is all we want. We are not after anybody.\n  So I guess the truth of the matter is, the fast track vehicle is \ncarrying a lot of unauthorized cargo. And it is abuse of the fast track \nprocess and I hope that, if we use the fast track process again, we \nwill be able to clean that up. I voted for the fast track extension and \nI think certainly this undermines the process if that is going to be \napproved next year.\n  We have another term dealing with patents. This was raised by a \ncolleague on the House side, Congressman Rohrabacher. That has been \naddressed. We think the administration now agrees it will not oppose \nlegislation, if it is offered next year. I ask that statement by him be \nmade a part of the Record. That was from the Trade Representative, from \nMickey Kantor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, November 23, 1994.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: I appreciate the opportunity to respond \n     to your concerns about the so-called ``pioneers' preference \n     provision,'' which is found in Title VIII of the GATT \n     implementing legislation.\n       As you know, this provision serves two basic purposes. \n     First, it prevents the pioneers from obtaining the use of \n     radio spectrum for free. Absent the GATT provision there is, \n     in our judgment, an unacceptable risk that the pioneers will \n     succeed in overturning the current FCC Order which, reversing \n     an earlier order, now requires payment from the pioneers. \n     Second, it rewards the innovation produced by the pioneers \n     who, in the judgment of the FCC, have helped to spur the \n     current interest in the provision of Personal Communications \n     Services. Indeed, we are only days away from the beginning of \n     the broadband PCS auction. The PCS auctions, which were \n     proposed by President Clinton and established in the budget \n     reconciliation act of 1993, are expected by OMB to raise \n     $12.6 billion for the federal government.\n       Under the GATT provision, the three pioneers will \n     contribute a significant percentage of the total proceeds to \n     be gained from the PCS spectrum. OMB estimates that, over a \n     five-year period, the three pioneers will pay about $1.5 \n     billion to the federal treasury.\n       We are aware, of course, of competing estimates that have \n     been made by opponents of the GATT agreement and potential \n     competitors of the pioneers. In general, those assertions \n     attempt to compare mature, small markets for established \n     wireless services that possess a significant customer base \n     with the incipient, multistate, demographically-diverse \n     markets for new PCS services. In our judgment, no known \n     alternative estimate establishes a credible basis for \n     analysis.\n       Of course, as the Administration has consistently noted, no \n     one can predict with certainty the outcome of the coming PCS \n     auctions and, therefore, it is impossible to be absolutely \n     sure how much the pioneers will pay under the GATT provision \n     or how much that payment might differ from the alternative \n     formulae contained in the current FCC Order.\n       I can commit to you, therefore, that the Administration \n     will work with Congress next year to do the following:\n       1. Compare the price paid by the pioneers to the payments \n     paid by the PCS auction winners;\n       2. Determine whether the government received a fair return \n     for the licenses obtained by the pioneers;\n       3. If the determination in (2) above is negative, pass \n     legislation that would adequately compensate the United \n     States in accordance with the determination on fair return.\n       Congress, of course, could still act on its own. We are \n     sending under separate cover a letter expressing our views \n     with regard to the constitutionality of future legislation on \n     this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leon E. Panetta,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI assumed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOLE. The rest of my statement deals with the budget. I \nunderstand Senator Packwood made a brilliant speech. I was not here to \nhear it, but I have had people fax me notes on how he explained the \nbudget process and the waiver. And I thank him for that.\n  But it is pretty clear to me that if we do not waive the budget, we \nare going to doom the whole process. There is no question about it. And \nthat is a steep price to pay. So we have addressed it. We think it has \nbeen addressed as much as we could. And we have to keep in mind, too, \nwe are talking about cutting tariffs, going to create more jobs, more \nopportunities--a lot of things are going to happen in the second five \nyears. So I think in the long run, increased economic activity which is \ngoing to result from this trade agreement certainly is going to \noutweigh the losses and obligations caused by the tariff cuts. In other \nwords, over time, tariff cuts pay for themselves. In fact this argument \nis reminiscent of an argument we have been making for a long time with \nregard to capital gains rate reduction. I hope next year, as I said in \nmy letter to my colleagues, the administration will be receptive to \nthis argument in the context of the capital gains debate.\n  So, finally, I would just say, Madam President, that I think the \nbottom line is we just cannot isolate ourselves from the rest of the \nworld. We have to have a big ``open for business'' sign all over \nAmerica. Everywhere in America it has to say we are open for business. \nWe want your business in America. He want to create jobs, we want to \ncreate opportunities in America. We do not want to put a ``closed'' \nsign in America, ``Not welcome in America.''\n  We want them to bring down the barriers for our products and our \nservices. We are going to lock in this agreement--market opening \nmeasures pave the way for further measures.\n  I have always thought that we could compete with anybody else in the \nworld as long as we have access to that market and that we have assured \naccess. I think this agreement is going to help us in that regard.\n  So, Madam President, I ask any other material I have not included in \nthe Record relating to this agreement be printed at this point. And \nagain thank my colleagues for their leadership.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            General Counsel of the\n\n\n                                  U.S. Department of Commerce,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 23, 1994.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: One of the revenue measures included in \n     the GATT implementing legislation would require the Federal \n     Communications Commission to recover for the public a portion \n     of the value of the public spectrum that has been awarded by \n     the Commission to licenses granted under the ``pioneers \n     preference'' program. The legislation requires the pioneers \n     to pay not less than 85 percent, on a per population basis, \n     of the highest bids for licenses in the 20 largest markets in \n     which no applicant has obtained preferential treatment (the 3 \n     pioneer markets). Assuming enactment of the GATT legislation \n     free from constitutional infirmities that re-calculates the \n     fees to be paid by the pioneers. This subsequent legislation \n     would likely occur after the FCC proceeds to issue the \n     licenses to the pioneers and would raise a constitutional \n     question whether such subsequent legislation could be \n     effective on a retroactive basis. We believe that the \n     Congress retains wide discretion to enact retroactive \n     economic legislation to support legitimate legislative \n     purposes and such legislation would be permissible from a \n     legal perspective.\n       In a case decided June 13, 1994, the Supreme Court held in \n     United States v. Carlton, 114 S.Ct. 2018 (1994), that due \n     process was not violated by retroactive application of an \n     amendment to a federal estate tax statute limiting \n     availability of a deduction despite evidence that a taxpayer \n     detrimentally relied on the previous provision and had no \n     notice that the provision would be retroactively amended. In \n     the case, the Court noted that the due process standard to be \n     applied to tax statutes with retroactive effect ``is the same \n     as that generally applicable to retroactive economic \n     legislation.'' 114 S.Ct. at 2022. In quoting from its \n     decision in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A. Gray & \n     Co., 104 S.Ct. 2709 (1984), the Court stated:\n       ``Provided that the retroactive application of a statue is \n     supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by \n     rational means, judgments about the wisdom of such \n     legislation remain within the exclusive province of the \n     legislative and executive branches.''\n       We believe that the Supreme Court's holding in the Carlton \n     case would be controlling if the Congress enacted subsequent \n     legislation with retroactive effect regarding the price paid \n     by the pioneers. There, as here, the subsequent Congressional \n     action would be intended as a ``curative'' measure to correct \n     previous legislation with ``significant and unanticipated'' \n     revenue consequences (Congress had estimated the revenue loss \n     from the deduction in the Carlton case at $300 million over 5 \n     years but subsequently discovered the loss could be as much \n     as $7 billion). There, as here, the ``corrective'' \n     legislation would be enacted promptly with only a ``modest \n     period of retroactivity.'' Just as a taxpayer ``has no vested \n     right in the Internal Revenue Code,'' no party has a vested \n     right in conveyance of Government spectrum at a discount. See \n     114 S.Ct., at 2023. In addition, two factors which the \n     appellate court found troubling in that case, a lack of \n     notice and detrimental reliance, would not be present \n     provided the Congress included floor statements in the \n     Congresisonal Record noting the possibility of subsequent \n     legislation relating to the fee question.\n       For these reasons, we believe that Congress could, if it \n     wished, enact subsequent legislation with retroactive effect \n     regarding the assessment of fees to be paid by the pioneers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ginger Lew.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 23, 1994.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: I appreciate the work you have done to address \n     the concerns of your constituents and other Senators before \n     making a final decision about the GATT agreement. I am \n     encouraged that the sovereignty issue has been resolved. I \n     believe your announcement today in support of GATT will \n     certainly bring us closer to the 60 votes needed for the \n     budget waiver.\n       As the President stated in his press conference Tuesday, \n     the Administration is unwilling to link any conversation \n     regarding capital gains to GATT. But Members of the 104th \n     Congress will no doubt set forth ideas for capital formation. \n     I can assure you that these proposals will be carefully \n     reviewed.\n       It would of course be our hope that the work of the 103rd \n     Congress be completed next week with a bipartisan victory, \n     not by a narrow margin, but by a resourcing vote of \n     confidence. You and I have lead important fights in the past \n     to expand economic growth in our country. Few are as \n     important as this one. If we can achieve this, I believe the \n     American people will hold both our political parties in \n     greater esteem. With my best wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lloyd Bentsen.\n\n  Mr. DOLE. I want to commend my colleagues who are on the other side. \nThey feel very strongly about it. I think it has been our hope that we \ncould answer some of the concerns they had.\n  Some are just flat opposed to it. Some believe there is a conspiracy \nout there. Some believe that some of us are out to do in America. That \nis not my record and I do not think it is the record of anybody else.\n  It seems to me we had two choices: Kill it or make it better and pass \nit. In my view we have made it better. It is better than it was, \nbecause of the cooperation we have had with the administration and \nbecause they, too, understand that the WTO was causing real concern \nwith real people all across America. And now Congress has some say or \nwill have some say when we pass the legislation next year.\n  So, Madam President, I hope that--we probably cannot have a unanimous \nvote--but let us try for 70 votes, at least 70, on the budget waiver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. PACKWOOD. I yield the remainder of the time I have to Senator \nWarner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 2 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I shall be very brief. I wish to \nassociate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Republican \nleader. I have counseled with him on this matter from the very \nbeginning, and he has laid forth the precedents, the points that I \nshall place in the Record in support of my decision on this measure.\n  An easier vote perhaps would have been to vote against the point of \norder, then vote for the treaty. But to me that is not being honest. \nThat is not being straightforward, and I feel that as the distinguished \nRepublican leader feels, we ought to stand and be counted and vote if \nit is in our judgment this is in the best interest of the United \nStates.\n  I waited, Madam President, such that all across Virginia calls came, \nas the distinguished leader said, and others, in opposition, in large \nmeasure. I did not want to cut off the avenue of my constituents to \nreach me with their views, and I forced an open mind. But it is the \nwise counsel of our Republican leader and that of the two managers of \nthis bill, the Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, and the Senator \nfrom Oregon, Senator Packwood, and others, to persuade me this is in \nthe best interest of the United States.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for H.R. \n5110, legislation to implement the Uruguay Round Agreement reached \nunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). After many \nmonths of closely scrutinizing the agreement, I have come to the \nconclusion that this agreement is in the best interests of Virginia and \nthe Nation as a whole. It moves the United States toward free trade and \npositions us to compete vigorously in the worldwide market.\n  Virginia recorded merchandise exports in 1993 of $8.2 billion--the \nsecond largest State total in the South Atlantic region. Nationally, \nVirginia ranked 15th among the States in the value of export sales. \nOver the 1978-93 period, Virginia's merchandise exports rose by 159 \npercent--well above the 90 percent increase for the Nation as a whole \nand the 12th largest percentage gain among States. Virginia's top three \nexport markets in 1993 were Japan, Canada, and Belgium and 87 percent \nof Virginia's 1993 export sales consisted of manufactured goods. Also, \nit should be noted that Virginia posted substantial export gains in \nvirtually all major manufactured product categories over the 1987-93 \nperiod.\n  I anticipate that under the Uruguay Round Agreement reached under \nGATT Virginia will experience greater economic expansion particularly \nin the areas of: fish and fish products, maritime industry, household \nand office furniture, renewable energy technology, industrial \nmachinery, electronic equipment, tobacco, and high technology exports. \nIn the area of agriculture, economic expansion is expected in, among \nothers, these areas: corn, soybean, small grains, apples, beef, \npoultry, and horticultural products.\n  Those areas listed above are just a few of the areas that will \nbenefit under the agreement. The worldwide lowering of tariffs will \nhelp open other countries' markets, therefore creating markets in the \nfuture for many other Virginian goods and services.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say a few words about the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and its impact on U.S. sovereignty. The WTO will \nhave the authority to pass out penalties to member nations that have \nviolated the agreement. After reviewing the WTO provisions of the \nagreement I, like many others, was concerned with that aspect of the \nagreement.\n  However, I believe that former U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert H. \nBork, in a letter to Senator Don Nickles, helped clarify this matter. \nJudge Bork stated that ``the U.S. constitutional framework safeguards \nU.S. sovereignty by providing that the most recent action by the \npolitical branches of the federal government supersedes prior laws or \ninternational agreements.'' Judge Bork concluded by saying that ``as \nlong as the United States can relieve itself of any international \nobligation that conflicts with U.S. law by enacting a subsequent \nstatute, U.S. sovereignty is protected.''\n  In addition, incoming Senate Majority Leader Dole reached an \nagreement with the Clinton administration on the matter of the WTO. The \nDole-Clinton agreement commits the Clinton administration to support \nprompt enactment next year of legislation creating a permanent \ncommission of five sitting U.S. appellate court judges, appointed by \nthe President in consultation with appropriate House and Senate \nleaders. The commission will review all final WTO dispute settlement \nreports, subjecting them to a three-part test. If the majority of the \ncommission believes that the WTO panel did not demonstrate adherence to \ncertain guidelines then action could be taken by Congress to request \nthat the President negotiate new dispute settlement rules addressing \nthe problems identified by the commission. If the commission issues \nthree affirmative decisions in a 5-year period, any Member of Congress \nwould be able to introduce a joint resolution to disapprove U.S. \nparticipation in the WTO.\n  Mr. President, we must not sit idle and let the world pass us by. We \nare the worlds largest exporter and we can only benefit from a lowering \nof worldwide tariffs that in turn allow us access to more foreign \nmarkets. The Uruguay Round Agreement does just that and I intend to \nsupport it.\n\n  Mr. President, in closing I ask unanimous consent that an Op-Ed \nwritten by Mr. John W. Snow, Chairman, President, and CEO of Richmond, \nVirginia based CSX Corporation and Chairman of the Business Roundtable, \nbe included in the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Richmond Times Dispatch, Nov. 27, 1994]\n\n              Virginia, U.S., Have Stake in Expanded Trade\n\n       Let's cut to the heart of the GATT debate: If America wants \n     more jobs, higher living standards, and lower taxes, then \n     this vital international trade agreement must be approved by \n     the U.S. Congress immediately. Defer action and we lose.\n       The latest round of GATT (shorthand for General Agreement \n     on Tariffs and Trade) has been seven years in negotiation and \n     represents the cumulative work of 123 nations to reduce trade \n     barriers and encourage economic growth. It is the most \n     comprehensive trade deal in history and would not have \n     happened without American leadership. Presidents Reagan, \n     Bush, and Clinton have all championed this effort.\n       The present ``Uruguay Round''--the eighth in the history of \n     GATT--stands as the latest, best opportunity to continue the \n     process of making American values a fixed part of the \n     international economic system.\n       Yet we hear objections. It is argued, without factual \n     basis, that the U.S. will lose control of its destiny. Others \n     say, ``Why rush, let's improve it''--ignoring the years of \n     difficult, step-by-step struggle this agreement represents.\n       A lot of this is disturbingly familiar. The road to passing \n     the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was littered \n     with exaggerated dangers and unsubstantiated claims by \n     opponents. In fact, the early report card on NAFTA is even \n     more encouraging than many proponents had predicted.\n\n\n                     NAFTA Has Benefitted Consumers\n\n       For unrestricted trade to be of benefit, both imports and \n     exports should rise. In the first six months of 1994, the \n     U.S. Commerce Department reports that Mexican exports to the \n     U.S. rose 21 percent, to $23.4 billion, from a year ago, and \n     U.S. exports to Mexico rose 16 percent, to $25.5 billion. \n     Such numbers portend solid growth for American businesses and \n     respectable savings for American consumers.\n       GATT, like NAFTA, will be a plus for the American people, \n     because America wins with free trade. The United States is by \n     far the world's largest exporter and the world's most open \n     market. Any agreement like GATT that binds more than 100 \n     nations to the same discipline we impose on ourselves can \n     only benefit our economy over the long term.\n       It is simply remarkable that anyone would oppose this \n     opportunity for economic growth--particularly in Virginia, \n     where exports have driven and sustained our economy, where \n     from 1987 to 1993, merchandise exports soared by 159 \n     percent--way above the national average of 90 percent. Last \n     year alone, Virginia racked up $8.2 billion in export sales. \n     so much a part of Virginia's past, international trade \n     requests our best chance in the future.\n       The state's exports touch on many sectors of its economy, \n     from agriculture and livestock, production to manufacturing \n     of products ranging from electronics and computers to \n     chemicals and heavy machinery, and encompass the gamut of \n     large to small employers. A study done in 1987 found that 95 \n     percent of Virginia enterprises involved in export trade had \n     fewer than 500 employees.\n       Without a doubt, the citizens of the Commonwealth would \n     benefit from overall business growth and creation of new jobs \n     resulting from more open international trade. Several \n     gubernational administration representing both Democrats and \n     Republicans have seen the Value equation in international \n     trade and have worked effectively to market Virginia's \n     exports to the world. The GATT stands to extend those \n     economic benefits will into the 21st Century.\n       Since the GATT process began in 1947, world trading nations \n     have cut average tariffs from 40 percent to 5 percent today, \n     thanks largely to U.S. efforts that have once again spanned \n     both Republican and Democratic administrations. The result \n     has been the fastest global economic growth in history. The \n     newest GATT agreement obligates signatory nations to take \n     serious action against discriminatory non-tariff import \n     barriers and to reduce or eliminate tariffs and quotas on a \n     range of products affecting 85 percent of world trade. The \n     result will be a $744 billion reduction in tariffs on world \n     trade, the largest tax cut in the history of the world.\n       Implementing the Uruguay Round is expected to cost the \n     United States $40 billion in foregone tariffs over the next \n     10 years. However, for every dollar lost in revenue from \n     tariff cuts, the Clinton administration estimates an \n     additional $3 in new revenues will be generated from \n     increased economic activity. Obviously, one aspect of the \n     GATT debate focuses on how much additional growth the United \n     States can expect.\n       The administration estimates that the GATT will pump an \n     extra $100 billion to $200 billion into the U.S. economy \n     every year after the agreement takes full effect in 10 years. \n     This assessment recently was boosted by a study released by \n     the GATT Secretariat showing that the trade accord would add \n     another $122 billion to the U.S. economy by the year 2005.\n\n\n                       Gains Outweigh Any Losses\n\n       But even the most conservative assessment of the GATT by \n     independent analysts shows that the accord will contribute an \n     extra $25 billion to $30 billion per year to the U.S. gross \n     domestic product. That would be far in excess of the GATT's \n     projected 10-year cost of $40 billion.\n       The truth is that more open trade will generate far more to \n     the American economy than it will cost. Right now the biggest \n     danger is that the Congress will fall prey to GATT \n     opponents who are using the complexity of the agreement to \n     urge delay on ratification until next year's formal \n     deadline. Those who oppose free trade expansion know that \n     delay crushes political chances for approval and certainly \n     damages America's standing with its trading partners.\n       It is worth repeating that talks began on the latest trade \n     pact more than seven years ago under President Reagan and \n     enjoyed the support of President Bush during the 1992 \n     campaign, before being embraced by and concluded under \n     President Clinton. Improving the climate for international \n     trade was, until recent times, a subject that enjoyed broad \n     bipartisan leadership.\n       Earlier this month, voters sent a strong message to \n     Washington that they expect more leadership on a host of \n     issues connected to the nation's future direction and a \n     collective sense of well-being for our families and \n     communities.\n       The upcoming vote on the GATT agreement is certainly a \n     once-in-a-generation opportunity: for the President to \n     govern, for the Democrats to vote their great hopes for the \n     nation's future, and for the Republicans to show their \n     leadership. Even a delay in considering the GATT agreement \n     could cost future generations of Americans immeasurably, as a \n     number of our political leaders have expressed the view that \n     a delay on the GATT vote will ultimately kill its chance for \n     implementation. Such is the power of America's position on \n     this issue around the world.\n       Our representatives in Congress will be asked to \n     demonstrate their bipartisan leadership in the next few days. \n     They will have the opportunity to sow the seeds of future \n     prosperity for our nation and our fellow citizens by \n     approving the GATT agreement.\n       In the final analysis, GATT is about change. It's about \n     moving toward the future, not away from it. It's about \n     knocking down barriers to global commerce and allowing \n     economic competition to flourish throughout the world.\n\n\n                       american products will win\n\n       Congress should approve the agreement, thereby opening the \n     doors, leveling the playing field, and preparing the way for \n     an American victory. America will win with GATT because our \n     workers are the most productive in the world. America will \n     win because our science is better, our products are superior, \n     and our companies are more efficient. America also will win \n     because of the ideas we hold dear. It's really extraordinary. \n     In this decade, the ideological battle between command \n     economies and market-driven economies has ended. The verdict \n     is in. Markets win!\n       The worldwide advance of economic liberty is the great \n     victory of the late 20th Century. Freedom has momentum on its \n     side. The U.S. and 17 other Pacific Basin countries--a group \n     constituting half of the world's production and 45 percent of \n     world trade--have just agreed to opening their economies and \n     removing all trade barriers by the year 2020. Other \n     expansions of freedom beckon; the future is promising. But \n     nothing is guaranteed. A defeat of GATT would send the wrong \n     message at the worst possible time.\n       Congress must not let that happen. If anything, the recent \n     election affirmed Americans' desire for greater economic \n     opportunity. Now, at a time when the world has come to \n     embrace that same desire, for freedom and prosperity, it \n     would be a sad irony for America to step backward. We should \n     approve GATT now--and I urge Virginians to so inform their \n     congressional representatives.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the decision on how to vote on the \nimplementing legislation of the Uruguay Round of GATT has been a \nparticularly difficult one for me. I have painstakingly studied the \nbill. I have corresponded extensively with USTR and others to obtain \nclarification of many of its provisions and I have carefully weighed \nthe pros and cons of this agreement. There are many strengths.\n  This agreement will put in place a set of rules which will allow the \nU.S. to compete on a more level playing field in trade relationships \nwith other nations. Overall, I believe progress toward free trade is \ngood for the United States. This agreement includes many positive steps \ntoward that end.\n  First, GATT would create a new international trade framework and \nestablish rules to govern international trade. It would also expand the \nnumber of participating nations from 40 to 123.\n  Second, GATT's intellectual property provisions would broaden and \nstrengthen the protection of U.S. patents, copyrights and trademarks \naround the world. This would provide new and better protection in world \nmarkets from piracy of U.S. entrepreneurship, copyright and invention \nin industries such as pharmaceutical, entertainment and computer \nsoftware.\n  Third, the Uruguay Round would expand the trading system to include \nservices and agriculture for the first time. This includes many \nimportant U.S. industries such as accounting, advertising, computer \nservices, tourism, engineering and construction.\n  Finally, this GATT agreement would set forth multilateral trading \nrules for all member countries to abide by, including developing \nnations. Furthermore, it would establish a forum and procedures to \nresolve trade disputes that might arise among trading partners. \nTogether, these measures would create a more level playing field in \ninternational trade than exists today.\n  But let us be candid--the Uruguay Round Agreement does not bring \nabout free and fair trade. This agreement permits a number of countries \nto continue to engage in blatant protectionism. And as a result, \ncertain countries and industries will do better under this agreement \nthan others.\n  I am deeply troubled by the fact that this agreement continues to \nallow unfair foreign trade restrictions which adversely affect key \nMichigan exports in autos and auto parts. GATT fails to address the \ndiscriminatory trade barriers of greatest importance to Michigan. I'm \nspeaking of Japan's keiretsu system, the collusive and unfair Japanese \nbusiness practice whereby producers and suppliers form strategic \nalliances and effectively block outside competition. Measures to break \ndown such non-tariff trade barriers such as these are conspicuously \nabsent in GATT.\n  Since this GATT agreement does not specifically cover Japan's \nkeiretsu system, we would most likely have to fight barriers to trade \nsuch as this using U.S. domestic trade remedy laws. I specifically \nasked the Administration to indicate how it would deal with Japan's \nkeiretsu system under the new GATT agreement. I was assured by the USTR \nthat they would continue a firm bilateral approach with Japan in an \neffort to bring about an end to Japan's discriminatory trade practices. \nBut this is the same decades-old method that has failed to produce any \nresult.\n  This agreement could actually make matters worse and weaken remedies \nunder U.S. trade law that we can use to retaliate against unfair trade \npractices. I am concerned that the use of quotas and tariffs to \nretaliate against unfair trade practices, such as those contained in \nSection 301 and Super 301, would be in violation of the agreement. \nUnder the new system, should the U.S. choose to use sanctions, such as \nSection 301, to respond to unfair and restrictive Japanese trade \npolicies not explicitly prohibited by GATT, such as keiretsu, the WTO \ncould well rule that such U.S. action violates the GATT agreement and \nsuch finding could no longer be blocked by a United States veto under \nthe new GATT. In my view, this might tend to undermine the credibility \nof a threat to use Section 301.\n\n  In the Statement of Administrative Action, the Administration has \nmade assurances that it intends to use Section 301 to pursue vigorously \nunfair trade barriers that violate U.S. rights or deny benefits to the \nU.S. under the Uruguay round agreements. The Administration has also \nstated their intention to use section 301 to pursue foreign unfair \ntrade barriers that are not covered by the GATT agreements. The \nimplementing legislation specifically identifies two important \nmanufacturing industries that face unfair competition policies that are \nnot clearly covered under GATT--auto parts and flat glass--to be \naddressed under the revised Section 301 law. The Administration has \nstrongly committed to the continued use of U.S. trade remedy laws \nunilaterally when deemed necessary.\n  I also have a serious problem with an agreement that reinforces \nMexico's local content requirements which discriminate against U.S. \nauto parts. These requirements have often resulted in U.S. \nmanufacturers locating production in Mexico rather than in the U.S. \nWhile the Uruguay Round Agreement will eventually eliminate all such \nlocal content requirements, Mexico is allowed to maintain these \nprotections for ten years under the terms of this agreement. Although I \nam glad to see Mexico's local content requirements phased out, I think \nwe got a bad deal in this area under NAFTA and now GATT reinforces it.\n  The Uruguay Round also allows the European Union to maintain its \nlimits on imports of vehicles from Japan for five more years. Because \nthe U.S. government has no similar import restraints, and under the \nUruguay Round we will be restricted from imposing similar restrictions, \nI am concerned that there is the danger that Japan will dump its excess \nauto capacity into the U.S. market.\n  On the other hand, the European-Japanese agreement exists now and is \nunlimited in duration. This GATT agreement arguably has the virtue of \nsetting a time limit on it.\n  The issue is close surely. But a factor pointing toward a ``yes'' \nvote is the impact of rejection of GATT on American leadership in the \nworld. If we abandon this hard fought agreement, after eight long years \nof negotiation, with the nations of the world looking to us to lead, it \nwill be a blow to America's role in the world.\n  On balance, I have decided to cast my vote in favor of the budget \nwaiver and the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreement.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nattached letter by John O. Wilson and Robert Kramer be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n\n                                              Bank of America,\n\n                                                  August 10, 1994.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: During your recent meeting with a \n     delegation of California businessmen and women who support \n     passage of the Uruguay Round Agreement, Mark Kadesh asked \n     that Bank of America provide additional information on the \n     impact the Agreement would have on the California economy. We \n     have attached the results of a study of this question using \n     the bank's California macroeconomic model (attachment 1).\n       We used the model to project out the likely effects of the \n     Agreement over the next five years on: employment, \n     unemployment rates, exports through California ports and \n     exports originating within the state.

Contact: John O. Wilson, Chief Economist. The        \n  California econometric model captures movements of key economic components of the California economy. It      \n  consists of about 20 annually estimated equations for California's important economic indicators such as      \n  employment, gross state product and personal income. It is structured for the corresponding U.S. economic     \n  indicators and their forecasts (generated by BofA using DRI's U.S. macroeconomic model) to directly drive the \n  California economy. However, significant differences between California and the United States in the ways     \n  these indicators vary over time are also carefully specified.                                                 \n\n                             [Attachment 2]\n\n          Impact of GATT on California Economy--August 8, 1994\n\n       After seven years of negotiation, a GATT accord was signed \n     in December, 1993. The U.S. Congress is now debating \n     ratification of the GATT accord, and the outcome of that \n     ratification is far from certain. That outcome will have a \n     very significant impact on the California economy. If the \n     GATT accord is not approved by the United States, the current \n     recovery in the California economy would be greatly weakened.\n       GATT establishes the basis for world trade, and the GATT \n     accord emphasizes such important areas to California as \n     gaining greater access to foreign markets in high-tech goods, \n     capital goods, business and computer services, and \n     agriculture. All of these are leading industries in \n     California. Furthermore, GATT will reduce the average level \n     of tariffs by one-third and eliminate many non-tariff \n     barriers over the next ten years. Since California is such a \n     large exporter, the lower barriers will lead to even further \n     gains in California trade and jobs related to trade. \n     Furthermore, GATT, through its new structure referred to as \n     the World Trade Organization, sets up new dispute settlement \n     mechanisms which would prevent trade wars which would be \n     detrimental to California exports.\n       California accounts for 15 percent of U.S. merchandise \n     exports, and the value of exports to the California economy \n     has grown significantly during the past several years. As \n     shown in Table 1, the value of California merchandise exports \n     through California ports has increased from $54 billion in \n     1988 to $82 billion in 1993. Some of these exports were \n     actually manufactured in other states, and transported to \n     California for shipment. This creates jobs for Californians \n     engaged in the transportation and shipping, but not the \n     manufacturing of those goods. However, $70 billion of the $82 \n     billion shipped out of California ports in 1993 was \n     manufactured or produced within the state, and this \n     represents the greatest source of trade related employment to \n     California. That employment is significant.\n\n                 TABLE 1.--CALIFORNIA MERCHANDISE TRADE                 \n                          [Billions of dollars]                         \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Exports                \n                                                 through       Exports  \n                                               California    produced in\n                                                  ports      California \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1988........................................         $53.6         $47.8\n1989........................................          63.0          53.5\n1990........................................          68.6          58.4\n1991........................................          73.8          63.1\n1992........................................          81.0          68.9\n1993........................................          82.3          70.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The exports which are produced in California account for \n     one million direct jobs. These are jobs that are directly \n     related to the manufacture, production, and transportation of \n     California exports. Another 800,000 jobs support trade \n     employment through the provision of services and support \n     industries. Thus, the total number of jobs created through \n     exports in California is 1.8 million. This represents 13 \n     percent of our entire employment of 14 million.\n       There have been major changes in the relative importance of \n     California's trading partners during the past several years. \n     While Japan remained the number one export partner in 1993, \n     two neighbors, Canada and Mexico, significantly increased \n     their imports from California during the 1990-93 period. In \n     1993 their combined imports easily surpassed Japans imports. \n     Furthermore, California's exports to China increased a \n     staggering 145 percent during the 1990-93 period.

Globally, we could \n     anticipate the following developments in world trade and \n     growth: (1) a general negative impact on global economic \n     growth due to loss of productivity gains that occur in a \n     free-trade economy; (2) an increase in intra-regional trade \n     such as trade within the European Union, trade within ASEAN \n     in Asia, and trade within NAFTA countries in North America, \n     but a reduction in inter-regional trade between Asia, North \n     America, Latin America, and Europe; (3) a move towards \n     unilateral protectionism in the form of higher tariff and \n     non-tariff barriers which will reduce overall world trade.\n       Specifically for California, we could anticipate the \n     following developments: (1) an increase in tariff and non-\n     tariff barriers to California exports to Asia, Latin America, \n     and Europe; (2) a reduction in California exports to those \n     regions, and particularly to Japan, China, Germany, and \n     France; (3) little impact on trade with Canada and Mexico \n     which would still be guided by the NAFTA agreement; and (4) \n     an immediate loss of 173,000 jobs in California (1995) \n     growing to a loss of 252,000 jobs by 2000. This would \n     increase the unemployment rate by a full one percent.\n\n                                               John O. Wilson,\n\n                                      Executive Vice President and\n                                 Chief Economist, Bank of America.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, when all is said and done, the GATT \nagreement lowers tariffs by one-third across the board between a \nmajority of the world's trading partners. This, without question, is \ngood for Florida and the United States and therefore I will vote for \nthis agreement.\n  This GATT agreement is the result of efforts made during the last \nthree administrations. The agreement will mean an expected $100-$200 \nbillion increase in our GDP by the year 2005. By any accounting, this \nwill be a tremendous benefit for our country.\n  Expanding trade opportunities is something the United States should \naggressively pursue. It is one of our most promising opportunities for \ncontinued economic growth. Our future prosperity lies not in tariff \nwars but in our ability to capitalize on our strengths and export the \nresulting products to the world's markets.\n  Over the last few months, I have heard from businesses in Florida and \nfrom across the country in support of the GATT. They have told me how \nvital this agreement is to their firms and to the people they employ. \nThey're right, and we should continue to knock down foreign trade \nbarriers for American products. The GATT will allow us to do just that.\n  Recent data from the Commerce Department's International Trade \nAdministration shows the potential benefits the GATT agreement can \nprovide to Florida. Between 1987 and 1993, Florida's exports grew by \nalmost $7 billion. Over two-thirds of these exports were from \nindustries such as industrial machinery, electric and electronic \nequipment, chemical products, and scientific measuring equipment. With \nthe lower tariffs under this agreement, Florida will clearly benefit.\n  The Commerce Department also shows Florida as the Nation's eighth \nleading exporter of merchandise, with nearly 10,000 businesses who sell \ngoods abroad. What's more, virtually all of these businesses have fewer \nthan 500 employees. Clearly, this agreement is vitally important to the \nsmall businesses that create capital, produce jobs and generate an \nimpressive share of this country's economic growth.\n  Many countries provide subsidies and impose significant tariffs. \nThese trade practices destroy American jobs, and should not be \ntolerated. The American worker is the most productive in the world, and \nhas always excelled on a level playing field. The GATT will help level \nthe field for U.S. exports.\n  There is an additional element in this debate that is important to \nnote for both this and future debates. In this legislation, the \nadministration has conceded that there are legislative changes which \nwill pay for themselves, even if the static accounting models used by \nboth the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and \nBudget do not capture the resulting revenue increases.\n  In particular, the Clinton administration--and now many in the \nDemocratic leadership--acknowledge that the economic growth created by \nthe passage of GATT will increase revenues to the Federal Government. \nSo despite the loss of some tariff revenue, the economic effects of \nGATT are a plus for the Federal budget.\n  This is precisely the same argument that has been made for so long \nabout a capital gains tax reduction. Capital gains tax cuts will \ngenerate revenue increases through economic growth just like tariff \nreductions. I would hope, therefore, that the Clinton administration \nwill concede this point next year when Republicans pass a capital gains \ntax cut.\n  Like a reduction in the capital gains tax rate, the GATT will create \nopportunities, and stimulate the creation of new jobs and new \nbusinesses. I look forward to the expansion of the Florida and U.S. \neconomies that will follow the passage of this agreement.\n\n\n           the u.s. must endorse the uruguay round agreement\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nthe Uruguay Round Agreement reached under the auspices of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n  Among the nations of the world, the United States of America has long \nbeen the foremost advocate of open trade. The Uruguay Round Agreement \nis the culmination of decades of work--by Americans of all political \npersuasions--to extend that advocacy. And it is that rare example of a \ntreaty that allows us to benefit while our neighbors in the global \ncommunity also benefit.\n  This agreement consolidates the triumph of political freedom we have \nwitnessed in the past few years and extends the philosophy of openness \nto the field of international economics. It continues the process of \ntearing down the barriers that hinder trade among nations.\n  Some critics of this measure say it tears down too many walls, and \nexposes America too nakedly to the vagaries of the international \nmarketplace. I say, this Nation need never fear fair competition.\n  Simply put, we are already the most open Nation on earth. We have \nnothing to fear from further opening the international trading system \nso long as all nations stand on the same level field. More than ever, \nthis agreement ensures that our trading partners will extend the same \nopenness to us. To deny this agreement would be to deny our national \nheritage, substitute fear for optimism, and forsake the economic \nbenefits that will accrue to our Nation from free and fair \ninternational trade.\n  This agreement is first and foremost an indispensable tool for \nfacilitating economic growth and job creation in our country. Its \nbenefits to American workers in the form of increased incomes and \nbetter job opportunities will extend from high tech industries in the \nSilicon Valley to farms and ranches in the Heartland to the steel mills \nof Pennsylvania to the furniture factories of the Carolinas.\n  But, as beneficial as are the agreement's immediate specific benefits \nto individual Americans, so too are the principles of multilateral free \ntrade that it advances.\n  One strong advocacy of a free and fair multilateral trading system \nbegan shortly after World War II with the establishment of GATT. The \nexpanded trade resulting from GATT was largely responsible for reviving \nthe depressed, war-torn economies of Europe and creating thriving new \nmarkets for American products.\n  That experience demonstrated the benefits free trade bestows upon \nboth the United States and its trading partners. Since that time, we \nhave been steadfast in our support for GATT, and it has served us well. \nThe many trade agreements reached under its auspices have fueled \neconomic growth around the world and brought more countries and \nconsumers into the international marketplace served by American \nindustry.\n  Meanwhile, as many are quick to point out, circumstances have changed \nover the years. While the United States still dominates the \ninternational marketplace, competition for market share is becoming \nfiercer every year. In the face of this new challenge, some have been \ntempted to turn away from multilateral arrangements toward \nprotectionism.\n  The concerns and frustration underlying that protectionist sentiment \nare powerful. And they are understandable. However, the policy response \nthose emotions elicit is myopic. In international trade, our course \nshould be charted along the lines of our enlightened self interest, not \nby a visceral reaction to the history of our grievances with other \nnations.\n  Closing our markets to foreign goods will close our goods to foreign \nmarkets. In the long run, that will harm more than help American \ninterests.\n  By contrast, joining other nations in a multilateral trading system \non equal terms will expand opportunities for American businesses to \nsell their goods and services abroad. This is truly a case of a rising \ntide lifting all boats.\n  There is no dispute about our stake in international trade. Exports \nare vital to the continued growth of the U.S. economy.\n  Over the past 5 years, international trade has been the bright spot \nof our economy, generating more new jobs and more economic growth than \nany other sector. International trade represents roughly 25 percent of \nour gross domestic product [GDP], a share that has almost doubled in \nthe past 20 years. During the past four decades, new jobs in trade-\nrelated fields grew at three times the pace of overall job creation. As \na result, export-related industries and companies currently employ over \n10 million American workers.\n  The reduction of trade barriers is absolutely essential to the \ncontinued expansion of the U.S. economy. The Uruguay Round Agreement \nwill reduce import tariffs, export subsidies and other trade distorting \npractices. Moreover, it will create a structure that will hold \nsignatory countries to their commitments to fair and more open trade.\n  The agreement is particularly beneficial to the United States because \nwe already have significantly fewer trade barriers than our foreign \ncompetitors. Cutting tariffs worldwide by an average of 38 percent over \nthe next 6 years, combined with standardizing and simplifying customs \nprocedures and licensing, will further reduce the cost of exporting \nU.S. goods and services.\n  The lower cost of exporting goods and services will encourage more \nU.S. companies to sell their products abroad. Currently, less than 10 \npercent of U.S. companies that could export products or services choose \nto participate in the international marketplace. With the Uruguay Round \nAgreement, these companies will have new incentives to develop markets \naround the world. They also will have new assurances that the time they \ninvest in developing new markets will not be squandered on trading \npartners that abruptly change their rules and close their markets. Such \nassurances will be especially important to small and innovative \ncompanies.\n  The Uruguay Round Agreement also holds great promise for American \nagriculture, consistently one of our most successful economic \nenterprises in the international marketplace. Experts estimate that \nagriculture exports will increase by as much as $14 billion over the \nnext 10 years, creating perhaps 190,000 new jobs in the process. And \nwhen the agreement is fully implemented, the United States can expect \nan additional $10 to $30 billion of economic activity in agriculture.\n  As one who is intimately familiar with the economics of the \nheartland, I can attest that this increased growth is essential to the \ncontinued prosperity of rural America.\n  This new trade environment will be a tremendous advantage for the \nUnited States. American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs are the best \nin the world. If we make everyone play by the same rules, we will \ncontinue to excel. The Uruguay Round Agreement is a significant \nlandmark in the march toward free and fair trade.\n  The projected results of the agreement speak for themselves. Most \nimportant is the bottom line: the Uruguay Round Agreement is estimated \nto create over 1 million new high-wage jobs in the United States over \nthe next 10 years as a result of increased exports of U.S. products and \nservices.\n  Certainly, this agreement is not perfect. We would all make some \nchanges if given the opportunity to draft it on our own terms. But that \nis not the way trade agreements are reached. In fact, when one \nconsiders the torturous, multiyear negotiating process that brought us \nto this point, it is surprising how favorable the resulting agreement \nis to American interests.\n  Before I conclude, Mr. President, I want to address the controversy \nsurrounding the World Trade Organization. Many Americans are concerned \nthat this new body will undermine American sovereignty. That is a \nserious concern that should not be minimized. And it has not been \nminimized.\n  The WTO has been widely mischaracterized as a world regime with \nunlimited jurisdiction that will run roughshod over American interests \nand American laws. In fact, the role of the WTO is limited. It will \nserve primarily to facilitate resolution of disputes over rules to \nwhich the signatories of the Uruguay round have already agreed.\n  In this role, the WTO will help ensure that our trading partners \nabide by the commitments they made when they signed the Uruguay Round \nAgreement. When American companies venture into the international \nmarketplace, they will be able to do so with confidence, because they \nwill know the rules of the game and they will know that those rules \nwill be enforced.\n  Critics have charged that the WTO will undermine our worker \nprotection, environmental, and food inspection laws. That is not the \ncase. The authority to change or make U.S. laws rests solely with the \nCongress of the United States. By the express terms of the agreement \nsigned by over 120 countries, even negative rulings of a WTO dispute \nresolution panel are mere recommendations. The WTO does not have \nenforcement powers. This fact is reaffirmed in section 102(a)(1) of the \nimplementing language, which explicitly states that U.S. law will not \nbe superseded by any provision of the Uruguay Round Agreement.\n  While the protections in the agreement and the implementing \nlegislation are significant, those who still have doubts about the WTO \nshould find reassurance in the recent agreement reached between the \nadministration and the Senate Republican leader. The agreement ensures \nthat the United States will have the opportunity to pull out of GATT if \nthe WTO's decisions are repeatedly inconsistent with American \ninterests.\n  Mr. President, we cannot afford any further delay. Some of my \ncolleagues will oppose this agreement because it violates a \ntechnicality in the Senate's budget rules. Others will oppose it \nbecause they would like to change various details in the agreement and \nimplementing legislation. I myself am not without some reservations.\n  But the simple fact is that the time for equivocation has passed. Too \nmuch hangs in the balance to back away.\n  If we fail to act, we risk setting a dangerous protectionist \nprecedent that could nullify all of the gains we have made in market \naccess over the last four decades. If we fail to act, we could begin a \nprocess that will break the world into trading blocs--and cause the \nwalls to go once again.\n  The Uruguay Round Agreement represents an important continuation of \nour decades-long advocacy of free and fair trade and will serve as a \nbuilding block for future trade agreements. To balk now, after 7 years \nof negotiation under three administrations, would send dangerous \nsignals around the world about our commitment to the principles of free \nand fair trade.\n  The agreement we consider today reflects the collective bipartisan \nbelief of three presidents that an international trading system that is \nboth free and fair serves the American national interest. I share that \nassessment.\n  Mr. President, on November 8 we experienced a remarkable election. \nWhile individual members have different reactions to it, the overriding \nmessage delivered by the voters was unmistakable. The American people \nare tired of what they perceive to be ``business-as-usual,'' partisan \nwrangling among professional politicians. They question our motives and \nrelevance in the face of our inability to address very real national \nproblems. And they want the Congress and the President to work together \nto deal constructively with these problems and improve the quality of \ntheir lives.\n  While the new congressional line-up does not take effect until \nJanuary, this debate marks the initial post-election test of whether \nCongress learned the lesson of the election and can respond to the will \nof the American people. There will be policy differences between our \npolitical parties and among individual members. That is inevitable in a \ndemocracy, and it is healthy.\n  Votes are judgment calls, and our constituents elect us to analyze \nfacts and make judgments. Americans are, however, becoming less \ntolerant of our penchant for seeking to score political or rhetorical \npoints while their concerns go unattended.\n  It is time to stop bickering and start governing. This vote, on this \nissue, at this time, will demonstrate that we have heard the voice of \nthe people and can work together for the common good.\n  My judgment is that approval of the Uruguay Round Agreement is \nimportant to the future growth of our national economy, and I am \ndelighted that the President and the Republican Leader were able to \nwork together to reach consensus on the implementing legislation that \nwe consider today.\n  I urge all my colleagues to approve this historic agreement.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Uruguay \nround agreement.\n  In this town, we talk a great deal about winners and losers. We \nwonder who will benefit and who will be hurt by the decisions we make. \nBut on the issue before us today, the answer to this question is quite \neasy.\n  The typical working family in America would be the true winner if we \napprove this trade agreement. To be sure, American business would be a \nwinner, but that's not why we should vote aye. Our standing around the \nworld would be strengthened, but that's not why we should back GATT.\n  We should back GATT because of what it would mean to working people \nin this country. Although people in some sectors would unfortunately be \nhurt, the gains overall would be impressive. Working people would enjoy \na major tax cut on many essential products they buy. They could find \nbetter employment opportunities in a growing export sector. Their \nchildren would look forward to a brighter future in a competitive, \nvibrant global economy.\n  That's what is really at stake here this week. We will hear a great \ndeal of ominous talk about a something called a world trade \norganization. We will hear about dolphins and tuna. We will hear \nphilosophical discussions about national sovereignty and abstract \nruminations over international law.\n  But when it comes right down to it, GATT is about two things a great \ndeal more immediate and a great deal more real to families all across \nthis country: better jobs and lower taxes.\n  A major boost in family income and a $12 billion tax cut over five \nyears for the working people of America. When we get through the pages \nand pages of abstract trade language and the hours and hours of red-hot \nrhetoric, that's what GATT is all about. Better jobs and lower taxes.\n  This vote presents us with our first opportunity since the election \nto come together--Republican and Democrat, conservative and liberal--on \nbehalf of the working families of this country. Passing this trade \nagreement is just about the best holiday present we could give them.\n\n\n                         u.s. trade leadership\n\n  For almost 50 years, the United States has been the principal leader \nin efforts to expand world trade. After World War II, we vigorously \npursued trade liberalization not only to increase our own economic \nprosperity but also to bolster the stability of our allies and former \nenemies alike.\n  Expanded trade has been the success story of the post-war economy. \nSince the beginning of multilateral trade negotiations, GATT membership \nhas increased from 23 nations to 124, and tariffs--which are simply \ntaxes on traded goods--have been cut from 40 percent to 5 percent. \nDuring that time, the global economy has grown faster than during any \ncomparable period of world history, and U.S. job creation in trade-\nrelated fields has grown at a rate several times faster than over-all \njob creation.\n  Increased trade has also proven to be a foreign policy success. \nProsperous nations linked together in trade are far less likely to go \nto war. People engaged with each other in commerce are far less likely \nto engage each other in violence.\n  It took two world wars to teach us this lesson, and it's as valid \ntoday as it was half a century ago.\n\n\n                       where do we go from here?\n\n  Today the nations of the world are linked together in a complex web \nof overlapping trading relations. More than one trillion dollars a day \nis traded in the global markets. And the growth industries in the \nindustrialized nations of the world are disproportionately those that \nare succeeding at trade.\n  Most have sought these opportunities because the domestic markets for \ntheir products have been saturated. Their growth--and ours--is \ndependent on increased trade opportunities.\n  Recognizing this fact, the past three presidents--Republican and \nDemocratic alike--have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to \nopening markets and expanding world trade. A major step was the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, Already responsible for increasing our \nexports to Mexico at a rate more than three times as fast as U.S. \nexports to the rest of the world.\n  The next step is the Uruguay round of GATT, launched under President \nReagan, advanced by President Bush and completed by President Clinton. \nAt the start of negotiations, we enacted legislation outlining our \nprincipal trading objectives. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act \nof 1988 established three overall goals: increased market access, a \nreduction of over-all trade barriers and an improved and strengthened \ndispute settlement process.\n\n  The final Uruguay round agreement achieves all of these objectives. \nIt will cut overall tariffs by approximately one-third, expand GATT \ndiscipline to new areas of commercial activity and increase enforcement \nauthority for trade violations.\n\n\n                        world trade organization\n\n  By far, the most controversial part of the Uruguay round agreement is \nthe formation of a world trade organization to administer, oversee and \nenforce the conduct of trade relations among participating member \nnations.\n  The formation of a governing body with teeth was one of the American \nbusiness community's top priorities during the Uruguay round. Current \nenforcement procedures have proven inadequate. Insufficient deadlines \nfor resolving trade challenges have frustrated and delayed decisions \nfor years.\n  The current reliance on decision-making by consensus has allowed one \ncountry to block favorable decisions from being implemented. And lax \nsurveillance and implementation of final decisions have prevented \ncorrective action.\n  These deficiencies have disproportionately harmed American \nbusinesses, which export more products than those from any other \nnation. Since the United States has fewer trade barriers than other \ncountries, we have the most to gain by creating and enforcing more fair \nand open international economic playing rules.\n  We have nothing to fear from fair competition and an even playing \nfield. A team that plays by the rules should have no problem with a \nreferee.\n  But, as the agreement worked out between the administration and \nSenator Dole last week makes clear, congress can pull the United States \nout of the World Trade Organization if it repeatedly and groundlessly \nrules against us.\n\n\n                what expanded trade means to connecticut\n\n  My State of Connecticut is already taking advantage of the Global \neconomy and is poised to do even more should we pass GATT. Exports have \nbeen one of the few profit-making and job-creating sectors of \nConnecticut's economy during the recent downturn. The state's exports \ngrew by $5.5 billion from 1987 to 1993.\n  For years, Connecticut has been one of the most defense-dependent \nstates in our Nation. The decline in Federal defense dollars has had a \nsevere and lasting impact on our economy. We are fortunate, however, \nthat exports helped fill the gap--increasing at approximately the same \nrate as defense dollars declined.\n  Connecticut businesses are no longer asking why they should export, \nbut how. And they are doing so in greater numbers, thanks to the \nincreased level of awareness in the business community heightened by \nthe NAFTA debate last year. Connecticut firms and their employees are \nthirsty for trade, and they are anxious to benefit from more targeted \nand coordinated export and financing opportunities.\n  The benefits in Connecticut are seen by small and large businesses \nalike. The commerce department reports that 97 percent of all exporting \nbusinesses in Connecticut have fewer than 500 employees.\n  Let me give you just one example of how international trade is \nbenefiting Connecticut. Heublein Corportion--which employs 2,000 \nAmericans, 800 of them in Connecticut--is now selling American-\nmanufactured Smirnoff vodka in Russia. Smirnoff--produced from a \nRussian recipe by American workers--is a status symbol in Russia. This \nyear, Heublein will sell 500,000 cases of Smirnoff, up from zero in \n1990. Most of the vodka is produced in Hartford.\n  Heublein has barely tapped this market. The 500,000 cases of vodka \nrepresent only one-half of one percent of Russian vodka consumption. If \nHeublein can increase Smirnoff's share of the Russian market to just \nfive percent, it will see substantial profits, and Connecticut workers \nwill hopefully see more jobs.\n  The entire New England region--with its large export industries and \nhigh-technology companies will benefit substantially from the \nintellectual property provisions and increased market access included \nin the Uruguay round.\n  Let's take just one example: The pharmaceutical industry, which \nsupports 10,000-12,000 jobs in my state alone. While the industry leads \nthe world in the development and production of new medicines, it loses \nas much as $5 billion a year through international piracy. A lack of \nrecognized and enforced patent protections have enabled foreign \nbusinesses to easily and inexpensively reproduce U.S. drugs, drugs that \noften take years and millions of dollars to bring to market.\n  The Uruguay round agreement will help remedy this problem by \nproviding 20 years of patent protection for pharmaceuticals and strict \nenforcement of intellectual property rights, including special border \nmeasures to prevent the importation of infringing imports. That means \nfair competition for American pharmaceutical firms, and better jobs for \nAmerican workers.\n\n\n                     western hemisphere free trade\n\n  I hope we will approve this trade agreement, and then look beyond it \nto find other dramatic ways to cut taxes and create high-quality jobs \nfor working families through international trade. I believe the first \nstep should be a concerted effort to expand trade opportunities in our \nown hemisphere.\n  Thirty years ago, John Kennedy proposed a new alliance for progress \nto strengthen our ties to our Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. \nKennedy implored:\n\n       Let us once again transform the American continent into a \n     vast crucible of revolutionary ideas and efforts--a tribute \n     to the power of the creative energies of free men and women--\n     an example to all the world that liberty and progress walk \n     hand in hand. Let us once again awaken our American \n     revolution until it guides the struggle of people \n     everywhere--not with an imperialism of force or fear, but \n     with the rule of courage and freedom and hope for the future \n     of man.\n\n  Three decades later, the political and economic conditions necessary \nto give fruit to these hopes have improved substantially. In my view, \nthe hemisphere is ready to move toward free trade and closer ties.\n  I believe that we should give the President the authority to \nnegotiate a comprehensive and inclusive western hemisphere free trade \nagreement by the end of this century. We should seize the opportunity \npresented by the historic summit of the Americas meeting in Miami as \nthe first major step in this direction. If we act with leadership and \nvision, the western hemisphere will enter the 21st century strengthened \nby democracy, warmed by friendship and linked by free trade.\n  Latin America and the Caribbean are rapidly becoming larger players \nin the global marketplace, providing promising new markets for American \nexported goods. Since 1989, U.S. exports to the region have grown by 60 \npercent. The region is now our third largest trading partner, surpassed \nonly by Canada and Western Europe.\n  A western hemisphere free trade area would comprise the largest \nsingle market in the world. It would include nearly three-quarters of a \nbillion people and have a gross domestic product of more than $7.3 \ntrillion.\n  A hemispherewide free trade agreement would cement and further recent \ndemocratic and economic reforms in Latin America. Expanded trade is the \nbest tool we have to strengthen the democracies of the region and \nprevent civil strife. And it is the best tool we have to expand markets \nthirsty for U.S. products.\n  In addition to expanding market access, our participation in a \nhemisphere-wide accord would strengthen our hand in trade negotiations \nwith the Europeans and the Japanese. It would give us more leverage in \nopening up markets around the world. And it would position our economy \nfor success in the coming century.\n\n\n                    caribbean interim trade program\n\n  I want to briefly address another piece of unfinished business \ninvolving trade in our hemisphere.\n  Originally, President Clinton had intended to submit as part of the \nGATT implementing bill a measure that would expand our special trading \nrelationship with the Caribbean basin. This provision, called the \nInterim Trade Program (ITP), was intended to encourage trade \nliberalization in the Caribbean region while stimulating a growing \nmarket for U.S. exports.\n  It was--and still is--necessary because of increased pressures on the \nU.S.-Caribbean trading relationship as a result of the North American \nFree Trade Agreement and the Uruguay round of the GATT.\n  During the past few months, I have been contacted repeatedly by U.S. \nand Caribbean business leaders and government officials who are \nconcerned that without the Interim Trade Program trade relations \nbetween the United States and the region will be slowly undermined. \nAlready, there is evidence that Caribbean garment exports to the United \nStates have been displaced by exports from Mexico and Asia. Further \nerosion of these trade patterns could have a disastrous effect on \ninvestment, economic growth and, ultimately, peace and stability in the \nregion.\n  I understand that the Clinton administration has pledged to resubmit \nthis legislation early next year, and that it ``staunchly'' supports \nits enactment as soon as possible. The Caribbean now ranks as our 10th \nlargest trading partner, and it is one of the regions with which we \nconsistently maintain a trading surplus.\n  So I hope my colleagues will join me in urging the administration to \nmove quickly on this pledge so we can continue to strengthen our \nmutually beneficial relationship with our Caribbean partners.\n\n\n                     enhancing u.s. competitiveness\n\n  Expanding trade opportunities--whether in the Caribbean, Latin \nAmerica or elsewhere--is essential to our nation's future prosperity, \nbut it alone is not enough. Throughout our trade debates, concerns have \nbeen voiced about the impact of increased international competition on \nour work force.\n\n  While I disagree with these critics' conclusions that we should turn \nback the clock on free trade, I share many of their concerns. If all \nAmericans are to benefit from expanded trade, it is critical that we \nenhance the competitiveness of our nation's work force.\n  The American work force is in the process of substantial structural \nchange. Increased global economic competition and rapid advances in \ntechnology have transformed the economy, streamlining manufacturing \nprocesses and placing a premium on highly-skilled and highly-educated \nworkers.\n  While the demand for skilled workers has increased, the number of \njobs available for those lacking skills has declined. According to the \ncongressional research service, over the past fifteen years, \nmanufacturing jobs--the bedrock of the middle class--declined by 19 \npercent, and real wages dropped by 10 percent.\n  These trends threaten traditional American middle-class life, and \nthey undermine our shared sense of opportunity and experience that form \nthe basis for our success as a nation.\n  The solution to these difficulties, though, is not to turn back, but \nto confront the obstacles head-on. And we are doing so.\n  As a result of the Clinton administration's new investment priorities \nand broad, bipartisan congressional support: 130,000 more children will \nenroll in head start each year, and enter school ready to learn; \nnational education standards and goals will help guide student \ninstruction for the first time; new school-to-work programs will assist \nstudents who choose to move directly from high school to work through \njob training programs, apprenticeships and vocational education; \nstudent loan reform legislation is expanding college access, permitting \nmore flexible repayment options, and saving taxpayer dollars through \ndirect student lending; our unemployment system is shifting to a \nreemployment system, ensuring that Americans who lose their jobs \nreceive skills and job-search assistance to help them find new ones--\nnot just an unemployment check.\n  We must do more--and we will. I look forward to working with \ncolleagues in both parties in the Congress ahead to increase the \nsecurity and competitiveness of the American work force.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  The United States entered the twentieth century as a struggling young \ndemocracy, and here in the century's closing days we find ourselves the \nworld's only superpower. The twentieth century has been correctly \nlabelled the American century. If we are to continue our extraordinary \nand unprecedented record of success and leadership, we must embrace the \nfuture with enthusiasm, strength and foresight.\n  The United States has proven itself to be the strongest and most \nresilient nation on earth. Our citizens are our greatest source of \ntalent and strength. Time and time again, they have been at their best \nwhen they have risen to face difficult challenges.\n  The American people will face the challenge of the global economy, \nand they will prevail.\n  And this Congress will face a decision over whether we will march \ninto the economy of tomorrow face first, with our eyes wide-open, or \nwhether we will be dragged into it from behind, with our eyes firmly \nfixed on the past.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Uruguay round and cast a vote for \nthe working families of America.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will vote for this agreement today, Mr. \nPresident, because I am convinced that it is a good deal for our \ncountry, that it will open more opportunities for our workers--the most \nproductive in the world today--to sell their products in expanding \noverseas markets.\n  But before I explain my decision, I want to say a few words about the \nconcerns of those Americans who oppose this agreement.\n  If this is such a good deal, why do we hear so many voices raised in \nopposition? I believe that there are real reasons for Americans to be \nconcerned about the place of our economy in the world, and concerned \nabout the possible effects on our standard of living from increased \ninternational competition.\n  In recent years, American faith in the future, American confidence in \ndealing with the rest of the world, has been replaced with a growing \nanxiety. Before we have had a chance to enjoy our victory in the cold \nwar, we now face a world that appears to many of us as a threat to our \neconomic wellbeing.\n  Mr. President, if you take a hard look at what has happened to our \nstandard of living over recent decades, you know why many Americans no \nlonger face the future with confidence.\n  Two key elements that traditionally supported Americans' faith in the \nfuture were job security and growing incomes. If you worked hard and \nplayed by the rules, America was the land where you could make a better \nlife for yourself and your children.\n  This was the promise, and the reality, of the American economy for a \nwhole generation after World War II.\n  But in recent years, that reality, that promise, has too often been \nreplaced by stagnant wages and declining job stability. In particular, \nmiddle-class manufacturing jobs have become scarcer, and the security \nof lifetime employment has been replaced by an era of downsizing and \nrestructuring.\n  In my own State of Delaware, we have worked hard, and succeeded in \nkeeping unemployment below the national average, but those trends have \nstill hit every key industry.\n  In an atmosphere like this, it only makes sense for Americans to be \nconcerned about the future, and something that appears as new and \ndifferent as a World Trade Organization as yet another threat to \nAmerican wages and job security.\n  For the average working American, wages have not grown for over two \ndecades. Families now have to run faster--with both parents working--\njust to stay in place. And the jobs that they do find no longer offer \nthe promise of security.\n  No wonder Americans are skeptical about, even frightened, by an \nagreement that appears to draw us deeper into a world economy, and, \nthey are told, ties us to a new international organization over which \nwe have no control.\n  But these changes that worry us today were not caused by the GATT \nagreement, and rejecting this agreement will not make it any easier for \nus to deal with those changes.\n  Other forces have been the source of the changes that rightfully \nconcern us. A revolution in technology--led by the United States--has \ntransformed virtually every industry in this country. Almost every kind \nof work has been made easier and faster by computers and many other new \nways of moving and handling information.\n  These advances in productivity allow us to make more products with \nless labor. Productivity gains in turn have caused companies here to \nrestructure the way they do business, reducing workforces and changing \nthe job structure in our country.\n  Under these new conditions, we must find new, expanding markets for \nour products if we hope to create new jobs. Those markets exist, \noverseas, but we need agreements like this one to open them to American \ngoods.\n  Mr. President, if we reject this agreement, we will give up a $700 \nbillion cut in other countries' tariffs, $700 billion in barriers to \nAmerican products and American job growth.\n  If we reject this agreement, we will give up American negotiating \nvictories that won us fairer treatment of agricultural and service \nexports. For the first time, these sectors--our most competitive \ninternationally--will be subject to fairer rules and will be sold at \nlower prices and higher volume overseas.\n  If we reject this agreement, we will give up powerful new protections \nfor American intellectual property--the scientific achievements \nembodied in the advanced products and processes we protect with \npatents. Other countries are required for the first time to honor those \nprotections.\n\n  That means more jobs here at home, jobs that without this agreement \nwill go to countries that will continue to pirate our formulas, \nsoftware, and other American inventions.\n  Mr. President, another revolution--against State-controlled societies \nand economies--was led by the United States. The obvious superiority of \ndemocracy and free enterprise--the lesson America helped to teach the \nworld--weakened and then toppled totalitarian systems. Communism \nfailed; we won.\n  Along with the rise of new, developing, industrial countries, this \nrevolution has opened a huge new market to international competition. \nWe won the cold war, and our way of life is the most copied and most \nenvied on the planet. Now, people in other nations seek their fortunes \nin a global economy in which we are the best prepared to compete.\n  Despite the many dangers and evils still abroad in the world today, \nwe now see a world less hostile to our way of life, not a world split \nby two irreconcilable visions.\n  Mr. President, we are a long way from a world in which everyone \nenjoys the rights and privileges of Americans. And as some of my \ncolleagues have argued, there remain far too many countries where wages \nand living standards are low. But in recent years we have seen more \nnations look to the American way as the guide for economic development.\n  This is a world in which our workers, our entrepreneurs, scientists, \nand inventors, can compete and win. But to win, we must compete, not \nretreat.\n  Just this year, our economy returned to its position as the most \nproductive in the world. A world reshaped by our inventions and \nconvinced of the superiority of our way of life offers us rich new \nopportunities in expanding markets, if only we will stick to our \nprinciples of free trade and vote to approve this agreement.\n  I have listened to the charges that opponents of this agreement have \nmade. They scared me, Mr. President, as they have scared some \nAmericans. If I thought those charges were true, there is no way I \ncould vote for it. But this agreement is not the cause of the problems \nwe face in our economy. In fact, I am convinced that it can be part, \nbut only part, of a solution.\n  Mr. President, like most of the legislation we pass here in \nWashington, this latest trade deal is neither all its supporters or its \ndetractors claim it to be. This legislation is a compromise among many \ndifferent interests, representing something most of us here can agree \non but that none of us is completely happy with.\n  That is also what happened in the years of international \nnegotiations, conducted under the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \nadministrations, during which this deal was put together. They produced \nan agreement that is the best accommodation among the one hundred and \ntwenty countries that have committed themselves to the world trading \nsystem.\n  And this agreement is just the latest part of a long history of \ninternational trade agreements since World War II.\n  Mr. President, some Americans might gather from some of the \ndiscussion about this agreement that this is something new for the \nUnited States, something that will permanently affect our trading \nrelations with the rest of the world.\n  In fact, this is the eighth round of negotiations we have conducted \nunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade since 1947. As the \nleading market economy in the world, we have consistently pressed \nnegotiations with our trading partners to reduce artificial barriers to \nfree markets.\n  The Uruguay round is a significant step forward, including for the \nfirst time trade in services and agriculture--areas in which the United \nStates has a real advantage, and bringing the frustrating and chaotic \npractices and procedures of the GATT system into a more formal \nstructure, the new World Trade Organization.\n  As important as those changes are, they are incremental, not a \nradical departure from the past.\n  For those citizens whose attention is drawn to trade policy for the \nfirst time with the debate on this, the eighth round of GATT \nagreements, it is important to put its features into that historical \ncontext.\n  I see this process a little differently, from a perspective that I \ngained in a very different policy area--our arms control negotiations \nover this same period. In some ways, our attempts to lower trade \nbarriers is similar to our attempts to reduce the threat of weapons \naround the world.\n\n  From the beginning of the cold war, we recognized that we could not \nachieve our own goal of national security by ourselves. We saw that if \nevery nation went its own way, building more and more weapons to match \nthe threats of others, no one would be safe.\n  Not everyone thought each deal we struck was the best for us--some \ncriticized arms control agreements for giving too much to the other \nside, some thought they did not reduce weapons fast enough. But we \ncontinued to keep the talks going, in the belief--which proved to be \nright--that these complicated issues would only yield to long-term, \npatient negotiation.\n  Taking the best we could get at each stage, our arms control policy \nachieved real progress. Today, new, equally difficult negotiations \ncontinue this process. The alternative--demanding complete capitulation \nby the other side, or abandoning negotiations altogether--will gain us \nnothing.\n  International trade negotiations follow this same pattern. Because \nthere is no final authority to compel countries to follow any trade \nrules, progress can only be made on those areas in which there has been \nagreement.\n  That point bears repeating, Mr. President. The new World Trade \nOrganization has authority over trade rules only as long as we agree \nthat those rules are in our interest. By the terms of the agreement, we \ncan get out of the organization at any time, on six months notice.\n  In addition to that fundamental safeguard, we have put into this \nlegislation requirements for an annual report on the benefits of this \ndeal to the United States, and have scheduled votes every 5 years on \nwhether we should stay a member.\n  A final, additional safeguard sets up a panel of judges to look at \nany rulings that the World Trade Organization may make affecting the \nUnited States. If those rulings are not made according to procedures we \naccept, that is grounds for a vote to get out.\n  Mr. President, some of my colleagues have argued that we will have \nonly one vote in the new World Trade Organization, and claim that will \nput us at an obvious disadvantage in an organization of 120 countries, \nmany of which are smaller and less developed than we are.\n  But the formal operating rule of the WTO is decision by consensus--\neveryone, including the United States must agree before a decision is \nmade. Under the current GATT, consensus is used, but only by tradition, \nnot by the formal rule required in the Uruguay round before us today.\n  If a vote is taken, if consensus fails to produce a decision, no \nimportant change in our rights or obligations can be made without a \ntwo-thirds vote, a supermajority in which the influence of the largest \nmarket and the most productive economy--the United States--will be \nfelt.\n  But even if we fail to get support to prevent a two-thirds vote, Mr. \nPresident, any change in rights or obligations will apply only to those \nwho vote for it, not to those who disagree. Only by a vote of three-\nquarters of the members can change in rights and obligations apply to \nall members, and even then there are provisions for waivers.\n  These are hardly the procedures of an organization designed to \nsteamroll our country.\n  And no action of the WTO has any bearing on State laws, such as \nDelaware's incorporation and other laws that make our State such a good \nplace to do business. The Association of State Attorneys General, \nNational Governors' Association, and National Council of State \nLegislatures support the Uruguay round agreement because they worked \nclosely with the U.S. Trade Representative to get additional protection \ninto the legislation we will vote on today.\n  This is not the end of the process. It is one more step in a series \nof negotiations to improve the long-term growth opportunities for \nAmerican industries. There are certainly many more barriers and unfair \npractices out there that we want to remove. But there will be other \nagreements, if, and only if, there is a structure that continues to \nserve the interests of the United States.\n  Do I like every aspect of the deal? I do not. But I am sure of two \nthings: First, with this agreement, American products have better \naccess to more markets around the globe than ever before, and \nopportunities are better now for future job creation--in the highest \npaying jobs, in exporting industries.\n\n  And second, I am sure that we have preserved our options--we can \ncontinue to use the forum of the World Trade Organization to fight for \nAmerican economic interests in the future. Without the organization--\nincluding the stronger rules that we fought for--countries would go \ntheir own way, back into a system where every nation looks after its \nown narrow interests, and everyone loses.\n  Mr. President, that retreat into protectionism will cost American \njobs, as companies move overseas to beat the tariffs other countries \nraise against products made here. To keep out cheaper imports, we might \ntry to raise the cost of products from overseas--by raising tariffs, \nwhich are taxes on American consumers. We lose jobs, and prices \nincrease--this is no answer to the very real problems in our economy.\n  If there is any doubt about that, just open your history books to the \nperiod of the 1930's. That was when we and the rest of the world \nretreated behind protectionism, and we accelerated the slide into a \nworld-wide depression. We learned from that bitter experience, and \nafter World War II we established the GATT, and have systematically \npushed back trade barriers ever since.\n  Mr. President, my own State of Delaware has been in a great position \nto take advantage of lower trade barriers that we have achieved under \nthe GATT. And many of the successes scored by United States negotiators \nin the Uruguay round directly benefit Delaware's key industries.\n  At Wilmington, Delaware boasts one of the most important seaports on \nthe East Coast, and many of the world's most important high technology, \nchemical and pharmaceutical companies. We stand at the edge of our \ncountry, and have always looked out to the rest of the world for new \nopportunities.\n  The chemical industry is the nation's, and Delaware's, biggest \nexporter--last year, our companies sold $2.3 billion of their products \noverseas, over two-thirds of the State's total exports.\n  The Uruguay round cuts tariffs of our most important trading \npartners, widening the markets for Delaware chemical exports. But I \nwant us to do more, particularly to bring developing countries under \nthe same rules our biggest customers have agreed to. That is why I \nsupport the creation of a strong organization to continue to press for \nmore open markets.\n  Our chemical and pharmaceutical companies will also gain important \nprotection for their patents--the ``intellectual property'' in their \nformulas and processes. For years, other countries have pirated these \nformulas and processes, but at the insistence of the United States, \nthey will now be protected.\n  The Delaware Department of Agriculture endorses the Uruguay round \nagreement, because it will increase American exports of poultry and \nother products important to Delaware. United States poultry exports are \npredicted to rise 32 percent over the next ten years under the terms of \nthe Uruguay round agreement.\n  Not just our biggest companies and industries will benefit from this \nagreement. Delaware has more than 250 exporting businesses. Fully 96 \npercent of them are small businesses, with fewer than 500 employees \neach. Throughout our state, jobs are tied to the international economy \nwhich will continue to grow with the global tariff cuts in the Uruguay \nround agreement.\n  Mr. President, this agreement is one step toward a fairer, more \npredictable world trading system, one in which the specific advantages \nof the United States--in the fast growing service sector, in \nagricultural products, in high technology products--receive new \nprotection and greater access to the markets of the world.\n  Americans are understandably concerned about the changing role of our \neconomy in a changing world. In response to those concerns, this \nagreement will open more growing markets to our workers and factories--\nthe most productive in the world. The agreement will remove $750 \nbillion in tariff barriers in the international economy, increasing the \nflow of trade in a system where we have the advantage of the biggest \nsingle market and the most productive workers.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have several concerns with the \nproposed World Trade Organization [WTO] and associated trade \nagreements.\n  The latest series of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade [GATT] was officially completed on April 15 of this year when \nrepresentatives of over 100 countries signed the final act of the \nUruguay round in Morocco, coming over 4 years after the original \ncompletion date of December 1990.\n  In some important ways, trade barriers are reduced and free-trade is \nenhanced by the most recent GATT. According to the Congressional \nResearch Service, tariffs will be reduced an average of one-third on \nthousands of manufactured goods, and it is my understanding that a \nnumber of improvements have been made in the area of intellectual \nproperty that may benefit U.S. companies.\n  But, Mr. President, there are aspects of the proposed agreement that \nare troubling. There are clearly imbalances in the costs and benefits \nflowing from the proposed agreement, and for certain sectors of the \neconomy, the proposed agreement may be a bad deal.\n  One of the most important small businesses in my own State of \nWisconsin, the family dairy farmer, may be particularly hard hit.\n  Under the proposed agreement, European nations will be allowed to \nsubsidize 30 billion pounds of dairy exports while we will have reduced \nsubsidized exports to just 1.5 billion pounds. In addition, we have \nagreed to open our domestic markets to increased dairy imports which \nwill, in all likelihood, reduce domestic prices for our own producers.\n  A recent analysis of the proposed agreement by Cornell University \neconomist Andy Novakovic concluded that the proposed GATT trade \nagreement could lower U.S. milk price by as much as $2 per \nhundredweight.\n  In Wisconsin, such a price drop could result in the devastating loss \nof as much as $480 million in annual farm income.\n  Mr. President, the economic consequences of such a drop in income \nwould extend well beyond the family farms themselves. That kind of blow \ncould send many rural areas into significant economic downturns, at a \ntime when many are still recovering from last year's floods, and dairy \nfarmers are already having to cope with the arrival of bovine growth \nhormone, and the continuing loss of dairy farms to the west and south \ndue in large part to a Federal milk marketing order system that \ndiscriminates against them.\n  Mr. President, the potential economic consequences could go even \nfurther, underscoring my second concern that there may be an effort to \nimplement the proposed trade agreement without funding that pact.\n  Mr. President, some have argued that we should waive the budget \nrules, and allow the implementing legislation to add to our Federal \nbudget deficit. According to a number of estimates, this will amount to \nan additional $40 billion in deficit increases over the next 10 years, \nnot including the additional interest that will accrue because of those \nhigher deficits.\n  Adding such a huge additional burden to the Federal deficit not only \nbetrays future generations of taxpayers, it arguably undercuts \neverything we have accomplished in the last year and a half to reduce \nthe deficit. By ducking our responsibility on the proposed implementing \nlegislation, we will have undone the progress we made to reduce the \ndeficit, progress which was so difficult to achieve.\n  Waiving our own budget rules in this instance also makes it all the \neasier to do so again whenever finding sufficient funding for a \npolitically appealing proposal becomes difficult.\n  Making exceptions to tough budget rules will soon render those rules \nmeaningless.\n  Perhaps even worse than waiving the provisions of our budget rules, \nsome are now proposing to change the way we calculate fiscal effects to \nallow controversial assumptions to be made about potential economic \nbehavior. The effect of this risky new procedure would be to make it \nmuch easier for legislative proposals to be considered without being \nfully funded.\n  At least a motion to waiver our budget rules is an open, public act, \nfor which each Member may be held accountable. Changing the way fiscal \nestimates are calculated is a surreptitious and disingenuous attempt to \ncircumvent our budget rules.\n  I strongly reject such an effort to sidestep our tough budget rules \nmerely to make it easier to promote a political agenda.\n  The only way we will continue to reduce the Federal budget deficit is \nto maintain strict budget discipline and fully fund legislative \nproposals with real offsets, not by ``cooking the books'' with \nquestionable assumptions.\n  If any savings are realized above and beyond those that \nare calculated under the current, more conservative approach, then they \ncan be applied to further reducing the deficit.\n\n  Are we now to change the budget rules every time compliance with them \nbecomes inconvenient or even difficult?\n  Mr. President, we are confronted on a regular basis with having to \nmake tough decisions on worthy programs because of our budget rules, \nand rightly so. The Federal budget deficit must be brought down.\n  The proposed World Trade Organization is certainly a significant \nmatter, but the importance of an issue should not determine whether or \nnot it should conform with the budget rules we have set for ourselves.\n  Indeed, the true test of our resolve to bring the deficit under \ncontrol is our willingness to apply the budget rules to the important \nissues.\n  To those who suggest that we will generate more revenues than will be \nlost, I say, ``all the better.'' Let us fully fund the implementing \nlegislation. Then, any hoped for additional revenues we realize will \nreduce the deficit that much further.\n  Measure that against the terrible precedent of waiving the budget \nrules, or even worse, of changing those rules to meet our convenience.\n  Mr. President, the last concern with the proposed World Trade \nOrganization I want to discuss relates to the potential impact it may \nhave on how this body, and other democratic policy-making institutions, \nwill be affected by our adoption of the proposed agreement.\n  Despite a comprehensive set of rules, detailing what trade activities \nare permitted and what are not, as well as a dispute mechanism, the \nworld trade system has largely been one of concensus. As the senior \nSenator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] has pointed out, this is because \nthere never has been a formal ratification of what was to have been the \ntreaty formalizing our membership in something called the International \nTrade Organization, proposed just after World War II.\n  Instead, we have operated in the trade system by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, this system has worked both for and against our trade \ninterests, just as the rules of this body sometimes stymie legislation \nwe may want, while also providing individual members and groups of \nmembers protection against possible abuse of majority power.\n\n  An example where the United States has exercised its effective veto \npower by refusing to consent is the tuna-dolphin issue. Despite \nfindings against our Marine Mammal Protection law, the United States \nhas not consented to those findings. As a result, we have not had to \nchange our Marine Mammal Protection law, nor have we been forced to pay \ncompensation, nor have we been subjected to trade sanctions because of \nthe findings against us.\n  This would not be the case under the proposed WTO. If we were to lose \nthe tuna-dolphin dispute as a member of the WTO, and there is every \nreason to suppose that we will, the United States would be put into the \nposition of having to choose between changing one of our laws, paying \ncompensation, or being subject to trade sanctions.\n  We would be faced with these same three options any time we lost a \ndispute with respect to a domestic law.\n  Mr. President, responsible representatives of a number of different \norganizations have noted that there may well be a significant impact on \nour current laws and regulations as well as on future policy and \npolicy-making.\n  The response that some forward--that the proposed WTO and associated \ntrade agreements will mean freer trade--is not sufficient reason for \nthe Senate to ratify membership in the proposed WTO.\n  With respect to our Nation's domestic policies, and aside from the \nnoneconomic goals of our country, though free trade may be a priority \nfor our economy, no trade agreement should come at the expense of the \npolicies that enhance the 90 percent of our economy that is entirely \ndomestic.\n  Nor is free trade the only goal of our foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, a foreign policy that promotes democratic ideals, that \nenhances human rights, that protects the common environment of the \nworld in which we live, is certainly also a goal. Two useful methods of \nachieving these goals have been through trade levers and economic \nsanctions.\n  The proposed agreement greatly diminishes our ability to use these \ntools, and leaves us with fewer, more perilous alternatives.\n\n  And, Mr. President, as others have noted, in addition to our federal \nlaws, our State and local laws would be subject to the oversight of the \nWTO as well.\n  The ominous and far-reaching effect of this agreement has been felt \nalready. Responding to a number of Members who expressed concerns about \nthe effect the proposed agreement would have on our ability to ban \nimports made by child labor, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor, \nin a letter to those Members, conceded that nothing in the proposed \nagreement would change previous GATT rulings that the United States \ncould not block the importation of a product made by child labor.\n  Of broader concern were Ambassador Kantor's additional comments in \nthat letter in which he also conceded that it was likely that the \nadministration will oppose legislation they consider to conflict with \nthe rules of the proposed new World Trade Organization.\n  In fact, this may have occurred already as it is my understanding \nthat during the past session the administration voiced their opposition \nto at least one telecommunications reform proposal as being GATT \nillegal.\n  Mr. President, because of this very aspect of the pact, some have \nsuggested this proposal should be considered as a treaty. Given the \npotential impact our membership may have on our federal, state and \nlocal laws and lawmaking, and on our ability to promote the foreign \npolicy goals I noted earlier, requiring the agreement to be ratified as \na treaty may be appropriate.\n  Mr. President, there have been some recent developments with respect \nto the proposed implementing legislation that I also want address. In \nparticular, I know many were interested in the agreement reached \nbetween the administration and the Republican Leader, Mr. Dole.\n  As I understand this agreement, a judicial panel that would advise \nCongress is created to review the WTO dispute settlement process, and \nto determine whether WTO dispute panels exceed their authority or act \noutside the scope of the GATT agreement.\n  On the charge given to this proposed judicial panel, I would only \nnote that much of the foreboding that surrounds the WTO dispute \nsettlement procedures have not been that a WTO panel would act outside \nits scope or exceed its authority, but that the scope and authority \ngranted such panels in the first place are enormously broad and overly \nintrusive.\n\n  Beyond that, Mr. President, the creation of a judicial review panel \nto advise Congress on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, \nwhatever its charge, does not satisfy the concerns I have outlined.\n  The creation of a judicial advisory panel does nothing to solve the \ndeficit problem created by the GATT implementing bill. Not one more \npenny in offsets is added to the current inadequate level of funding, \nso the implementing legislation still violates our budget rules.\n  Nor does the creation of judicial panel correct the gross inequities \nconfronting our domestic dairy industry. European nations will still be \nallowed to subsidize 30 billion pounds of dairy exports while we will \nhave reduced subsidized exports to just 1.5 billion pounds, with \npotential devastating economic consequences for family farms and many \nrural communities.\n  Nor does the creation of a judicial panel change the outcome of any \nruling by the WTO, nor would it change the impact such a ruling could \nhave on our Federal, State, and local laws, or on our ability to \nconduct foreign policy.\n  In this respect, the defect in the current agreement, as presented to \nCongress, is that we are asked to choose between increased trade and \nindependent democratic institutions. That choice is fundamentally \nflawed, and the creation of a judicial panel does not correct the \nshortcoming.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will not decide that, in the name of free \ntrade, we should join a new international organization that may \ndramatically alter and even harm the ability of our democratic \ninstitutions to set trade and non-trade related policies.\n  Mr. President, we should reject the proposed pact, and seek a new \none--one that provides truly free and fair trade for all sectors of the \neconomy, one that is fully funded, and one that preserves our cherished \ndemocratic institutions.\n  Mr. RIEGLE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this bill to \nimplement the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade--GATT. While this is not perfect legislation, and there are parts \nof this bill that I am deeply concerned about, I believe it is \nimportant for our Nation's economic future that we pass this \nlegislation.\n  The Uruguay round opens foreign markets to U.S. goods and services by \nlowering tariffs and non-tariff barriers in foreign countries, which \nwill benefit many Michigan industries. For example, it will, on \naverage, reduce foreign tariffs on autos by over 50% and on auto parts \nby over 25% by our major trading partners. It will cut foreign tariffs \non household appliances in our major markets by over 40% on average. It \nwill eliminate duties on furniture exports to Japan and the European \nUnion as well as strengthen intellectual property protection for \nfurniture designs. And it will cut foreign tariffs on machine tools and \nopen up foreign government procurement markets to U.S. companies.\n  While lowering foreign trade barriers, the legislation preserves U.S. \ntrade laws. For example, this bill includes a 1-year legislative \nextension of Super 301. While the provision is not identical to the \noriginal Super 301 provision I coauthored with Senator Danforth in the \n1988 Trade Act, I am pleased that the administration and the Congress \nhave recognized the usefulness of this important tool for overcoming \nforeign trade barriers.\n  The bill also includes a provision directing the President to request \nthe establishment of a working group on trade and labor rights within \nthe new World Trade Organization--WTO. While I would like to have seen \nmore on labor rights in this legislation, I believe that such a working \ngroup is an appropriate first step toward grappling with these issues.\n  There are a number of specific issues included in this legislation \nthat I would like to briefly mention. First of all, let me point out \nthat there are losers as well as winners under this Agreement. One of \nthose industries that we face increased pressure under this Agreement \nis the zinc alloy industry. Because of reduced U.S. tariffs on zinc \nalloy imports, this industry is in danger of facing a surge of low-\npriced imports.\n  I am pleased that the Statement of Administrative Action--SAA--\naccompanying this Agreement, which has the force of law, contains a \nprovision which I sponsored requiring the administration to monitor \nzinc alloy imports. This monitoring will continue as tariffs are \nreduced for a period of at least 8 years, to determine if there is an \ninjury or threat of injury to the industry and to the national \nsecurity. If there is reason to believe that there is either severe \ninjury or the threat of severe injury, or injury to national security \ndue to imports of zinc alloys, the administration will initiate a \nsection 201 or section 232 investigation to halt the injurious surge of \nimports. I hope the administration will be aggressive in its monitoring \nand investigation activities concerning zinc alloy imports.\n  A second provision relates to how the anti-dumping laws are applied \nagricultural growers and processors. This problem came to my attention \nin the late 1980's when Michigan cherry growers complained that dumped \ncherry concentrate was causing them injury, even though the domestic \nprocessors themselves, the concentrators, were not necessarily \naffected. Because it was concentrate, and not cherries, that was being \ndumped, and because not all of the Michigan cherries went into \nconcentrate, the domestic growers did not have a remedy under current \nlaw.\n  This is a very complicated problem, affecting many agricultural \nproducts. The SAA commits the administration to review the issue and \npropose legislation, if appropriate, to solve this problem. Again, I \nhope the administration will be aggressive is addressing this ongoing \nproblem.\n  There are other provisions in this legislation, specifically in the \narea of anti-dumping and countervailing duties, that continue to \nconcern me. One outstanding issue is that of duty absorption. In too \nmany cases, importers who have been caught unfairly dumping or \nsubsidizing their products are simply absorbing the costs of the duties \nimposed on them. By not raising prices by the amount of the duty as \nthey should be doing, the importers continue their unfair practice of \nbuying market share even though they may be losing money. The result is \nthat the anti-dumping and countervailing duties are not effective in \nstopping the unfair practices.\n  This bill takes steps to correct the problem by requiring that duty \nabsorption be considered when the International Trade Commission \nundertakes its administrative reviews of a dumping order to determine \nwhether those orders should continue. However, the bill does not go the \nnext step to require a calculation of the size of the duty absorption. \nSuch a calculation as part of the review process would help \npolicymakers by showing the extent of the problem. The Administration \ndoes not need legislation to perform this calculation; nor does the \nlegislation prohibit such a calculation. I hope they will take it upon \nthemselves to make this calculation.\n\n  I am also concerned over the method used to calculate the exemption \nfor start-up costs in an anti-dumping or countervailing duty case. This \nlegislation contains a provision clarifying that such an exemption is \navailable only for true start-up costs and not for costs such as a \nmodel year change over in the auto industry. However, the legislation \nallows variable costs, as well as fixed cost, to be excluded from the \ncalculation of costs in start-up situations. While fixed costs are a \nlegitimate start-up expense, variable costs are an on-going operational \ncost and should not have been included in this exemption. I hope this \nissue will be revisited by a future Congress.\n  In addition, I am concerned about the Agreement's new subsidies code. \nSome of my colleagues fear that the new subsidies rules will force the \nU.S. into a subsidies war by allowing only a very limited amount of \ngovernment funding for industrial research. I disagree. The subsidies \nwar started long ago, and America has been losing. I fear that these \nnew subsidies rules will push us more toward unilateral disarmament \nwhile not stopping our foreign competitors. An Agreement will not stop \nother nations from unfairly trying to wreck American industries. That \nwill take vigorous action by the Federal government in enforcing the \nnew rules and in pursuing assistance to industry where allowed under \nthe rules. We must continue to do all that we can to promote and \nmaintain America's technological competitiveness.\n\n\n                             gatt and nafta\n\n  Mr. President, I was a strong opponent of the North America Free \nTrade Agreement (NAFTA). I felt, and still believe, that NAFTA was \nfundamentally a bad deal for American workers and the American economy. \nMuch of the recent celebratory noises about NAFTA are, at best, \npremature. Shifts in investment and the movement of plants and jobs \ntakes years to show up in the statistics. However, the trend is very \nclear. One just has to look at the number of petitions for the special \nNAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits to realize that companies \nare already shipping jobs south.\n  But the GATT agreement is not NAFTA. At its core, NAFTA was all about \nthe economic integration of a developed nation with a developing \nnation. It was a merger between two economies with fundamentally \ndifferent structures and situations.\n  I supported the U.S.-Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). The CFTA \nwas essentially a deal between like-parties. The U.S. and Canadian \neconomies are similar in their structure and level of development, and \nwere already highly integrated. The CFTA was an agreement to set in \nplace rules to govern our already intertwined economies. NAFTA was \ndesigned to put in place rules to force a joining of very different \neconomies.\n  In that sense, the new GATT agreement is much more similar to the \nCFTA than it is to NAFTA--even though GATT does not go as far as toward \nintegrating economies as the CFTA does. GATT is more a deal between \nequals. While the agreement broadens the scope of GATT coverage to \ninclude more developing countries under its rules, its core is \ncomprised of the developed nations--especially the so-called ``quad'' \nof the U.S., Canada, Japan and the European Union.\n  Whereas NAFTA was, at heart, an issue of economic integration, GATT \nis, at heart, an issue of lowering foreign trade barriers. The Uruguay \nRound includeds an over 40% reduction in tariffs on the most important \nmanufacturing exports to Europe and Japan. It includes large tariff \nreductions in developing nations, such as the rapidly expanding markets \nin Asia and the Pacific. It also includes an important agreement on \nagriculture, including the opening of the Japanese rice market.\n  At the same time, unlike NAFTA, the Uruguay Round does not eliminate \nall U.S. tariffs. Under NAFTA, all tariffs on Mexican and Canadian \ngoods will be eliminated. Under GATT, some tariffs will be phased out, \nothers will be reduced, and yet others will remain in place.\n  A look at the dispute settlement process in GATT and NAFTA confirms \nthe difference. Under NAFTA as an economic integration process, the \nbinational dispute settlement panels can review and overturn decisions \nby the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission in \ncases involving U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws. The new \nWTO dispute settlement panels under the new Uruguay Round agreement \ndon't have the power to overturn U.S. decisions. They can authorize \nother nations to seek retaliation, but they have no power directly over \nU.S. decisions. Rather than seeking economic integration, as under \nNAFTA, the Uruguay Round Agreement seeks to set up a mechanism to \nmanage the rules of the road on international trade.\n\n  Finally, and very importantly, the issue of investment is treated \nvery differently in GATT and NAFTA. NAFTA was, in my view, an agreement \nto make Mexico safe for U.S. investments. One of its major purposes was \nto reduce the barriers to U.S. companies who wanted to set up \noperations in Mexico. The proponents of NAFTA couched this in terms of \nbeing able to have Mexican plants to serve the Mexican market. I think \ntime will show that the results will be to move U.S. plants to Mexico \nto then sell products back to the U.S. market.\n  GATT, on the other hand, says very little about investment. To some, \nthis is a great short-coming of the agreement. However, I believe that \nthe entire issue of the link between investment and trade is one which \nwe need much more time to discuss and understand. Had the uruguay Round \nAgreement taken major steps that would have increased incentives for \nU.S. companies to move overseas, I would be strongly against it. But \nthe new GATT Agreement, unlike NAFTA, does not include these \nincentives.\n\n\n                                funding\n\n  One of the areas that concerns me about this bill is the financing \npackage. Under the current pay-as-you-go budgeting rules, Congress must \ninsure that the bill will be budget neutral. Since implementing the \nagreement involves reducing tariffs on foreign goods sold in the U.S., \nCongress must either raise new revenues or cut spending to replace the \nrevenues lost due to these cuts in tariffs. The amount in question is \nalmost $12 billion over the first 5 years of the agreement. The bill \nsent to us by the Clinton Administration includes a $12 billion \nfinancing package, worked out in cooperation with the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Ways and Means Committee.\n  Technically, however, the bill does not cover all the revenues lose. \nUnder a special Senate rule, revenues offsets are required for a full \n10 years. This rule is separate and beyond the budget deficit reduction \nrequirements we have enacted over the years, As I stated earlier, the \nfunding package included in this bill covers only the first 5 years. \nThus, the bill is subject to a point of order under the Senate rules, \nwhich requires 60 votes to waive.\n  I firmly believe that this legislation, by opening foreign markets to \nU.S. goods and services, will promote economic growth here in America \nand will not result in an increase in the Federal budget deficit. \nTherefore, I will vote to waive any budget point of order that may be \nraised with respect to this bill. We should not allow technical \naccounting rules to get in the way of doing what must be done to ensure \nthat America remains a strong player in the global economy.\n  While I generally do not oppose this funding package, I am opposed to \none element of it--the provisions concerned with the Pension Benefit \nGuarantee Corporation [PBGC]. I stand committed to ensuring that secure \nretirements are available to the working men and women in this country \nand understand that PBGC reform may be needed. However, the PBGC reform \nproposal included in this legislation has been subject to few hearings \nand almost no formal scrutiny by the relevant committees. I am \nconcerned that we may be enacting far reaching changes to the pension \nsystem in our country without adequate debate or discussion.\n\n\n                               fast track\n\n  The issue of the PBGC reform proposals highlights my second concern \nover this bill--the so-called ``fast track'' process. Under the fast \ntrack procedure, legislation to implement a trade agreement proceeds \nunder a specific timetable for Congressional consideration with no \namendments allowed. My concern is not over the timetable for debate. I \nam, however, deeply concerned over the no amendment rule.\n  As the PBGC issue illustrates, fast track is being used for more than \nsimply trade-specific items coming out of a multilateral negotiation. \nAt a very minimum, future Congresses should not allow fast track \nprocedures for trade agreements to be used beyond the intended scope to \nenact non-trade legislation. Any future procedure for handling trade \nagreements should allow amendments in general--and must, at least, \nallow amendments to non-trade, non-germane provisions.\n  There are those who claim that trade agreements must be an all-or-\nnothing vote by the Congress. They claim that to allow amendments to \nsuch a large agreement, negotiated by so many countries, would result \nin an unraveling of the agreement and its certain death.\n  I disagree. The Congress, as the elected representatives of the \npeople, should and must have a say in not only the final product of \nsuch trade agreements but also in the details.\n  Even if such a fast track procedure were critical for large, \nmultilateral agreements, the same procedure need not apply to bilateral \ntrade agreements. Proponents of fast track claim it would be impossible \nto renegotiate an amendment with over 100 other nations. Even accepting \nthat, surely it would be possible to renegotiate with a single nation \nover an issue held by the Congress to be important. Our experience with \nthe NAFTA side-agreements confirms that such renegotiations are \npossible.\n  Likewise, there is no need to extend fast track to the financing \npackages of a trade agreement. Under the current budget rules, any \namendments to the fund provisions would have to be completely offset by \na substitute funding provision. Opponents could not kill the agreement \nby amendment, as some fear. Changes in the financing package would not \nrequire renegotiations of the trade agreement itself. Thus, the \nrationale for fast track does not apply.\n  I believe that our experience with this GATT implementing legislation \nshould serve as a lesson to future Congresses. When used, if at all, \nfast track procedures should be explicitly reserved for truly \nmultilateral trade provisions. They must be clearly restricted to only \nthose parts of a multilateral agreement negotiated with other nations. \nAll other parts of the bill must be subject to amendment--including the \nright of the Congress to add additional safeguards if necessary. Under \nthis process, the rights and obligations of Congress are preserved \nwhile the negotiated parts of the agreement are not subject to \namendment and the threat of renegotiation.\n  This system I have proposed would, I believe, overcome the flaws that \nhave become evidence in the current fast track process, while \ncontinuing our ability to negotiate trade agreements. I hope future \nCongresses will look carefully at this suggestion when debating any \nrenewal of fast track authority.\n\n\n                     sovereignty and related issues\n\n  While I have concerns over this Agreement, I do not believe that it \nviolates U.S. sovereignty, as some have claimed. The rules under which \nthe WTO will operate are generally the same as for the current GATT--\nsomething not well understood. In most cases where there have been \nchanges to the rules, the new rules have a stricter voting \nrequirement--such as increasing the voting requirement from a simple \nmajority or two-thirds to three-quarters, or even to requiring a \nconsensus. Thus, the fears that the U.S. will be ``out-voted'' are even \nless under the new rules than under the existing system.\n  In addition, the WTO, like the GATT, provides a mechanism for leaving \nthe Agreement. This is the ultimate safeguard of U.S. interests--one \nthat I hope this Administration and future Administrations will use \nwisely.\n  There is one change in the rules that has caused legitimate concern. \nUnder the existing system, any finding by a dispute settlement panel \ncan be blocked by either party. In other words, if we challenge another \ncountry's trade laws as unfair in the GATT, that country can block a \nGATT finding that their law or practice is an unfair trade restriction. \nLikewise, we can block any finding against us.\n  Some have claimed that this means that all U.S. laws are at the mercy \nof foreign governments. This is not the case. First of all, the finding \nof a dispute settlement panel is only that--a finding. Such findings do \nnot overturn U.S. laws or regulations. Only Congress can change U.S. \nlaw.\n  If another nation does win a dispute settlement finding against us, \nthere are only four things that could happen. First, the U.S. could \nchange its law or regulation. Second, the U.S. could give the other \nnation a trade compensation--such as lowering existing tariffs on some \ngood exported by that nation to us. Such a compensation must be in the \nsame amount as the economic harm to that nation's trade caused by the \nU.S. law. Third, the other nation could retaliate against some U.S. \nexport by, for example, raising their tariffs in the same amount as the \neconomic harm.\n  Finally, nothing might happen. The U.S. might decide not to change \nits law or regulation and not to grant a trade compensation. And the \nother nation might decide not to retaliate, even under WTO sanction, \nfor fear of starting a trade war.\n  While I reject the claims that the Agreement violates U.S. \nsovereignty, I share the concern that adverse rulings by the dispute \nsettlement panel will be used as political pressure to force a change \nin U.S. law. We must keep up our vigilance to ensure that U.S. laws, \nespecially those concerning worker rights and health and safety issues, \nare not changed merely to suit the convenience of other nations. I \ncommended those who have raised this concern and hope that they will \ncontinue as strong watchdogs of this Agreement.\n\n\n                            future of trade\n\n  Mr. President, as all my colleagues know, I share the concern of many \nthat for too many years, America has been the patsy of the world when \nit comes to trade. We have opened up our markets while others have kept \nthem closed--a situation I hope this Agreement will finally reverse.\n  Labor Secretary Robert Reich has coined the term ``the anxious \nclass'' to describe the feeling that has afflicted the middle class in \nthis country. Wages, incomes and standards of living for working \nAmericans stagnated over 20 years ago. Two incomes are now needed to \nmaintain middle-class status. At the same time, job security has \ndeclined as too many companies continue to look upon workers as a cost \nrather than as an asset.\n  Recessions have made matters worse; but recoveries have not helped. \nEven now, the benefits of the most recent economic recovery have been \ntoo few for too many Americans.\n  Many are opposed to this Agreement--based on these all to real fears. \nHowever, rejecting this Agreement will do nothing to advance our agenda \nto create an effective trade strategy. It will only slow us down as it \nforces us to re-open all of the old trade arguments of the past decade.\n  Rather than turn inward, we need to continue to insist on a trade \nstrategy that opens foreign markets to U.S. goods and services. We need \na trade strategy that targets our export promotion activities toward \nthose markets and those products were we excel. And we need a trade \nstrategy that aggressively uses all the tools at our disposal to \ncounteract unfair and predatory practices by our trading partners.\n  We have the elements of the strategy today. For example, the work of \nthe Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) within the \nAdministration has strengthened our export promotion activities. The \nTPCC has produced and is implementing a strategy to target the so-\ncalled Big Emerging Market and Big Emerging Sectors.\n  These efforts need to be backed up with strong efforts to counter \nclosed markets and unfair trading practices. We have begun to make \nprogress in some cases, such as in telecommunications and government \nprocurement in Japan. But much more is needed, especially in the area \nof autos and auto parts.\n  Finally, we need to proceed carefully with the next steps of trade \ntalks. We should not let the heady rhetoric of global free trade \nobscure the harsh reality of the strategic nature of the global \neconomy. We should proceed slowly with grand plans for free trade areas \nin the Asian-Pacific region and Latin American--carefully weighing the \ncosts and benefits of such plans. Opening of foreign markets and the \nreduction of trade barriers should be our goal--not the headlong rush \ntoward economic integration regardless of the costs.\n  I am convinced that we can craft a strategic trade policy for \nAmerica--one that opens markets to U.S. goods and services abroad and \nraises workers' standard of living at home. The first step is to move \nforward, not backward. Adoption of this legislation to implement the \nUruguay Round Agreement is that step forward. We need to pass this \nAgreement and move on.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today we face one of the most important \nvotes in the economic history of this Nation. The job growth and \nexpansion opportunities for our country hang in the balance of this \nvote and it is up to us to make the right decision. As the world \nbecomes smaller because of the explosion in communications and \ninformation technologies, we must make the transition to this global \neconomy in a way that provides the maximum benefit for these United \nStates of America. Will this task be easy--No. Is it possible--Yes. \nWell, how can we get there--By passing the Uruguay Round GATT \nAgreement, the United States can take advantage of our inherent \ncompetitive advantages in these new global markets.\n  Mr. President, our historic debate on GATT, which culminates in a \nfinal vote today, should answer a number of important questions for the \nAmerican people. In the next few minutes, I would like to pose some of \nthose questions and provide some answers.\n  What is GATT? Simply put, this agreement sets up a system to help \ngovern how the various member countries will trade. With varying \ncultures, customs, and laws, this type of agreement is necessary to \nfacilitate open and fair trade among nations. GATT reduces tariffs \naround the world by roughly one-third. Since a tariff is nothing more \nthan a tax on exports, this translates into the largest worldwide tax \ncut in history of some $744 billion. Just as the NAFTA agreement has \nhelped open markets with our trading partners to the north and south \nand set up a better defined system to facilitate trade, the GATT will \naccrue these same benefits with over 120 countries.\n  Is the GATT agreement perfect?--No, few things are. Will every sector \nof our economy win under this GATT?--No, but rejecting this agreement \non behalf of a handful of industries is hardly equitable for the \noverwhelming majority of our economic sectors that stand to benefit \ngreatly by expanded opportunities around the world.\n  What does GATT mean for my home State of Arkansas?--It means new \nmarkets, new jobs and economic growth. Just look at what Arkansas has \nexperienced the last few years in terms of exports. In 1987, Arkansas \nexported merchandise worth around $408 million. By 1993, Arkansas \nexports had grown to over $1.1 billion--an increase of 172 percent, \ngiving it the eighth largest percentage increase among all the States. \nWe have clearly demonstrated our ability to compete in the world and \nthis agreement only facilitates more opportunities with new markets.\n  Where are Arkansas exports going?--All over the world. In the Pacific \nrim alone, exports from Arkansas totaled some $269 million. In \naddition, we enjoyed approximately $174 million in exports to the \nEuropean union and had sales to Latin America and the Caribbean region \ntotaling $107 million.\n  What kind of exports does Arkansas make?--Some 95 percent of \nArkansas' export sales in 1993 consisted of manufactured goods which \ntranslate into jobs and opportunities for Arkansans. Specifically, $305 \nmillion of these from the food products industry, $185 million from the \nchemical products industry and nearly $122 million from the industrial \nmachinery and computers industries, not to mention electric and \nelectronic equipment, transportation equipment, and fabricated metal \nproducts representing over $250 million cumulatively.\n\n  Mr. President, I am confident that America will benefit from GATT. \nBut it is also my responsibility to look after the effect GATT or any \nother measure before Congress will have on the State of Arkansas. Mr. \nPresident, the facts I have just mentioned make if abundantly clear \nthat Arkansas will be a major winner under this trade agreement by \nincreasing the trade exports that have benefited our State tremendously \nduring the last several years. I for one, will not sit back and take a \npass on an opportunity to increase Arkansas' prosperity.\n  If it is true that 95 percent of the world's population is outside \nthe United States, then why shouldn't Arkansas and the rest of the \nnation be the ones to sell food, goods and products to these consumers. \nIf we don't, someone else will. We cannot afford to allow some other \ncountry to surpass our position as the world's largest exporter.\n  Roughly, 60 years ago, this country turned away from foreign markets \nand sought to build a wall around our country. This legislation was \nknown as the Smoot-Hawley Act and helped lead us to our worst economic \ndepression. Today, the Congress is again faced with the choice between \nfree markets or isolationism. -I believe we should learn from our \nmistakes and not let history repeat itself. We should take advantage of \nthe enormous benefits this agreement will bring to Arkansas and the \nrest of the country.\n  There have been red herring arguments galore in this debate \npredicting gloom and doom should we pass this legislation implementing \nthe agreement. For example, some have argued the very sovereignty of \nour country may be jeopardized. Mr. President, as much or more than any \nmember of the Senate, I am concerned anytime our sovereignty may be \nthreatened, but this agreement does not. Even the conservative jurist \nRobert Bork has studied this agreement and in his legal opinion GATT \ndoes not pose a threat to the sovereignty of the United States. The \nCongress of the United States and only the Congress can change any law \nof the United States.\n  Mr. President, let us not fall into the easy traps of being against \nchange especially when the benefits can be so great. The United States \nneeds this GATT agreement and it is up to us to deliver. Let's pass the \nGATT and any procedural votes necessary to do so.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I support the GATT implementing \nlegislation. I believe that the GATT Agreement is good for the American \npeople, good for our international competitiveness, and good for our \ncollective future as a nation and a people.\n  The history of expanding trade opportunities has been a history of \nincreasing economic growth, both here in the United States and \noverseas. Lowering trade barriers has consistently produced new jobs--\ngood jobs--here at home.\n  Over the last 50 years, the United States has provided an enormous \nmarket to the countries of the world. At the same time, we have worked \nto gain market access for American products. Both Americans and the \nrest of the world have benefitted. Eliminating trade barriers and \nincreasing trade has therefore been a win-win proposition for the \nUnited States.\n  The Uruguay round agreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and \nTrade is designed to continue that ``win-win'' tradition. It opens \nmarkets and reduces tariff and nontariff barriers, in order to expand \ntrade, economic growth and job opportunities.\n  The evidence is convincing that this agreement will be good for the \nAmerican people. Over the next 10 years, United States GDP will expand \nby $100 to $200 billion as a result of GATT. It will create hundreds of \nthousands of new jobs. It will increase U.S. productivity, real wages, \nand living standards. In 1992, 10\\1/2\\ million U.S. workers owed their \njobs to exports of goods and services. And jobs related to exports pay \nan average of 13 percent more than the national average wage.\n  Under the new GATT Agreement, the United States achieved a 40 percent \naverage reduction of tariffs that our major trading partners impose on \nU.S. products. In the area of industrial goods, worldwide tariffs on \nconstruction equipment, farm equipment, medical devices, \npharmaceuticals, steel mill products, and beer and distilled spirits \nwill be eliminated. Tariffs on electronic equipment and scientific \ninstruments will be halved.\n  These are all areas where U.S. products are of the highest quality in \nthe world. What is more, workers who make medical devices and \nconstruction equipment are well paid. When we sell more of these \nproducts to the rest of the world, we create high skilled, high paying \njobs.\n  In agriculture, the Uruguay round has been very successful in \nreducing trade-distorting subsidies. The United States Department of \nAgriculture expects U.S. agricultural exports to nearly double from \n$4.7 billion to $8.7 billion in the next 10 years as a result of the \nUruguay round agreements. Increased exports will raise U.S. farm \nprices, increase farm income, and lower U.S. Government outlays on \nprice and income support programs. Agricultural export-related \nemployment is expected to increase by as much as 190,000 jobs in the \nnext 10 years.\n  For the first time ever, the GATT Agreements establish multilateral, \nlegally enforceable rules for trade in services. Areas such as \naccounting, advertising, architecture, and engineering services, as \nwell as financial services, will come under the General Agreement on \nTrade in Services. Foreign governments' will no longer be able to \ndiscriminate against U.S. banking and insurance companies. Service \nproviders from other countries will receive no less favorable treatment \nthan that accorded to local service suppliers. U.S. firms will also \nhave the right of repatriate profits.\n  Seventy percent of U.S. jobs are in the service sector. The General \nAgreement on Trade in Services provides new international rules that \nwill greatly benefit this largest sector of the American economy in its \neffort to compete overseas, and that will mean additional new jobs here \nin the United States.\n  In the area of intellectual property, the trade-related intellectual \nproperty rights agreement establishes enforceable multilateral \nobligations to protect copyrights, patents, and trade secrets. Computer \nsoftware and databases will finally have the same protection as a \nliterary work.\n  These agreements will have a very positive effect on Illinois, \nbecause Illinois is a major exporting State. In 1993, Illinois exported \njust over $20 billion of merchandise and services. From 1987 to 1993, \nIllinois exports doubled, and the GATT Agreement will lead to further \nmajor increases in Illinois exports.\n  More importantly, the GATT reduces tariffs imposed by our largest \ntrading partners. Illinois exports $4.7 billion of goods and services \nto the European Union. Those tariffs will be reduced an average of 54 \npercent. Illinois exports almost $2 billion of goods and services to \nJapan. Those tariffs will be reduced an average of 39 percent.\n  This agreement eliminates and reduces tariffs in areas where Illinois \nproducts are strongest. Illinois exported $5.5 billion in industrial \nmachinery. We exported $3 billion in agricultural products. With the \nreduction of tariffs and trade distorting agricultural subsides, these \nnumbers will only increase. And that means more Illinois jobs for \nurban, suburban, and rural communities.\n  I would like to address some of the concerns I have heard from people \nin Illinois regarding the World Trade Organization, and the new rules \nregarding dispute resolution. Under the WTO, the procedures of \ninvestigating a trade dispute will be much the same as the current \nprocess. The difference is that decisions, which are the outcomes of \nthese investigations, will be enforceable.\n  The United States will continue to be able to reject a decision of \nthe WTO. If a decision is made against the United States, and \nsubsequent negotiations cannot resolve the issue, the plaintiff can \nretaliate by lifting tariffs back to where they are today. Further, the \nPresident will support legislation to establish a WTO dispute \nsettlement review commission to ensure that the WTO acted fairly.\n  I do not believe that the United States will be losing its \nsovereignty by joining the WTO. Quite the opposite, the WTO will ensure \nthat the rest of the world practices the kind of fair and open trade \nthat the United States has always practiced.\n  I would like to take a moment to address the anxiety of labor unions, \nenvironmental groups, and consumer groups, who have expressed their \ndeep concerns bout the GATT agreements. To my friends in the \nenvironmental movement, I would like to say that I would not support \nthe GATT if I thought it would lower American environmental standards. \nI do not believe that laws that protect food safety and air quality \nwill be found GATT illegal. As we saw in the recent ruling on cafe \nstandards, our environmental laws are legal as long as they do not \nfavor domestic producers over foreign ones.\n  With regard to labor, I understand the concerns of Americans who \nworry about losing jobs to low-wage workers overseas. I think it is \nworth keeping in mind, however, that fully 40 percent of our overall \ntrade deficit is with Japan, a country that pays its workers even more, \nin dollar terms, than American workers earn. Yet Japan not only runs an \nenormous trade surplus with the United States, but with the entire \nworld.\n  It is also worth keeping in mind that defeating the GATT will not \nprotect Americans from low-wage workers abroad. U.S. tariffs are \nalready far lower than tariffs in most other nations, and defeating \nGATT would not increase them. Our future depends not on high tariffs, \nbut on continuing to do what we are already doing, working much \nsmarter, working much more productively, than our international \ncompetition.\n  To take just one example of what I mean, it wasn't very long ago that \nmany people were writing off the U.S. automobile industry. U.S. \nmanufacturers were steadily losing market share to foreign competitors. \nNow, the U.S. is the place to manufacture. Foreign car companies \neagerly build plants in the United States because of the advantages of \nmanufacturing here, and one of the most important of those advantages \nis the American work force. In one industry after another, Americans \nare demonstrating that we are the most productive workers in the world. \nWe can compete--and win--internationally, and that is what we must \ncontinue to do.\n  Mr. President, the Uruguay round builds upon the long U.S. tradition \nof open markets. It increases the volume of trade and investment \nworldwide, which will create jobs at home and abroad. It anchors the \nUnited States in the family of trading nations, and it sets fair and \nuniversal standards for us to compete in the global marketplace.\n  The GATT agreements are, in essence, about confidence, confidence in \nour future and confidence in our children. I am voting for GATT because \nI am confident that Americans will prosper under the new trading \nregime. Americans are ready to compete and succeed, and GATT will help \nthem to be more successful.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, after a careful listening to those on both \nsides of the issue, I have decided to support the implementing \nlegislation for the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade [GATT], as well as the motion to waive the budget point of \norder against the bill. I have concluded that the Uruguay Round \nAgreement, on balance, offers a promising opportunity for the United \nStates--already the largest and most open market the world--to secure \nits fair share of a growing world marketplace, and more importantly, to \ngenerate here at home the kind of good-paying, skilled jobs that, in my \nview, give purpose to our efforts to pursue trade reform.\n  This agreement, as some of its detractors unfortunately fail to \nmention, is actually the product of nearly 8 years of negotiations \ninvolving over 120 countries. It is a work that has been many, many \nmonths in progress, and the subject of numerous hearings and debates in \nCongress ever since this trade round was inaugurated in September, \n1986. This implementing measure would have been voted on months ago, \nexcept for the procedures governing consideration of the bill which \nspecifically provided various committees of the Congress an established \ntimetable to examine the bill's provisions and weight its impact. But \nfor the fact that a single committee exercised its full rights under \nthese procedural timetables, we would have voted on this agreement well \nin advance of this fall's election. Although this bill is indeed a very \ncomplex piece of legislation, this is not, in other words, a document \nthat has been sprung on Congress and the American people without \nnotice, without debate, and without the opportunity for challenge. It's \na sad commentary on the state of civic debate in this country that the \nagreement's opponents have resorted to describing the current situation \nin a manner deliberately intended to fuel public suspicion that this is \na back-room deal, written in secrecy under the direction of \nmultinational corporations at the expense of U.S. workers and \nconsumers, presented for rushed, last-minute approval by defeated \nMembers of Congress.\n  As the largest but already the most open economy in the world, the \nUnited States has something to lose but certainly much to gain as we \nreduce our trade barriers still further but in turn secure from our \nGATT trading partners, as this agreement does, the obligation to \nprovide even greater access to their markets. The vast majority of the \neconomic assessments that I have seen point to the agreement's likely \nresult in creating more American jobs, boosting national income and \nreturning more, not less, to the U.S. Treasury, despite the known \nrevenue loss associated with the tariff reductions included in the \nimplementing bill.\n\n  The likelihood that this agreement will increase Treasury receipts \nrather than decrease them is the reason why I will support the motion \nto waive the budget point of order against the agreement. This bill, I \nbelieve, is as clear an example as any why our budget procedures \nrightly provide a limited opportunity for a waiver. Under our current \nbudget rules, we are required to acknowledge the known costs of a \nbill--in this case, the revenue losses resulting from the tariff cuts. \nHowever, those same rules prevent us from assuming--on the ground that \nthey are too speculative--the likely gains to the Treasury that most \nstudies conclude should result from the increased U.S. employment, \nincome, and tax revenue expected to be generated by the pact. I support \nthe waiver, in short, because I agree that the Uruguay round is likely \nto lead to increased trade and increased economic activity that will \noffset expected tariff revenue losses, leaving our annual budget \ndeficits no worse than currently projected. I believe strongly that \nfree trade, fairly conducted, is good for the world economy and \nparticularly good for the United States and its workers. From \nagriculture, to services, to technology, to basic manufacturing, the \nU.S. ranks among the world leaders and has the potential, under this \nagreement, to strengthen its position still more.\n  A central source of controversy surrounding this agreement involves, \nof course, the proposed new World Trade Organization [WTO] that will be \nestablished to replace the current GATT body as the forum for \nconsidering and resolving trade disputes. In my view, this issue \nessentially boils down to one question: Do we favor finally putting \nsome teeth into the enforcement of decisions that arise from \ninternational trade disputes? Or do we prefer to continue the current \nsystem under which the United States has, on several occasions, brought \nunfair trade complaints against other countries, and prevailed under a \nsubsequent GATT review, only to have the offending country ignore the \nGATT decision and snub the United States? I believe the United States \nhas much more to gain than to lose by giving meaning to the resolution \nprocess governing international trade.\n  I understand that there is strong concern, quite legitimate, about \nthe impact of a WTO finding that may go against the United States. \nDespite considerable misinformation to the contrary, an adverse WTO \ndecision could not force the United States to change a Federal, State, \nor local law or regulation. What it would require the United States to \ndo, however, is to decide whether to comply with the WTO decision by \nenacting changes in our laws or regulations, or to ignore the decision, \nthus providing the opportunity for the country that prevailed in the \ndispute to impose compensatory tariffs on U.S. exports to that country. \nBut it's up to the United States to decide how to comply or whether to \ncomply, and possibly face sanctions. In any event, only the United \nStates may change its own laws, if that's what we decide to do.\n\n  On the other hand, it must be pointed out, and I believe this is \nvital, that the same risks the United States accepts by becoming a \nmember of the new WTO affords the United States, for the first time, \nthe assurance that we can obtain redress and compensation if we win a \nfair trade case brought before the WTO. As the largest and most open \neconomy already in the world today, it only stands to reason that we \nhave considerably more to gain than to lose by agreeing to participate \nin a world market suddenly obliged to adhere to enforceable standards \nof fair trade.\n  Although I have reached the conclusion, Mr. Prsident, that this \nlegislation, on balance, is good for the United States and deserving of \nstrong support, I believe the agreement itself is deficient in some key \nrespects.\n  For example, nothing in the agreement prompts the United States and \nits trading partners to cooperate in a deliberate way to develop the \ntype of environmental and labor standards that we have adopted in this \ncountry to help ensure that our economic gains do not come at the cost \nof environmental degradation and worker exploitation. Yet, I agree with \nthose who espouse the belief that increased trade, and the economic \nactivity and jobs it generates, tends to list the living standards of \nthose individuals it touches, but I think that as civilized nations, we \ncan and should do more. Those who bring fervor and ideological force to \nthe argument for breaking down trade barriers should be called upon to \nbring a concurrent commitment to elevating the living and working \nstandards of all those who paritcipate, in whatever small part, in the \nworld economy. We in the United States should cede no economic or trade \nadvantage to another country simply because that country has, for \nexample, no Clean Air Act, no Clean Water Act, no child labor \nsafeguards, or no wage and hour standards. Such countries enjoy no real \nadvantage because they lack such measures, and the United States bears \nno unacceptable burden because it has them. But we should, as a member \nof the WTO, do much more to ensure that all nations engaged in \ninternational commerce adhere to similar standards. This must be a \ncentral objective of the trade agreements of the future.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I must note that many of those who \nhave expressed to me their opposition to this agreement have cited \ntheir deep-seated concerns about economic concentration in this \ncountry; the stressful impact of today's changing and uncertain economy \non struggling workers--especially those families with children; the \neroding sense of community and company loyalty; and evidence of failed \ndomestic policies in such areas as agriculture. In short, they have \nexpressed to me their personal anxiety about a rapidly evolving economy \nthat they fear--and the operative word is indeed fear--is producing \nmore losers than winners.\n\n  I say to these opponents that I understand and agree with these \nsentiments. But an international trade agreement alone will not and \ncannot be expected to overcome the effects of failed domestic policies. \nThose policies deserve our separate but equally focused attention. And \nno new trade agreement will halt the fundamental changes that are \nrocking our economy and are likely to continue apace with or without \nthis agreement. But I am confident, and I urge them to consider, that \none of our best opportunities, as a country, to overcome these \ndislocations in our economy and relieve the anxiety felt by families is \nto build on the strengths of the many U.S. industries that currently \nmake up our competitive export sector and employ millions of Americans.\n  For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I intend to support the GATT \nimplementing bill and urge its adoption.\n  Mr. DURENBERGER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nlegislation to implement the GATT Agreement. The agreement represent 7 \nyears of hard work by over 100 countries to overhaul a GATT system that \nwas not working--that was not imposing the needed disciplines which \nenable countries to work together and prosper in a global economy.\n  The new World Trade Organization will enable our country, for the \nfirst time, to effectively address unfair trade practices by other \ncountries. We will no longer have our complaints blocked by an \noffending country. This is major progress. A more effective dispute \nsettlement mechanism is something we fought for during the entire \nnegotiation process--and we got it. It will not affect our sovereignty. \nIt will not force us to weaken our environmental protection laws. It \nwill not impose world government. It will help Americans sell their \ngoods and services abroad under a level playing field. It will impose a \ndiscipline which I believe will avoid the pursuit of protectionist \nefforts by other countries as well as to remind our own leaders how \ncounterproductive these efforts can be in our own country.\n  The Uruguay round agreement achieved significant progress in many \nareas. Agriculture, services, investment and intellectual property \nrights will now be covered under GATT disciplines. Tariffs have been \ncut significantly and important market access goals have been met. \nImprovements were made in the subsidies and antidumping codes. There \nwill be fewer standards barriers. There was an explicit recognition of \nthe right of all nations to retain their tough health and environment \nstandards--unless those standards are imposed solely for the purpose of \nrestricting imports. This is important progress for Minnesota as well \nas the whole country.\n  The progress we made on tariff cuts alone--a global tax cut of $744 \nbillion over next 10 years--and on expanded market access to help us \nexport more of our Minnesota products and services, is worth a vote for \nthe agreement through its implementing legislation. That is progress we \ncan all understand.\n  We have also achieved major progress on more esoteric areas such as \nsubsidies and antidumping. We now have a better system to identify and \ncontrol the use of government subsidies abroad as well as to maintain \nand improve our own tough antidumping laws which have benefited \nindustries such as steel. Yet we have attempted to control the kinds of \nchanges in our antidumping laws which could result in more dumping \ncases against U.S. companies operating in other countries. I have \nworked with the steel industry in Minnesota throughout my entire career \nin the Senate to help them combat unfair trade practices and to improve \ntheir own competitiveness. That industry has gone through a very \npainful, but necessary, modernization and restructuring process and \nappears to be well on its way to regaining its competitiveness \nglobally. But, it, and all of our other industries, need the level \nplaying field of this Agreement to continue to compete.\n\n  The agreement is a definite plus for Minnesota, as an export economy \nwhich will significantly benefit from lower tariffs abroad as well as \nfewer barriers and further access for Minnesota products. Minnesota \nexported $10 billion in 1993--the 13th largest State exporter. \nMinnesota's exports grew by 80 percent over 1987-93 and will only \nincrease under this agreement. Minnesota service companies and \nagricultural producers will now be able to use the disciplines of the \nGATT to ensure that they can trade fairly. Tariff cuts will help many \nof our Minnesota companies cut their costs in order to increase \ncompetitive opportunities abroad. Intellectual property protection \nabroad is instrumental to Minnesota's huge high tech community.\n  In my judgement, agriculture fared very well in the agreement. \nMinnesota's agricultural exports are vital to its economy. Agricultural \nexports in Minnesota increased 25 percent from 1987-93 and totaled $2.8 \nbillion in 1993.\n  The USDA has estimated that the GATT Agreement will boost \nagricultural exports by $5 to $14 billion over the next 5 years. Ag \nsubsidies abroad, particularly in the European Union, have been slashed \nsignificantly, albeit not to the extent we desired. I am pleased that \nso many agriculture interests strongly support this agreement--the Corn \nGrowers, Barley Growers, Pork Producers, Cattlemen's Association, the \nFarm Bureau, Poultry and Egg Council, Sugar Industry and many others.\n  The dairy industry has protested the market opening which will bring \ndairy imports up to about 1 percent of consumption--but dairy now has \nmore access for its exports abroad. The soybean growers wanted lower \ntariffs. The administration is committed to continuing efforts to lower \ntariffs worldwide. The GATT Agreement does not halt that progress.\n  To recognize further efforts to help our important agricultural in \nMinnesota, I was pleased to hear that Bob Dole has secured a commitment \nby the administration to propose $600 million in additional greenbox \nprograms which will help us export even more agricultural commodities, \nincluding dairy and soybeans. Further, the administration indicates it \nwill not propose ag program cuts in the fiscal year 1996 and 1997 \nbudgets.\n  Minnesota has a long history of support for trade agreements and \nlegislation which expands trade opportunities, My record, from my \nsupport of the Tokyo round implementing legislation in 1979, for the \ntwo major trade bills we have passed since then, and for the NAFTA has \nbeen consistent with the interests of my State. I am proud to have \nplayed a role in each one of these efforts, just as I am proud to have \nbeen an active promoter of the GATT Agreement.\n  Despite opposition from labor, I have been encouraged by estimates of \njob creation due to the GATT Agreement. The DRI-McGraw-Hill study \nestimates an employment gain, over that of normal economic expansion, \nof 1.4 million jobs by the 10th year.\n\n  I was also pleased that soon-to-be majority leader Dole was able to \nwork out an agreement with the administration to satisfy some of the \nconcerns about the agreement itself, as well as its funding mechanism. \nWhile I had thought the 6-month notification period in the agreement \nthat would enable us to withdraw from the WTO was adequate, the Dole-\nU.S. review panel was a positive improvement and should satisfy some of \nthe concerns that the WTO panel process could be used unfairly against \nus.\n  Mr. President, I am well aware that this agreement is controversial, \nlargely because it is not easily understandable by many people. It has \nnot received much attention by the press, partly because much of it is \nso technical in nature. I regret the opposition by many of my friends \nfrom labor unions, from environment groups, from the dairy industry.\n  Particularly I regret what has been an unfair characterization of the \nagreement by Ralph Nader and others who have tacked many of the world's \nevils onto this agreement. They are the ones who do not understand the \nagreement--who have not read the agreement.\n  I admit that the agreement fell short in some areas. We did not, and \ncould never, achieve 100 percent of our negotiating objectives. In my \njudgement, we reached far more of our objectives than other nations. We \nshould not delay the agreement. It cannot be reopened next year to \nachieve further progress. That just will not happen--no other country \nwould agree to that. So the significant progress we made over 7 years \nwill be lost if that happens.\n  In addition, the administration communicates that even a 6-month \ndelay would cost the united States $70 billion in lost production and \nreduce employment in the United States by 25,000 jobs a year for 10 \nyears. There is no need to delay. The final agreement has been before \nus for well over a year. We have known our negotiating objectives and \nhave had briefings over the last 7 years from our negotiators.\n  The budget waiver vote before us is the only real vote on the \nimplementing legislation. If we do not waive the Budget Act, the GATT \nAgreement will die.\n  Earlier in the year, I joined many of my colleagues to protest what I \nhad heard was an intention on the part of the administration to waive \nthe full 10 years of the agreement. This was not acceptable, and I \nstrongly communicated that to the administration. However, the \nadministration was able to waive the first 5 years, and I believe that \nthe economic growth this agreement will bring to us will definitely pay \nfor the second 5 years. In fact, the Treasury Department reports $100 \nto $200 billion in added income per year as a result of the Uruguay \nround agreement progress. As a result, I will vote to waive the budget \nrules, although I am generally loathe to do so.\n  Mr. President, we have far more work to do in the area of addressing \nunfair trade barriers and to expand export opportunities for American \ninterests. I wish we could have solved all of the problems in the \nUruguay round, but we didn't. But we cannot scrap 7 years of hard work \nthat is significant progress. There will be future trade negotiations. \nThere will be efforts to improve the WTO as we gain experience with it. \nThere will be discussions in many international fora to focus on the \nunfair labor practices and the need for more environmental protection \nefforts in other countries. We can pursue such issues as CBI parity, \nwhich is necessary to afford the same benefits to our CBI friends as \nthat granted under the NAFTA, again next year.\n  We must adopt this progress and move on to develop and pursue future \ntrade goals which will bring us even closer to where we should be. I \nbelieve that as we do move toward implementing the agreement, it will \nbecome evident to the public that this is a positive and fair \nagreement.\n  I urge the support of my colleagues for the implementing legislation. \nI particularly urge support for the waiver of the Budget Act and to \noppose any constitutional point of order that the agreement should be \nconsidered a treaty. Trade agreements have never been negotiated as \ntreaties, and this one was no exception.\n  Mr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, there has been some controversy about \nsection 801 of the GATT implementing legislation, which requires PCS \npioneers to pay at least half a billion dollars for their FCC licenses. \nSome have questioned whether this provision is the product of some \nunfair sweetheart deal for the pioneers.\n  I am intimately familiar with this provision, which was crafted over \nthe course of several months in an open fashion. I am also familiar \nwith the history of the proceedings at the FCC by which the pioneers \nobtained their preferences. I believe that section 801 guarantees a \nmore than fair return for the government. That is why I supported \nsection 801 in the first place. As far as I am concerned, the matter of \nthe PCS pioneers should now be considered closed.\n  The FCC promised for four years to guarantee the pioneers a license \nas a reward for their innovative efforts--not just an option to \npurchase a license, but a guaranteed license. In January of this year, \nthe FCC clarified that it would give pioneers free licenses, even \nthough it now can auction licenses. Only in August of this year did the \nFCC change its mind. The pioneers have taken the FCC to court, and all \ninformed observers believe the pioneers will win. They will receive \nlicenses for free--the taxpayers will get nothing.\n  The GATT bill guarantees the taxpayers will get payments of 85 \npercent of an average auction price from the pioneers. The pioneers \nwill make a minimum payment of some $530 million even if bid prices are \nlower than expected. No other company has committed to minimum price. \nAnd the pioneers have not been granted a ceiling--if the auction yields \nbillions, they will pay according to the GATT legislation's formula.\n  The GATT implementing legislation's formulation of 85 percent of the \nauction price for the top 20 non-pioneer markets will produce a fair \nreturn for the American taxpayer. The Office of Management and Budget \nestimates that the GATT bill's formula will bring in $1.5 billion--more \nthan the FCC formula, which used a figure of 90 percent of the top 10 \nmarkets.\n  Whatever the projection, it is important to remember that the goal of \nthe FCC's pioneer preference policy, which we permitted the FCC to \ncontinue in the 1993 auction legislation, was to provide incentives for \ninnovators. Raising revenue was not a consideration. The three \ncompanies that received preferences created the new PCS technologies, \nand their efforts will benefit the public as a whole. Jobs will be \ncreated. Tax revenue will be produced. Competition to cellular \nduopolies and telephone monopolies will be created. And consumers will \npay lower prices.\n  It would have been fair for the pioneers to have received their \nlicenses without charge. Requiring pioneers to pay an 85 percent \naverage auction price is more than fair. The pioneers worked for five \nyears to develop PCS and made their research and development available \nto the public so that all could learn and benefit from it. The pioneers \nrelied on a ten-times-reaffirmed promise of a free license--a promise \nthe FCC broke only after the pioneers had performed their side of the \nbargain. They put millions of dollars at stake at a time when PCS was a \nglimmer in an entrepreneur's eye.\n\n  Some have called for an assessment after the auctions of whether the \npayments from the pioneers made a fair return to the taxpayers. I would \nlike to make a few points with regard to this proposal:\n  First, everyone agrees that the pioneers should be immediately \ngranted their licenses. Section 801 specifies that the FCC cannot delay \nissuing licenses to the pioneers more than 15 days after the \nlegislation's enactment. I do not expect the FCC to have any difficulty \ncomplying with that mandate. The license applications have been pending \nmost of this year, and the pleading cycle has been completed for \nmonths. The Administration's letters to Senator Dole on November 23, \n1994, recognized that the pioneers would be issued their licenses now.\n  Second, all of us who are involved in this issue understand that all \nrelevant factors must be taken into consideration. These factors, as I \nmentioned before, include the hard work of the pioneers, their \ncommitment of high-risk capital, their public sharing of research \nresults, their longstanding reliance on the FCC's promises, and the \nextent to which the work of the pioneers created all the auction \nrevenues that the Treasury will receive.\n  Third, no one involved intends the potential for some future review \nto have a chilling effect on the commercial plans of the pioneers. We \nassume that the pioneers will be turning to investors to fund the \nhundreds of millions of dollars needed to pay the Government for their \nlicenses and build out their systems. These investors should not be \nconcerned that Congress will ignore the contributions of the pioneers \nand force them into an unfair and retroactive payment scheme. I believe \nthat there will be no further legislation. It is my view, and, I \nbelieve, the view of my colleagues on the Commerce Committee, that \nSection 801 already provides a fair return to the public. This matter \nshould be considered closed.\n  Finally and most importantly, retroactive legislation to increase the \nprice of the pioneers' licenses would be grossly unfair. For years, the \npioneers were led to believe their licenses would be issued early in \n1994 and would be free. Then the legislative process delayed insurance \nof the licenses and we required the pioneers to pay 85 percent of the \naverage auction price for those licenses. Now that the pioneers have \nsome finality, we cannot in good conscience enact legislation to \nincrease the price again. We should let the pioneers get on with the \nbusiness of PCS. Further retroactive legislation would just be plain \nwrong.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I believe in free trade. I think that \nlowering tariffs, eliminating quotas, and reducing other trade barriers \nis clearly in the best economic interest of the United States. I \ndisagree with those who have taken the floor in opposition not just to \nthe GATT agreement before us, but to the very principles of free trade. \nIn my opinion, the principles of free trade are clear and unwavering.\n  For far too long, U.S. exports have not had a real chance to compete \nin many foreign markets. American producers of goods and services are \nnot looking for a handout in the international marketplace. They are \nlooking for a level playing field. They know that they can compete in \nworld markets if they are given adequate access to those markets.\n  Free trade is not a complicated proposition. If we lower tariffs \nabroad, American products are less expensive to the foreign consumer. \nIt's like a permanent ``sale'' on American products. It is the holiday \nseason in America, and any shopper at any store will tell you that \nthey're more likely to buy an item on sale. After all, why pay more \nwhen you don't have to?\n  So free trade means more foreign consumers buying more American goods \nand services for less money. Foreign sales means American jobs. That is \ncalled a win-win agreement. Who could find fault with that?\n  Mr. President, if the GATT agreement stopped right there, this \nSenator would be its strongest supporter. I have no qualms with the \ntariff reduction schedules included in the agreement. I have no problem \nwith the elimination of non-tariff barriers. But the GATT that we are \nrequired to vote on today does not stop at that point. It goes much, \nmuch further.\n  The agreement jumps off the free-trade track with the creation of the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO). This Senator doesn't believe we need \nanother international bureaucracy of any kind. But the WTO is \nparticularly offensive, and it should be of grave concern to every \nAmerican.\n  The WTO is given substantial legislative, executive and judicial \nauthority. Under the WTO, any member nation--and there are 117 of \nthem--can challenge another nation's law if they believe that the law \nis ``WTO-illegal.'' ``WTO-illegal'' is a vague term that has far-\nreaching implications. Any domestic law that restricts free trade could \nbe subject to challenge.\n  Challenges would then be investigated by a three member panel. The \ndispute panel--or tribunal--would be staffed by trade experts who would \nnot have to adhere to any conflict-of-interest rules. Nor would the \npanels be required to adhere to previous precedents--the cornerstone of \nthe judicial system in the United States.\n\n  The tribunal would meet in secret: no press, no citizen groups, no \nindustry groups. Only national governments would have standing to \naddress the tribunal. Even worse, the final decisions of the panel \nwould be binding unless there is unanimous agreement among all WTO \nparticipants to set aside the findings--a highly unlikely scenario at \nbest.\n  If a country appeals the decision of the tribunal, the resolution \nprocess is no better. Instead of an ad-hoc tribunal, the challenge \nwould be considered by three people from the seven member WTO appellate \nbody. The appellate panel again issues recommendations or findings that \ncannot be reversed except by unanimous consent of the members.\n  So let us assume for a moment that among the thousands of state and \nfederal laws on the books, one is challenged as a barrier to free \ntrade. The initial tribunal is formed and rules that the law is ``WTO-\nillegal.'' The United States appeals the decision, and the appellate \ntribunal also rules that the law is ``WTO-illegal.'' What is our nation \nto do?\n  Under such circumstances, the United States can: (a) negotiate a \nsettlement, or (b) change the offending law, or (c) face fines and/or \nsanctions from the WTO.\n  ``None of the above'' is not a choice under the stringent rules of \nthe WTO.\n  What leverage would be United States have under such a scenario? The \nanswer is: none. The dispute settlement procedures under the World \nTrade Organization are clearly and unequivocally flawed.\n  Other procedures governing the World Trade Organization are similarly \ndefective. Changes to the WTO rules or interpretations will be put to a \nvote unless--again--there is unanimous consensus among all 117 \nparticipating nations. According to article IX of the agreement, ``each \nmember of the WTO shall have one vote.'' The United States is not given \na veto, as it is under the United Nations security council. The United \nStates is not given weighted votes, as it is in the World Bank. \nInstead, the United States is given one vote--the same as Cuba, and \nChad, and Haiti, and Mexico, and on and on and on.\n  Mr. President, not all nations of the world are equal trading \npartners, and creating an international bureaucracy to make them equal \njust doesn't make it so.\n  There is no reason to believe that--when the votes are cast in the \nWorld Trade Organization--the outcome will be favorable to the United \nStates. Let me give a few examples from the voting record of the United \nNations:\n  Nation and percentage of Votes Against U.S.: India--81.5; Cyprus--\n77.6; Morocco--78.1; Sri lanka--78.8.\n  The rest of the 117 nations are not much better. In fact, some have \nworse voting records. All told, developing nations will hold 83 percent \nof the votes in the World Trade Organization. When the results are \nconsistently anti-American, no one should feign surprise.\n  Mr. President, we have a free trade agreement burdened with the ill-\nconceived World Trade Organization. But the problems do not stop there.\n  In August, 1994, OMB Director Alice Rivlin wrote that: ``We do not \nbelieve it is necessary to sacrifice budget discipline to pass GATT in \nthe Congress.''\n  Yet the Clinton Administration is asking Senators to do just that. \nImplementing the GATT is projected to result in a budget shortfall of \n$26.7 billion over the next ten years. Congressional budget rules \nrequire that $26 billion of this shortfall be paid for by spending cuts \nand/or tax increases.\n  The Agreement before the Senate would finance the GATT with $4.7 \nbillion in tax hikes and $3.1 billion in spending reductions. The \nimplementing legislation makes changes in the U.S. Savings bond \nprogram, pension law, licensing fees and a host of other areas wholly \nunrelated to free trade. And still, the Clinton Administration failed \nto reach its goal. The remaining $18.9 billion will simply be added to \nthe national debt.\n  That is unacceptable to this Senator. I had looked forward to \nsupporting a clean GATT agreement that would move America forward. \nInstead, I will vote against an agreement that takes us two steps back.\n  Mr. President, the GATT legislation before the Senate should be about \nfree trade, and only free trade. It should not be saddled with the \nweight of an uncontrollable international bureaucracy and unrelated \ndomestic provisions.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this agreement so we can support an \nimproved GATT next year. That is the only way to achieve an unfettered, \nwin-win free trade agreement.\n  Mr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter of \ngreat importance to the citizens of our United States: The Uruguay \nRound Free Trade Agreement, a bill that needs our immediate attention \nand support in this turbulent era of international trade. Free trade is \ntruly the road to economic success, both foreign and domestic. By \nsupporting open markets and ensuring our industries have the room they \nneed to compete internationally, the United States will remain the \nworld's trade leader.\n  Conceived under President Reagan, nurtured under President Bush and \nfinalized by President Clinton, it is time for the Uruguay Round GATT \nto be implemented. In the United States, lower tariffs and trade \nrestrictions mean increased productivity. As our firms are allowed to \ncompete globally, our workers will maximize their skills and talents. \nAs the demand for U.S. products rises, so too will our Gross Domestic \nProduct. We can welcome a net gain in employment and a stronger economy \ndue to this dramatic rise in exports. When this happens, we will \nexperience the strongest international economy the world has ever seen.\n  Shielding and protecting domestic industries can lead to preposterous \noutcomes. The U.S. has come a long way since our protectionist trade \npolicy was so strikingly and detrimentally enacted during the pain of \nthe Great Depression. What happened, in response to these substantially \nhigher tariffs, could be predicted by any first-semester, economics \nstudent--international trade came to a stand-still, reduced to twenty-\nfive percent of its pre-tariff level. The Great Depression became even \ngreater.\n  A combination of the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which \nlowered some tariffs, and World War II, which taught us the power of \nworking with our partners and not against them, laid the groundwork for \nthe first General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947. Anything less \nthan multilateral negotiations for significantly reduced tariffs and \nthe practical elimination of trade barriers, would drastically hamper \nthe international economy. The original GATT called for this and \ninternational trade took a huge step towards increased efficiency and \neffectiveness through trading partner cooperation. The original GATT \nagreement and its successors have served us well by expanding world \ntrade. However, the current GATT is not enough, we need the Uruguay \nRound Trade Agreement in order to keep pace with our rapidly changing \nglobal economy.\n  Be it stopping tariff wars, clamping down on import quotas, or any \nnumber of other types of restrictions, international trade needs a \nboost. For example, the U.S. is constantly and unjustifiably accused, \nby other nations, of dumping its exports into their economies--\nconsistent, specific antidumping laws simply do not exist outside of \nthe United States. Secondly, unfair agricultural subsidies have been a \nthorn in the side of U.S. farmers for decades. Fearing U.S. \ncompetition, nations resort to protectionist economic policies which \nnot only hurt their industries, but their citizens as well.\n  When the U.S. brings these disputes to the current GATT Council in \nGeneva, years may go by before any settlements are suggested. \nFurthermore, members of the pre-Uruguay Round GATT have been known to \ncompletely ignore Agreement rules and dispute settlements. Uruguay \nRound GATT provisions and the World Trade Organization can bring order \nto the whirlwind of chaotic bilateral trade agreements and broken \npromises.\n  The current system's chaos and inefficiency represent more than mere \ninconvenience; it translates into lost U.S. efficiency, lost U.S. \ncompetitiveness and lost U.S. jobs. Furthermore, without a World Trade \nOrganization, countries who are not members of GATT, who have not \nagreed to lower their trade restrictions, will continue to unfairly \nreap the benefits of trade with members who have lowered tariffs. The \ninstitution of an organization which efficiently and objectively \nreports on trade disputes and expedites the process through which a \nsettlement is reached, will benefit current GATT members and give all \nworld traders incentives to play by the rules.\n  The Uruguay Round includes, for the first time in history, the \nservice sector in a world-wide economic agreement. Members of the new \nGATT, over 100 nations, are making commitments to open their economies \nto business, health, environmental, engineering and construction \nservices, to name just a few. This is an incredible boost to the U.S. \nservice sector.\n  In addition, the agreement strengthens international trade law with \nregard to intellectual property rights. America loses billions of \ndollars each year as everything from CDs to computer circuits are \npirated in foreign countries. The Uruguay Round GATT would make \ncopyrights, patents, trademarks and even trade secrets enforceable \namongst all trading partners.\n  Advances in biotechnology would also be protected by the new patent \nrules. While I believe this is a positive step, I continue to express \nconcern over the ethical and moral implications of patenting genes and \nanimals, now magnified in the global sphere. My concern is compounded \nby the intrusion of ``use'' doctrines, currently regulated at the \nnational or local level. Therefore, I strongly urge the establishment \nof a forum to discuss these issues surrounding the sanctity and essence \nof life, while preserving the beneficial advancement of biotechnology.\n  As crucial as this new GATT is to the nation's economy, it runs the \nrisk of being lost if we do not pass the budget waiver. With one vote \nthe Senate can approve using the PAYGO balance of $1.6 billion and \nwaive the Senate's rule requiring the bill to be financed for ten \nyears. I have not taken budget waivers lightly in the past, nor do I \ntake this one lightly, but we must find the courage to pass this bill. \nThe Budget Rule Enforcement Act was not meant to inhibit our \nlegislative ability. Every so often, in the name of good legislation, \nan exception needs to be made--this is one of those times. Make no \nmistake, those who preach ``free trade'', but do not support the waiver \nare not friends of free trade--they are signing this agreement's death \nwarrant.\n  Any fair discussion of the Uruguay Round GATT must clarify the World \nTrade Organization's ``one member one vote'' policy. Some are worrying \nthat less developed or communist countries will have as much voting \npower as the United States. It is important to keep this in \nperspective: The United States is the world's largest importer and this \nassures economic and political clout, giving a major player such as the \nU.S. a dominant role in the WTO system; we will take a backseat to no \nsingle nation or group of special interests.\n  It must be emphasized that the WTO cannot change U.S. law and U.S. \nsovereignty is not in jeopardy. Any vote to add an amendment which \naffects certain fundamental GATT obligations, such as Most Favored \nNation status, the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the \nAgreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights, requires a \nconsensus by WTO members. Moreover, any amendments that change the \nrights or obligations of members, while requiring a two-thirds majority \nto go into affect, affect only those members who vote for the \namendment.\n  While I believe the Uruguay Round satisfies all sovereignty concerns, \nthe Administration has assured Senator Dole that if the WTO Dispute \nSettlement Body rules adversely against the United States, even three \ntimes in a five year period, we will begin withdrawal from the WTO \nAgreement. This is only one part of Senator Dole's efforts to make the \nUruguay Round GATT more palatable. I congratulate the Republican Leader \nfor his courage and foresight in building these safeguards into the \nagreement.\n  Finally Mr. President, I want to get specific and discuss how vitally \nimportant this legislation is to my state. The Uruguay Round GATT \nclears the road for statewide economic growth. Oregon has an export \neconomy of over $6.2 billion, during its 1987 figure. While Oregon is \nranked only 29th in population, it ranks 18th among all states for the \nnumber of business establishments that export. Oregon's whole economy \nis preparing to feel solid and significant.\n  The revised GATT actually provides overlapping benefits for some of \nOregon's largest industries. For example, in 1993 Oregon exported one \nbillion dollars worth of industrial machinery and computers. Under the \nUruguay Round rules, the European Union, which imports more U.S. \ncomputers than any other member of GATT, will reduce its tariffs on \nU.S. computers by 80 percent. Not only will Oregon benefit from this \nreduction in trade restrictions, but strengthened intellectual property \nrights will aid the computer industry even more.\n  The hi-tech sector is not the only one which stands to gain. The \npaper industry, one of Oregon's largest exporters, would face tariff \ncuts of 100 percent. The U.S. Department of Commerce expects a $2 \nbillion increase in U.S. paper and allied product exports--this means \nmillions for Oregon. Electronic components, industrial and analytical \ninstruments and semiconductor manufacturing equipment are other Oregon \nindustries that will reap huge rewards if the Uruguay Round passes. \nAgriculture, one of Oregon's mainstays, generates over $1.4 billion in \neconomic activity. Over five years, the Uruguay Round GATT would \nincrease agriculture exports anywhere from $5-14 billion.\n  The Uruguay Round GATT will spur trade on with Oregon's leading \ntrading partners. Looking towards the future, it has the potential of \nopening up whole new territories such as Russia, the Far East and the \nmarkets of developing economies. President Clinton, at the Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation (APEC) forum, laid the groundwork for economies to \nbe opened and all trade restrictions of Pacific Basin countries to be \nremoved by the year 2020. Let the Uruguay Round finish the job so that \nAmericans can benefit from the buying power of the Asian nations, \nincluding Japan.\n  The United States Congress found the courage to vote for the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Since then, we have seen our \nexports to Mexico increase by 20.5 percent and Canada by 11.4 percent. \nNAFTA is working, let GATT work too. This is the time for the United \nStates and our trading partners to completely turn our backs on the \ndestructive, isolationist and protectionist policies we have seen this \ncentury.\n  Other countries are looking for us to take the lead--it is time we \ndid. In the realm of international trade, the United States has no \nchoice but to be the leader, but it requires our vote to be a member. \nThe best way to be a champion of the U.S. economy is to support free \ntrade. Let me have the foresight to pass the Uruguay Round Free Trade \nAgreement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                      URUGUAY ROUND AGREEMENTS ACT\n\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the Senate will now resume consideration of H.R. 5110, which the clerk will report.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5110) to approve and implement the trade \n     agreements concluded in the Uruguay round of multilateral \n     trade negotiations.\n\n\tThe Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the order, there shall be 9 hours of debate remaining under the statutory time limitation with 2 hours under the control of the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan], 2 hours under the control of the Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], and 5 hours under the control of the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Packwood].\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. Mr. Moynihan, the Senator from New York, is recognized.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as may be required to make an opening statement on, as Reverend Halverson said, this last day of the 103d Congress and the momentous--as I see it and many do--decision we will make at the end of this day and at the end of this Congress, which is the decision to ratify or not the legislation that will put into effect the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade culminating 60 years of American trade policy that began with Cordell Hull in 1934.\n\tThe Washington Post has an editorial this morning which, in the view of this Senator, sums up the case with great clarity and force. I would take the liberty, sir, of reading it to the Senate.\n\tIt says:\n\n       Until the Soviet Union collapsed, the military threat was \n     the glue that held the rest of the world together and \n     enforced political cooperation. Currently, it's beginning to \n     look as though trade is going to be the next organizing \n     principle, with trading relations and institutions becoming \n     the transition lines of political influence. Americans can \n     take great pride in the work that their country has done in \n     the past 50 years to bring stability and prosperity to a \n     dangerous world. Some dangers have now vanished with the end \n     of the Soviet Union, but others are appearing. Both for its \n     own interest and the world's, the United States has to remain \n     the central force in the world's trading system.\n\n\tI think we would all agree on that, even if we disagree on the particulars of the arrangements of the institutions, the facilities, that we put in place. But the great point about our decision today is to consult our experience as well as our hopes and not simply our feelings.\n\tTrade is always an area that arouses concern among citizens, and ever has done as far back as our Republic goes. In 1791, Alexander Hamilton, in his report on manufacturers, made a powerful case but a case that had to be made that, no, it would not be enough for the United States simply to remain a rural agricultural nation; that we had to be a manufacturing and trading nation. We have been so ever since, never more so than now.\n\tThis is the expanding sector of our economy, the one that brings--and I think it is fair to say, as the Washington Post observed it--not necessarily more jobs, but a lot of better jobs, jobs with higher value added, higher wages, and better, longer term prospects.\n\tThat, sir, is what brings us here on this final day, an era which we can see as having begun in the depths of the Depression, with the recognition of strong, able leaders--Franklin D. Roosevelt, Cordell Hull--that we had to change what had been a pattern set for many years of protectionism and take the gamble which in the end has succeeded. And, having done so, I say this is the moment of decision.\n\tI met today with my colleague and dear friend, the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Packwood], who is necessarily delayed for a few moments.\n\tI saw my friend from South Carolina visit the Chamber. He is here now. I cannot believe that he will not return in force and with great vigor.\n\tBut, for the moment, it falls to me to welcome him this morning. I made some opening remarks, and perhaps the Senator from South Carolina would like to do so the same.\n\tI yield the floor, Mr. President.\n\tMr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings].\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I always enjoy the comments and expression, and literally the education, I receive from the distinguished Senator from New York. He has a profound sense of history.\n\tWhat happens is that America should continue to lead in the trading system. Therein, in and of itself, is our difficulty. We are not leading; we are losing. Yes, we set the example in a losing fashion over 45, almost 50 years. It was almost like the Golden Rule: ``Do unto others as they would do unto you.''\n\tAnd we tried to set the good example of Adam Smith and David Ricardo of comparative advantage, open markets and free trade, which we all believe in. This Senator voted for free trade with the Free Trade Agreement with Canada. I strongly support the proposed free trade agreement with Chile, which we will be visiting in a few weeks, because we have relatively the same standards of living, the same systems of open markets--David Ricardo--comparative advantage. But the competition, according to Alexander Hamilton or Friedrich List, is measured not by a cheap shirt or what you can buy but what you can produce. Decisions are made that weaken or strengthen the economy.\n\tInterestingly, Mr. President, that is the example being followed today in Eastern Europe. You only have to read this week's special edition of Business Week. Romania, Hungary, and all the rest of these Europeans now are not going for old David Ricardo and Adam Smith. They are going for Friedrich List, as the Germans long since have with their interlocking directives and Japan with the Keiretsu, of course, out in the Pacific rim. And so now, after the 60 years, which the distinguished Senator points out, the change that has taken place with the fall of the wall is that we should no longer sacrifice our economy to keep the alliance together. Yes, the editorial is correct, we kept the alliance together. It worked and it deserves praise. But with this change, now is the time to rebuild the economy of the United States; and the reality is that we are in decline. Everyone knows that. Everyone knows that. That is, the people of America know. That is what the election was about, and the stupid politicians here in Washington--we politicians--cannot recognize it. That is the frustration of the American voter.\n\tThe American worker, yes, the most productive American worker, who is the most productive in the world, is taking home 20 percent less pay than what he was 20 years ago. His wife is having to go out and work to make up for that loss of income. And then you have the latchkey children, and we politicians run around saying, ``I am for the family, and we have to get the children and mothers back together.'' We are separating them with this GATT. Can they not see it? Can they not understand where the crime begins in the inner city of New York, with 93,000 garment workers down there who will now lose their jobs, which will flee to the Pacific rim? Everybody knows. Rather than creating enterprise zones, what we are doing here today at 6 o'clock is taking the enterprise out of the zone. Leading? That Americans should continue to lead the world's trading system--I wish they had politicians and newspapers made overseas. Washington would be out of business and long gone. They make everything else offshore. If we could only get politicians and newspapers manufactured offshore, this crowd would learn quickly.\n\tMr. President, the President went out there just a couple of weeks ago to Indonesia, and every one of those countries in the Pacific rim was at the meeting. We have a deficit in the balance of trade. Who is leading? Is the United States leading? They rebuffed us. The head of trade in Malaysia and the head of trade in Indonesia said, ``We are not going along with this.'' To keep face, they want, of course, this particular GATT, because this opens up the United States, as Senator Brown from Colorado pointed out. This opens us up entirely, but it does not open up the Keiretsu or the closed markets of the Pacific rim. None whatsoever. The GATT proponents defend the WTO rules. Do not worry about the WTO rulings, they do not have to be obeyed, they say. But if nobody changes the laws in the United States, in the debate, ergo, they do not change the laws of Japan or the Keiretsu. They cannot have it both ways.\n\tSo the President is out there with a $150 billion deficit. They keep talking exports, exports, exports. Fine. I export regularly from South Carolina. We built the ports there and we are proud of it. But look at the entire picture, not like a CPA coming in and looking at your expenses and not your income. You are faulty on income here in this case. Your imports far overshadow--$150 billion worth--your exports. There is the President with a $150 billion hole in his pocket and a tin cup begging the Japanese. Tell me about the fears of inflation. They keep writing all those articles about inflation. But I asked Mr. Felix Rohatyn at the GATT hearings that we had in the Commerce Committee and he said, ``Yes, that is a good part of it.''\n\tI said, ``Mr. Rohatyn, is it not a fact that we have depended on the Japanese, until recently, to buy 30 percent of our Treasury instruments to finance our debt? Is that not a fact? Now, is it not a fact that they are threatening us every time we go there and tell them to open the markets?''\n\tWho is the Trade Representative? Ambassador Kantor or Secretary Bentsen? Everybody with common sense knows it is Secretary Bentsen, because he has to finance our debt. So we give in and we have meetings with the Japanese and praise each other and agree to negotiate, as with financial services, and we will come back again. Just like services themselves. We have to negotiate those still. You have to go back to the WTO. Senator Brown read the agreement.\n\tBut the reason for that tin cup in the hand is we have now subjected our economy and economic future to the whims of the Pacific rim financing our debt. We are in decline.\n\tHeavens above, wake up, Washington. My friend John F. Kennedy wrote the book, ``Why England Slept.'' They all say, ``Hollings is just for textiles.'' I have been in textiles, yes, but I have been in an entire picture for 28 years up here. I testified before I got here in the fifties before the International Tariff Commission. I want to write the book called ``Why America Continues To Sleep.''\n\tYes, we have a special session. I never intended it. I never thought the President, not calling us back for a lame duck for health care, or for welfare reform, and not calling us back for all the other issues we are interested in, such as the information superhighway, would call us back for GATT. We have until July 1995 on this one. No industrial country has adopted it, none. So we could easily debate it next year. We debate complicated treaties. SALT I, SALT II, the ABM treaties. We can put in reservations. We cannot do the same with this one, except, of course, for the distinguished minority leader, soon to become majority leader, who goes to the White House and, as we read in a newspaper, in a dignified fashion got his amendments. The Finance and Ways and Means Committees have a right to amend. We will look at the gift to the Washington Post later.\n\tWe will look at these other things later. We will get like 10 New York doctors on Carter's little liver pills. Under the agreement between the President and the future majority leader, we will get four or five court judges to make up their minds for us to see whether or not we will have reservations.\n\tThey get amendments. I do not know what amendments they agreed to. We do not. It is scandalous the way this Congress operates and this Government in Washington. Nothing has changed. They are wheeling and dealing. They are saying: I will take your budget-buster for GATT. You take mine later on for capital gains. Do not be telling me about a veto on capital gains, Mr. President, because it loses $25 billion. I am taking a loss of $31 billion for you today to save your political hide.\n\tNothing has changed. Come on. And our country is in decline and better wake up and not lose. Start leading by rejecting this agreement and getting a good competitive trade policy.\n\tI retain the remainder of my time.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time not be allocated to either side.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will state it.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Is there time allotted for the Senator from New Mexico?\n\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is time under the control of the Senator from New Mexico. If the Senator opposes the point of order the time is under the control of Mr. Packwood.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am sure that the Senator from Oregon [Mr. Packwood], would wish the Senator from New Mexico to have as much time as he requires.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. How much time does the Senator require?\n\tMr. DOMENICI. About 15 minutes, Mr. President.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be recognized for not to exceed 15 minutes.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Moynihan.\n\tMr. President, for some it must have seemed like this day would never come. Hundreds of people, both here and abroad, have worked on the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations for the past 8 years; 125 nations began the negotiations in Punta del Este in September 1986. On April 15, 1994, 111 signed the final act in Marrakesh, and thus we are here. By signing that final act those 111 nations committed to bring the results before their respective legislatures for ratification.\n\tSeveral countries have ratified this agreement, the United Kingdom, Greece, and Belgium among them. France and Canada are very close and will ratify this agreement this year. Japan will soon follow. The United States through the U.S. Senate in this Senator's humble opinion should also vote to ratify this agreement.\n\tMy colleagues from the Finance Committee have ably spoken to the U.S. Senate and the Senators herein regarding the benefits to trade and national welfare that the GATT agreement will afford to our country and our people, and I concur with those remarks.\n\tI especially congratulate the soon-to-be chairman of the Finance Committee for his eloquent remarks. I have listened to them. I openly commend him for his explanation of what trade means to American jobs and what GATT could mean to American workers and American prosperity.\n\tThat is not to detract from other excellent statements to the American people and to the Senate that have been made here on the floor.\n\tThe merits of the Uruguay round agreement have not been nearly so controversial as the issue that I will speak about here today--how the agreement affects the Federal budget. By far the largest budget effect is the loss of revenues from reduced tariffs. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the net revenue loss amounts to $11.5 billion over the first 5 years and $31.8 billion over 10 years.\n\tThis Uruguay round agreement cuts overall U.S. tariff collections by 15 percent from what they otherwise would be. Everyone should understand, because of Budget Act points of order, consideration of this implementing legislation requires 60 votes in the U.S. Senate. I will explain this shortly.\n\tIt has been very difficult for the U.S. Congress to wrap its arms around the deficit. We tried at the 1990 summit conference, but at that time we did not have a GATT agreement in mind. The Chair, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, was an active member of that budget summit.\n\tWe came up with a concept, aside and apart from GATT, and it is called pay-as-you-go. It says, if a policy results in lower revenues, you must make up the loss somewhere else with new revenues or with entitlement cuts. Now, frankly, that is very new, that 60-vote point of order for pay-go. It is very new to American legislation and certainly to the body of the Senate and our processes.\n\tI, for one, believe it is among one of the five or six good new concepts for budget control. It is easy to understand. It resonances nicely--pay-go. Everybody thinks that is right. You ought to pay as you go. But the truth of the matter is that it is all based on estimates and all based on assumptions. What paygo does, in a sense, is put a big picket fence around the deficit.\n\tBut I must suggest we left a nice gate in the fence. There is a little gate in this fence. And the gate is a hard gate to get through--60 votes, supermajority. I submit that is precisely why we put that in and it finds itself right here on the floor.\n\tWhen there is something of paramount American importance, you open the gate and you say, ``Look, these rules are good, but these rules are not impeccable. These rules are not things that cannot be violated.'' And if the GATT agreement is good for America, it appears to this Senator that you ought to open that gate in the fence. And that is why I support waiving this point of order and opening that gate in the fence.\n\tNow I want to continue on to make sure that my constituents and those who are interested in the views of somebody who has been working on the budget for a long time and understands all this estimating, understands the big current argument about dynamic evaluation of activities versus static. I am not one that jumps to the tune of either one, as if the rhythm is absolutely mandatory.\n\tFrom my standpoint, I am looking for accuracy in these two apparently opposite systems of static versus dynamic. And that is at play here today. For those who would like me to say you do not need a waiver because if this was estimated with a dynamic model there would not be any revenue loss, I am not prepared to do that yet. We are going to have a joint hearing with the House and Senate Budget Committees on the dynamic versus static issue. For the first time in the history of both bodies, both budget committees are going to have hearings to let the public understand that.\n\tBut for now, I do not choose to say there is no effect on the deficit, but I do choose to say it is rather minimal. And let me proceed to discuss that, having discussed that opening in that fence with the gate that requires 60 votes to get around this wall.\n\tThe Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, as a result of this agreement, there will be following the results: In agriculture, there will be a savings of $1.5 billion over the first 5 years and $5.2 billion over 10 years. Now that means we will spend less on agriculture because of this agreement.\n\tThe overall net cost of the agreement to the Treasury before any offsets is $10 billion over the first 5 years under the current way of estimating. Over 10 years, the cost is $26.6 billion. However, the administration and Congress worked together to structure a package of offsets. The entire agreement, offsets included, increases the deficit by $1.7 billion over 5 years, I say to Senator Moynihan, $1.7 billion over 5 years and $12 billion over 10 years.\n\tNow I am not one that excuses spending because it is a small amount. But I must put this one in perspective. This increase in the deficit represents two-tenths of 1 percent, I say to Senator Packwood, two-tenths of 1 percent of the total projected deficit for the next 5 years, five-tenths of 1 percent of the total projected deficit for the next 10 years--if, in fact, the numbers are right; if, in fact there is no positive influence on America starting out in the 6th, 7th, 8th year by getting rid of tariffs which have to work in our favor. I have heard everyone speak to that. It is unequivocal that getting rid of tariffs works to our advantage.\n\tSo last May, Congress wrote a budget for this country by the adoption of a budget resolution which set a floor for revenues and a ceiling for outlays. The GATT implementing legislation, on its own, reduces revenues below that floor and, therefore, as I indicated heretofore, violates the budget resolution. The Budget Act defines this in section 311(a) and talks about a point of order. It takes 60 votes to waive, as I have just indicated in my general explanation of the pay-go provisions, which I think have generally been very good.\n\tThis same budget resolution modified the pay-as-you-go point of order established last year. Our pay-go enforcement makes it out of order to consider legislation that, combined with all legislation enacted since August of 1993, would increase the deficit for any one of the following three periods: 1995, 1995 to 1999, or 2000 to 2004. So I say to my friends in the Senate, we are now out there in the 2000 and 2004 part of this.\n\tIncidentally, that was not even the law a year and a half ago. We went out 10 years, I say to Senator Moynihan, and heretofore we had only gone out 5. So, in a sense, we are burdening GATT with a very, very stern test when we are very tough on the evaluation of these activities in terms of estimates.\n\tSo, based on the CBO scoring, it is obvious that GATT violates this pay-go point of order, this fence around expenditures or loss of revenues for the last two thresholds and is subject to this point of order.\n\tI urge that the Senate vote to waive this point of order. And, as I have indicated, generally I do not do that lightly but I believe the 60-vote point of order was there clearly intended to give us the opportunity to not have to comply with pay-go when we find it is in the national interest to do otherwise.\n\tThe administration knew the budget effects of this agreement and knew precisely what they would be. They proceeded to try their hardest, as I can determine, to find ways to offset the costs and it was not their wish to run into points of order over GATT. People worked tirelessly here in the Congress and in the administration for months to work out a funding package for this agreement.\n\tI can remember 8 months ago talking to both Senator Moynihan and Senator Packwood about that. So we have been all busy doing it. We could accomplish it mutually and we had to do it with the administration and the Congress.\n\tSince the agreement with all the offsets will still increase the deficit, this point of order lies. And so we are confronted with the facts as I have described them with this rather small effect if it all works out that way, and do we have a GATT or do we not based upon those rather small and almost insignificant budget effects.\n\tMr. President, our budget rules are tough. They are very tough. They were meant to be. And I think of the rules, as I have indicated before, are like a fence with a gate. We have this small gate, but we are penalized when we use it and we have to get 60 votes. I support waiving this Budget Act for purposes of considering the GATT implementation language and we simply have too much to lose if we miss this opportunity.\n\tIn the field of economics that is known for diverse answers to the same question, there is a remarkable agreement on the benefits of GATT to our people. So where economists differ on many things there is almost a unanimous concurrence that GATT is good for American workers and for our future. So, if we fail to waive, we are letting all that go down the drain because of a 60-vote point of order that I have done my very best to describe in terms of its impact.\n\tIncidentally, the United States is not the only winner. Reducing trade barriers is not a zero sum game where some countries benefit at the expense of others.\n\tThe positive, overall effects of GATT are long term and accrue to all countries participating. With free trade--and free trade causes investment and capital formation--workers become more productive, the economy grows, and jobs increase. Household incomes rise.\n\tWhile we do not score the future expected economic growth for budget purposes, in this case we can be pretty sure it is going to happen. This is one of the cases where we need to crack the gate open, as I have indicated, and fit this legislation through it and waive the pay-go.\n\tIn my mind, this is not a vote on whether we increase the budget deficit. It is a vote for free trade. So for those who are using the budget waiver as an excuse, or for their justification, the truth of the matter is this is not a budget vote. It is a free-trade vote. Those who oppose free trade clearly can use any reason they like. But I believe the view is very shortsighted that predicates a vote against GATT on budget and budget activities.\n\tMr. President, I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I yield the Senator 5 additional minutes.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dorgan). The Senator may proceed for 5 additional minutes.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. Frankly, this GATT agreement will do more for the long-term economic growth and for our people's prosperity than anything else passed in the 103d Congress. And I believe that. Most of what we did has some very measurable impacts and much of it has both negatives and positives. GATT, as an instrument of change in the way the world markets work, is the most significant legislation that we will pass here in the whole 103d Congress, and I stand on that and I believe that.\n\tBefore I conclude, I would like to briefly address a couple of important issues that citizens in my State and many others have brought to our attention. They are legitimate, valid concerns and deserve attention.\n\tFirst and foremost, the GATT agreement does not threaten U.S. sovereignty. Let me repeat. I know people in New Mexico, many of them good, solid friends of mine, have been talking about sovereignty. In this Senator's opinion, the GATT agreement does not threaten U.S. sovereignty. All living Presidents, former Secretaries of State, all former Trade Representatives of the United States, as well as many constitutional scholars, including Robert Bork, are convinced that this agreement does not impede U.S. sovereignty.\n\tAmong all of those people, would any of them want to deny our sovereignty? I do not believe so. I do not believe this Senator wants to, and I do not believe the 61 Senators who hopefully are going to vote for waiver really want to deny our sovereignty.\n\tSimply put, the World Trade Organization cannot change U.S. law. The WTO cannot change a U.S. law because only the U.S. Congress can change a U.S. law. Therefore, even if the World Trade Organization made a ruling that would go against an existing U.S. law, the U.S. law could not automatically be changed to conform to the World Trade Organization ruling. A U.S. law can only be changed if the U.S. Congress votes to change the law.\n\tA final safeguard to U.S. sovereignty is that if at any time the United States becomes dissatisfied, it can withdraw from the World Trade Organization after giving 6 months' notice. That is a pretty good escape hatch. In the event the WTO becomes arbitrary or capricious, we get out.\n\tAnother important concern has to do with why should we do this in this session; why should it not be delayed? Many of my constituents are asking that. The answer is, this is not a ``rush'' to approve an agreement. The GATT has been negotiated for over 8 years by Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton. The Congress has had ample time to review carefully the specifics of this multilateral trade agreement, and it is time to make a decision one way or another.\n\tThere are Senators who have read much of this. There are some who have read every word in it. And one of the overriding reasons why we need to make this decision sooner rather than later is that delay in approving this means that other nations will continue to impose high tariffs on U.S. goods. This is costly to each and every American. The United States should protect its valued business interests and jobs. According to some estimates, a belated passage of GATT implementing legislation could cost us as much as $7 billion in lost production over 1 year alone, as well as thousands of jobs. Given these onerous costs, I believe the time is now. I submit to people around the country and people in the State of New Mexico that we have had plenty of time, over three Presidencies, to work on this and get it where it is. I do not believe it needs to be delayed any longer.\n\tAnother important concern some have in our country, and in my State, is that this agreement appears to be a treaty and, thus, requires a two-thirds vote by the U.S. Senate. It is important to point out this is not a treaty. It was not negotiated as such. It has always been considered an executive agreement by all parties involved. As such, GATT is about the issue of commerce with foreign nations, and under Article I of the Constitution, the Congress has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations. Hence, only a majority vote in both Chambers of Congress is required. If it were considered a treaty, then the U.S. Senate would be required under the Constitution to pass it by a two-thirds vote. However, this is not the case, and I believe the constitutionality of this kind of executive agreement is well established. I do not choose to go into the legal opinions, but I believe it is established.\n\tA final question of special concern is that GATT requires that every United States citizen receive an identification number at birth, and that this matter is unrelated and irrelevant to matters of trade. The answer is that this requirement is included in the implementing language of GATT; it is not part of the GATT itself. This language was included in the implementing legislation because to ensure accurate assessments of income taxes, improper deductions on tax returns must be minimized.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. It is the Social Security number.\n\tMr. DOMENICI. The Social Security number, that is right. As a consequence, this section is designed to reduce tax cheating by people who claim children they do not have, which has the effect of reducing their taxes. This is important because it has a significant effect on the amount of tax revenue collected, which directly correlates with the overall net cost of the agreement to the U.S. Treasury. Therefore, the United States has decided that it is critical to maintain an accurate accounting of its taxable population.\n\n\tMr. President, as I stated earlier, I believe this legislation is extremely advantageous for our long-term economic growth and our American prosperity. It is as fiscally disciplined as it can realistically be. It is something we must pass to achieve better standards of living in our own country and around the world. I have reviewed this agreement carefully, and I am satisfied that it is in the best interests of our citizens. I am, therefore, confident that the GATT should be approved.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon, the Chair is informed, has 4 hours and 38 minutes remaining.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Four hours and 38 minutes remaining? I thank the Chair.\n\tI ask that only for this reason. Senator Grassley is here ready to speak. Does Senator Hollings have any objection?\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Go right ahead. No.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I am going to give him 15 minutes. But I will say this. I have 17 speakers left who have said they wanted to speak. I just know what is going to happen as they begin to get here in the afternoon. They are going to want 10 or 15 or 20 minutes with 2 hours to go, and I will say, for those who want to speak, if they will come over now they are more likely to get 10 or 15 or 20 minutes than they are this afternoon.\n\tWith that, I will yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, will my friend from Oregon allow me just one moment to say that in our case, we are in yet more straitened circumstances. We have 1 hour 55 minutes. The leader will have to have some time. Probably no more than 10 Senators, at most, can be accommodated. There will be a limit of 10 minutes. I hope those who wish to speak will let us know.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa for 15 minutes.\n\tMr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to waive the budget point of order and to support the GATT.\n\tAs my colleagues know, I yield to no one in this Chamber in my desire to cut spending and reduce the deficit. The National Taxpayers Union recently rated my voting record as one of the three most fiscally conservative in the Senate.\n\tI believe it is important that we have the fiscal discipline to pay for tax cuts with reductions in spending or increased revenues.\n\tThat is why I joined several of my colleagues in signing a July 15 letter to President Clinton asking that the administration provide the necessary spending cuts and revenues to make up for the tariff revenues that will be lost under GATT.\n\tThe Congressional Budget Office [CBO] estimated at that time that implementation of GATT will mean a loss of approximately $12 billion in revenues over the next 5 years. The administration's proposed spending cuts and revenue increases would limit this loss to only $2.5 billion over the next 5 years according to CBO.\n\tI am pleased that the July 15 letter was effective in forcing the administration to greatly limit the amount of lost revenues. I am disappointed that the administration did not show the leadership to provide the spending cuts necessary to avoid a budget point of order.\n\tHowever, the $2.5 billion in lost revenues is dwarfed by the costs of delaying GATT and attempting to find the additional funds. The Department of the Treasury has estimated that postponing the implementation of GATT will cost the United States $70 billion in lost production over the next 10 years.\n\tThe Department of the Treasury also estimates that a 6-month delay in implementation will reduce U.S. employment by an average of 25,000 a year over the next decade. These costs greatly overshadow the $4.5 billion in lost revenue.\n\tThe Department of the Treasury numbers are supported by what I'm hearing from my fellow Iowans. In Iowa, many business men and women and especially farmers tell me that they need GATT now. It is my understanding from them that 100's of millions of dollars are at stake for Iowa companies and workers. Enormous grain sales could be lost to unfair EC subsidies if we fail to pass GATT now.\n\tDue to this year's bumper crop, there are now mountains of corn in Iowa. It is imperative to Iowa's economy that this corn reach overseas markets. Iowa State University estimates that GATT will mean a net increase in farm income of $225.5 million in Iowa by 2002.\n\tIn considering my vote on this waiver, it was necessary to weigh the long-term impact. While the budget deficit is a top priority for me, there is no question that GATT will be a tremendous boon to our Nation's workers and the economy. GATT will especially benefit agriculture in our Nation--good news for farmers and for Iowa. A growing economy is crucial if we are going to successfully address the deficit.\n\tThe budget shortfall is half-a-billion dollars a year. While the budget aspect should be a serious concern, an even more serious concern is growth, prosperity and competitiveness. The flow of exports from Iowa and the United States to greater markets will help bring us these. We can't let half-a-billion dollars a year get in the way of that. It would be like building a beaver dam to stop up the Mississippi. It would do nothing but no good.\n\tAs my colleague Senator Domenici, the incoming chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, made clear earlier today, the authority to waive the Budget Act was put into the law by design to provide the Senate a gate to disregard the budget rules when it is in the best interests of the American people. GATT is certainly a case where we must crack open that gate in the budget rules. GATT is without question in the best interests of the American people.\n\tI have voted in the past to waive the budget rules when I believed it was in the long-term interests of the American people. In 1992, I voted to waive the budget act to allow for an extension of emergency unemployment benefits. Given the state of our Nation's economy at the time, I thought it was important that we provide additional benefits to families in need.\n\tSimilarly, it does not make sense to me now to jeopardize the tremendous benefits to working families across America and throughout Iowa from free trade because of the administration's failure to provide sufficient spending cuts.\n\tMr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the budget waiver so we can pass this landmark, worldwide agreement.\n\tMr. President, very soon we will be voting on the GATT implementing legislation, one of the most important pieces of economic legislation since the end of World War II. It is also one of the most controversial.\n\tMany opponents of the agreement have bombarded the American people with the claims that they have nothing to gain and a great deal to lose from implementation of this agreement: U.S. sovereignty will be sacrificed they say; our environmental and sovereignty will be scarified they say; our environmental and health standards will be endangered; and unemployment will soar.\n\tThese are frightening prospects, and if they were true I would be the first to oppose this agreement. But all the ranting from soapboxes doesn't make the opponents arguments true. In fact, these predictions are about as accurate as the one about the giant sucking sound NAFTA was supposed to produce, which has proven to be demonstrably false.\n\tThis is not meant to suggest that the concerns expressed by my colleagues during this debate are without merit. I share many of these concerns, such as the use of child labor in many countries, and will do whatever I can to correct these problems. But I believe we can address these problems more effectively as the most influential member of the international trading community, as opposed to rejecting this agreement outright.\n\tFor each of us however, the failure to secure certain more parochial concerns should have no impact on our decision whether to support GATT. Simply put, the removal of trade barriers generally will promise global competitiveness and greatly improve the standard of living both here and abroad.\n\tA look at GATT shows it is an economic winner for the United States. Economists, both Liberal and Conservative, agree that ratification of the agreement will add $100 to $200 billion to the U.S. economy each year, and create thousands of jobs, particularly in the high value-added, high-productivity, high-wage industries that produce the types of jobs our economy needs.\n\tLet's look at the sectors of our economy that will benefit from this agreement:\n\tForeign tariffs on telecommunications equipment and wood products will be lowered and tariffs on agricultural machinery, construction equipment, pharmaceuticals, toys, and furniture will be phased out, thereby bolstering exports of these products. High-Technology goods will be especially helped.\n\tThe aircraft industry will benefit from lower subsidies to its foreign competitors.\n\tStronger protection of intellectual property will help those industries that have suffered from piracy or product counterfeiting, costing us billions of dollars in lost revenue every year.\n\tAnd especially important to Iowa, exports of agricultural products will rise because of reductions in export subsidies and tariffs in Europe, as well as requirements for minimum import access in all countries.\n\tMy colleagues have discussed the positive impact GATT will have on other sectors of the economy, so I would like to focus on the benefits of implementing the Uruguay round to Iowa agriculture. Perhaps the most significant accomplishment of the Uruguay round is the reduction in tariffs and export subsidies for agricultural products. The tariff reductions will lead to increased access to foreign markets for U.S. commodities--leveling the playing field in the world market for trading agricultural goods. The reduction in export subsidies will force our foreign competitors to cut their support for agricultural exports--again, leveling the playing field for U.S. producers.\n\tHow will these liberalized trade rules benefit agriculture? Although the United States is currently running a trade deficit, we enjoy a healthy trade surplus in agricultural goods. So even though our foreign trading partners erect high barriers to U.S. agriculture imports and heavily subsidize their own exports, the United States still exports more agricultural commodities than it imports. This is a result of the U.S. farmer being the most efficient producer in the world. Because of the wide advantage in productivity enjoyed by the U.S. farmer, we will be able to export even more agricultural products when worldwide barriers and subsidies are lowered.\n\tThe importance of exports to the agriculture sector and the individual farmer cannot be overstated. In any given year, the United States sells about 70 percent of its wheat, 40 percent of its corn and 60 percent of its soybeans in the world market. This year, exports take on increased significance. The harvest of 1994 has resulted in record supplies of corn and soybeans. According to the USDA, the U.S. corn crop could exceed 10 billion bushels for the first time in history and soybeans should set a record at about 2.5 billion bushels. There are literally mountains of grain in Iowa that need to be moved to market. However, the demand for grain in the United States is not sufficient to liquidate these supplies. Therefore, exporting this grain to foreign markets is essential to the viability of the family farmer.\n\tClearly the family farmer and farm-related workers will benefit from GATT. Consider some projections regarding Iowa farmers, for example. The center for agricultural and rural development at Iowa State University has concluded that Iowa producers of corn, soybeans, pork, and beef all benefit to a large degree under the Uruguay round. As a result of increased trade in these commodities, Iowa State economists project cash receipts of corn to increase $184 million, receipts from hogs will increase $110 million, soybean receipts will rise by $83 million and, finally, cattle cash receipts are expected to increase $92 million. The bottom line is that Iowa net farm income is projected to rise over $200 million per year from 1995 to 2002. I want to stress that these figures are just for Iowa farmers alone. The impact on the U.S. agricultural economy is just as dramatic. Cash receipts for agriculture products are projected to rise $5 billion by the year 2002 with net farm income rising $1.4 billion per year from 1995 and 2002. Although these figures are dramatic, my intent is not to befuddle the American public by citing a number of estimates and projections. The basis for these projections is simple: Increased access to the world marketplace will increase agricultural exports which, in turn, will increase the net income for the American farmer and those associated with farming.\n\n\tAnd in regard to the budget issue that has been raised by some of my colleagues, in agriculture alone there are a number of budgetary consequences that are receiving little or no attention. For example without new export markets opened by GATT, U.S. surplus farm production will cost the Government more in storage costs, create higher deficiency payments and require export subsidies to continue the agricultural subsidy battle with the European Union. So rejecting GATT could hurt, not help efforts to reduce the budget deficit.\n\tLet us not forget that the United States has the lowest tariffs in the world, so GATT will mean that tariffs of other countries will come down. So GATT is more in our interest than that of other nations. When foreign tariffs are brought down, the playing field will be level. And as the most productive nation on Earth, we can compete with anyone and win.\n\tIn the final analysis, my support for this agreement is based on the fact that GATT is good for America; GATT is good for Iowa; and GATT is good for world prosperity.\n\tI would now like to deal with some of the arguments that have been filling the airwaves lately, that come close to predicting the end of the world as we know it if GATT passes. The bone of contention for opponents is the provision in GATT that creates the World Trade Organization and gives it the authority to arbitrate and settle disputes between international traders. Opponents claim the WTO would infringe upon U.S. sovereignty making the laws of the land subservient to an international tribunal. They have created the impression that the WTO was foisted on the United States by countries who want nothing more than to invalidate our laws. The arguments ignore the plain facts. The WTO was suggested and fought for by the United States out of frustration with the weakness of, and delays in, GATT dispute settlement proceedings and enforcement. For example, U.S. farmers suffered greatly from the European refusal to abide by several GATT panel rulings on agricultural products and the lack of effective enforcement rules. Under the WTO procedures, countries that discriminate against U.S. products can no longer ignore adverse rulings. And it is worth noting that the United States has won 80 percent of the cases it has brought to GATT since 1947.\n\n\tWith regard to U.S. sovereignty, I can state without fear of contradiction that no Member of Congress is going to vote against the sovereignty of our Nation. This Senator certainly will not do that. But this argument is as false as all the others. Let me quote from the implementing legislation which states that ``nothing in this act shall be construed to amend or modify any law of the United States, including any law relating to the protection of human, animal, or plant life or health, the protection of the environment, or worker safety.'' The legislation also provides in section 102 that ``no provision of GATT * * * that is inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have any effect.'' So the implementing legislation emphasizes Congress' commitment to ensuring that the United States and not the WTO will determine the primacy of U.S. laws.\n\tAnd the opponents conveniently overlook the fact that if we don't like what's happening with the WTO, we can withdraw at any time by giving 6 months notice. And thanks to Senator Dole, we will have another withdrawal option, given to Congress, if a review panel decides that WTO decisions against the United States have been arbitrary or capricious. And if that is not enough, there is a provision in the agreement that gives Congress the right to review our situation under GATT after 5 years and if we don't like what we see we can withdraw at that time. With all these safeguards, it is hard to see how our sovereignty is at stake.\n\tThe plain truth is we are the greatest economic power on the planet, and our influence will be respected. In fact, the WTO will operate under the first rule of international trade: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. If that principle is ignored, then the opposite rule will take effect: He who has the gold, rules. We will dominate the WTO by that simple fact alone. Simply our threat to withdraw will be enough, because who can imagine a WTO without the most prestigious and largest member of the International Economic Community.\n\tLet us bear in mind that membership in GATT is not a lifetime commitment. It is, in fact, a voluntary association which we benefit from because it will require other countries to play by the same rules we have been playing by for years. There is simply no basis to the argument that our sovereignty is in danger, and I want my constituents to know that this argument is not valid.\n\tAnother argument that has people in an uproar is the one that says Congress should not deal with such an important issue during a lameduck session. Well, Congress has dealt with many matters of enormous importance to the Nation in post-election sessions.\n\tSince 1950, there have been six post-election sessions. In those sessions, Congress has passed well over 150 bills, resolutions and conference reports involving matters of national security, economic policy, foreign policy, and Government spending. During these sessions Congress has ratified treaties, approved a budget and budget resolutions, approved major environmental measures, passed a mass transit bill and authorized numerous appropriations.\n\tEvery Member in this body was duly elected by his or her constituents to serve in the 103d Congress, so any suggestion that this post-election session lacks ``standing'' or ``legitimacy'' is not legally supportable. This is the argument one makes when he knows he can not win on the merits. It is simply a smokescreen for delay to give the opponents of GATT more time to appeal to people's fear and insecurity.\n\tAmericans have always had a high view of our Nation. We think we stand for something important, and that its worth offering the world. And the world is listening, as more and more countries try to emulate us. When you are No. 1, the only superpower, the only Nation with a globally appealing ideology, when you want to keep America first, that is the time to promote free trade to open markets to American products. GATT does that, and we should pass it now.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Colorado.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado, Senator Hank Brown, is recognized for 1 minute.\n\tMr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President. I simply wanted to thank the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee for entering into the Record yesterday, following my talk, the portion of the cost of GATT that the United States now pays which is a little under 15 percent. Our share of GATT's cost is based on our share of international trade. In my statement yesterday, I mentioned the U.S. contribution could be as high as 25 percent. This was from an understanding that we may shift to a formula used by the United Nations which is based on a member country's portion of the total world GDP, and from other proposed changes in the assessment of members' contributions to the World Trade Organization [WTO] that may take place soon.\n\tAccording to the State Department, the size of a member country's economy will be a consideration in calculating its contribution to help pay for the new WTO. It is likely that some modifications will be made in the contributions to the WTO based on each member's portion of the total world GDP. Our current portion of the total world economy is 23 percent.\n\tAlso, beginning in 1996, each GATT member country's contribution will reflect its share in international trade in goods, services, and intellectual property. Thus, the U.S. contribution to WTO will significantly increase because we have the largest trade in service and intellectual property in the world.\n\tThe chairman's figures are exactly correct that we currently pay 14.6 percent of GATT's costs. I appreciate very much him taking the time to enter them into the Record to set it straight.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I express my great admiration for the graciousness and thoughtfulness of the Senator from Colorado, who is meticulous in these matters. If there is any one of us in this Chamber who has not had some statistics go awry from time to time, I do not know who that would be. I do very much appreciate his remarks.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Mississippi.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\tMr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon for yielding time to me.\n\tMr. President, after undertaking a careful review of the Uruguay round, I am convinced the GATT agreement provides an unprecedented opportunity to benefit the United States, create new high-paying jobs, and strengthen our economy. The Uruguay round is the most comprehensive trade agreement in history. It breaks down foreign trade barriers and opens markets to U.S. goods, services, and agricultural products. Since the United States already has the most open market in the world, this means more export opportunities for our side.\n\tMr. President, in looking at the agreement and being in meetings with colleagues, talking to administration and former administration officials, I have assimilated a body of information which I am pleased to share with the Senate in writing. I have labeled this information, that I ask be printed in the Record, ``GATT Agreement Facts.''\n\tWe have heard a lot of rhetoric, we have heard a lot of fears, we have heard a lot of arguments, and we have heard a lot of speculation. What the Senate needs to focus its attention on right now are the facts. I asked my staff to try to sift through all of this information that we have accumulated during this process and to put down on paper what the facts are. The facts are overwhelmingly persuasive, in my view, in favor of approval of this agreement, and in waiving the so-called ``budget rule'' to accomplish the approval of this agreement.\n\tI am going to highlight just a few of these facts in the brief time that is available to me, and then ask it all be made a part of the Record.\n\tThe United States accounted for almost 12 percent of all world exports in 1992. We are the world's largest exporting country. We sell more of what we produce in the international marketplace than any other country.\n\tTrade represents approximately one-fourth of our gross domestic product. Over the last 5 years, U.S. exports accounted for half of our total U.S. economic growth.\n\tThe reason these facts are important to me is very obvious. If we are able to lower barriers to our trade throughout the world, then those growth numbers are going to be even higher in the years ahead, above what are already projected to be opportunities for more growth in exports.\n\tIt benefits us more than any other country to lower barriers and to remove unfair barriers to our trade. This agreement will cut tariffs on manufactured goods by over one-third, the largest cut in history.\n\tThe agreement will bring important areas such as services, intellectual property, and agriculture under international rules for the first time. Why is that important? Because agriculture is one of our largest industries. If you add production agriculture with the food processing and transportation industries, almost one out of every five jobs in America depends upon agriculture, food processing, transportation, and the rest.\n\tBeing able to export more from this sector of our economy is a tremendous advantage to the United States, and agriculture subsidies are brought under GATT for the first time under this agreement. Increased agricultural exports will mean higher prices for U.S. farmers, along with increased export-related jobs.\n\tAt the conclusion of my remarks, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a roster of the Agriculture for GATT Coalition be printed in the Record. This is a list of all of the members of this coalition.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n   Mr. COCHRAN. To give you an idea, the Senate should notice there are three single-spaced pages of names of organizations and producer groups in agriculture that support this agreement.\n\tAnother fact that I am including is that in my State of Mississippi, just as an example, we recorded exports of $803 million in 1993, nearly 80 percent greater than the $354 million in 1987, just 6 years before. Exporting and sales in overseas markets is a growth industry in my State, as it is in many other States, and much of that is related to the exporting of food, food products, timber and timber products, and other manufacture products as well.\n\tMississippi boosted export sales of a wide range of manufactured products over the 1987-93 period. Rapidly expanding export categories included furniture and fixtures, up over 1,000 percent; rubber and plastic products, up 600 percent; food products, 502 percent; textile mill products, 330 percent; fabricated metal products, 154 percent; and transportation equipment, 123 percent.\n\tThe agreement contains important provisions to open foreign markets and reduce tariffs on many of Mississippi's largest and fastest growing export products, leading to economic growth and job creation for the State.\n\tMississippi expects rapid growth in overseas sales by Mississippi manufacturing industries such as furniture, rubber and plastics, fabricated metals, and transportation equipment.\n\tExports to the State's fastest growing markets--Latin America--stand to realize significant benefits under the GATT Agreement.\n\tStronger patent and intellectual property protection under GATT and harmonization of foreign tariffs at lower levels will benefit Mississippi's top export--chemical products.\n\tThe agreement's elimination of tariffs on paper goods, wood, and many furniture products will enhance the State's exports.\n\tUnder the agreement, the European Community nations will substantially reduce tariffs on many of the State's exports of industrial machinery and electronics.\n\tThe WTO does not endanger U.S. sovereignty.\n\tThe World Trade Organization would be the governing body of international trade disputes. It provides a forum to resolve trade disputes and investigate the issues of tariffs and other trade barriers. The WTO cannot directly override U.S. laws or require any action to do so. The United States will only be bound to obligations it has accepted and Congress has voted on. In comparison to the current situation, the WTO would have expanded powers. It would be able to exercise indirect powerful pressure upon countries to change its laws that contain more rigid requirements on foreign producers than domestic producers, regardless of whether the discrimination was intended or not. A panel decision will no longer be able to be blocked as under the existing GATT. WTO would allow counties aggressively to go after other countries through international trade measures.\n\tAccording to R. William Ide III, president of the American Bar Association, and I quote:\n\n       In particular, the Uruguay Round dispute settlement \n     provisions leave U.S. domestic legal powers totally intact, \n     just as they were under the old GATT rules. Likewise, the WTO \n     simply provides an updated procedural framework for dealing \n     with GATT trade issues. It gives the U.S. more, not less \n     procedural protections than the old GATT. Finally, none of \n     these changes permits GATT rules to override U.S. domestic \n     law, so U.S. sovereignty remains intact.\n\n\tRobert H. Bork concurs, I quote:\n\n       In sum, it is impossible to see a threat to this nation's \n     sovereignty posed by either the WTO (World Trade \n     Organization) or the DSU (Dispute Settlement Understanding). \n     Any agreement liberalizing international trade would \n     necessarily contain mechanisms similar to those in the \n     Uruguay Round agreements. The claim that such mechanisms are \n     a danger to U.S. sovereignty is not merely wrong but would, \n     if accepted, doom all prospects for freer trade achieved by \n     multi-national agreement.\n\tIn considering the GATT implementing legislation, a budget waiver is justified.\n\tUnder congressional budget rules, the implementing bill must include provisions to offset the loss of tariff revenues under the trade agreements. Estimates of lost revenues are about $12 billion for the first 5 years and as much as $40 billion for 10 years. The bill includes about $1.7 billion in savings available from previously enacted legislation, another $2.2 billion in savings from nontax writing committees--including the controversial pioneer preference provisions--and $7.3 billion in a wide variety of relatively small, unrelated provisions. Most of the sections are tax provisions, but one on tax section pertains to reform of the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation. If a budget rules waiver is needed in the Senate, 60 votes will be needed to pass the waiver.\n\tA study by the Joint Economic Committee Republican staff, using several independent estimates of economic growth under the agreement, found that on average, the agreement will raise nearly $30 billion in new revenue over the first 5 years. After accounting for the expected $12 billion revenue lost to tariff reductions, the agreement still comes out ahead on revenues by an average of nearly $18 billion. When the total fiscal impact is considered, every study of the GATT surveyed by the staff showed a net reduction to the Federal deficit.\n\tAccording to Representative Jim Saxton, of New Jersey:\n\n       We are all aware of the PAYGO rules which threaten to hold \n     up the GATT legislation. In general, the PAYGO rules are \n     helpful in preventing new and wasteful spending. However, in \n     the case of free trade in general and the GATT in particular, \n     such rules fly in the face of virtually all the available \n     evidence. The purpose behind the GATT is to improve economic \n     performance. Virtually all economists agree it will have this \n     effect. * * *\n       There are some valid concerns about the GATT, but \n     objections to this free trade agreement over its fiscal \n     impact are hollow. The GATT will not reduce Federal revenues, \n     and in all likelihood, it will substantially increase them. \n     The Congress should start governing smarter, and the GATT \n     presents a marvelous opportunity to do so.\n\n\n                    background information--history\n\n\tThe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] is a multilateral trade agreement, entered into force in 1948, to promote freer trade among member countries. GATT provides a forum for negotiating trade issues and a framework of principles guiding the conduct of trade. Central features of the GATT framework are: nondiscriminatory trade treatment; reliance on tariffs, rather than nontariff barriers, when it is necessary to protect domestic producers; adherence to negotiated tariff rates, at fixed maximum levels; and, settlement of disputes through consultation and conciliation. The membership of GATT includes 123 countries, accounting for over four-fifths of world trade.\n\tPrior to the Uruguay round, signatory countries had conducted seven rounds of trade negotiations. Despite the significant accomplishments of these rounds in removing barriers to trade, many observers maintained that important reforms were needed to improve GATT rules and procedures, to strengthen the codes negotiated in the rounds, and to expand the coverage of the GATT to new areas of international trade. A conference in Uruguay in September 1986 launched a new round of multilateral trade negotiations.\n\tTrade officials from over 100 countries signed the closing documents of the Uruguay round in Marrakesh, Morocco on April 15, 1994. They endorsed the Final Act, a 22,000 page document that includes rules on trade in goods, trade in services, intellectual property rights, and dispute settlement.\n\n\n                               provisions\n\n\tThe agreement would produce significant changes in the world trading system.\n\tWorld Trade Organization.--The agreement establishes a new structure for the administration of world trade rules. The umbrella body with oversight of this structure will be the World Trade Organization [WTO]. WTO will administer agreements on goods, services, and intellectual property rights, and will oversee the dispute settlement understanding. WTO will also administer the trade policy review mechanism, which will regularly examine countries' trade policies and practices. Countries will have to sign on to all of the new trade structure or none of it, thus eliminating the free rider problem where a country gains the benefits of an agreement without accepting the obligations.\n\tTariff reductions.--Developed countries agreed to cut tariffs on industrial products by an average 38 percent. Tariffs would be reduced to zero for the following: construction equipment, agricultural equipment, medical equipment, steel, beer, distilled spirits--not all kinds--pharmaceutical, paper, toys, and furniture. Tariffs would be reduced by 50 to 100 percent on electronic items, and they would be harmonized at reduced rates for chemicals. Most tariff reductions would be effective after 5 years, except for certain sensitive products, which would have tariffs reduced over 10 years.\n\tAgriculture.--Countries agreed to cut export subsidy outlays by 36 percent and the quantities exported with subsidies by 21 percent--1986-90 base--over 6 years for developed countries and over 10 years for developing countries.\n\tNontariff barriers to imports, such as quotas, will be replaced by tariffs. All tariffs will be reduced by an average 36 percent--24 percent for developing countries--with a minimum cut of 15 percent; 10 percent for developing countries, for each tariff item.\n\tInternal support programs, that distort trade will have to be cut by 20 percent--1986-88 base. Credit will be allowed for cuts already undertaken since 1986. Action will not be taken against export subsidies and internal support measures that meet the above reduction commitments. Imports, however, will be subject to countervailing duties except in certain circumstances.\n\tSanitary and phytosanitary measures.--Countries also agreed to several provisions on sanitary and phytosanitary measures; health and safety measures related to people, animals, and plants. They agreed that each country has the right to set its own standards. Standards should be based on scientific principles and can be more stringent than international standards. States and local governments are expected to abide by the Uruguay round framework, but do not have to lower their standards if the standards are scientifically based.\n\tTextiles and apparel.--Countries agreed to a 10-year phaseout of the current quota system under the multifiber arrangement and full integration of textiles and apparel into the GATT. During the 10-year period, a safeguard mechanism will be allowed to protect domestic industries against import surges; special provisions on transshipments--shipments through a third country--are included. Quotas will be eliminated in three stages over 10 years, with the importing countries having wide discretion over which products are freed from quotas at each stage.\n\tDeveloped and developing countries have agreed to market access commitments, both for tariffs and nontariff barriers. Trade remedies are allowed if a country does not meet its commitments.\n\tSafeguards--protections against import surges that threaten to harm a domestic industry.--The safeguards section includes some incentives to use the multilateral safeguards process rather than unilateral measures, and it places tighter controls on how safeguard measures are used. For example, existing voluntary restraint agreements; agreements where the exporting country voluntarily limits its exports, will be phased out over 4 years, except for one allowed exception that will be phased out by the end of 1999. The reason for imposition of safeguards will be publicly explained, and any safeguards will be phased out over a maximum term of 8 years.\n\tAntidumping.--The agreement consists mostly of relatively minor clarification and expansion of existing provisions. Changes include: a standard of review, greater transparency and due process in antidumping investigations, de minimis dumping and import volume margins, sunset of antidumping orders, cumulation of injury, and recognition of anticircumvention practices.\n\tSubsidies and Countervailing Measures.--The agreement adopts substantive changes in the subsidies and countervailing practice. It (1) introduces modified subsidies disciplines for developing countries; (2) defines ``subsidy''; and (3) categorizes subsidies as: prohibited--specific subsidies--to individual enterprises--and export performance-conditioned subsidies; actionable--countervailable--those causing injury, impairment of benefits, or serious prejudice, subsidies that exceed 5 percent; cover operating losses, or forgive debt; and nonactionable--provisions expire in 5 years--for industrial research, up to 75 percent of cost; precompetitive development activity, up to 50 percent; regional development, or one-time adaptation of facilities to new environmental requirements, up to 20 percent; and introduces modified subsidies disciplines for developing countries.\n\tTrade-related investment measures.--The agreement establishes, for the first time, rules on investment measures that distort trade. It includes a list of measures that are prohibited, including local content and trade balancing requirements. The phaseout period for eliminating prohibited investment practices would be 2 years for developed countries, 5 years for developing countries, and 7 years for the least developed countries. As practices are phased out, a country can impose similar requirements on new entrants into their market in order to reduce any disadvantages on already established firms. A review of this section will be required within 5 years.\n\tServices.--For the first time, countries agreed to international rules and market access commitments to cover trade in services. These provisions are in the newly established General Agreement on Trade in Services [GATS]. Also for the first time, disputes concerning the trade in services will be covered by multilateral dispute procedures.\n\tThe GATS includes a broad framework of principles that include most-favored-nation [MFN] treatment, nondiscrimination among foreign services or service providers; national treatment, nondiscrimination between domestic and foreign services or service providers; transparency, publicly available information; and access to markets.\n\tIntellectual property rights.--The agreement establishes, for the first time, rules for trade-related intellectual property rights [IPR] and brings these issues under a multilateral dispute process.\n\tCountries agreed to observe the major copyright treaty, the Berne Convention, and they agreed to important copyright protections for computer bases, motion picture makers, and sound recordings. They agreed to greater protection under both process and product patents and to some limits on compulsory licensing of patents; however, U.S. pharmaceutical companies oppose the long lead-in time for developing countries to change their laws. Other protections in the agreement cover trademarks, trade secrets, integrated circuits, industrial designs, and appellation of origin--product names specific to a geographical region.\n\tDispute settlement.--The final act greatly strengthens the dispute procedures. It provides that dispute procedures shall apply to the areas of goods, services, and intellectual property rights, and allows cross-retaliation; that is, retaliation in one are to address a violation in another.\n\tSeveral changes are expected to strengthen the dispute settlement process; establishment of a dispute panel upon request, automatic adoption of panel reports, a time limit on implementation of a panel finding, and automatic approval of retaliation if a country refuses to implement the finding, unless a consensus agrees otherwise. A country will not be forced to change its practices if it loses a case, but if it does not implement the panel finding, it might face retaliation by the other party to the dispute. It is uncertain how the use of unilateral U.S. measures, section 301, might change with this stronger dispute process, but many experts have said that there might be less need to use unilateral measures with stronger multilateral rules.\n\tGovernment procurement.--The government procurement agreement provides for open information on bids, minimum deadlines for bids, notification of bid outcome, procedures for protest of bid decisions, and a tie-in to the multilateral dispute procedures. It covers, for the first time, government procurement in services. The agreement sets a threshold for procurement to be covered, and it expands the types of procurement covered by adding sub-federal procurement, limited mostly in public utilities. There is some difference in concessions from country to country, depending upon the concessions offered by each country.\n\tOther trade provisions.--Several other important provisions are in the final act. The section on import licensing procedures includes a minimum notification period if licensing procedures are changed, limits the time to process licensing applications, and requires that countries instituting new licensing procedures must provide detailed notification. The section on customs valuation includes changes related to investigation of customs fraud and developing country obligations. The section on preshipment inspection includes rules related to the use of preshipment inspection companies, which often are employed by developing countries for customs-related work, and dispute provisions. The section on rules of origin includes disciplines on such rules and requires that a 3-year work program be undertaken to try to harmonize the rules of origin among signatories. The section on technical barriers to trade deals with how counties set technical standards and how they determine conformance with those standards. Several provisions relate to miscellaneous GATT articles such as balance-of-payment problems, state trading companies, and preferential trading arrangements.\n\tThe environment.--Environmental issues were included in the final act as modifications to language in the preamble and sections on technical barriers to trade, sanitary and phyto- sanitary measures, and dispute settlement. An environmental work program was formulated and it was agreed that an environmental committee in the WTO will be established to carry out the work plan. Environmental groups are split on the outcome of the round: some support the increased participation that the environmental committee provides; others are concerned about the potential of the WTO to reduce environmental standards and want a full negotiation of environmental and trade issues. Attention will focus on how environmental goals and objectives might be outlined in the implementing legislation.\n\tWorker rights.--The United States pushed strenuously for discussion of worker rights during the months between conclusion of the round and the Marrakesh signing. Although the United States was unsuccessful in having a permanent committee on worker rights established in the WTO, it did have the issue placed on the agenda for the preparatory committee. What this means is that worker rights will be one of the topics considered for possible inclusion on future agendas.\n\tMr. President, based on all of these facts and comments that I have been able to elicit from present administration officials, from the Bush administration and the Reagan administration officials, it is as clear as anything can be that the approval of this agreement and waiver of the budget rules are the things for the Senate to do today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         Ag for GATT Coalition\n\n\n                         national

Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n\tIf I might, Mr. President, I have 16 speakers left, and if we go 15 minutes apiece, I will use up more time than I have. If we can hold it to 15, I would appreciate it.\n\tMrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the debate we are having today is not new; it has raged in this century and those before--here and in the Parliaments of Europe. For most of the Victorian Age, England, the greatest economic power of the 19th century, held to a policy of free trade and prospered. At the turn of the century, an ``Imperial Preference'' plan was proposed to divide the world in two. Crown colonies would enjoy free trade with England, while all other nations would be walled off by stiff tariffs.\n\tThe Imperial Preference was as controversial then as GATT is today. England's greatest statesman, Winston Churchill, was then a back-bencher in the House of Commons. He had followed in his father's footsteps in support of free trade, and as a Conservative Party member. But on the Imperial Preference, Churchill refused to follow his party leaders towards protectionism; he crossed the aisle to join the free-trade liberals, stating that protectionism is a:\n\n       Policy to shut the British Empire up in a ringed fence. Why \n     should we deny ourselves the good and varied merchandise \n     which the traffic of the world offers, more especially since \n     the more we trade with others, the more they trade with us.\n\n\tThis week, as we debate whether our country should continue to be part of the economic community of nations, we should listen to what the lessons of history from abroad and from our own former Presidents teach us.\n\n\n                                history\n\n\tFirst, we need to remember Calvin Coolidge, a plain-spoken American. He said, ``the business of America is business.'' Our national identity is not wrapped up in a historic monarchy. Our Nation is about freedom to pursue life, liberty, and happiness. To succeed in that pursuit, we need jobs--and the paychecks that follow. We need employers and workers, raw materials and factories, customers and suppliers.\n\tWith our abundant resources and educated work force, we produce more than we consume. We cannot have the business and jobs we have today without trade with other countries.\n\tShortly after President Coolidge left office, Congress passed the Smoot-Hawley Act of 1930. Under Smoot-Hawley, tariffs on imports rose to the highest level in history. In 1932, tariffs averaged 59 percent--nearly doubling the cost of imported raw materials and finished goods. Smoot-Hawley pushed us into the depths of the depression; we did not fully recover until after the Second World War. Under authority delegated from Congress, the Roosevelt administrations were able to reduce these tariffs through a series of international agreements.\n\tFollowing the war, the United States and eight other countries agreed to a provisional GATT--15 other nations soon joined. Six rounds of negotiations and agreements followed the initial agreement--the first five concentrated on tariff reduction. Other rounds concentrated on reducing nontariff trade barriers and coordinating antidumping laws. The Uruguay round agreement is the latest step in a continuing series of agreements that have reduced tariffs and other barriers to international trade.\n\n\n                    former president's contributions\n\n\tAs we debate the GATT bill, we need to remember the contributions to two former Presidents--Presidents Reagan and Bush. Under their leadership, the Uruguay round went from an idea--to expand trade agreements beyond tariff reduction to trade in services, trade in agriculture products, intellectual property protection, and reducing government subsidies--to near completion.\n\n\tWithout their unshakable belief in American competitiveness and the free market system, and their faith in the eventual resolution of the talks to the benefit of the United States, we would not be on the threshold of a new chapter in world economic growth. President Reagan said:\n\n       America doesn't need to hide behind trade barriers. Given a \n     level playing field, Americans can out-produce and out-\n     compete anyone, anywhere on earth. That's why it's the policy \n     of this Administration to open markets abroad, not close them \n     at home.\n\n\tPresident Bush's leadership and understanding of North American economics probably did more for free trade than any other modern President. By successfully completing the North American Free-Trade Agreement, President Bush showed that freeing countries from trade barriers could do more than just create jobs and increase trade. Trade creates good neighbors and solidifies friendships.\n\n\n                              trade policy\n\n\tDespite the efforts of Presidents Bush and Reagan, the Uruguay round talks were a marathon. Internal politics in Japan and France prevented a resolution of agricultural issues, and delayed completion of the round for almost 2 years. Despite claims that foreign rice was unfit for consumption, the Japanese Government agreed to end its ban on imports of rice. By the year 2000, rice imports in Japan will be 8 percent of the market. French farmers also held up agricultural negotiations--and traffic in Paris--until a worldwide deal on oilseeds and other issues were reached.\n\tWe have delays here in the United States, too. After years of negotiations we made important new agreements with over 100 other nations. But the Clinton administration put passage of this legislation, and our participation in the WTO, at risk by delaying this bill in order to push new international environment and labor standards. Congress flatly refused to allow this by refusing to include new fast track negotiating authority for the President in this fast track bill. New negotiating authority should be fully considered on its own, in amendable legislation.\n\tThat brings us to the present. I have been in a dilemma over GATT because there are serious questions and serious consequences for voting either yes or no. I want to discuss a few of the serious issues.\n\n\n                                  wto\n\n\tMuch of the concern over the agreement has focused on whether the WTO is a threat to the sovereignty of the United States. I have thoroughly reviewed this issue. I have concluded that the implementing legislation contains adequate safeguards against ceding our authority to a multinational body.\n\tUnder our constitutional system, no treaty or international agreement can bind the United States if we do not wish to be bound. At any time, Congress can override such an agreement by statute. Similarly, the WTO Agreement states that any amendment changing the rights or obligations of a member country is not binding unless it is agreed to by the member.\n\n\tChanges in existing trade agreements--which will include the Uruguay round agreements if they go into effect--require a two thirds vote of the WTO. If a member refuses to accept a change, it can be asked to withdraw from the WTO by a three-quarters vote. But such a sanction could not reasonably be imposed on the United States--member countries would not eject their largest customer for their imports from the low-tariff trading community. but if it were imposed, ejection would simply put us where opponents want us--out of the WTO. So this argument is without foundation; in sum, it is ``we shouldn't join the WTO because we could get thrown out.''\n\tNo less a constitutional scholar than Judge Robert Bork has concluded that the sovereignty issue is a ``scarecrow'' raised by opponents of lowering trade barriers. Bork found that many of the safeguards in the WTO agreement are either the same or stronger than those already existing in the GATT, under which we have operated successfully for decades. Under the new agreement, changes to the WTO dispute settlement rules--the rules for challenges by one member to another's laws or practices--now require a unanimous vote of all members; under the GATT, they could be changed by a two-third vote.\n\tThe GATT has existed for almost 50 years as a multilateral trade agreement, and an ad hoc body to administer the agreements. But in order to make sure that the best interests of the United States are protected, Senator Dole and the Clinton administration reached an agreement last week to pass legislation next year that will establish a ``WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission'' of five Federal appellate judges.\n\tUnder the Dole agreement, if there are three commission determinations in 5 years that a WTO panel unfairly hurt the United States interests, any Senator or Congressman could introduce a privileged, expedited joint resolution disapproving of United States participation in the Uruguay round agreements. If the resolution is enacted by the Congress and signed by the President, the United States will commence withdrawal from the WTO.\n\tSenator Dole's agreement establishes a procedure for expedited consideration of withdrawal from the WTO if the WTO does not effectively serve the United States best interests. Because of the improvement made in the agreement, I believe that joining the WTO will not harm the sovereignty of the United States.\n\n\n                               financing\n\n\tI remain, however, severely disappointed with the administration's financing plan.\n\tWhile some of the revenue increases in the bill are good--I certainly support denying the earned income tax credit to prisoners and illegal aliens--others are irresponsible. For years, savings bonds have been the soundest, most accessible investment for many Americans. Why are we eroding the public's trust in savings bonds and the Government by repealing the mandatory 4 percent floor on savings bond interests?\n\tCuts in tariffs are tax cuts--they reduce tariffs on imports. Tariffs are unkowingly paid to the Government by consumers as part of the sales price at the check-out counter. Cutting tariffs reduces prices--not only on imports, but through competition on U.S. products, too. Lower prices mean consumers have more money to spend that goes to producers, instead of to the Government, which means more sales, more sales revenue, and more jobs. It also means that economic activity increases--which creates higher, not lower, total Government revenue.\n\n\tDespite this, the administration insisted that the tariff cuts be offset for the first 5 years--they don't believe tax cuts change consumer behavior. OMB went so far as to say that ``we do not believe it is necessary to sacrifice budget discipline'' to pass GATT. But they fell $2.5 billion short in their offsets, and came up with a budget gimmick--counting past tax increases that were already used for deficit reduction--for a second time.\n\tAfter insisting on a static model estimate for the first 5 years, the administration argued that Senators should vote to waive the Budget Act because cutting tariffs will raise revenue over years 6 through 10. So offsetting the first 5 years became unnecessary in the Senate--we need a Budget Act waiver anyway.\n\tThe administration could have: Used spending cuts as offsets; recognized that the static model does not compensate for consumer behavior; or fully offset the entire agreement instead of using budget gimmicks.\n\tInstead, they ask us to believe one prediction method for the first 5 years, and a second for the second 5 years.\n\tAll I can say in response to such inconsistency is that when consumers have money in their pockets instead of the Government's, they either save or spend it--and both help the economy and raise revenue more than higher taxes do. When Republicans are in the majority, I hope the administration will recognize that we expect honest accounting. We may not agree on methods, but there should be no more shell games of switching estimating models after 5 years or recounting past tax increases as an offset.\n\n\n                              consequences\n\n\tSo that brings me to the consequences of passing or not passing this bill. Some have tried to pin jobs lost in America to trade agreements. That is wishful thinking on the part of Members of Congress looking for the trees and missing the forest.\n\tJobs have left America because Government regulation, litigation, and taxation makes it too expensive to do business in America. If our businesses can not compete, it is not because our workers are paid more. All the statistics show our workers make up for their better wages by being more productive and efficient than workers in foreign countries.\n\tWhen our businesses can not compete, its because over-regulation and litigation drive up their production costs, and taxes drain their capital. GATT is a first step towards leveling the playing field because it reduces other countries trade barriers. We must take that first step now, and next year we must take another step towards leveling the playing field by passing regulatory and litigation reform here at home.\n\tOver time, reducing trade barriers has benefited America. In the early 1950's, most countries tariffs on imports averaged 40 percent. Once the new agreements are fully implemented, tariffs will average less than 4 percent. Our gross national product in 1947--expressed in today's prices, for better comparison--was $231 billion. Today, our national economy is almost $7 trillion a year. This is more than a 30-fold increase since we first joined the GATT.\n\n\tObviously, GATT has been good for America, and for the world economy. Reducing tariffs from 40 to 4 percent has created jobs here, and jobs abroad. I am sure it has created more jobs in developing countries than any foreign aid money ever has.\n\tGATT will also be good for my home state of Texas. The GATT agreement opens new foreign markets by lowering other countries' tariffs on chemicals, computers, semiconductors, construction equipment, and steel that is produced in Texas, and in many other States. Agriculture will benefit from increased access to world markets--feed grain, cotton, beef, and poultry exports are expected to increase.\n\tMost important, GATT will benefit consumers; the Treasury estimates that lower prices from GATT will result in savings of $1,700 for every American family of four. That is a tax cut which provides needed help for every person--it will mean more food, clothing, books, and education savings for children all over America. People will choose where their money is spent, instead of being forced to fund bureaucratic spending programs from Washington.\n\tOur experience with NAFTA is a resounding success. We're enjoying a ``Surge in Trade,'' according to one recent newspaper article. Exports to Mexico are up 22 percent in 1994. These exports support thousands of jobs in the United States.\n\tFor example:\n\tBecause of cuts in tariffs under NAFTA, the Miles, Inc. chemical company has closed its plants in Mexico. Because the plants in Mexico are no longer protected with high tariffs, they cannot compete with the productivity, efficiency, and skills of American workers. Miles now exports to Mexico from its plant in Baytown, TX.\n\tIn El Paso, a new plant that manufacturers Wrangler jeans has created 450 new jobs this year to meet demand from NAFTA-related trade.\n\tEven though newsprint tariffs do not go down until 1997, the improved business climate with Mexico has more than doubled newsprint exports to Mexico in the last year.\n\tWe can continue to increase our exports under GATT, and increase employment throughout America.\n\tSo to conclude, while I am troubled by part of this agreement, my choices do not include amending it. My choice is to vote yes--or no. Because of its benefits for American workers and American consumers, I will vote ``yes'' for the implementing bill, and for the motion to waive the Budget Act.\n\tWinston Churchill said that the price of greatness is responsibility. It is our responsibility to act now for the benefit of American workers and for our country's future.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be charged against the three parties in charge of time.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, yesterday I used the example of agriculture as an industry, and I use the term ``industry'' in the best sense of the word, that is able to compete worldwide when given a level playing field.\n\tIn response, my good friend from South Carolina, the junior Senator, Senator Hollings, said, well, what would you expect from an industry that is the most subsidized industry in the world and no wonder they can compete?\n\tI would like to respond to that as follows: As far as my State of Oregon is concerned, wheat is our largest agricultural export. At the moment, we export about 85 percent of all the wheat we grow. At the moment, the export price in Portland is $4.50 to $4.60 a bushel. Which is above the target subsidy price set in the 1990 farm bill. Therefore, these wheat farmers are getting no GATT-illegal subsidy. They are competing on the worldwide market without a penny of any GATT-illegal subsidy.\n\tIn order of export, our next biggest crops are vegetables, principally processed vegetables, fruits, peaches, cherries, all kinds of fruits, and then grass and vegetable seeds. Oregon has become one of the largest seed-growing areas in the entire world, both grass seeds or vegetable seeds. Neither vegetables, fruits nor seeds are subsidized at all.\n\tSo we are competing throughout the world without subsidies and beating the world.\n\tYesterday I called John Deere to recheck my facts, and I said, what does a large combine cost? They said, $145,000 to $150,000. What does the large tractor cost? And this one surprised me--$120,000 to $130,000.\n\tI guess I am old enough. I was thinking of the old-style tractors. These are immense new tractors that are pulling these combines.\n\tYou say to yourself, how can a farmer pay $150,000 for a combine and $140,000 for a tractor--and that is not all the equipment they need--and compete with the farmer someplace else that is using an ox and a wooden plow?\n\tYou know the argument that is raised--30 cents an hour, 30 cents an hour, clean conditions, child labor. How does a husband, wife and maybe a couple kids and maybe or maybe not a hired hand beat the world? And the answer is productivity.\n\tAt the turn of the century a farmer could feed seven people in the United States. Now, a farmer can feed about 80 people, and I will wager that by the end of this century a farmer will be able to feed about 100 people in this country.\n\tAgriculture is the most stunning example, more than manufacturing, more than services, of our success in productivity. But we can do it in manufacturing and we are starting to. We can do it in services, and we are doing it. We have an immense surplus in our balance of trade in services.\n\tI just wanted to set the record straight that at least as far as Oregon is concerned the products we are competing with throughout the world are mostly agricultural products that are not GATT illegally subsidized, that are very, very capital intensive and that we are winning that war and we can continue to do it and GATT will make it even easier to do it.\n\tI thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally against the parties.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wofford). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\tMr. DORGAN. I appreciate the chairman yielding and hope that I might have 5 additional minutes if I need it at the end.\n\tMr. President, I take no great pleasure in being on this floor on the opposing side of this GATT issue. I think it was Mark Twain who was once asked to debate and he said, ``Fine, give me the opposing side. That will take no preparation.''\n\tI would prefer to be here on another side of this issue. But the fact is, we are presented with these trade agreements under a fast-track procedure and we are told that you cannot amend them. It is this way or no way. So we only have one option here. We either accept or reject these agreements.\n\tI also take no pleasure in this because this President, President Clinton, and this Trade Representative, Ambassador Kantor, have exhibited real guts as compared to many others in the past 20 years. They have stood tall on bilateral negotiations with Japan and Canada and others, and they have done things other administrations would not even think of trying to do. So I support them very much in their initiatives on trade.\n\tBut our trade strategy, in my judgment, that brings this GATT agreement to the floor is a bipartisan failure and has been for a long while. It moves us in precisely the wrong direction.\n\tThis year our Nation's trade deficit will be the largest in American history. If you are not persuaded that the current trade strategy, which helped produce the largest deficit in history this year, is the wrong direction, what on Earth will persuade you?\n\tWe have accumulated a trade deficit of $1.2 trillion since 1980. What on Earth does it take to be persuaded that this is the wrong direction?\n\tI just heard someone refer a moment ago to the United States of America as the dominant figure in world trade, leading the way. And I was thinking of reading to my son the other night about Gulliver's travels and this behemoth Gulliver laying there on the ground tied up by the Lilliputians. That is the way we are in trade.\n\tYes, we are large. We are the largest economy in the world. That is why we are the biggest market for cheap imports, displacing American jobs. There is no substitute for the American marketplace anywhere on this globe. And that is why in every corner of the Earth there are interests, and especially the international corporations' interests, who want to produce where it is cheap and then sell not in Libya, not in Nairobi, not in Kenya, but in the American marketplace.\n\tWhy? Because they can compete in the market with very cheap labor, displace American jobs, and injure this country's economy, and under the new GATT they can do so with no restrictions, no admission price at all.\n\tUnder the rules of the new GATT, companies are free to produce shirts somewhere overseas in some factory using 6-year-olds or 10-year-olds working 12 hours a day and making 12 cents an hour, and then ship them to Cleveland, ship them to Fargo, ship them to New York to be sold in a store under a designer label name and have the American consumer purchase the products of labor of 12-year-olds. The admission price to our marketplace should be higher than that.\n\tFree trade is just fine, as long as it is fair competition. And the plain fact is, this trade strategy is not fair, it is not fair to our country, it is not fair to our workers, and it is not fair to our businesses who produce here and try to compete here and around the rest of the world.\n\tThis is supposed to be a time of change and new policy, a period of fresh air in public policy in Washington. And, do you know what? We come back to this Senate floor after the recent elections and engage in the same old, worn out, failed trade policies that have put this country deep in debt. The same old policies. There is no change here.\n\tI read yesterday, and I think I will read again, some of the debate from our consideration of the Tokyo round trade agreements in 1979. That was the last time we debated a new GATT agreement here.\n\tHere is what the proponents of the 1979 agreements said. Now, just close your eyes and imagine. Is it 1979 or 1994?\n  ``These agreements offer new opportunities for all Americans. For American farmers, the agreement expands world markets for American farm products. For American workers, the agreement offers more jobs, higher incomes, and more effective responses to unfair foreign competition.'' That is the argument made here in 1979.\n\tWhat happened? GATT was passed. Those were the promises. Well, U.S. agriculture exports did go up 5 percent. In 14 years, agricultural imports into this country went up 32 percent. Is that not something?\n\tHow about the American workers? Since the Tokyo Round Agreement, the United States has seen a net loss of 3.3 million manufacturing jobs.\n\tHigher incomes? Oh, no. Most Americans out there in the American households understand that average household incomes has declined since 1979.\n\tSo how on Earth can the people who gave us the promises in the last round have any credibility at all?\n\tThe central point here is that U.S. living standards are being sacrificed to a bunch of failed policies and a slogan called ``free trade.''\n\tI know that when you stand on this floor and speak as I speak, you are immediately categorized as some protectionist. Protectionist. Lord, it is an awful word, I guess, that you would want to protect the economic interests of our country. I do not know when that became unfashionable, but I regret that it did. I should think it would be fashionable for people to stand here and protect the economic interests of America.\n\tProtect us against imports? No, not at all. I want our consumers to have the widest choice.\n\tProtect us against unfair competition that would move our jobs elsewhere? You better believe I want to protect us against that.\n\tProtect us against policies that will erode and have eroded the income of the American family? You bet I want to protect us against that. Just chalk it up and mark me down as a protectionist. If we are talking about protecting American income and protecting American jobs, you are darn right that is something I want to protect. If being called a protectionist is the price for doing that, then count me in.\n\n\tBut, do not ever confuse protecting the economic interests of our country with efforts to put a wall around America. A wall is not our intent. It will always be my intent to fight for a world in which we have broader, expanded trade but trade which is fair and trade in which there is an admission price to enter a developed marketplace. We fought for 50 years for safe working conditions and fair living wages and protection of air and water against dumping pollutants and chemicals and toxic waste into water and air, and the admission price into our marketplace must reflect our determination to maintain those accomplishments for the American people.\n\tThat is exactly what this debate is about.\n\tInteresting. I had a debate yesterday with some people from the U.S. Trade Representative's office. They were alleging that these new agreements are going to help us with Japan. Total bunk. Nonsense. This will do nothing with respect to Japan. We have a $60 billion trade deficit with Japan. It is a shame, a shame that we have that circumstance in our bilateral relationship between us and Japan.\n\tYes, Japan is a good friend but they have taken advantage of us for decades. We ought not have a $60 billion trade deficit with Japan, and this GATT agreement will do nothing to resolve it. The only thing that will resolve it is bilateral negotiations that are tough, assertive, strong, with some nerve, and will on our part say to them, ``You cannot do that. If you expect to ship your goods to the United States of America, then you better expect to have your markets open for our goods to be shipped there. We are going to hold up a mirror and look in the mirror because what you see is what you get. You treat us fairly, we treat you fairly.''\n\tThat is the way reciprocal trade ought to work.\n\tChina? China is not even a part of the new trade agreements; another outrage. Their trade deficit with us has gone from $9 billion, to $12 billion, to $18 billion--this year to $28 billion. Our trade strategy with China is not working. The deficit is draining American jobs. That should not be hard to understand.\n\tI just heard a Member of the Senate talk about jobs leaving America, saying that the exodus is not because of cheap labor elsewhere, but because of Government regulation. I do not know how you could come to such a conclusion. You have a choice in this country if you are a producer. You can produce with the same money: Hiring one American, or, instead, 20 Filipinos; or 40 from India; or, 80 Chinese.\n\tUnder those conditions, producers go outside this country and use cheap labor to produce their products; ship American jobs there, and then ship their goods back here. That means we lose. It is a process of accessing cheap labor to injure our marketplace.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\tMr. DORGAN. I ask the Senator for 5 additional minutes?\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Two?\n\tMr. DORGAN. Two is fine. I had wanted to speak about child labor and about agriculture.\n\tRegarding agriculture, the Senator from Oregon made the point about farmers. I support it fully. While we disagree on the end strategy here, I support his point about agriculture. But the fact is, you take a look at what happens in agriculture. We negotiate to reduce export subsidies and, guess what? We lose every single trade negotiation. The European Community will end up with three times as much allowable export subsidies on wheat, for example, as our country will be allowed to use. That is fair? Of course it is not fair.\n\tThink of this as an Olympics. We have an Olympics and we put uniforms on Americans and we put ``USA'' on them. We all sit on the edge of our couch hoping that we win. This is an economic Olympics of sorts. The fact is the winners are going to be the recipients of new jobs, expanded opportunities, and economies that provide new growth.\n\tThe losers are misguided nations who believe what matters is not what you produce, but what your consume. It is called the British disease: a shrinking economy, shrinking base, shrinking job opportunities. The fact is, what matters is what you produce. That is the genesis of economic health, the genesis of jobs and income.\n\tThis is an international Olympics of sorts, and the fact is we have somehow been embarrassed to support our team. We have somehow not been concerned about our winning. The only important element at the end of this debate when all the dust settles on all the issues that are raised is this and only this: Have we done something that increases--no, not trade exports, not GDP--have we done something that increases the standard of living of people who live in America? If not, then we have lost. And, on that basis, this GATT trade agreement is a loser for this country.\n\tThere is a much better way, with open trade, expanded trade, and better opportunity for the entire world; a way that I support. That is free trade with fair competition between us and other countries of the world.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Minnesota.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\tMr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his fine statement, and I appreciate his comments, especially about the importance of incorporating basic internationally-recognized human rights standards into our trade policy.\n\tLet me start by quoting from the Calgary Herald of the other day.\n\n       This past Friday the preparatory committee for the new \n     World Trade Organization, WTO, rejected any formal \n     institutional arrangement subjecting the new body to any \n     human rights scrutiny whatsoever.\n\n\tThis was this last Friday. This was the last effort to have some kind of linkage to human rights in this trade arrangement, and it failed. I would like to just follow up on what the Senator from North Dakota said. He said he did not have a chance to go to child labor and human rights issues. I want to do so now. And if a picture is worth 1000 words, let me start out with a picture.\n\tThe first picture here is of three sisters, age 6 to 16, working in an incense factory in Nagpur, India. They roll 20,000 incense sticks per day for less than $1.65. Children working all day, for a total income of $1.65.\n\tNext picture. Young children who work in a carpet factory in Nepal, for long hours under strict production quotas that they must meet to avoid abuse by their employers.\n\tNext picture. Children who are forced to work because of debts owed by their parents, in India--in virtual indentured servitude.\n\tMr. President, while some on this floor have downplayed this issue, facts are stubborn things. There are an estimated 200 million children in the workplace worldwide, working under dangerous and unsafe conditions in violation of international human rights standards. In Bangladesh, children as young as 8 years old make up 25 percent of the work force in the garment industry.\n\tIn Brazil, 4-year-old children--4-year-old kids--work up to 10 hours a day harvesting cotton. Mr. President, here again we are talking about children who work for little pay and who are subject to abuse by employers when they do not meet their harvesting quotas.\n\tI start out this way because I really believe that the promotion of internationally-recognized human rights standards should be a part of what the United States of America should be about in our foreign and trade policies. There should be some kind of linkage in our trade agreements. I felt that way in relation to most-favored nation status for China. I felt that way in relation to our policy toward Indonesia. I felt that way in terms of the North American Free-Trade Agreement. And I most definitely feel that way when it comes to the new WTO.\n\tAnd I am concerned because I do not believe, despite the tireless efforts by international advocates for children, that enough is known about the horrible abuses in this area all around the world. I know that come this Christmas, when parents buy toys for their children, it may not occur to them that in many cases the toys they buy for their children were made by children in other countries even younger than their own kids, for $1.35 a day under the most harsh, exploitative, awful working conditions. I know that when people buy carpets for their living room they do not want to buy carpets that are produced by children working under these kind of conditions.\n\tAnd let's not try to fool anyone that this issue is going to be vigorously pursued within the World Trade Organization. As I said earlier, it was just last Friday that we had the final formal rejection by the WTO preparatory committee of any kind of human rights scrutiny by the United Nations, any kind of linkage to child labor or other social development issues under this agreement.\n\tI have been in the Senate now for 4 years and I have learned a lesson. This is a respectful disagreement with other colleagues. That is the way we have to be, in respectful disagreement.\n\tAnd one of the things I have learned is that if you do not have some kind of framework, some kind of intellectual and philosophical framework that you stay true to, you just sort of get buffeted about on the basis of who can yell the loudest, who can exert the most pressure and all the rest. Now some argue that in order for developing countries to become more democratic, and better able to extend basic civil and political rights to all of its citizens, you have to have the trade liberalization and the economic expansion first. And there is an element of truth to that argument. In some countries, it has worked out that way. But you are much more likely to get progress in human rights if pressure is maintained by major trading partners for such progress, and if everyone--all trading nations--have agreed beforehand on at least a few basic minimum standards.\n\tIf history has taught us anything, it is that the only way that happens is when the United States and other major countries take the lead and insist on some kind of linkage, and use our leadership as a democracy to encourage and pressure other countries to live up to these basic standards.\n\tI wanted so much for there to be some kind of basic human rights formulation built into this agreement, and have pressed for that. I have not been able to support either the GATT or NAFTA, as much as I am an internationalist by birth, partly for these reasons. I am the son of a Jewish immigrant from Russia. My mother's family was from the Ukraine. My father taught me that we ignore the world at our own peril. But I believe from head to toe that human rights and child labor conditions must be a part of such an agreement. Instead, this linkage was formally rejected.\n\tMr. President, as we move forward in this debate, let's not forget that there is a linkage between the working conditions of these children in these pictures and this agreement. These kids' lives do matter. Commercial logic is not the only logic; they do matter. There is a linkage between the conditions of their lives and what happens to our work force as well. As Senator Dorgan said, it is very difficult for workers to compete, for citizens in our country to compete, against children who are getting paid $1.35 for a whole day.\n\tWhen I take together the human rights questions, which are compelling questions to me, the child labor questions, which are compelling questions to me, and I realize that this agreement does not acknowledge these conditions and makes no effort to begin to address these conditions, it saddens me. Combined with concern that the WTO, which makes important trade decisions that crucially affect the quality of the lives of citizens in the United States of America, does not meet publicly and is not publicly or democratically accountable, it gets even worse. And then when you consider that some of the legislation my State and others have passed in consumer protection, in environmental protection, health and safety over the years might be put at risk by WTO decisions, this agreement does not make the grade. All of that legislation could be challenged as GATT-illegal and our country, therefore, made subject to economic retaliation.\n\tThough I am an internationalist, and would have loved to have had an opportunity through amendments to have improved this agreement, that is not possible under the fast-track procedures. I would have loved to have had the opportunity through amendments to have built in some linkage to human rights and child labor, to have built in some protection for democratic procedures and decisionmaking, to have made this trade agreement more accountable.\n\tBut I do not have that opportunity. This is on fast-track procedure, which I voted against, and, therefore, I cannot in good conscience--and I emphasize the word ``conscience''--I cannot in good conscience view this trade agreement as a step forward. I cannot view this trade agreement, though I want to, as one which will lead to the uplifting of the living standards of peoples in our nations. I believe it is a step backward.\n\tI know some of my colleagues disagree. But that is my rigorous analysis, that is my honest assessment, that is my view and, therefore, I will vote no.\n\tI yield the rest of my time.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\tMr. ROTH. Mr. President, when we consider that over 20 percent of America's economy is dependent upon trade--when we consider that over the past four decades, trade-related jobs in our country have grown three times faster than overall American job creation--when we consider that open markets and free trade mean new jobs for American workers--we realize how important this debate is.\n\tNot only are we considering an historic trade agreement--an agreement some 7 years in the making--but an agreement that can go a long way toward providing jobs and security for Americans.\n\tOf course, Mr. President, I wish I could say that this is a perfect agreement--that it would be immediately and universally advantageous to all Americans. But such is not the case. The fact is that long-term growth seldom comes without change and change is sometimes disruptive and even painful. There will be real challenges in the short term.\n\tSome will be less than others as this agreement is to be phased in over a number of years, but from the beginning we must be aware of those men and women and families whose lives and livelihoods will be affected by this agreement.\n\tWe must also be aware of concerns felt by others regarding the creation of the World Trade Organization. Personally, I am satisfied that--as Robert Bork and other distinguished scholars have said--the GATT and the WTO will not interfer with American sovereignty. America cannot be bound by an international agreement or treaty if it does not wish to be bound.\n\tAs Judge Bork has said, ``Congress may, at any time, override such an agreement or provisions * * * by statute.'' Despite this assurance, we must continue to be vigilant and certain that now and in the future America remains first among equals in its international relationships.\n\tThe key to that future will be borders that are open for imports and exports--trade that is free and fair. As the great historian Will Durant pointed out, tariffs that restrict trade in the name of protectionism are little more than civilized piracy--piracy that strangles commerce and internationalizes poverty.\n\tIf we are to realize the potential of our future, we must have international agreements that break down these barriers. I believe the agreements that emerged from the Uruguay round of trade talks is a step in the right direction.\n\tLet me tell you what this agreement can do for Delaware:\n\tIn my State, exports have grown 27 percent since 1987 to $3.5 billion in 1993. The Port of Wilmington and the longshoremen that work there, Delaware's farmers, our workers at chemical, pharmaceutical, and auto plants have all seen their exports grow. This agreement will further increase these exports and create even more jobs by reducing and eliminating tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade.\n\tIn Delaware, our farm sector is of vital importance, but our farmers are often on the short end of the stick when it comes to exporting to our trade partners like Canada. This agreement will move us toward correcting such inequity. Not only in Delaware, but across the Nation, our farmers, who exported over $40 billion last year, will finally see some relief from the subsidy and other unfair trade policies that have plagued world agricultural trade for far too long. We are the world's largest agricultural exporter and will be a major beneficiary of liberalized trade in this critical area.\n\tThis agreement will also strengthen intellectual property rights and improve trade rules that protect Delaware and American industries against unfair trade practices. The intellectual property rules alone will be critical to eliminating the piracy of U.S. intellectual property that are essential to our pharmaceutical, software, and chemical industries, to name a few. Each of these industries is important to Delaware, and piracy of intellectual property costs our economy billions of dollars each year.\n\tFor these, and other, reasons, Mr. President, I will support this agreement. I encourage my colleagues to do likewise. With them, I understand that this agreement will not be completely painless to all Americans. Change is often difficult.\n\tBut if America is to maintain its leadership in the global community--if we are to have the bright and prosperous future that is possible--I believe we need this agreement.\n\tWe need it because our Nation's economic health is dependent upon the global economy. We need it because it is in our fundamental interest to have an international trade regime that is built on three pillars: openness and cooperation; predictable rules of fair play; and mechanisms to make sure the rules are upheld. Creating these conditions has been the essential purpose of the GATT, particularly this Uruguay round. That is why I will vote for this agreement.\n\tMr. President, I would like to now explain more in depth my analysis of the Uruguay Round Agreement and my reasons to support it.\n\tMr. President, we are now considering whether to approve an historic trade agreement--the Uruguay round. It was negotiated under the aegis of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, otherwise known as the GATT, which has served as the foundation for global trade since 1947. The negotiations leading to this historic agreement were initiated by President Reagan, almost concluded by President Bush, and finalized by President Clinton. The agreement has been over 7 years in the making, and has had strong bipartisan support throughout.\n\tBefore us is the legislation that is needed to implement our obligations under the Uruguay round. It is a momentous decision in many respects. It will determine the future course of our trade relations with other nations. It will have a substantial impact on jobs and economic growth here at home. It will say a lot about our Nation's confidence in facing the economic challenges and opportunities ahead. There should be no illusions about if--this decision is a defining moment for America and the rest of the world.\n\tThe Uruguay round was concluded last December, and, over the past several months, Congress has worked with the administration on the legislation that is needed to implement it. What has emerged is not a perfect trade agreement, and some serious questions have been raised about it, such as those regarding the new World Trade Organization [WTO] and its affect on U.S. sovereignty.\n\tLikewise, the implementing legislation is not perfect, and the implementation process has not gone as smoothly as it could, or should, have. The final legislation and the Statement of Administrative Action were introduced very late in the congressional session. Although, as a member of the Finance Committee, I had a chance to review most of the draft bill before it was introduced, many of my colleagues did not have such an opportunity, and they should have been given more time to review it. While the special session has afforded more time to examine the final details. A lame-duck session is certainly not the best congressional process for deciding the final fate of such an important issue facing the Nation.\n\tNevertheless, after careful examination of the trade agreement, the legislation to implement it, and the concerns that have been raised, I believe that, on balance, we must approve the Uruguay round. I am convinced that to do otherwise would be a grave mistake and a detriment to the people of Delaware as well as to folks throughout the country.\n\tMy decision to support the Uruguay round is based on the recognition that our Nation's economic health is dependent upon the global economy and that it is in our fundamental interest to have an international trade regime that is built on three pillars: openness and cooperation; predictable rules of fair play; and mechanisms to make sure the rules are upheld. Creating these conditions has been the essential purpose of the GATT, particularly this Uruguay round. In a sense, creating these conditions has been our Nation's objective. For this reason, the United States has been the prime mover behind the GATT's creation and evolution. For decades, we have viewed the international trading system as an opportunity, not as a threat, and I believe that this is a view our Nation should maintain.\n\n\n        importance of global trade to delaware and u.s. economy\n\n\tI have often said that whether we like it or not we cannot shut orselves off from trading with the rest of the world; this is more true today than ever before. We are the world's largest trader. Last year we exported $465 billion in manufactured goods and agricultural products, $650 billion in you add services. Over 25 percent of our economy is trade-related and millions of our jobs depend on trade. In my State of Delaware, exports have grown 27 percent since 1987 to $3.5 billion in 1993. The Port of Wilmington and the longshoremen that work there, Delaware's workers at chemical, pharmaceutical, and auto plants, as well as poultry growers, just to name a few, have seen their exports grow. Over the last 5 years, in fact, 50 percent of U.S. economic growth has been due to exports.\n\n\n                some key benefits from the uruguay round\n\n\tThe GATT has been a critical reason for the enormous expansion of world trade since the post-World War II era and the economic growth that has accompanied it. Through seven so-called rounds of negotiation, we have eliminated tariff and other barriers to trade in goods and have negotiated predictable rules to help facilitate this trade. And that is what is at the heart of the Uruguay round, the eighth round of trade talks held under the GATT. It is an integral part of our Nation's longstanding trade policy to open markets to our exports, and to establish a transparent, rules-oriented trading system which eliminates the law of the jungle.\n\tThe Uruguay round, in fact, goes much further than previous GATT negotiations in opening trade. it will cut tariffs worldwide by one-third, by almost $750 billion. Tariffs really are no more than a tax that is imposed at the border. A global tax cut of $750 billion will lower consumer and producer costs and will be a huge stimulus to economic growth here at home and abroad. All studies of the agreement have shown major economic benefits. According to some estimates, the agreement could add as much as $100-$200 billion annually to our economy once fully implemented, and create as many as 1.4 million new jobs.\n\tAside from this huge tariff cut, the Uruguay round improves existing GATT rules and principles, creates important new ones, and tackles nontariff trade barriers that the United States has been battling for decades. For the first time ever, we will have international trade rules to protect intellectual property rights, to reduce distortive agricultural subsidies, and to govern trade in services. Our workers, farmers, industries, and firms excel in each of these areas and we will reap enormous benefit from these new agreements. In one fell swoop, over 120 countries are expected to agree to these rules, something which would take much longer to achieve if we were to negotiate one-on-one with each of these countries.\n\n\tThe new rules on intellectual property rights, for example, will finally raise standards worldwide to protect U.S. copyrights, patents, trademarks, and other critically important intellectual property. We have, for years, been trying to eliminate the piracy of our intellectual property, which costs the U.S. economy billions of dollars each year. Our computer software and pharmaceutical producers, among other industries, spend millions creating their innovative products and rely on strong intellectual property protection for their competitive survival. Anyone spending millions on R&D to create a new product obviously cannot compete for long against another company that has simply copied the product at little cost by stealing patents and ignoring copyrights. Few dare to do that in the United States because of our strong laws protecting intellectual property, but the same is not true in many markets overseas, particularly in developing countries. The Uruguay round will help reverse this situation.\n\tIn agriculture, our farmers, who exported over $40 billion last year, will finally see some relief from the subsidy and other unfair trade policies that have plagued world agricultural trade for far too long. The Uruguay round agreement on agriculture will move us down a path of fairer and freer trade. Although it does not go nearly as far as I would have liked, we are the world's largest agricultural exporter and will be a major beneficiary of liberalized trade in this critical area. The Department of Agriculture estimates that the Uruguay round could expand farm exports by as much as $8.7 billion, create as many as 190,000 farm-related jobs, and add as much as $2.5 billion in net farm sector income.\n\tThere is one area of the agricultural trade that must be further addressed by the administration as soon as the agreement goes into effect. This, of course, is making sure that Canada upholds its free trade commitments to us by eliminating all tariffs to trade, including poultry products. Now that the Uruguay round commits Canada to converting its very restrictive quota regime for poultry into tariffs, it must now agree to eventually eliminate them altogether. We have had a free-trade agreement with Canada since 1989, but in my opinion that free-trade agreement is not completely free until Canada eliminates the restrictions it places on United States poultry products. The time has come for our administration to start paying more attention to resolving this problem.\n\n\n                       concerns over sovereignty\n\n\tI would like to turn to two of the issues that have captured the most attention in the debate on the Uruguay round: The impact of the WTO and the strengthened dispute settlement rules on U.S. sovereignty. I have examined these important issues very closely and they have been an active part of the Finance Committee's implementation process. Based on my review, and the safeguards that Congress has required in the implementing bill, I have concluded that U.S. sovereignty remains intact under the WTO, the GATT's successor regime.\n\tThat is not to say that a major international cooperative agreement, such as the Uruguay round, does not entail obligations on our part. It certainly does, but it is an exercise in sovereignty in agreeing to adhere to them voluntarily because, on balance, we believe they are in our best national interest.\n\tThere are important safeguards in the actual implementing legislation that address the concerns that have been raised and clear up some of the misunderstandings about the agreement's effect on U.S. sovereignty. For example, the bill clearly states, in section 102, that if there is any conflict between United States law and a Uruguay round agreement, only United States law applies. The only changes to U.S. law as a result of the Uruguay round are those that are contained in the implementing bill we are now considering. After that, any future decision on whether and how to change United States law in relation to any possible inconsistency with our Uruguay round commitments can only be made by Congress. The WTO cannot change U.S. law; only the Congress can do that. What we are considering here is not a self-executing agreement which has the direct force-of-law.\n\tThe implementing bill also addresses the State-related concerns that were expressed earlier by establishing elaborate Federal-State consultation procedures regarding possible obligations and dispute settlement proceedings affecting State laws. Both the Governors and Attorneys General Associations, as well as other State organizations, have endorsed this approach as meeting their concerns. The Governors Association unanimously endorsed passing the GATT agreement this year.\n\tIn looking at the WTO and the new dispute settlement rules, it is very important to keep in mind that they essentially build on the existing GATT, which has been in place since 1947. Article 9 of the WTO explicitly provides that the decisionmaking process will continue the GATT practice of operating on the basis of consensus. The last time there was a vote on a policy issue was in 1959. As under the GATT, voting procedures can be used in the absence of consensus, based on a one-country, one-vote process, but they are now more protective of our interests than they were under the GATT. Most importantly, we do not have to accept any future amendment affecting our fundamental rights and obligations if we choose not to.\n\tThere are other important safeguards in the bill. One is that both Congress and the private sector will have a much greater role in providing input and oversight on the general operation of the agreement and on any future dispute settlement panel. There is also a built-in, expedited procedure for a congressional vote on whether to continue U.S. participation in the WTO 5 years after it goes into effect, and every 5 years after that. Our future majority leader, Senator Dole, has also devised an earlier review process of the new dispute settlement rules, which could lead to our withdrawal from the WTO sooner than 5 years. We can, of course, withdraw voluntarily at anytime after 6 months written notice.\n\tI believe these and other provisions will ensure that the new WTO's operations do not impinge on our sovereign powers. While no one can predict precisely how the new WTO will work in practice, if the new system does indeed harm our sovereign interests, I do predict that we will not remain as members for very long.\n\n\n                            budgetary impact\n\n\tBefore concluding my statement, I would like to make just a couple of points on the budgetary impact of the agreement. The first point is that Congress gave little or no thought to major trade-liberalizing agreements when the latest budget rules were enacted, because if it had, I am convinced that these agreements would have been the exception to the rule. It is an historical fact that lowering tariffs and eliminating trade barriers have major positive, dynamic economic effects which ultimately lead to increased revenue. Lowering tariffs are not a cost to the taxpayer, they are a decrease in producer and consumer costs. This agreement goes much further than any previous GATT agreement in cutting global tariffs by almost $750 billion. It will put more money in consumer pockets and will be a boon to the United States and world economy.\n\tThat is what the economic studies of the agreement show. The Republican staff of the Joint Economic Committee recently surveyed eight of these studies and found that the GATT's total fiscal impact could lead to new revenue as high as $115 billion over 5 years.\n\tRegardless of these economic and revenue benefits, the Uruguay round's tariff cuts do fall within current budget rules requiring that any lost revenue be offset, and the implementing bill includes funding provisions to offset the $12 billion in lost tariff revenue that is expected during the first 5 years of the agreement. Some of these proposals have been controversial, including the ``pioneer preference'' provision. But the recent agreement between Senator Dole and the administration on this provision should eliminate the concerns that have been expressed about it. Unfortunately, however, the bill cannot be changed at this point and, while I do not support these extraneous and controversial funding provisions, the agreement should not be defeated because of them.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n\tMr. President, the time to move forward is now. It took 7 long years of negotiation to conclude the Uruguay round. The agreement itself was finalized almost 1 year ago. There has been ample time to examine its contents. The Finance Committee alone has held 25 hearings on one or more aspects of the agreement.\n\tIt is essential that we approve this precedent-setting trade agreement. Current GATT rules are antiquated and have not kept pace with the rapid changes in the global trading system. The GATT also does not cover many areas of critically important trade to the United States, such as services and intellectual property rights. And the current GATT leaves in place major tariff and nontariff barriers that slow down or prevent the expansion of U.S. exports. We export well over $600 billion of goods and services and we need the Uruguay round's trade rule improvements and greater worldwide market openings to further our export and economic growth. A stable, predictable and open global trade regime is in our Nation's best interests.\n\tFailure to approve the Uruguay round through procedural points-of-order maneuvers or by voting against the implementing bill itself would be a blunder of historical magnitude and would set our Nation's trade agenda in a harmful, backward direction. I cannot believe that this body would choose that direction. I hope that it moves along the same path it did when it considered the last major GATT negotiation--the Tokyo round. It passed the Senate overwhelmingly by 90 to 4. I hope this latest agreement garners the same level of support, and I urge my colleagues to strongly support it.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I yield 15 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Ohio.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\tMr. METZENBAUM. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the passage of the GATT because I think it is a bad deal for America. I think it is a bad deal for American workers. I think it is a particularly bad deal for the children of America. Unquestionably, one of the most prodigious and well-respected magazines in all the world is the Economist. The Economist in its April 9, 1994, issue had a picture of a child carrying heavy cement blocks in India. The editorial is ``Free trade or foul.''\n\tI believe the significance of that magazine, so totally well respected throughout the world, addressing itself to the subject to which I addressed myself yesterday is important for people of this country to know about.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the entire editorial be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From the Economist, Apr. 9, 1994]\n\n                          Free Trade or Foul?\n\n       It was supposed to be a sunny coda to end years of \n     discordant haggling. Now it seems that next week's gathering \n     of world trade minister in Marrakesh, Morocco, may be a \n     darker affair. They are meeting to sign the agreement \n     hammered out during the seven-year Uruguay round of world \n     trade talks. But the prospects for world trade have become \n     clouded since the final negotiating session in Geneva in \n     December. This cloud, no bigger yet than a man's hand, is \n     growing fast.\n       In recent weeks America and France have been pressing for \n     an addition to the declaration from Marrakesh. Their demands \n     are unclear, but at a minimum they want a promise that the \n     new World Trade Organisation (the successor to the GATT) will \n     examine how labour standards and workers' rights ought to \n     affect trade rules. The proposal sounds innocuous, even \n     benign. Yet it has caused anger in the developing world. \n     India's prime minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao (whose efforts to \n     liberalise the Indian economy were difficult enough already, \n     said this week that such moves could become ``an alibi for \n     raising protectionist trade barriers''.\n       Peter Sutherland, the GATT's director-general, hopes that a \n     compromise (Japan proposed a vague reference to ``social \n     conditions'' in the Marrakesh communique) will allow the \n     celebrations to go ahead. But the subject will not go away. \n     The charge that developing countries are engaged in ``social \n     dumping''--competing unfairly by denying their workers basic \n     rights and decent conditions--is potent. It appeals equally \n     to rich-country self-interest and self-righteousness. The \n     competitive threat from third-world exports is likely to \n     increase over the next few years; as it does, social dumping \n     will challenge environmental protection as the issue most \n     likely to force radical change on the global trading system.\n\n\n                    crude disguises and flying pigs\n\n       Some complaints of social dumping hardly deserve to be \n     taken seriously. Those who regard it as ``unfair'' for \n     Chinese workers, say, to be paid less than American ones, and \n     who call for tariffs to redress the balance, are in truth \n     opposed to all trade between rich and poor countries. This is \n     extreme protectionism in the crudest possible disguise. When \n     its advocates claim as well to have the best interests of \n     developing-country workers in mind, they are surely \n     hypocrites too. Countries cannot pay their workers more \n     merely by deciding to do so. They must first produce more, \n     and the best way to spur growth is to trade.\n       What goes for wages applies as well to other labour costs. \n     To insist on a levelling of ``working conditions''--closer \n     equality in hours worked each week, standards of health and \n     safety in the workplace, entitlements to holidays, health \n     care, sick-pay, pensions and so forth--would be in every case \n     to insist on a standard of living that poor countries, being \n     poor, cannot afford. Legal rights over such terms of \n     employment may exist in most industrial countries, but rights \n     under the law (which are freely modified as circumstances \n     dictate) should not be confused with more basic human rights \n     (which are not).\n       Other concerns, however, cannot be so easily dismissed. \n     Slavery, which is wicked, is still practised in some \n     developing countries. Children should be educated, not sat at \n     looms or made to carry bricks all day. Workers should have \n     the rights of assembly and free speech--which, in some \n     developing countries, they are denied. In cases such as \n     these, basic freedoms are at stake. You do not need to be \n     rich to outlaw slavery or grant the rights of free speech and \n     assembly; education is costly, but curbing the cruellest \n     sorts of child labour is widely affordable. Therefore, is it \n     not right to put pressure on offending third-world \n     governments to change their ways? If there is a reasonable \n     chance that the pressure will work, and if it does not put \n     other interests at risk, the answer is Yes.\n       Granting that pressure may sometimes be justified, why not \n     let trade policy be the means? Free-traders, such as this \n     newspaper, would like to answer that pressure of this kind \n     never works. In fact, it often does. Against large countries \n     and small, America has often got its way by threatening trade \n     restrictions. The case against such a policy is not that it \n     cannot achieve its narrow objective, but that it puts other \n     interests--America's own, as well as those of the rest of the \n     world--in jeopardy.\n       The difficulty can be stated simply enough: governments \n     cannot be trusted with trade policy. If, as trade-policy \n     activists implicitly assume, governments were competent and \n     dedicated to the public good, there would be less to worry \n     about. The case for trade policy in pursuit of basic human \n     rights would be more persuasive (though low-flying pigs would \n     be a terrible nuisance). The institutions that liberal \n     democracies use to rule themselves are needed precisely \n     because governments in the real world are often incompetent \n     and always subject to demands from narrow, organised \n     interests. The GATT is one of these needed institutions--an \n     especially necessary one, because trade policy is an area in \n     which governments, left to themselves, are especially \n     unreliable. The GATT was created in the first place because \n     its founders understood that the pressure to protect \n     producers is intense; without an occasional exchange of \n     multilateral trade concessions, governments would find \n     liberal trade impossible to achieve.\n       They were right: only consider how close the Urguay round \n     was to collapsing last year, or the ferocity of opposition to \n     the North American Free-Trade Agreement, or the sharp rise \n     during the 1980s of new forms of non-tariff protection. \n     Liberal trade is under perpetual attack. To beat it back, \n     governments need to strengthen the GATT and at every \n     opportunity undermine its enemies.\n       If industrial countries insist on bringing labour-related \n     rights into the multilateral trade task, they will do the \n     opposite. The GATT will be weakened because its agreement-by-\n     consensus approach cannot accommodate such controversial \n     issues. At the same time the GATT's foes will be strengthened \n     by each new admissible ground for trade restrictions. For \n     instance, a trade rule on child labour might keep countries \n     in which that practice is common (whether or not legal) out \n     of the WTO; on the other hand, if a country joined the WTO \n     after signing up for the rule, but was then unable to enforce \n     it, it would be prey to every species of rich-country \n     projectionist, henceforth equipped with new grounds to seek \n     trade sanctions. In the battle between liberal trade on one \n     side and the protectionism that helps to keep poor countries \n     poor on the other, the balance would have shifted decisively \n     in the wrong direction.\n       Those who truly seek to advance the cause of human rights \n     in the third world should weigh this carefully--and \n     reluctantly conclude that the costs of pressing for new links \n     between trade and basic human rights outweigh the likely \n     benefits. They should call for diplomatic pressure instead; \n     and tell rich-country consumers about human-rights abuses, \n     then let them make up their own minds about whose goods to \n     buy. That is bound to strike many as inadequate. But in \n     reality most lobbyists seek to use human rights as just \n     another way to raise old-fashioned barriers against poor \n     countries' exports, caring little for human right, caring \n     nothing for the plight of the third world's poor, caring \n     nothing for the freedoms of industrial-country consumers. The \n     argument is ugly--but it will run and run.\n\n\tMr. METZENBAUM. Madam President, I had spoken yesterday at some length about the whole issue of child labor and products pouring into the United States. Today I will not repeat those arguments. But I will talk about my other concerns with GATT.\n\tI am frank to say that I wish I could support the agreement. I believe in and I want to support expanded trade. I believe that international trade agreements can be beneficial both to America and to the entire world. But I believe that free trade must occur between equals. I do not believe that you can mix countries and markets of unequal status and unequal standards and expect all to benefit. Just look at our own trade deficit. The whole idea is that NAFTA has been such a wonderful thing. That is just not true. We keep entering into trade agreement after trade agreement and our trade deficit continues to increase. Last year our trade deficit was $130 billion. We are making a lot of progress. This year it is expected to exceed $160 billion, and GATT will only increase that deficit.\n\tOur recent experience with the NAFTA agreement further confirms the problems of trade among unequals. Since the enactment of NAFTA, during the first 6 months of 1994, our trade surplus with Mexico has declined by 50 percent. Sixty percent of Mexico's new capital is coming from the United States to build factories in order to make products which will be sold back into the United States markets.\n\tIn addition, the jobs that NAFTA was going to create just have not materialized. The administration claimed that 100,000 jobs would be created by NAFTA. But so far only 500 have been created. Over 30,000 workers have already filed for trade adjustment assistance because they claim they lost their jobs by reason of NAFTA. Walk into any store in America, in any of the shopping centers or in the smaller communities of America, wherever, the larger communities. It is nearly impossible to find products made in America anymore. Shoes from Brazil, clothes from China, India, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Taiwan, tools from Mexico and Taiwan, TV's and computers from Japan and Korea. Instead of entering into endless free trade agreements that help our corporate community but decimate our labor force, we should be investing in our own industries to create American products and American jobs.\n\tThe GATT agreement will only accelerate the demise of American production. The average American has not the slightest idea what this agreement is about. Walk down the streets of any town, be it Dayton, OH, or Cody, WY, or Natchez, MS, or Eugene, OR. Ask the first person you meet. ``What is GATT about? Are you for GATT or against it? Explain to me in one sentence or two sentences or a paragraph.'' He or she does not have the slightest idea, but the professionals who are interested in our passing this bill have some idea what it is about.\n\tBut if the average citizen knew what was in this bill, they would be skeptical that American workers will benefit from some international trade agreement about which they know practically nothing. We have an obligation to explain this major international agreement to the American people. But we have no chance to do that. We must act within 2 days. Great. I am in favor of always moving forward as promptly as we can. But that means that the average American will not know what it is all about until he or she gets her termination notice. I am realistic enough to know that if this matter were debated for 2, 3, or 4 more days more, that would not change the facts.\n\tUnfortunately, however, this agreement is flawed in many ways.\n\tThe biggest problem is what is not in this agreement.\n\tThis agreement contains no protections for workers.\n\tWe should be considering international working conditions together with trade.\n\tIt is basic common sense that if trade is based primarily on price without any other standards, America will lose out.\n\tLabor, capital, and raw material costs determine the price of most goods and services. And if American labor receives on average $15 an hour, and Korean, Indian or South American labor receives only $1 an hour, it is obvious what is going to happen.\n\tThe only way for America to compete against dramatically different labor costs is to have significantly better quality. And some would argue that is the way we solve the problem. We produce better products. But many foreign products are not that inferior to American made products. Whether it is clothing, toys, games, radios, TV, tools, or a host of other products, it is difficult even without GATT to buy American made products. With GATT we will only exacerbate the problem.\n\tBlindly opening up American trade to the cheapest price without any labor protections will only force countries to lower their labor costs, not raise them.\n\tAmerican wages in real dollars, have declined almost 10 percent over the past 20 years when adjusted for inflation.\n\tIn large part what Americans were worried about during this past election cycle was the problems they face in their working lives.\n\tMost Americans do not see that their working lives are getting better.\n\tAmericans are working longer hours for less pay.\n\tThey are watching their standard of living erode.\n\tThere is a relationship between increased international trade and declining American wages.\n\tWe must look at these issues together.\n\tUnfortunately, too many who negotiate trade agreements know nothing about wage and working conditions.\n\tAnd I do not say that to slight any particular individual or group. Too many know about trade and trade only.\n\tThe only two places that working conditions are even mentioned in the GATT legislation are on pages 14 and 70. That is 2 pages out of more than 2,000 pages. And the words on these two pages do not help American workers.\n\tOn page 14 it states that--\n\n       Nothing in this act shall be construed to amend or modify \n     any law of the United States relating to worker safety unless \n     specifically provided in the act.\n\n\tAmerican workers need help. They need protection. GATT does not do a single thing for them in that statement. It actually only addresses itself to worker safety.\n\tThere are a whole range of labor laws that protect American workers in addition to worker safety.\n\tDoes this mean that our minimum wage and civil rights laws are not protected under GATT?\n\tOr our child labor laws?\n\tOur labor relations laws?\n\tOur antidiscrimination laws?\n\tThe sad fact is that this statement is stated the wrong way.\n\tIt should not just be that GATT does not undo other Federal laws.\n\tWe should affirmatively state that all of our labor laws are protected as part of GATT.\n\tPages 70 says the President shall seek the establishment of a working party to explore the relationship between internationally recognized worker rights and GATT.\n\tIt does not take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is meaningless mumbo jumbo. What is a working party? And what does it do after it explores this relationship?\n\tThe reality is the United States and France already tried to get a committee on workers' rights and were rebuffed by India and most of the South American countries.\n\tA lot of Third World countries do not want to raise the wages of their workers nor improve their working conditions. Their ruling elites want to keep the benefits of trade for themselves.\n\tBut as long as we do not bring the working standards in these countries up, they will continue to bring American workers' wages down.\n\tIf we could not get a committee on workers rights before GATT, imagine trying to get a committee after GATT becomes a reality.\n\tIt is disgraceful that a 2,000-page trade agreement contains barely 2 pages even mentioning worker rights.\n\tWe need an international trade agreement but one that improves the lives of working men and women, not one that undermines it.\n\tThere is too much that we do not know about how this agreement will be applied and much to be feared.\n\tAnd quite honestly, I cannot help but conclude that the GATT agreement will undermine our framework of environmental laws.\n\tLast fall, when the European automakers such as Mercedes, Ferrari, and Jaguar objected to U.S. CAFE standards, a GATT panel recommended that the United States bring CAFE regulations into conformity with the treaty's free trade obligations.\n\tThe CAFE standards law had been on the books since 1975.\n\tIt was passed in the grips of an oil shortage, when auto emissions were rapidly deteriorating our air quality.\n\tAnd in spite of that the panel concluded that this energy conservation law was a thinly disguised restriction on trade.\n\tQuite frankly, this is just a shot across the bow for our environmental laws.\n\tAnd I only wonder how other laws protecting the air, water, and environment will fare if the GATT treaty is approved.\n\tFinally, too many of the financing provisions for this agreement smell of corporate pork.\n\tThis bill contains sweet deals for the Washington Post, Cox Enterprises, Omnipoint Communications, GM, Ford, and Chrysler as well as public utilities.\n\tIn 1986, I stood on the Senate floor exposing and stopping dozens of tax breaks hidden in the Tax Reform Act for individual American corporations.\n\tNow the same type of shenanigans are going on again--only this time in an unamendable bill.\n\tWhy do good companies do this? They do not need these special breaks.\n\tThis agreement would raise even more revenues if it did not contain such special deals.\n\tIt undermines our credibility and that of these companies when they seek unnecessary special breaks.\n\tIt is especially shocking when the beneficiaries of these deals include some of the newspapers that generally editorialize against congressional pork and special perks.\n\tI was shocked to learn that the final GATT bill included the so-called pioneer preferences deal for the Washington Post, Cox Enterprises which owns the Atlanta Constitution, the Dayton Daily News, and Omnipoint Communications.\n\tThe administration cut a deal with these companies. They will receive communications licenses for a total of $400 million even though the fair market value of the licenses is estimated at $1.2 billion.\n\tUnder the Dole negotiations, it is my understanding that there is something about they might be able to reopen and rediscuss the subject at some later point. Do not hold your breath.\n\tThe FCC had been planning to auction the licenses on the open market this December where they were estimated to sell for a total of $1.2 billion.\n\tBut at the last minute, the administration and the companies cut a back room deal to sell the licenses for a total of $400 million. Who pays?\n\tThe American taxpayer gets ripped off for $800 million.\n\tThere are other secret deals in this bill as well.\n\tSenator Danforth extended an expiring provision to permit companies such as McDonnell Douglas in his State to transfer workers' pension moneys to pay for health benefits. The Danforth provision permits companies to drain their pension funds jeopardizing both the workers' pension and health benefits. What does this provision have to do with international trade? Nothing. And it does not belong in this bill.\n\tThe bill also contains a variety of pension law changes to speed up pension funding by underfunded pension plans.\n\tThese pension changes have no place in a trade bill. We should use pension reforms to provide better pension benefits to retirees, not to pay for a trade bill.\n\tFurthermore, some companies got special exemptions from the new pension funding rules.\n\tGM, Ford, and Chrysler negotiated special rules so that they do not have to fully fund their pension plans.\n\tAnd Senator Packwood put in a special deal for public utilities exempting them for 3 years from having to pay increased PBGC insurance premiums. He specifically provided that utilities need not pay increased pension premiums for 3 years unless the utility gets the money through a rate increase from taxpayers. Again, this provision has no place in GATT and was never included in previous pension bills.\n\tIt is outrageous to include these deals for big business in an unamendable trade agreement that will shortchange the American worker.\n\tThis is not what the fast-track process was meant to be about.\n\tThese are exactly the types of insider deals that give the administration and us our bad reputation. It amounts to buying votes with taxpayer dollars.\n\tIn closing, I regret that I cannot support this agreement.\n\tA vote ``no'' on the budget waiver is right--right for America, right for balancing the budget, right for our economy, and right for millions of children around the world.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Madam President, I want to respond to two things the Senator from Ohio said. I have talked with Senator Moynihan, and he has a response, and Senator Nickles will be speaking next for about 15 minutes.\n\tThe Senator from Ohio mentioned two issues. One was the so-called pioneer preference and the other was the regulated utilities and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation [PBGC]. I will explain what happened on both of those, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation first.\n\tAbout 20 years ago, we set up the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. We were worried about companies promising pensions to workers and going bankrupt or going out of business and leaving the pension plans underfunded. Workers of 20, 30 years of experience suddenly had no pension. The PBGC was to collect premiums from companies, put them into a fund, so that if some company went bankrupt and could not pay, the Government the--PBGC--would have a fund to pay from. This is similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for banks which has by and large worked well over the years.\n\tWe are aware that any number of companies have underfunded pension plans. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation advised us from time to time that not enough money is going into the fund to pay the promised benefits. So in this bill the administration suggested, and we agreed, to revamp that so that the companies with the highest level of underfunding will pay more to the PBGC fund. None are going to pay less. They would pay more into their funds to guaranty the solvency of their pension funds.\n\tAmong the companies that we directed to increase their payments were a number of regulated utilities--electric, water, transportation, and sewage companies. The one problem with many regulated utilities is that their prices are regulated by State law. So that if we increase a cost to the utility, they cannot immediately collect the money to pay it. They have to go to the local public utility commission and say: The Federal Government said we have to pay more money into the PBGC, and we petition you to raise the rates to get the money to pay.\n\tThat is why we gave a 3-year grace period to the regulated utilities. They are different from other companies because they cannot go out and automatically increase their rates to recoup the premium costs. There is a company in Oregon that is so affected, and this came from a list that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation gave us. There were five in Ohio on the list that were similarly affected. There are several scores of these companies around the country that also benefit from this provision. It is not a rifle shot for a company in Oregon.\n\tSecond, there is pioneer preference. This is an unusual situation. I can understand the frustration of the Senator from Ohio. But let me explain what happened.\n\tUp until a few years ago, the Federal Communications Commission used to issue licenses on comparative applications, and if they had a radio frequency to give out--and nowadays there are wireless communications--they would give a frequency that your company could have to use for wireless communication, and you had what you called comparative applications. A number of companies would apply for a frequency. And these applications were very expensive. You had to be a pretty well-financed company to even apply, by the time you got all of your technical experts and lawyers and say why you are better than some other company to get this. The Tom, Dick, and Harrys of this world simply could not afford to get into the competition.\n\tSo after a number of years at congressional direction, we said this is not fair. We are getting into the area of wireless communication, and only the giants should be able to afford to even compete. So we said, instead of doing that, we want you to give these licenses by lottery, so everybody could apply. It does not cost much to apply if you do not have to prove you are fit or unfit. Minimal qualifications. If you win the lottery, you get a license. One unusual thing happened that we did not foresee. Actually, there were two. A lot of very clever lawyers in this country, who were knowledgeable in the ways of the Federal Communication Commission, began to prepare scores of applications for the licenses. It did not cost a lot to file. They actually began to syndicate a piece of the application. Say you are a mechanic, a garage mechanic in Steubenville, you can put up $50 or $100 to get a piece of the application. If the lottery hit your number, there is a big payoff. But the little guy did not get it anyway. As soon as somebody won the lottery, one of the big giants went and bought it up from the person. So the mechanic who put up $50, $100, or $150, hit the jackpot. The big company bought it up. There was an after-market in these licenses.\n\tSo the Congress said this is ridiculous. If the big boys are getting it anyway, why do not we at least go back and have them auctioned off by the FCC and we will get the money?\n\tNow, while this process was going on, before it got to Congress saying we think we do not want these lotteried off anymore, we want them auctioned off, a number of large companies came to the FCC and said, ``We have some very innovative ideas that are going to cost us millions of dollars to develop. We are prepared to put up millions of dollars of research and innovation if our chances of getting a license are not based on lottery. Why should we put up $40 million to come up with something innovative and no hope at all other than winning the lottery of getting the license?''\n\tSo the FCC said, all right. We will make you a deal. We will have a pioneer preference and here are the standards. The FCC set up a bunch of standards, and there were competitive applicants for these pioneer preferences. A lot of companies put up a lot of money on research. And the FCC picked three and they said: We think what you have shown is justifiable, and research is good, and we think it is innovative and is going to advance the communications of this country, and we award these.\n\tThree licenses. Interestingly, some people did not like the process. Their application did get picked in pioneer preference. They are now complaining.\n\tAt this stage there was never any talk of paying for these licenses because if you won a license in the lottery, you did not pay for it either. You got it for nothing.\n\tSo when we said to pioneers, if you put up millions of dollars and if you will come up with something innovative, you get a license, we did not think of charging them. We were not charging anybody for any license, whether they won in the lottery or otherwise.\n\tBut then Congress said to the FCC, change your practice, do not lottery them off anymore; auction them off. At that stage the Federal Communications Commission had already said to these pioneers, if you put up a lot of money and do research and meet our standard as to what is innovative, we will give you a license even though Congress said auction.\n\tThen, the Federal Communications Commission felt somewhat honor bound to go ahead and award some of the pioneer licenses. The FCC awarded three even after Congress told them to auction the licenses off. And one of them happens to be a company that is 70 percent owned by the Washington Post and another is Cox Communications and another is Omnipoint.\n\tThe big flap came around the Washington Post. Why does the administration cut a deal with the Washington Post, and what is going on?\n\tThe administration did not cut the deal. Think of the sequential situation. We lottery off all these licenses and you pay nothing for them. We say to the pioneers, well, the chance of winning the lottery is not very great. If you put up a lot of money we will give you a license. We do not charge anybody for licenses anyway. So we will not charge you. Then Congress says charge and the Federal Communications Commission says it is not fair. These companies put up all this money, we will give them three free licenses. This occurred on about December 1993.\n\tA couple months later the Federal Communications Commission, after a lawsuit was filed, changed its position and said, no, we are not going to give or even let these pioneers have these licenses for nothing. We are going to charge them a certain amount.\n\tAt this stage one of the three companies sued and said, ``You violated the contract. You promised this. We relied on it. We put a lot of money in for research. Now you are changing the rules for us.''\n\tThe case is in the court of appeals. It has not yet been decided. For the moment the court has simply remanded it to the Federal Communications Commission and is holding it to see what Congress and the Federal Communications Commission are going to do because as of yet the Federal Communications Commission has not charged them. They said we are going to charge you, they have not done it yet. So from the standpoint of the court, the case is not what you call ripe. It is not quite ready for decision.\n\tBut if this company wins the case in court, then the Government gets nothing, and none of the three companies will have to pay us anything--if they win. This case has not been decided.\n\tThis is a common situation with lawyers in court. Do you go ahead, take your case to the jury and take your chances, win or lose, zero or a hundred, or do you settle and not take the chance of possibly losing everything?\n\tSo the administration worked out arrangements with these three companies and said, all right, let us reach a settlement. You pay us a minimum of $400 million plus interest, a minimum. It may be more than that because it is going to be based upon a percentage of the auction price of these new licenses. And the auction starts on December 5 and goes for about a month. It is going to be based upon a percentage of that auction price, but in any event they will pay $400 million plus interest. And if they accept that offer they have to drop the lawsuits.\n\tThey accepted the offer. So now the Government is guaranteed at a minimum of getting $400 million plus interest. We might get more if the auction price is a lot more, but no one knows what the auction price is going to be. That is the trouble with pioneer licenses.\n\tYou can argue whether we ever should have had the policy, or the Federal Communications Commission was right or wrong in what they did. You can argue whether standards were correct or not correct. But at the time they set it up, they set it up because people were not going to put up millions of dollars for research and innovation in communications if the chance of getting a license was based upon the lottery with 60,000 or 70,000 applicants in the lottery. That is it.\n\tWas this a sellout to the Washington Post? No, it was not a sellout. It was a settlement, a settlement in the hopes of getting some money, and a settlement of avoiding the risk of getting no money and having to justify these three licenses anyway.\n\tThe administration has now agreed, and Senator Dole got them to agree, that after the new Congress comes in they will reconsider this, and the Federal Communications Commission may have the power to undo this. I am not quite sure what happens to the lawsuits in that case, but we have to see when we get there. Apparently it is going to be reconsidered in the next Congress. There certainly was not any malice by the Federal Communications Commission or by Ambassador Kantor or President Clinton or the Washington Post or anyone else in how this arrangement was arrived at.\n\tI thank the Chair. I believe Senator Moynihan wanted to say something and we will then go to Senator Nickles.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I thank my friend and future chairman.\n\tMadam President, I yield myself such time as I may require, and it is not much.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. I regret the tone in which I will have to speak, but it is one of sincere regret.\n\tThere is not a more honorable Member of this body than the Senator from Missouri, Senator Danforth. The idea that there is any provision in this measure that is put there as some kind of backroom deal for Senator Danforth is completely unfounded. Senator Danforth has been interested for some time in the use of excess pension assets to fund retiree health benefits. It is a perfectly logical, reasonable case to make--that where moneys are not needed for this employee benefit, they may be used for this other employee benefit. He persuaded us completely, and it stands, in my view, and I am sure the Senator from Oregon shares it--it was the entirely proper proceeding as open as the morning sky.\n\tI am sure the Senator from Ohio did not mean anything personal in this regard. I see he is standing, and I yield to him.\n\tMr. METZENBAUM. Madam President, the Senator from Ohio pointed out the deals not as a reflection upon either Senator Packwood, Senator Danforth, or any individual Member. I think everybody's conduct is entirely above board and I have no fault with it at all.\n\tMy point of reference is that these measures do not belong in the GATT treaty, and it is in that respect that I criticized.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. That is a perfectly legitimate argument, Madam President, and yet the paygo provisions required us to pay. The provision in question raises substantial revenue.\n\tMay I also say with respect to the idea there was some backroom deal with respect to the Washington Post or such, in no sense can it be so described in my view.\n\tMy friend from Oregon, the future chairman--who has the distinct advantage of having attended the New York University law school, and therefore is a far more formidable man in this regard--spoke that the Government was faced with the prospect losing a court challenge and getting no money at all.\n\tI wonder if he would not agree from the point of view of a lawyer, because I have distinguished attorneys here, we have many of them with the Finance Committee--Mr. Joseph Gale, our chief tax counsel--I know what his view is, that it was not a risk. It was a probability about how a court would decide.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Whether it was a probability, a possibility or a risk, there is no question but what the court of appeals was sitting on this case and was going to wait to see what we did or what the Federal Communications Commission did. But had that case gone to conclusion I am not sure but what a court would not have said, ``If the FCC said you do ABC you get a license for nothing,'' and you did ABC-plus, you might have a pretty good case.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Now we have, if there is anything--I hesitate to say this at this point in the debate--if there is anything involved here, it might just possibly be an abuse of Government authority. It is certainly not a backroom deal.\n\tMadam President, I yield the floor.\n\tMr. METZENBAUM. Will the Senator from Oregon yield for a question?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Yes, I yield for a question.\n\tMr. METZENBAUM. Who won in the lower court?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. There was no lower court decision because you appealed directly from the Federal Communications Commission to the court of appeals, so there has been no decision yet. The court of appeals is just holding it pending further action by the Federal Communications Commission, because as yet the FCC has not charged them. So they do not really, exactly, have a pending case.\n\tMr. METZENBAUM. Would the Senator from Oregon, who I know is a fair man and scholar, agree that this matter, as well as some of the other matters that are in the bill, do not really belongs in a GATT treaty?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Let me answer this question this way. They are not exactly in the GATT treaty.\n\tIn other words, the pioneer preference was not negotiated in Geneva in the GATT treaty. The administration and Congress will come up with money to pay--and we have a number of provisions in here--by raising money. And I think anybody can probably say that most of the things that are in here to raise money really have no relation to trade.\n\tSo, are they related to trade? No. Are they in the treaty? No. Did we have to come up with some money under our scoring rulings to pay? Yes, we did. And this was one of the ways we come up with some money.\n\tMr. METZENBAUM. I thank the Senator.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Before turning to Senator Nickles, Senator Wallop has a statement. I think it is about 1 minute long.\n\tMr. WALLOP. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. As he will recall, last summer during the Finance Committee consideration of the administration proposals for changes to antidumping and countervailing duty law, we considered an amendment to deal with situations of ``no supply.'' This amendment would have created a procedure to allow for temporary and quantity-limited relief from orders where a particular product needed by U.S. industry is not available domestically.\n\tThe amendment did not pass. However, during the consideration of the amendment the Department of Commerce submitted to the Finance Committee an explanation of authority to consider the lack of domestic availability in deciding issues that would come before the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission in antidumping and countervailing duty cases.\n\tMadam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters be printed in the Record at the appropriate point.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 17, 1994.\n     Hon. Michael Kantor,\n     U.S. Trade Representative,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor: During the Finance Committee's \n     consideration of the GATT implementing legislation this \n     summer, I proposed an amendment to the antidumping and \n     countervailing duty laws to establish a procedure for ``no \n     supply,'' under which the Commerce Department could \n     selectively waive the application of dumping or \n     countervailing duties in cases where domestic producers were \n     unable to meet domestic demand for a particular product. A \n     considerable coalition of American manufacturing companies \n     strongly supported this amendment. The Administration, for \n     reasons that are still unclear to me, vigorously opposed the \n     amendment. As a result, it did not pass.\n       However, during consideration of the amendment, the \n     Department of Commerce submitted to the Finance Committee a \n     carefully worded explanation of its current authority to \n     consider the lack of domestic availability in deciding issues \n     that come before the Commerce Department and the \n     International Trade Commission in antidumping and \n     countervailing duty cases. A copy of this explanation is \n     attached.\n       I would very much appreciate your consulting with the \n     Secretary of Commerce, and others whom you consider \n     appropriate, to inform me if the Administration concurs that \n     the Commerce Department has the authority to consider lack of \n     domestic supply in proceedings under the antidumping and \n     countervailing duty laws, as outlined in the attached paper \n     from the Commerce Department. I would greatly appreciate a \n     response prior to the Senate's vote on the GATT, given the \n     relevance of this issue to my consideration of the GATT \n     implementing legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Malcolm Wallop,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    The U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Malcolm Wallop,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wallop: Thank you for your letter of November \n     17, 1994 concerning the ``no supply'' amendment that you \n     proposed during the Senate Finance Committee's consideration \n     of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. Your letter asks for \n     confirmation of the statement provided by the Department of \n     Commerce on the exclusion of products from an investigation \n     or order.\n       After consulting with the Department of Commerce, I can \n     confirm all of the information provided in the statement. In \n     particular, I can confirm that the lack of domestic supply \n     may motivate interested parties to request that Commerce \n     consider the scope of an investigation or order or conduct a \n     changed circumstances review. The Department has the \n     authority to define the scope of an investigation and to \n     clarify the scope of an order to exclude products where \n     coverage would not serve the purposes for which the petition \n     was brought. In a changed circumstances review, the \n     Department has the authority to revoke an order in part if \n     maintaining the order as issued is no longer of interest to \n     the domestic producers.\n       The lack of domestic supply is relevant to the \n     International Trade Commission's injury determinations in \n     initial investigations as well as sunset reviews. As noted in \n     the Department's earlier statement, the fact that a product \n     is not made in the United States is reflected in the \n     Commission's determination of whether the imports are a cause \n     of injury to the domestic industry.\n       The Clinton Administration recognizes the importance of the \n     upcoming vote on the Uruguay Round Agreements Act to you and \n     your constituents. We are fully prepared to answer any \n     further questions about the proposed implementing legislation \n     as quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Kantor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Exclusion of Products From an Investgation or Order\n\n       There are mechanisms under current law by which a product \n     can be excluded from an order without undermining the overall \n     effectiveness of the antidumping and countervailing duty \n     laws. Proposals have been made from time to time to depart \n     from this structure to create discretion to waive application \n     of antidumping and countervailing duties. It is the \n     Administration's view, given the existing provisions, that \n     such authority is inappropriate, would undermine the \n     effectiveness of the law, and would result in undue \n     discretion to favor different industries.\n\n\n                        Investigation Procedures\n\n       Throughout the investigation, the administering authority \n     has the ability to define and clarify the scope of the case \n     to exclude products where coverage would not serve the \n     purposes for which the petition was brought. In addition, in \n     making the injury determination, the ITC must define ``like \n     product'' based on consideration of whether the \n     characteristics and uses of the domestic production are \n     similar to those of the imported product. The fact that a \n     product is not made in the United States will be reflected in \n     the ITC's determination of whether the imports are a cause of \n     injury to the domestic industry. If petitioning companies are \n     not producing a competing product, there will be no lost \n     sales, or adverse price impact with respect to the particular \n     merchandise and this will be a factor taken into account in \n     making the overall injury determination.\n\n\n                         Post Order Procedures\n\n       After an order is in effect, the administering authority \n     can clarify the scope of an order. If a product has \n     substantially different characteristics or uses than the \n     merchandise covered by the order and it is unclear whether \n     the order included the specific product at issue, it can be \n     declared outside the scope of the order. Furthermore, the \n     Department will continue to have the authority, based on a \n     changed circumstances review, to revoke an order in part when \n     maintaining an order as issued is no longer of interest to \n     the domestic producers.\n       Finally, an order will not continue indefinitely if it is \n     not continuing to provide a needed remedy to the domestic \n     industry. Under the new sunset review procedures required by \n     the GATT, if injury is not likely to continue or recur, the \n     order will be revoked. The goal of defining the scope and \n     duration of orders through these procedures is to ensure that \n     the petitioning industries are provided an adequate remedy \n     while not unnecessarily inhibiting trade.\n\n\tMr. WALLOP. Based on this information, a number of Senators may have concluded that the current authority of the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission to address no supply situations was adequate and that further authority was unnecessary. Specifically, under that antidumping and countervailing duty law, the nonavailability of a product from a domestic source is a relevant factor that the Commerce Department may consider in defining the scope of an investigation, in clarifying the scope of an order, and in deciding whether to revoke an order, in whole or in part. The fact that the domestic industry is unable to supply a particular product is a good indication of lack of domestic interest in including that product in the scope of an investigation or order. In addition, nonavailability is a relevant factor in situations such as the International Trade Commission's like product, injury causation, and revocation determinations.\n\tSo my question, Senator Packwood, is, do you concur that the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission possess the authority to consider the nonavailability of merchandise and antidumping and countervailing duty investigations and orders?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I confirm, Senator Wallop, that the antidumping and countervailing duty statute authorizes the Department of Commerce to consider a number of factors in deciding the issues you have had described, and that among these is whether a product is available from a domestic producer. For example, the Department of Commerce or the International Trade Commission may consider unavailability of a product in clarifying the scope of an investigation or order in making like product and causation determinations and considering whether an order should be revoked in whole or in part. There is little sense including within an antidumping or countervailing duty remedy products that U.S. users cannot get from domestic producers. I expect that the Commerce Department will exercise this authority when appropriate.\n\tMr. WALLOP. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his response.\n\tI point out one last thing: That even the greatly protectionist European Union included the no supply provision in its application.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I now yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\tMr. NICKLES. Madam President, first I wish to congratulate Senator Packwood, the future chairman of the Finance Committee, and also Senator Moynihan, the chairman of the Finance Committee, for an outstanding job on this piece of legislation. And also my friend and colleague, Senator Wallop, who will be casting his last vote later tonight in the Senate. His service for the last 18 years to the Senate has been a real asset, not only to the State of Wyoming, but also to this country as well.\n\tMadam President, I rise today in support of GATT. But first let me say I do not rise in support of a lot of things that are happening in this process. I strenuously object to the fast-track process. I object to the fact that we are having implementing legislation that we are not able to amend. It is 600-some-odd pages and it touches several things. The Senator from Ohio raised some of those issues and I think Senator Packwood addressed them very well. But I would like to have the opportunity to amend them. We do not have that opportunity now but we will next year. I have some problems with some of the provisions in the implementing legislation.\n\tI might mention, too, Madam President, as far as the GATT, the trade agreement itself, that is not amendable. I know even one of our major newspapers in my State said, ``Let's put it off until next year. Congress can amend it next year.''\n\tWell, that is not possible. We signed an agreement with 123 nations, a trade agreement to reduce tariff and nontariff barriers. I think that is positive. It is probably not perfect. Anything that is thousands and thousands of pages long leaves a lot to be desired. The fact that it has a general reduction in tariff and nontariff barriers I think is very positive. But I do not like the process.\n\tAlso, I compliment the Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, who delayed this somewhat and caused some concern amongst the administration. I think he is to be complimented. Because of his action we did have more hearings. I think we needed those hearings.\n\tI am also critical of the administration, because this trade agreement was agreed to on December 15, 1993. It took the administration until the last week that we were in session to say we want to pass it this year. I think that is one of the reasons GATT has had some trouble. It is one of the reasons it had some trouble with this Senator. I do not like this process. I do not like being told that we cannot amend the implementing agreement, and I do not like being told we have to pass something very quickly. As a matter of fact, I probably would have voted against it if they had tried to pass it in the last 3 or 4 days of the session, just because I do not like being railroaded. I do not like being forced into action without having a chance to review it.\n\tWell, we have had a month or so and Senator Hollings has had significant hearings that, I think, exposed some of the strengths and some of the weaknesses of the underlying agreement.\n\tI also think it has taken too long to get here. The GATT process started in 1986. Basically, it started under the Reagan administration and continued during the Bush administration. I compliment the Bush administration because it made significant gains. They included agriculture. Many countries did not want agriculture to be included in GATT, and it had not been in the past. They had all kinds of restrictions. But they were successful in November 1992 in including agriculture in the GATT agreement. I think it is a very positive thing for agriculture, and any agriculture State needs to look very closely at this. It has a lot of positive things. So I compliment the Bush administration for its success in that.\n\n\tBut that was in November 1992. This administration took another year to finalize the agreement, all the way to December 15, 1993. Then it has taken us now almost a full year to get to where we are voting on it. I think that is too long, and I regret the fact that the Clinton administration waited until the last few days of the session.\n\tBut it does not change the fact we are voting on GATT. And we are also voting on the implementing legislation. We cannot separate the two. Some of us may not like some of these provisions, either, to finance this package, as was mentioned. Special provisions dealing with pioneer preferences; we can reopen that. Senator Dole has already made mention of that, and has an agreement with the administration to do so if it is determined that those prices were too low. I think that was a step in the right direction. I was concerned about that, so I agree.\n\tBut I look at the overall thrust of the agreement of GATT, a reduction in tariffs and nontariff trade barriers, and I support that. I support that wholeheartedly. I think that is a positive move for our country. I think it is a positive move for other countries.\n\tSome people say, well, other countries will benefit more than the United States. I disagree. Trade is a two-way street. We do not compel anybody to trade in this legislation. Trade is a voluntary effort. If somebody wants to sell a product, they can sell it. If somebody else wants to buy it, they will buy it. It will be mutually beneficial. It is not one winner and one loser, or somebody wins and somebody loses.\n\tThat is not the case in trade. Trade can be and should be mutually beneficial. If you get Government barriers and tariffs out of the way, then you are allowing free individuals to be making those decisions and I think that is positive.\n\tI also think it is real positive that agriculture now has access. I notice in my State--the cattle industry is probably our biggest agriculture commodity--the National Cattlemen's Association supports GATT, the Farm Bureau associations support GATT, the Wheat Growers and the Grain and Feed Associations support GATT, mainly because they see this as increasing markets. And that makes sense. We produce a lot more than we can consume in my State and in this country. We are a very productive country in agriculture, and we should be proud of that. We can compete with anybody in the world.\n\tSo this general agreement with 123 countries says we are going to tear down some of those barriers. The barriers are a lot higher in those countries than they are in our country, so they have a lot more to reduce. That is to our gain, and I think it is to the gain of the other countries as well. I think it is mutually beneficial. And that means that people in the cattle industry, the wheat industry, or people in the high-technology industries in my State, California, or Oregon, are going to be able to sell more. And that creates jobs, and those are good jobs. Exports do create thousands of jobs. GATT is estimated by some to create 700,000 jobs; some estimate 1.4 million jobs. I do not know which is correct, but I do know increased trade will increase jobs. This will increase jobs, and I think that is positive. The reduction of tariffs is positive.\n\tSome people say they have had reservations about it. I have had reservations about it. I have had reservations about the sovereignty provision because many people said this infringes on our sovereignty. I do not want to do that. I will not do it. Am I an expert in that area? No.\n\tI did notice this letter by Robert Bork. I will just read the first sentence or two. He writes:\n\n       This letter is in response to opponents of the ratification \n     of the Uruguay round agreement, the General Agreement on \n     Tariffs and Trade, who argue that GATT undermines U.S. \n     sovereignty by creating the World Trade Organization. The \n     opponents' charge is simply false.\n\n\tI respect Judge Bork.\n\tI also look at the implementing legislation, and on page 14 it says:\n\n       United States laws to prevail in conflict. No provision of \n     the Uruguay Round of agreements, nor the application of such \n     provisions to any person or circumstance that is inconsistent \n     with any law of the United States, shall have effect.\n\n\tThat is pretty plain. It is pretty simple. They cannot overturn U.S. laws or State laws in GATT.\n\tSome people have alleged that, and I even read it in one of the newspapers today. That is not the case.\n\tAgain, maybe the implementing legislation will be changed, but I know that is one provision that will not be changed, so I feel comfortable with that.\n\tSome people said, well, they are going to support the agreement but they do not support the budget waiver because they do not want to increase the deficit. I respect that statement a lot. I probably voted to object to waiving the budget as many times as anybody on the floor. I do not want to waive the budget order that allows us to increase deficit spending. But, likewise, Madam President, I think we should take into account the economic consequences of our decisions.\n\tSome people have estimated that we are going to be increasing trade by GATT. Again, I do not know if this is factual or not. I have not run this through computers and so forth. But they estimated that by passing GATT, we are going to be increasing trade, to the benefit of the United States, by a $100 billion to $200 billion increase in economic activity every year. That is going to create jobs. That is going to have people paying taxes. There will tax revenue generated.\n\tI think we should take that economic effect into consideration, and at least give it some credit. We do not give it any credit right now. We analyze budgets with a static model instead of a dynamic one. And I think GATT will have a positive impact and probably produce far more revenue than it would lose by a small reduction in these tariffs.\n\n\tAgain, keep in mind our trading partners are reducing their tariffs much, much more than we are. So I think that is positive.\n\tSome of the other provisions that were mentioned--Senator Metzenbaum mentioned one concerning pioneer preferences. I listened to Senator Packwood's analysis of that. He has done a lot of homework on it. I compliment him. Maybe what is in the implementing legislation is just right but it may not be right, so maybe we will have to take a look at that next year. We are willing to do that. We can do that. We cannot reopen GATT and rewrite GATT. We cannot call the 123 countries that have been working on this since 1986 and say let us do this all over again, we do not like one provision. That is not possible. Several countries have already signed on. But we can review the implementing legislation and if we do not like something in it, or if it is not enough, or if it is not fair, let us review it. We can do that. We will review it and Congress can do that and hopefully we will.\n\tMadam President, I think it is important that we pass GATT. It is also important we do not fail to pass it. What would happen if we fail to pass it? Some people say wait until next year. I do not think we can. I do not think we can rewrite GATT. We can rewrite the implementing legislation. We cannot rewrite GATT.\n\tWhat would happen if we do not pass it? All the other countries have been looking to the United States to be the leader of the free world. We have been espousing free trade for decades, and especially during the Reagan-Bush years. They were the leaders. They were the ones. Reagan and Bush were telling everybody we want to tear down barriers. So we passed the Canadian-Free-Trade Agreement, we passed a free trade agreement with Israel. Now we passed NAFTA. In every case we have increased trade. It has been to the mutual benefit of all countries to do that.\n\tIf we do not pass GATT I am afraid the opposite will happen. A whole lot of those countries that have been looking to the United States for leadership will start moving back and say, ``Wait a minute, we are not going to do that. We are going to close our doors to agriculture.'' So South Korea is not going to allow us to sell beef or rice there, or into Japan. Or in France, where they have made restrictions time and time again on various agriculture exports, they would start building those walls. You can see this happen, country by country. Again, that would happen because the United States, which is supposed to be the leader in world trade and free trade, failed to ratify an agreement that we have been negotiating for 8 years. I think it would be a serious mistake.\n\tSo for the above reasons I hope my colleagues, one, will vote to waive the budget and, two, vote to pass the GATT agreement.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Madam President, I yield to my friend, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, 10 minutes to speak to the momentous question before us.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\tMr. DeCONCINI. I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Moynihan, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and Senator Packwood, ranking member, and compliment them on the work they have done on trade matters over the many years I have been here with them.\n\tMadam President, I followed the Uruguay round negotiations of GATT over the past 7 years with great interest, and I have been very pleased with some results, and very displeased with others. I have carefully considered the implementation legislation before us today. This is a vote which will have great implications for the future of our economy. Though there are many areas which trouble me, in weighing the pros and the cons, I have to come down in favor of voting to waive the Budget Act and vote in favor of the legislation to implement the Uruguay round agreement.\n\tI believe the GATT has served our Nation and the international economy well since we became members in 1947. It has opened up international markets, brought down trade barriers and reduced tariffs, from an average of 40 percent in 1947 to an average of 4.7 percent before the Uruguay round. In short, by bringing rule and order to the international trading system it has allowed international trade to flourish. It is not a perfect system. There have been rulings against the United States with which I did not agree and which deeply troubled me. But as the largest economy in the world, I believe the United States has benefited greatly from the GATT.\n\tOne of the failings of the current system is that, prior to the Uruguay round, sectors greatly important to the United States, such as services, agriculture and intellectual property, were not included in the GATT rules. While there are provisions in the Uruguay round where I had hoped the United States would get a better deal and there are provisions in the implementing legislation which deeply concern me, overall I believe being a member of the World Trade Organization and implementing the Uruguay round agreement is far more beneficial to the United States than remaining outside this system.\n\tFailure of the United States to join the WTO and the unraveling of GATT would have disastrous consequences. An international trade environment not governed by comprehensive agreements would leave individual countries to put up trade barriers at will, set tariffs arbitrarily and force individual industries to scramble around the globe to cut deals with every country in which they wanted access. This would be a chaotic system which, I fear, would bring international economic growth to a grinding halt.\n\tI am supporting the implementing legislation not because I believe the Uruguay round agreement is perfect in all respects but because overall I believe this trade agreement will lead to economic growth for our country by opening foreign markets to American goods and lowering tariffs on American goods sold abroad. The agreement will be good for American workers whose products will be more accessible overseas, will help U.S. exporters compete for Government infrastructure projects overseas and will help American consumers by lowering the tariff on goods they purchase.\n\tLower tariffs is one of the significant achievements of this agreement. Tariffs will be reduced to zero on many important items such as construction, agricultural and medical equipment and pharmaceuticals and will be reduced 50-100 percent on electronic items. Overall, tariffs will be cut by one-third. In essence, this is a huge tax cut which will stimulate new opportunities for American products abroad and will allow American consumers to pay less at home for goods and services.\n\tOne tariff in which I had a particular interest during the Uruguay round negotiations was on refined copper products, in which Arizona is a world leader. I pushed for zero tariffs on refined copper products. While Ambassador Kantor worked hard to get zero tariffs, the Japanese were unwilling to go to zero on this product. In the end, however, significant tariff cuts were made which will allow expanded access to the Japanese copper market which will benefit Arizona and United States copper in general.\n\tIn agriculture, another area important to my home State, this agreement does much to allow American farmers to compete globally as the GATT for the first time addresses trade in agriculture. U.S. farmers have long been hurt by countries which limited imports and subsidized exports. This agreement cuts export subsidies and internal agricultural supports, both of which distort trade and have hurt American farmers as the Europeans have subsidized their farmers higher than the United States. This cut in subsidies, along with provisions which will allow the use of funds for the Export Enhancement Program to enhance exports, will greatly help American farmers including Arizona cotton growers. Arizona citrus growers will greatly benefit by lower tariffs by Japan and Thailand, among other countries and by the reduction in export subsidies by the European Union.\n\tIn addition to agriculture, another important element of this agreement is the fact that it covers trade in services for the first time. The service sector represents 60 percent of U.S. output and 70 percent of U.S. jobs.\n\tIt is enormously important that the service sector was brought into GATT for the first time with the Uruguay round.\n\tThe agreement provides that countries not discriminate among foreign service providers, and that foreign service providers be treated the same as domestic providers.\n\tAs I mentioned, there are areas of the agreement which concern me. I share the concerns of some about the World Trade Organization. In particular, I am troubled by the meetings of dispute panels in closed sessions and that the panel deliberations will be confidential.\n\tIn addition, I am troubled by the idea that U.S. laws designed to address environmental concerns or child labor concerns could be challenged--and I say could be--as trade barriers by the WTO members. At the same time, however, I believe that the WTO also improves upon previous dispute settlement practices by achieving a more effective and expeditious dispute settlement mechanism. Furthermore, no WTO decision can affect U.S. law unless the Congress of the United States changes the law.\n\tSince historically the United States has brought more cases to the GATT than any other country and we have seen many rulings favorable to the United States be blocked, the WTO procedures could well work to our advantage.\n\tAnother area where I have had strong concerns is in the area of intellectual property. My concerns are the lack of national treatment and recognition of contractual rights with certain copyright revenue, exclusion of plants and animals from patents, pipeline protection for pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals and shortening the transition periods. Certain countries, especially in Europe, impose levies on the sale of blank audio and visual recording media and equipment which can be used to make private, unauthorized copies of motion pictures and sound recordings and they do it for millions and hundreds of millions of dollars each year.\n\tThe problem is that the U.S. right holders do not share fully in the revenue distribution. This is not a fair deal for the United States copyright industries. However, having said that, there are benefits for the United States in this agreement in that area. These include establishing minimum standards for the protection of intellectual property rights which was not there before; ensuring procedures to enforce those rights; procedures for dispute settlement regarding members' obligations to establish minimum standards and mechanisms to enforce those procedures.\n\tWhile I am concerned about those areas I mentioned above, the agreement does address the $15 to $17 billion loss in 1993 by the U.S. computer software, motion picture, music, recording, and book publishing industries due to piracy worldwide. This is a big black market which needs to be shut down.\n\tWhile the TRIPS measures are not perfect, they will reduce the piracy now devastating American companies. And these companies are vital to the United States. In value added to GDP, the copyright industries contribute more to the U.S. economy than most any other industrial sector.\n\tI also have concerns about the revenue provisions of the implementing legislation. I am troubled by the fact that the implementing legislation does not contain offsets for the loss in tariff revenues for the full 10 years.\n\tI am troubled by the fact that the implementing legislation does not contain enough revenue but I have been around here long enough--for 18 years--to realize what has to be done to pass this trade agreement, and I am willing to do it. It is not something that I do easily, because I have been out on this floor arguing for a balanced budget amendment and other reductions in Federal expenditures. I am confident that in the long run the agreement will result in gains to the Treasury, not losses.\n\tI am also concerned about the inclusion of the so-called ``pioneer preference provisions'' in the GATT implementing legislation that was argued a few minutes ago. I do not believe these provisions concerning FCC licenses belong in this legislation.\n\tOther financing provisions which concern me are the pension provisions, which has also been discussed here this morning. Why this is part of the implementing legislation is just beyond me and almost brought me to the conclusion not to vote for it. I hope that in the future we would not have these kind of things put in a trade agreement.\n\tBut despite these concerns which I cannot minimize, I share the view of leading economists that in the long run, implementation of the agreement will bring much more to the U.S. Treasury than reduction in tariffs will cost the Treasury. It is estimated by the Treasury that the Uruguay round will raise money and holds down the deficit by $60 billion over the next 10 years and the agreement will add $100 to $200 billion to the U.S. gross domestic product when fully implemented. That is impressive, and I think that is the most important part of this debate.\n\tMadam President, I weighed this decision carefully. This agreement is not perfect. Nobody will stand here and say it is, but our economy, our workers, and our consumers will be much better off with the Uruguay round agreement than without it. The Uruguay round helps us to continue to open markets for U.S. goods, stimulate economic growth at home and create jobs for Americans.\n\tIt is for these reasons that I will vote for waiving the Budget Act and vote for the implementing legislation and the agreement this evening.\n\tI thank the Senator from New York.\n\tMr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Breaux). The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Vermont.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\tMr. LEAHY. I thank my friend. Mr. President, I should note, in listening to the distinguished Senator from Arizona, how much I have enjoyed serving here with him. Senator DeConcini and I have ancestors from the same part of northeastern Italy, we have served as prosecutors in our States before coming here. We both came from the prosecutor's office to the U.S. Senate. We were good friends before we were in the Senate. We remained good friends throughout our Senate tenure and will continue to be in the years to come. He has been a voice of reason and concern for his part of the country and the country itself in service as a Senator from Arizona, as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and all the other areas that he has served. I have been proud to be associated with him in the U.S. Senate, and I am going to miss him when he leaves.\n\tMr. President, as the Senate prepares to vote on implementing the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, I do have grave concerns about this agreement. I said in October that I expect that I would have to oppose it, and I will oppose it.\n\tI have also listened carefully to the Senate debate on whether to waive the Senate budget rules. I had grave concerns about the budget waiver and after listening to the debate, I feel it is inappropriate to vote in favor of the budget waiver to assure the passage of the Uruguay round agreement. I believe it is going to add billions of dollars to our deficit.\n\tI am concerned because in the past 2 years, President Clinton and the Congress have made great strides in getting our fiscal house in order. In fact, President Clinton is the first President since Harry Truman to preside over a budget that 2 years in a row has decreased the Federal budget deficit. In fact, as a share of our gross domestic product, the deficit has been cut in half from 4.9 percent in 1992 to a projected 2.4 percent in 1995.\n\tOur strict Senate budget rules have helped in that, and that is why I cannot vote to waive the Budget Act in this matter. If GATT passes, as many now predict it will, it will have some benefit on the U.S. economy. I am going to be the first to admit that. By lowering tariffs worldwide, the agreement should allow U.S. companies to compete and win anywhere in the world. These tariff cuts should stimulate U.S. exports by making U.S. goods more competitive, and they are going to add high-wage jobs here at home. I also hope that the minimum in intellectual property protection that has been included in this agreement can benefit our computer, entertainment and other copyright industries, although I continue to have concerns in those areas.\n\tBut despite these benefits, despite the work and the herculean efforts by Ambassador Kantor, one of the finest trade negotiators I have ever seen in any administration, Republican or Democrat, I am convinced that this is a fatally flawed agreement. I believe that GATT is fatally flawed for a number of reasons, and I say this as one who believes in free trade, as one who has encouraged international trade to create jobs in the United States.\n\tI am one who believed in NAFTA and strongly supported NAFTA. But I do not believe in GATT. It is not what GATT does, it is what it fails to do that creates a problem.\n\tGATT fails to provide fair rules for our dairy exports--a billion-dollar industry in my home State of Vermont. Under this agreement, we will export fewer dairy products, and import more subsidized dairy products. I am unwilling to expose Vermont dairy farmers to these risks. We could have worked that out. Senator Jeffords and I made every effort to work with the administration to provide U.S. milk producers with the tools they need to be successful in a post-GATT world. But the administration decided it did not want to, and an agreement that does not provide increased access to foreign markets for Vermont dairy farmers is not free trade for Vermont.\n\tAs I stated, I believe in fair trade. I voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement, and I did it willingly and with enthusiasm. It has been an overwhelming success across the country and in Vermont. In fact, in the first 9 months since NAFTA went into effect, United States exports to Mexico jumped 22 percent. NAFTA has been an economic boon to Vermonters. It opened up markets and spurred Vermonters to add more high-quality jobs to their payrolls.\n\tI wish GATT was more like NAFTA, but GATT is not NAFTA. The two are totally different. GATT, unlike NAFTA, does not adequately address labor, environmental and food safety concerns. I am one Vermonter who is concerned about these areas, and in today's global economy, the interaction between trade and these issues cannot be ignored. We can never ask U.S. citizens to jeopardize their standard of living in the name of free trade.\n\tUnfortunately, GATT moves away from the crucial link between trade and the labor environment and food safety issues we fought so hard to forge in NAFTA. We were able to do it there. We were unable to do it in GATT. I am unwilling to support this trend. We need to go back, learn the lessons from NAFTA, and incorporate them into GATT.\n\tPresident Clinton and others have hailed GATT as an engine for our economic growth for the rest of this decade and into the 21st century. I hope they are right. I know that President Clinton has been more dedicated than any President I have known in his efforts to create jobs and encourage our trade worldwide. I believe GATT's tariff cuts should stimulate U.S. exports and add U.S. jobs. But there are still too many unanswered questions. I really wish we could go back and close the gap in these areas. Then I could support this agreement. Unfortunately, the gaps are still there.\n\tSo I must oppose this agreement not for what it is, but I oppose it for what it is not.\n\tI also ask unanimous consent that a statement of mine given as a member of the Judiciary Committee be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\nStatement of Senator Patrick Leahy on Section 514 of the Uruguay Round \n                             Agreements Act\n\n       As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, I have been \n     involved with Senators DeConcini, Biden, Hatch, and others in \n     working on the intellectual property provisions contained in \n     title V of the bill. Among the more controversial provisions \n     is section 514 of the bill, amending section 104A of the \n     Copyright Act, which ``restores'' copyright protection for \n     foreign works that are not in the public domain in their \n     country of origin but not currently protected in the United \n     States.\n       Ownership of the restored copryight vests first in the \n     author or in the initial rightholder of the work as \n     determined by the law of the country of origin. Such initial \n     rightholder could be, for example, the producer of a sound \n     recording or the producer of a motion picture where rights \n     are vested therein by foreign law. Those that had acquired \n     these rights through contract would also be recognized as \n     rightholders.\n       In attempting to achieve a degree of fairness, we include \n     protection for reliance parties, those who have relied on the \n     foreign works having fallen into the public domain. These \n     protections extend to those who are successors, assignees or \n     licensees of ``significant assets'' of a reliance party which \n     assets could include multiple copyrights, several titles, a \n     back list, imprints or tangible inventory, even if less than \n     all of the holdings of the company or of a division of the \n     initial reliance party.\n       We have also tried to ensure fairness for those who \n     continue to exploit ``derivative works''--as that concept is \n     used elsewhere in the Copyright Act and its case law--based \n     upon foreign works subject to restored copyright protection.\n       Section 514 of the bill also makes clear that section 412 \n     of the Copyright Act applies to actions for infringements of \n     restored works. The meaning of ``commenced'' is intended to \n     be governed by existing case law under section 412 without \n     the addition of any new element or test.\n       This is among the more complicated set of changes to our \n     law. It is being proposed in order to ensure that others will \n     treat U.S. works similarly within their countries and grant \n     them the copyright protections to which they should be \n     entitled.\n\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\tMr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if someone had asked me a year ago what my feelings would be in debating the GATT Uruguay round agreement and looking toward its potential passage, my guess is I would have said that this would be one of the high points of my career in the U.S. Senate. I am a firm believer in trade. I believe trade is critically important to job creation and to freedom and independence.\n\tWhile I am going to vote for GATT today, and while I am going to vote to jump the procedural hurdle that stands in the way of GATT today, I would have to say that the irresponsibility of this administration, the arrogance and irresponsibility of the Clinton administration in the way it has structured the debate, the way it has written the enabling legislation, and the way it failed to deal with budget requirements, has made it very difficult for me, and very difficult for a lot of other people who normally would have been for GATT, to be strongly supportive and to be excited about it.\n\tThe bottom line of the debate is, however, that despite what I believe has been the arrogance of the administration and the irresponsibility of the administration on GATT, the GATT agreement is critically important to the future of the people who do the work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon in Texas and in America. And while you can find a lot of reasons to be against it, there is one overriding reason to be for it. That reason is that it is the right thing to do for America and for its people.\n\tI want to try to address very briefly some of the issues that have been raised. Let me start with the whole sovereignty issue. It is a fraudulent issue. Anyone who understands the American constitutional system understands that the Congress of the United States, even in concert with the President, cannot give up sovereignty. The Constitution is very clear on this point. Nothing we can do, alone or in concert with the President, can change the Constitution or can limit American sovereignty.\n\tIf anything, based on a study of the whole World Trade Organization provisions of the Uruguay round agreement and looking at the existing GATT agreement, the new agreement has more built-in protections of American sovereignty than the current trade agreement we are operating under. If you are driven only by concerns about sovereignty, this new agreement is an improvement over the current GATT, an improvement over the trade agreement that we have operated under since the Second World War. Not only am I saying this, but no less of a constitutional authority than Judge Bork has concluded the same thing.\n\tI also want to thank Senator Dole. As I have said, I personally believe that there is not a sovereignty problem with GATT. But there are many Americans who are concerned about it, and I think an important step to take in dealing with an agreement like this is to allay people's concerns. Senator Dole sought to do that. He has reached agreement on a mechanism involving a panel of Federal judges to monitor the process and to report to the Congress. And he provided for triggering mechanisms. I think in terms of guaranteeing Americans that they are not going to lose sovereignty in this agreement, that is a good proposal.\n\tI will have to say that, like any other proposal, it holds out some potential for mischief. That is something that we are going to have to watch very closely. Every greedy special interest in America that wants to steal from the American consumer is going to come here and argue that somehow America is being hurt because Americans are being allowed to buy goods competitively and under price competitive conditions.\n\tSo I want to thank Senator Dole. I am going to watch the mechanism to see that it does what we set out for it to do. But I think, again, if your concern is sovereignty, this agreement, especially with the Dole provision, is a dramatic improvement over current procedures and practice.\n\tSecond, in terms of the budget waiver, let us be very clear what we are talking about here. We are talking about an agreement that every reasonable budget authority, every financial planner, and every economist in the country that is not on the payroll of some special interest group has concluded is going to promote more trade, more job creation. And, since the Government, like a leech, can draw more blood out where the heart is pumping strongly, this agreement is going to mean more revenues coming into the Federal Treasury because it will mean a stronger economy.\n\tWe are debating a budget waiver here only because OMB, in its projections, and our Congressional Budget Office, act as if trade, job creation, and consumer behavior have nothing to do with the revenues of the Federal Government.\n\tSecond, in their initial estimate, the administration did pay for the provisions of the bill for the first 5 years. Moreover, if we were voting on lowering the capital gains taxes, if we were voting on repealing the earnings test for Social Security, I would vote to waive the Budget Act on those issues. I will vote to waive it today because basically it is the same fundamental issue.\n\tIn terms of extraneous matters, let me say the Clinton administration has been totally and absolutely irresponsible on this bill. I am not aware that in the past has an administration ever included matters in a trade bill that clearly had absolutely nothing to do with the trade bill. I believe that in the process that the Clinton administration has probably killed the fast-track process as we know it. I think we are going to have to write a new fast-track process that will have a clear rule against extraneous matters and that will set out in the most minute detail the requirement that never again will a President put extraneous matters in a bill that is dealt with under special procedures where those extraneous provisions cannot be changed.\n\tI think the fact that in this bill we are extending Super 301 of the trade bill, which is a rotten provision and which has absolutely nothing to do with GATT, is outrageous. I think the fact that we are even getting into a question about settling a court case on licensing fees for communications is something that has nothing to do with GATT and should have never been in this agreement and should have been dealt with in legislation next year or dealt with through the courts.\n\tThe provision on rules of origin on textiles was nothing more than a provision that was meant to buy votes for this agreement. It is an outrageous provision which is going to steal billions of dollars from working families in this country who are going to pay more to put clothing on the backs of their children. That extraneous provision was put in this bill which should never have been in here. Under no circumstances would I ever support it if it were a freestanding measure.\n\tLet me tell you why today I am going to take a deep breath and look beyond the outrageous and irresponsible manner with which the administration has dealt with GATT. I am going to do that because we are talking about something that is vitally important. I take trade very seriously. The growth of world trade, which we promoted as a matter of American foreign policy beginning in earnest under Eisenhower and Kennedy and under every President, Democrat or Republican, since that day, was the great engine which tore down the Berlin Wall, which won the cold war, which liberated Eastern Europe, which transformed the Soviet Union, and which freed more people than any victory in any war in the history of mankind.\n\tWe created a wealth machine with trade that rebuilt Europe and rebuilt Japan after the war. We created a wealth machine that created vast amounts of productive capacity in places like Taiwan and Korea that had never known prosperity. And America benefited every step of the way. No country in the world has benefited more by the growth of trade than has the United States of America.\n\n\tWe are talking about more than jobs, more than growth, more than opportunity. We are talking about freedom. Does it not abridge my freedom when my Government, in protecting a special interest, imposes a tax or sets a quota that stops me from buying goods which are better than the goods I could buy on the domestic market, or cheaper? If the objective is not to raise revenues to pay for essential Government but instead to limit my right to buy goods because some politically powerful special interest in America is for limiting that right, does that not infringe on my freedom? I say it does.\n\tSo there are not many issues, Mr. President, I say in conclusion, that are important enough that they would induce me to accept all of these extraneous add-ons, the arrogance of the whole approach that has been followed by an administration which does not support trade as much as I do. There are very few issues that are important enough that I would look beyond all these problems in this bill, but trade is one of those issues.\n\tLet me say to the few colleagues that are undecided on this. This is one of those issues that comes along once in awhile where all the politics is on one side and all the right is on the other. It would be a great tragedy for America if this bill failed today.\n\tWe could blame Bill Clinton. We could point out all this stuff he put in this bill. We could point out his arrogance in the whole process. We could do all those things. We could dump this baby right at his doorstep. But the baby would be dead, and we love the baby ourselves.\n\tIn fact, it is our baby. We created this baby. Six of the 8 years of negotiations occurred under Republicans, and except for this one provision that the Clinton administration put in on green-light subsidies--which again is a bad provision, which I am not for--this is a good agreement.\n\tSo I want to urge my colleagues when they are getting all these telephone calls about sovereignty, when they look at all the politics, when they are outraged about the way the Clinton administration has handled all these issues, I simply ask them to look at what would happen if we rejected the GATT Uruguay round.\n\tIf I thought we could reject this agreement, kill all these extraneous matters, get rid of these green-light subsidies, and do this bill again 2 years from now when there is a Republican in the White House, I would do it in a heartbeat. But I do not think we can get Humpty-Dumpty back together again. I think if we reject this agreement, no other major country in the world will approve it.\n\tWe all know how much protectionist sentiment we have right here in this body, in our own country. It is strong all over the world, and it is something that people who understand trade, on a bipartisan basis, have to stand up to. Today I am joining those who have stood up to it. I am going to vote for this agreement. It is important that it be adopted.\n\tI say to my colleagues that, in the next few days, the next few weeks, a vote for this bill will probably be unpopular, but I believe that a year from now or 5 years from now or 10 years from now you will be able to look back and say, ``I did the right thing.'' I do not want my children, 20 years from now, to be looking through some Congressional Record and see my name down as voting against trade and say, ``I wonder why my dad was such an ignoramus.''\n\tLet me tell you, this is important to the future of America and to a free people, and that is why I am for it.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\tThe Senator from New York.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. May I first express to the Senator from Texas my admiration for what he said, and to say that the Senator from New York has nothing like the competence as a economist that he has. But I share more of his reservations than he might know, or I might be willing to admit. But I am absolutely, firmly with him. It would be a tragic mistake.\n\tSixty years of American trade policy--which really got energized under Eisenhower, but it began with Cordell Hull--is at issue and will be resolved at 6 o'clock tonight. This is a momentous vote. It is a great way to end up the century.\n\tNow I have the great pleasure to yield 10 minutes to my friend from Mew Mexico, Senator Bingaman.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\tMr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, thank you, and I thank the Senator from New York for his leadership on this issue as well as on many others and for yielding me the time.\n\tMr. President, the main goal we should have in considering the GATT is maintaining and increasing the number of high-wage jobs in the United States. Increased trade with other countries can help us to do that. But in order for us to grow new high-wage jobs, we must be able to maintain some balance in our trade relationships with the rest of the world, and we must be allowed to export to other countries the products and services in which we have a competitive advantage.\n\tThe question is whether going forward with GATT at this time helps us or prevents us from maximizing the high wage job creation that we want in future years.\n\tOur trade deficit is the largest in the world. It appears to be on the rise and primarily it is caused by two large unaddressed problems:\n\tThe first is imported oil, and the second is imported manufactured products from the Far East, which are not offset with sufficient exports by us to those Far Eastern countries.\n\tThe imported oil problem is of our own doing. We have lacked the national will to pursue energy independence and the chronic deficit that we carry in oil and petroleum products is the obvious result of that lack of national will. GATT will not address this problem.\n\tThe imbalance in trade with the industrializing countries of the Far East--Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia--is both our own fault and the fault of those we trade with. It is a direct result of those countries pursuing policies of export promotion and import restraint and also the direct result of our own country's maintaining a policy of relative free trade while those countries are engaged in this persistent import restraint. In my view GATT will only marginally address this problem as well.\n\tUnder U.S. law today there are tools available to the administration to achieve more equitable trade treatment from these countries; antidumping laws, counterveiling duties, section 337, section 301. Unfortunately, however, either those tools are inadequate or no administration in the 12 years I have been in Washington has been wiling to use them effectively. The consequence has been the continued unfair treatment we receive at the hands of these governments and their key industries and the growing trade deficit we suffer with these countries.\n\tMr. President, I understand that we should not expect to have perfectly balanced trade with each country, but we cannot allow the imbalances with certain countries to become so great that they cannot be offset for by trade elsewhere. That is precisely what we have allowed to happen with these Asian countries.\n\tThe proponents of GATT are running television ads which say that GATT will require over 120 countries to trade by the same rules we do. My own reading of GATT indicates that it will reduce tariffs but that it will not prohibit other countries from continuing to play by their own rules in most important respects. For example, it will not prevent Japan from maintaining a distribution system for its domestically manufactured cars that is closed to foreign manufactured cars. Similarly, it will not prevent cartels of foreign manufacturers from remaining in effect, and it will not prevent foreign governments from providing generous financial support to their domestic companies to support their efforts to export.\n\n\tThose countries have made it clear they will not play by our rules, and GATT does not require them to. Rather, the real question for us as a country is not whether other countries will play by our rules; whether we will have the clear-headedness, the pragmatism, and the courage to begin playing by some of the rules which the rest of the world has adopted and still insist on. Those rules include creating tax incentives for domestic manufacture of products to be sold in domestic markets, supporting government industry partnerships in strategic and targeted industries, aggressively supporting efforts by domestic firms to export, and most importantly, taking any and all steps necessary to produce reasonable balances of trade with other huge world economies.\n\tThat is the real challenge we face in a post-GATT world and I conclude that the adoption of GATT will do little to help us in meeting this challenge.\n\tWhether the adoption of GATT will prevent us from maximizing the high-wage job creation we want in future years is another question altogether. In fact, subject to key assurances and assumptions, I agree with proponents of GATT who say that it will not prevent us from achieving our job creation goals.\n\tMr. President, on balance I have concluded that adoption of GATT at this time by the Congress is the responsible thing to do. The 10 years of preparation that have gone into this agreement and the leadership role this country should play in world trade make it imperative that we move ahead.\n\tOn balance, I believe that GATT is also a responsible choice for New Mexico. Like the Nation as a whole, New Mexico will have losers and winners. I believe, however, that the potential for increased exports is great in New Mexico. In 1992, New Mexico exported $247 million in goods. In 1993, this figure jumped to $397 million, an increase of approximately 60 percent. GATT can help sustain this trend in exporting, and support good, high-wage jobs in New Mexico. Our leading export industries, which include electric and electronic equipment, industrial machinery and computers, and refined petroleum products, are all likely to reap the benefits of lower tariffs abroad.\n\tIn reaching this conclusion I believe that certain assumptions and assurances are critically important. My vote in favor of GATT today is only being cast based on assumptions and assurances in four major areas:\n\n\tFirst, my vote is based on the assumption that the United States will still have the ability to retaliate against unfair trade practices for activities not specifically covered by a rule in GATT;\n\tSecond, my vote is based on the assumption that the United States will continue to resist the admission of China to GATT until China agrees to be bound by the rules that apply to other industrialized nations; and\n\tThird, my vote is cast with the expectation that if the new World Trade Organization operates in ways that are inimical to U.S. interests we can, and in fact will, exercise our right to withdraw.\n\tAnd finally, my vote is based on assurances from the President that he shares my concern about the enormous trade deficits we currently have with Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia and that he will work with me over the coming days to find an effective way to review the cause of those deficits and their impact on the retention and creation of high-wage jobs in this country, and to come up with specific action steps we can take to deal with that very real problem.\n\tMr. President, let me just show one chart to my colleagues here to make the point which I have tried to make here in my statement about the growing imbalance in trade deficits with Far Eastern countries.\n\tThis chart shows in 1983 the combined trade deficit we suffered with the seven nations that I have cited was $32 billion. Ten years later, in 1993, it was $105 billion. This year it is anticipated to be $117 billion.\n\tI point out to my colleagues that the ability of China to manufacture for export is just now developing.\n\tWe have a serious problem in this area, Mr. President. I have discussed it with the Trade Representative and I have discussed it with others in the administration, and I believe strongly that after GATT is adopted--and I believe it will be adopted today by the Senate--we need to give attention to this growing trade imbalance with Asian countries.\n\tThis is a problem that is not going to fix itself. It is not one that is going away. It does impact on those working families in this country which are trying to maintain their standard of living and hope for better wages in the future.\n\tFirst, my vote is based on the assumption that the United States will still have the ability to retaliate against unfair trade practices for activities not specifically covered by a rule in GATT.\n\tOne area of concern which I share with many others relates to the ability of signatories to GATT to pursue unilateral retaliation for trade practices not required by a GATT rule to be handled by a dispute settlement body. According to a July GAO report, the European Union takes the position that governments that subscribe to GATT commit not to use trade retaliation except as authorized through the WTO legal system.\n\tI have raised this issue directly with Trade Representative Kantor, and he assures me that the GAO report does not reflect the correct EU position on the issue. He further assures me that this administration's position is solidly to the contrary, that is, the administration's view is that practices and policies of other GATT members which are not specifically covered by a GATT rule can be retaliated against by the United States and that all U.S. trade laws remain in effect even under GATT.\n\tIn my opinion the main trade obstacles we face are not covered by any GATT rule, and accordingly it is vitally important that we maintain the ability to act unilaterally against unfair trade practices which we believe require retaliation.\n\tSecond, my vote is further based on the assumption that the United States will continue to resist the admission of China to GATT until China agrees to be bound by the rules that apply to other industrialized nations.\n\tAlthough the chronic trade deficit we run with Japan is clearly the largest single country component of our overall trade deficit, another cause for alarm is the enormous increase in our trade deficit with China in recent years. In 1989, the first year of the Bush administration our trade deficit with China was $6.24 billion. By 1992, at the end of President Bush's term it had risen 193 percent to $18.26 billion. Last year in 1993, it grew to $22.77 billion and this year it is expected to reach over $28 billion.\n\n\tExperts point out that the cause for these increases are many, however, it is indisputable that one of those causes is the conscious policy of the Chinese Government to limit imports, and promote exports. The growth of Chinese exports in excess of imports is primarily into the United States market. And a particularly troubling fact is that even with those large exports, only a small fraction of China's GDP is devoted to exports today. To put it bluntly, we are on our way to importing even more from China than we import from Japan by the end of this decade.\n\tAgain, this is a concern that I have raised with Trade Representative Kantor. He has assured me that he shares this concern, not only about the size of our trade deficit with China but also about the Chinese policies and practices that have partially caused that deficit.\n\tHe has also assured me that this administration will block the admission of China to GATT until China has shown credible evidence of its willingness to abide by the rules that apply to other industrial nations. Blocking China's admission to GATT will not solve the problem we have today in trade with China, but it will help to maintain a focus on their unfair trading practices, until those practices are corrected.\n\tThird, my vote is cast with the expectation that if the World Trade Organization operates in ways that are inimical to U.S. interests we can, and in fact will, exercise our right to withdraw.\n\tMany have pointed out the potential problems that exist in the structuring of the WTO. The U.S. economy accounts for about 25 percent of world trade today, but under the proposed WTO we will have the same voting weight as those countries with the least amount of world trade. This is a serious problem which will only be alleviated if, in fact, the WTO can operate on a consensus basis as the GATT has in recent years. Time will tell whether this arrangement is a fatal flaw in the WTO which will require us to withdraw. But we need to put all countries on notice that the possibility is real, and I may well support such withdrawal if the need arises.\n\tFinally, my vote is based on assurances from the President that he shares my concern about the enormous trade deficits we currently have with Japan, China, Korea, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan and that he will work with me over the coming days to find an effective way to review the cause of those deficits and their impact on the retention and creation of high-wage jobs in this country, and to come up with specific action steps we can take to deal with that very real problem.\n\tMr. President, it is my view that the approval of GATT will not dramatically improve our ability to export, although it will result in tariff reductions over a period of time. GATT neither solves our major trade problems nor significantly impedes our ability to solve them in coming years. Without trying to criticize or demean the importance of GATT, I see it largely as secondary to the central trade issue which we confront.\n\n\tThe central trade issue which cries out for attention is this large and growing trade deficit with Asian countries. In 1993 when you add up the cumulative trade deficit the United States ran with the seven Asian countries of Japan, China, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, it exceeds $105 billion. Our trade deficit with all nations by contrast was only $116 billion. American workers see downsizing and streamlining and plant closings and they see more and more of the manufactured products bought by Americans being produced abroad. That increase in imports from abroad can be accepted as long as the jobs we lose are being replaced with jobs of equal worth in sectors of our economy which are exporting. But the existing trade imbalance reflects a job creation imbalance as well. And even though the U.S. economy has been successful at creating many new jobs in the last few years, too few of those jobs are high-wage jobs committed to export.\n\tJapan has built the world's second largest economy by pursuing a policy of manufacturing for export. This has worked to Japan's benefit but has harmful effects on our own ability to retain manufacturing jobs. And now other Asian countries are following the model of Japan. The United States cannot remain strong and U.S. workers cannot maintain their standard of living if we continue indefinitely as the one truly open market for Asian manufactured goods, and Asian retains a maze of impenetrable barriers to our own exports.\n\tMy concern about this crucial trade problem has prompted me to urge the President to work with me over the coming days to find an effective way to review the causes of these deficits and their impact on the retention and creation of high-wage jobs in this country. That review would result in recommendations of specific steps we should take to reverse the adverse trends in our trade relations with these countries and to bring our trade relations into reasonable balance by the turn of the century in such a way that we maximize the creation of high-wage jobs in the United States. It is my hope that this review could provide the basis for real progress in the 104th Congress in dealing with the challenge we face of making trade support our efforts to create a high-wage economy here in the United States.\n\n\tMr. President, before concluding, let me also address the arguments that U.S. ratification of GATT will cede U.S. sovereignty to others or will inundate U.S. laws in the areas of environmental and consumer protection. My reading of the agreement and the implementing legislation lead me to conclude that these arguments are soundless. If an adverse decision is rendered against the United States under GATT, this does not invalidate any Federal, State, or local laws. The result is rather that the successful complaining country will be authorized to take retaliating action against us. Of course any country has that same option at the present time.\n\tIn conclusion, based on the assumptions and assurances I have just outlined, I will support the GATT with my vote today. But the approval of GATT by the Congress should not be interpreted as an indication we believe that all is well in world trade. I believe the trade deficit we are experiencing as a nation are intolerable and I hope that the approval of GATT and the other steps I refer to above will lead us toward a resolution of this problem. For only a reversal of these trade deficit trends will allow the working men and women of this country to hope once again that they will have access to the high-wage jobs that can produce more prosperous and economically secure lives than they have today.\n\tSo in conclusion, Mr. President, I will support GATT with my vote today. But the approval of GATT by the Congress should not be interpreted as an indication that we believe all is well in world trade. I believe the trade deficits we are experiencing as a nation are intolerable. I hope that the approval of GATT and the other steps I have referred to will lead us toward a solution to the problem. For only a reversal of these trade deficit trends will allow the working men and women of the country to hope once again that we will have access to the high-wage jobs that can produce more prosperous and economically secure lives than they have today.\n\tThank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for a compelling case. May I say that the caveats he suggested about would the United States be able to retaliate for trade practices not covered in the GATT, the answer is yes. We have section 301 and we will continue to do so.\n\tBut I note that 60-percent increase in exports over 1 year. That is the prospect we have in America. And those are good jobs.\n\tMr. BINGAMAN. I certainly agree. Again, I thank the Senator from New York for yielding me the time.\n\n\n              substantial understatement penalty amendment\n\n\tMr. RIEGLE. I would like to ask the distinguished Chairman for a clarification on section 744 of this legislation, which amends section 6662(d) of the tax code. Am I correct, Mr. Chairman, that this amendment is not intended to alter the definition of a tax shelter for purposes of the substantial understatement penalty?\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator is correct.\n\tMr. RIEGLE. And is it the understanding of the Chairman that, under current law, only those entities or other arrangements that have as their principle purpose the avoidance or evasion of Federal income tax are considered tax shelters?\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. That is my understanding.\n\tMr. RIEGLE. Am I therefore correct that an entity, plan, or other arrangement that has as its purpose the claiming of tax benefits, such as the low-income housing tax credit under section 42 of the Code or the credit for producing fuel from nonconventional sources under section 29, in a manner consistent with the statute and Congressional purpose is not considered a tax shelter for purposes of the substantial understatement penalty and will not be affected by the proposed amendment?\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator is correct.\n\tMr. RIEGLE. I thank the Chairman for this clarification.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bradley). The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 15 minutes.\n\tMr. KEMPTHORNE. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\tMr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for free trade and the proposed $750 billion reduction of tariffs around the world. I know that the American worker, the American farmer and professional, can compete with anyone in the world, and I am confident that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade would make a major contribution to economic growth in the United States and around the world.\n\tIf I could vote for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade without voting for the budget waiver and without voting for the World Trade Organization, I would do so without any hesitation. But I cannot do that.\n\tWhile I strongly support free trade and a reduction in world tariffs, I am also determined to do everything I can to protect the sovereignty of the Federal Government and our 50 states. Despite the acknowledged economic benefits that will result from GATT, I have carefully weighed the evidence and I have come to the inescapable conclusion that the WTO threatens to do more harm than good. Let me be specific. I am convinced the voting arrangements for the World Trade Organization will jeopardize the sovereign right of our State governments and the Federal Government to affect the lives of Americans. While the agreement will not change our governments' right to make laws, it will, in my view, create a situation that puts pressure on State governments to change or repeal their laws and regulations to abide by WTO mandates. And within the WTO, our vote will be equal to the vote of Rwanda, Cuba, or Fiji. This voting arrangement and the enforcement powers given to the WTO lead me to the conclusion that this agreement poses far more risks than benefits to the American way of life.\n\tUnder the current GATT procedures, trade disputes are settled by consensus among the relevant parties. While this system has not worked well every time, it has preserved the U.S. ability to veto GATT decisions contrary to our interests. Under the Uruguay round of GATT now before the Senate, this veto power will be lost.\n\tIf passed, the World Trade Organization would replace the current GATT consensus structure.

Lawrence Tribe stated ``the proposed WTO would have authority to impose major financial sanctions on jurisdictions whose laws, either national or local, are found by WTO tribunals to restrict trade in unacceptable ways.'' The WTO is clearly difficult from the current GATT structure.\n\tMore specifically, under the dispute resolution powers given to the World Trade Organization, a WTO panel will meet, in secret, to settle trade disagreements. During the panel's deliberations, the U.S. Government will be represented by an official from the U.S. Trade Representative's office. Although a state law may be challenged by the WTO panel, the affected state will not be allowed to defend itself before the WTO panel. In addition, the decisions of the WTO panels will be binding and the United States has no ability to veto these decisions. In the event that a WTO panel rules against the United States we are left with three options: change the offending law, reject the WTO ruling and suffer trade retaliation or pay compensation to the offended parties. Under this system it seems likely that the certainty of trade retaliation or penalties will lead the U.S. Government to pressure a state to change a law that the WTO considers an impediment to trade.\n\tConcerned about the ability of the WTO to pass mandates onto the States, 42 State Attorneys General contacted President Clinton, in July, about GATT. They stated that they had concerns about how some of our State laws and regulations would fare under the WTO and its dispute resolution panels. The Attorneys General noted some countries had identified U.S. State laws that they intend to challenge under the WTO. The Attorney General from Idaho, Larry Echohawk, signed that letter.\n\tAt the end of July, after several meetings with the USTR and a few changes to the GATT agreement, several of the Attorneys General sent a letter to Ambassador Kantor announcing their support for GATT. The Attorney General from Idaho did not sign this letter. In fact, Mr. Echohawk stated in an August 1 letter to me that ``the GATT agreement still raises serious concerns for the rights of states in our federal system of government.''\n\tMr. Echohawk acknowledged that the changes negotiated between the USTR and the Attorneys General were significant. However, he went on to state that ``they are all in the nature of damage control after-the-fact. None of the changes provides the kind of protection that is due to a sovereign state under the federal form of government guaranteed by the United States Constitution.'' I agree and I believe States should be concerned. In the same letter to the President on GATT, Professor Tribe stated that ``the basic thrust of the Uruguay Round is that it would empower international tribunals effectively to override state laws protecting local workers, consumers, or the environment on the ground that those laws interfere with world trade.''\n\tIn addition, in a letter I received today, the Idaho State Tax Commission stated ``we believe that the dispute resolution process to be effected by the World Trade Organization risks a serious diminution of traditional state sovereignty.'' Moreover, the Commission recognized the importance of the changes brought about by the negotiations between the USTR and the Attorneys General. However, the Commission stated that ``these protections * * * do not change the main fact that GATT represents a significant shift of sovereign authority away from State and local governments.''\n\n\tThe Idaho State Tax Commission and the Attorney General of Idaho have identified numerous State laws that the WTO might call impediments to trade. For example, the Idaho legislature has enacted an investment tax credit which allows companies to deduct plant investments. It is not hard to imagine a WTO panel determining that this investment tax credit favors Idaho industries over foreign competition. Likewise, the State of Idaho has sent the United States Trade Representative 350 pages of Idaho laws that might be challenged by the WTO as trade impediments.\n\tThe United States economy is one of the largest markets in the world. Currently, the size of our market gives us increased clout in trade disputes with other countries. Under the one-nation one-vote formula of the WTO, our influence will be dramatically reduced. This reduced influence poses a direct threat to the sovereignty of State laws. Indeed, many of the health regulations, worker protection laws, including child labor laws, and environmental protection enacted by the various states might be challenged as trade impediments by the World Trade Organization.\n\tAs a United States Senator for the State of Idaho, I understand the impact of allowing others to control a State's destiny. This great Nation of ours was formed by a collection of sovereign states and we should reject any agreement or treaty that proposes to cede power and authority to a world organization.\n\tI believe that this agreement should be considered by the Senate as a treaty, which is amendable and, under the U.S. Constitution, requires the support of two-thirds of the Senate body. Harvard Law Professor, Lawrence Tribe, also believes that this agreement should be voted on as a treaty. Speaking on the treaty question, Professor Tribe has stated ``GATT, as presently structured, would entail so substantial a shift of sovereignty from State and local governments to the proposed WTO that the agreement requires Senate ratification as a treaty.''\n\tI am also troubled by the proposal to waive the Budget Act to make up for the lost revenue that would result from enactment of the GATT agreement. The Congressional Budget Office originally estimated that over 10 years GATT will cost the Federal treasury around $30 billion. The administration has now put forward some offsets that are said to pay for all but $15 billion of the lost GATT revenue. But these offsets are questioned by a number of opponents of GATT. In addition, even with these offsets every Senator will be asked to add $15 billion to our national debt if he or she wants to support the Uruguay round of GATT. I cannot go back to my State and tell the people of Idaho that I just voted to increase our deficit by over $15 billion.\n\n\tIf this agreement is as good as its supporters suggest, then we ought to pay for it up front. That is why I joined a small number of my colleagues to sign a letter to President Clinton urging him to pay for all of the lost revenue that would result from the passage of GATT. But this request was not agreed to. I also wrote to Senators Mitchell and Dole requesting that the Senate vote on the budget waiver if the President would not pay for all of the lost revenue from GATT. As we all know, our first vote on today will be concerning this budget waiver.\n\tIn conclusion, I would like to just quote from that letter I received yesterday from the Idaho State Tax Commission. They say in their closing paragraph:\n\n       One of the historic and traditional roles of the U.S. \n     Senate is to represent and protect the interests of state in \n     our federal system of government. It is unfortunate that this \n     legislation is before the Senate under rules that require an \n     all-or-nothing vote. The laudable goals of free trade and \n     reduced tariffs are made inseparable from the more lamentable \n     dispute resolution procedures provided by GATT.\n\n\tThey say it very clearly. I wish I could vote for GATT but vote against the World Trade Organization.\n\tThe United States must continue to be a leader in GATT. The administration and Congress should continue to reduce tariffs in the United States and urge their reduction around the world. However, I strongly believe that United States participation in the WTO is a detriment to our 50 States and this Nation, and I oppose passage of the GATT-WTO agreement.\n\tSeveral Senators addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\tMr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may assume under the direction of Senator Moynihan.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the new GATT agreement and in support of the jobs and prosperity that it will bring not only to the United States but also to my State of Louisiana which I proudly represent. Today's vote is a vote between--and a choice between--old versus new. It is a question of whether we want to return to the days of the Smoot-Hawley or whether we want to march into the 21st century. It is a question of whether we build walls around the United States or whether we tear down the walls around other countries of the world.\n\tThe international trade train of tomorrow is leaving the station and the question is whether we will be on it or whether the United States will be left at the station, surrounded by walls of protectionism. Some say we should reject GATT because it is too risky. They say our sovereignty is at risk, our jobs are at risk. These are the same people who see a half-filled glass of water and say it is half empty. While this agreement may not be perfect--and it is not--I know it is a much better agreement than one that is only half full. It is as close to full as an international trade agreement can ever be.\n\tFor example, how else are we going to get an agreement with over 120 countries of the world that expands Louisiana farmers' ability to sell their products abroad by limiting foreign Governments from unfairly subsidizing their own crops? How else are we going to get an agreement with over 120 countries of the world to open their markets to Louisiana chemical manufacturers, our industrial machinery, our processed foods, lumber, wood products, and, yes, our textile industries as well? How else are we going to get an agreement with 120 countries of the world to respect and pay for the use of Louisiana's creativity, found in our music, our movies, our computer software, our medical drugs, and our inventions?\n\tUnder current GATT rules, a country that closes its market to Louisiana products and goods can thumb its nose at a GATT ruling against it. But under this new agreement, our exporters can get deserved relief and Louisiana jobs will grow accordingly. As the world changes and the economic power of other countries grow, international trade rules will become more and more important. While we should not and will not give up our ultimate market leverage to resolve trade disputes as a country established under the rule of law, we should not fear the new trade rules. We will, instead, use these rules to our advantage.\n\tFruit Of The Loom, the largest employer in the State of Louisiana, Avondale Shipyards, Riverwood International, Procter & Gamble, Dow Chemical, the Louisiana Farm Bureau, the Port of New Orleans and other ports of Louisiana and countless other Louisiana employers and employees support this agreement as a positive step to improve the standard of living in Louisiana, and so do I.\n\tThis agreement is not a final answer to our economic prosperity. A level playing field is only as good as the players on that field. But, by leveling the playing field we can now focus our attention on improving the quality of our players as well.\n\tDuring the 1980's, U.S. companies paid the price to become competitive in the global markets. Now we are ready to seize the opportunity of expanded world trade.\n\tFinally, this effort is an example of how Government should work. It is bipartisan. It is Ronald Reagan, it is George Bush, and it is Bill Clinton working together over two decades to reach the same agreement: GATT.\n\tIt is Mickey Kantor and James Baker, it is Ron Brown and Jim Miller, it is Tom Foley and Newt Gingrich and George Mitchell and Richard Armey and also, to their great credit, Pat Moynihan and Bob Packwood, all together in support of the same package.\n\tAt the same time it is an all-American solution which benefits all Americans. It says to Mr. and Ms. America that you are going to win one for a change.\n\tOur choice is very clear: Old versus new. Build a fence around ourselves or knock down the fences of other countries and sell our products overseas. The Senate should pass GATT.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for his comments, generous personal comments. May I ask him, Louisiana continues to be an important rice producer, does it not?\n\tMr. BREAUX. We are one of the largest in the United States.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. And will be larger, because for the first time ever, in this agreement rice imports are open--in Japan, in Korea, and all parts of Asia. They do not like it one bit, but it is about time and you will have helped bring this about.\n\tMr. BREAUX. I thank the chairman for his comments. It is something we have been working on for over 25 years and now we can obtain that goal.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Twenty-five years. I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\tMr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask the time reserved for me, 10 minutes under the time allotted to Senator Hollings, be enacted at this time.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. EXON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a copy of a Washington Post editorial be printed at the end of my remarks.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Breaux). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n\tMr. EXON. Mr. President, the question before the Senate is an important and difficult one. Should the Senate approve or disapprove or delay the implementing package to the agreement reached under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade? Like all pieces of legislation, this bill has its good features and its bad features. Unlike other bills which come before the Senate or the House, the so-called fast-track rules, Members of both bodies are prevented from seeking to remedy the shortcomings of this legislation or to enhance its good features because amendments are not allowed.\n\tIn my view this process and the implementing legislation is a mixed bag. I have spent a great deal of time in committee hearings, discussions and study of the details.\n\tFirst, I would like to discuss and acknowledge the very good features of this agreement. The proposed GATT agreement does advance important U.S. priorities, including better protection of intellectual and other property rights, including some protection for leadership in advanced technology.\n\tI applaud our trade negotiators for this achievement. It is an area in which I have long sought change.\n\tIn the area of financial services, it is generally agreed that this new GATT agreement is a success. Trade in financial services is one of America's strongest suits. Progress in this area bodes well for the American banking, financial and insurance industries.\n\tThere are clearly some improvements and some measure of success for some of our agricultural producers. Others are not likely to fare well at all.\n\tMr. President, these important successes have been weighed against what I consider shortcomings of the GATT agreement. My long-held concerns are manyfold. My hopes of receiving satisfactory explanations and assurances from administration officials and colleagues strongly supporting approval have failed. The more I study it, the more convinced my conscience dictates ``no.''\n\tThe structure of the World Trade Organization [WTO] is a serious problem. Granting an international organization of 130 foreign countries the authority to object to any Federal, State, or local law by filing a trade violation charge and seeking counterbalancing tariffs is no small matter.\n\tIt is a loss of power, or sovereignty, when our law could be found to be contrary to GATT and the subject of the WTO trade sanctions.\n\tI am very concerned about the structure of the new World Trade Organization and its methods of dispute resolution. Under this new organization, member nations agree to subject their laws to the view of the WTO. The proponents don't want to concede this. If negotiations between nations fail, a dispute between the two countries, say the United States and Bangladesh, would go to a three member panel for experts to review.\n\tIf for example, the United States loses before that panel, the panel could approve trade sanctions by Bangladesh against the United States in an amount equal to the injury caused by the offending United States law. The three-member panels meet in secret and their decisions are binding unless the entire WTO membership--and I emphasize entire-- including the country who filed the action unanimously agree to overrule the panel decision. Such a structure will clearly stack the deck against the United States, since most countries want unlimited access to the coveted U.S. market. Virtually every country will have an invitation to challenge indirectly U.S. law which impedes any imported products.\n\n\tYes, as the proponents preach and preach and preach again, only the United States can change its laws in response to a WTO dispute resolution. But it must also be said that only the WTO has the power to determine if another country is justified in imposing trade sanctions against the U.S. law. This they do not preach. My concerns about the dispute resolution and decisionmaking process procedures are both about sovereignty and fairness.\n\tAnother structural problem with the WTO is its decisionmaking process above and beyond dispute resolution. Under the new agreement, decisions will be made on a one country, one vote basis.\n\tContrary to that, in the United Nations, the United States has an effective veto power over major actions of the United Nations because it is a member of the security council. In the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the United States has voting power weighted toward its financial contributions to these institutions. The United States will likely contribute 20 percent of the WTO budget and will bring the largest and most important consumer market to the world trading system, but will have a vote in that organization only equal to the smallest nation.\n\tIt is interesting to note that when President Eisenhower proposed another form of the WTO, it included a security council-type body which took into account market size. There is none of this balance in the proposal before us.\n\tI must also observe that it is, if nothing more, ironic that the presumed Senate majority leader of the next Congress, swept into power by promises of deficit reduction and a reduced government, asks that his party members in the Senate waive the budget act; support the creation of a new international bureaucracy and later support a new Federal bureaucracy to watch over the international bureaucracy.\n\tThis legislation, over the next 10 years, handles the $30 billion loss in tariff revenues by raising the Government's take by $15 billion and raising the national debt by $15 billion.\n\tI have serious reservations about the agriculture portions of this agreement. While many farm groups support passage of this agreement it seems we have been down this road before. The promise of a pot of gold for American farmers in foreign markets has been a promise unfulfilled. I am troubled that even after the adoption of this agreement, some of our European competitors will still have higher domestic subsidies than the United States. Yes, this agreement is progress, but faulted.\n\n\tThere are several other nonhighlighted potential problems, such as the provision that allows our competitors to employ higher subsidies by the use of so-called mix and remix of agricultural subsidies.\n\tMr. President, it is my best judgment that my constituents are probably evenly split on this proposal.\n\tThe largest number of corn, hog, cattle, and milo producers support it. They believe, as they always have, that foreign markets are the real chance that they have to escape low commodity prices. They have always believed that they can produce their way to prosperity. They are under serious financial stress. I feel for them. Their investments are high and their returns are low and frequently below the cost of production.\n\tThe Farm Bureau is in support. The Farmers Union is opposed. The soybean producers are opposed. My wheat producers are generally opposed. The milk producers are opposed since they know that, for some, GATT is near the end of their troubled road. I have not heard a great deal from our sugar beet producers but GATT surely is a dead end for some of them.\n\tMr. President, these are all good folks. They are hard pressed. I wish I could agree with all of them. Given the circumstances, it is not possible.\n\tI am fearful passage of this trade agreement will give opponents of agricultural and rural programs one more arrow in their quiver to fire in the heart of American farm families. Mark my words, during consideration of the 1995 farm bill, some of the most innovative reforms will be met with protestants that reform is ``GATT illegal.'' Note the editorial of November 30, 1994, from the not-so-farmer-friendly Washington Post which is printed following my remarks. As a veteran of many congressional battles for family farmers, I predict passage of this agreement holds nothing but peril for the new 5-year farm bill that must be passed in 1995.\n\tMr. President, every trade agreement involves a give and take. Unfortunately for many years the United States gave and gave and gave of its rich consumer market. The United States has allowed the near destruction of some industries in the name of free trade. That is not fair trade.\n\tFor the last 20 years working Americans have seen their standard of living slip or remain static. In spite of the recovering economy, Americans feel less secure in their jobs. The idea that children and grandchildren will have a better life than their parents is an open question.\n\tI think cheap foreign labor puts Americans jobs at severe risk. It should not be applauded. It should be condemned.\n\tThe proponents of this agreement will try to portray the opponents as protectionist. The choice is not between the World Trade Organization and Smoot-Hawley. There are a number of other options.\n\tAmerica is already the world's most open market. GATT opponents do not advocate unilaterally closing the American market. We should simply insist that the rest of the world catch up or risk their access to the American market. This was the idea behind the 1988 Trade Act. I believe that it is no accident that with this tough message, the U.S. trade deficit declined in the several years following the enactment of the 1988 Trade Act. The downward trend in trade deficit was reversed with the current GATT-mania. The trend I talk about from 1988 up to now, was reversed by the GATT mania.\n\tTrade should not be the only value the United States holds dear. There are other values--decency, dignity, fairness and conservation of the resources which may and should take precedence over unfettered international trade. Our Nation's abhorrence of tyranny, child labor, and environmental destruction should not be subordinated to the GATT principle of the least trade restrictive measures.\n\tHow many Americans and Nebraskans know this agreement prohibits exports of goods made by prison labor but allows exports made by children of, say, 12 years of age working for 50 cents per hour. Now that is something that we all can be proud of. We protect criminals but not the kids.\n\tIn closing, let me say that the free trade gurus that live in the world do not seem to understand where the treatment of workers starts and when we should leave workers to their own volition to do what is right. I do not apologize for being concerned about the Nebraska apparel workers, sugar beet growers in the panhandle, and workers in small and large factories throughout the State. They are real live Nebraskans and Americans all. I represent them too.\n\tI am profoundly troubled with the way GATT enthusiasts view low wage, low skill workers as disposable. I remember an America where hard work would earn a decent wage. Today, hard work and good will do not seem to go as far as they once did. The depiction of low skill workers by some GATT supporters demeans the hard work of many Americans. These workers are the families that so many politicians laud. Here is a chance to vote for them. Who's listening?\n\tIt is interesting that this same Congress just passed a massive crime bill and the next Congress will consider welfare reform. It is often said there are few of our social ills which could not be solved with a good job. Thousands of entry level jobs will be in peril with this agreement. But lest we forget, they don't vote.\n\tThe problem with the fast track procedures is that the Senate has no way to change the bad parts of this agreement. If we had more time, perhaps next year, absent the fast track we possibly could correct it. But as is, it is an all or nothing proposition. Having carefully weighed the benefits with the risks, I have concluded, Mr. President, that I can not lend my support to this agreement.\n\tThank you, Mr. President. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 30, 1994]\n\n                         Next Year, a Farm Bill\n\n       A major task of the Clinton administration and the \n     Republican Congress next year will be to write a new farm \n     bill. It's a huge undertaking; here will come a five-year \n     bill involving billions of dollars in likely subsidies and \n     other forms of support to an entire sector of the economy at \n     the start of a new era in world trade. But this time the \n     problem is compounded. The administration has no discernible \n     farm policy, has never developed one and seems most unlikely \n     to do so now, when it has been politically weakened and will \n     shortly lack even an agriculture secretary. The Republicans, \n     perhaps particularly in the House, are likewise untested. \n     It's clear enough that they want to cut federal spending and \n     regulation, but not so clear that they want to cut farm \n     spending and regulation--not the elaborate regulatory \n     structures that prop up prices, at any rate.\n       The major farm support programs are trade-offs of price and \n     income supports for production restraints. The strongest \n     believers in free markets among the Republicans would do away \n     with them. Majority leader-to-be Richard Armey has been among \n     this group in the past. Some urban Democrats have also tried \n     to kill or cut back some of the lesser programs, though for \n     different reasons. There's likely to be a revival of such \n     talk this time around, particularly if Republicans, who tend \n     to be strong in farm states, also pass a balanced budget \n     amendment and begin to make heavy cuts in other spending. If \n     only for political reasons, members not from farm states will \n     try to force them to cut farm spending, too.\n       The farm state members of both parties can be expected to \n     resist. They have already indicated they will once again try \n     to do no more than make some modest further reductions in \n     support levels. But that, too, can eventually lead to a \n     dissolution of the system, because as support levels drift \n     below break-even points, farmers will be inclined to withdraw \n     from the programs rather than submit to the production \n     limits.\n       That will be the broadest battleground--how much and how to \n     cut the principal programs. There will also be some lesser \n     battles. Dairy price supports have become dysfunctional; what \n     helps one region hurts another. The system has been so \n     patched over the years that the price of milk is now almost \n     entirely a federal artifact. A truly deregulatory Congress \n     would strike the system down. It would do away with such \n     anti-competitive constructs as the sugar program as well, in \n     which import and now even domestic marketing limitations are \n     used to keep U.S. prices artificially high.\n       The farm bill also presents environmental issues. What \n     happens next to the conservation reserve program, in which \n     farmers are paid to idle supposedly fragile land? To what \n     extent will either the administration or Congress seek to use \n     the farm bill to make pesticide and/or clean water or \n     wetlands policy?\n       The administration may not propose a bill. Instead, it is \n     said to be considering a statement of principles, mostly of \n     the steady-as-you-go variety, the effect of which would be to \n     leave the writing of the bill to Congress, which has the \n     power anyway. That would be a bow to political reality as \n     well as a way of preserving the president's options and \n     avoiding blame, all of which might be shrewd. But it still \n     wouldn't constitute a farm policy.\n\n\tMr. PACKWOOD addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Harkin). The Senator from Oregon.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Vermont.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 6 minutes.\n\tMr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the Senate will shortly be voting on H.R. 5110, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] implementing legislation. As my colleagues know, I have always encouraged and supported international trade and will continue to do so in the future. Expanding and developing export markets will not only give Vermonters, but all Americans, the opportunity to gain access into world-wide markets.\n\tAs a firm believer in free and fair trade, I regret that I am unable to support the GATT agreement. On first inclination, I am prone to support this agreement which has such worthy goals and intentions. There is no doubt, our economic future depends on the ability of this Nation to compete in the international marketplace. But this agreement is flawed. Upon detailed review of the sections pertaining to the dairy industry, the potentially devastating impact of GATT is clear.\n\tVermont's dairy farmers have for too long suffered at the expense of our trade policies. This agreement removes protections for Vermont farmers and puts them in direct competition with foreign farmers who receive massive government subsidies, making fair competition an impossibility.\n\tThere are few States that take advantage of international trade opportunities more than Vermont. This is a statistic which I think we should be quite proud of, and one which I will work to increase.\n\tStill, this issue is far more complex than just simply reviewing State trade statistics. Back in 1991, we took up the issue of so-called fast-track authority for negotiating the GATT agreement. I opposed this authority because dairy interests have been routinely ignored in trade negotiations. Once again this is true, our trade negotiators have given away the farm on GATT, and I am afraid Vermont's dairy farmers will be the ones to pay for it.\n\tWithin GATT, section 22 protections for dairy farmers are eliminated. In addition to that, a 5-percent minimum on food imports is mandated, domestic farm programs, including Federal dairy programs are reduced, and our domestic food safety laws are weakened. So what do we get in return? Canada is dragging its hooves on opening its dairy markets, and the Europeans are only required to scale back their exports by the same percentage we do.\n\n\tThis may be fair on its face to anybody who does not know dairy, but the Europeans have been massively subsidizing their exports while the USDA seems to regard dairy exports as a nuisance.\n\tSenator Leahy and I tried to work with the Clinton administration to make GATT fair to Vermont's farms and all dairy producers. I commend Senator Leahy for his efforts in working with me on a dairy export plan to be included within GATT. This plan was supported by most farmers who could see the benefits of creating worldwide markets for their products.\n\tOn numerous occasions, I urged the Clinton administration to give our farmers a fair chance in a market open to so many countries and include our export plan. Unfortunately, the President denied our request to include our export plan onto the enabling legislation of the worldwide agreement.\n\tMr. President, I also have concerns on the effects the GATT agreement will have on the world's environment. Primarily, arguments have been made that GATT will undermine implementation and enforcement of our domestic environmental protection standards. But just as importantly, GATT will interfere with international efforts to protect the environment, potentially reducing the effectiveness of international environmental treaties.\n\tMr. President, I am extremely disappointed that the President does not value the interests of the U.S. dairy farmers within the world market, along with supporting our strong environmental standards, as I do. Therefore, I cannot accept a trade agreement that will further burden our dairy farmers, weaken environmental standards and limit child labor protection.\n\tI think it is time for the President to stand up for the U.S. dairy industry and value the importance of these farmers to our Nation. He has done it for cattle, and he has done it for wheat. It is high time he pay attention to dairy as well.\n\tWhatever happens here today, I plan to go home having supported the environment and dairy farmers, in Vermont and throughout the Nation. Fairness demands nothing less, Mr. President. For these reasons, I will not vote for this agreement.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tMr. BRADLEY addressed the Chair.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey who has the distinction, among many, of having been a member of the study committee on the GATT in the mideighties.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\tMr. BRADLEY. Mr. President, we have been debating the Uruguay round agreement for nearly 20 hours now. I believe the proponents of this legislation have made a compelling case.\n\tI do not think it is any exaggeration to say that America's prosperity depends on our vote. Failure to pass this legislation would be a profoundly self-destructive act. It would close us out of world trade and deny us the export engine for economic growth and remove our voice from the councils that will shape the 21st century and national economic system.\n\tFailure to pass the agreement would be a vote of no confidence in our own future. I think it is trite but true to say that the only constant in the world today is change. Our vote is an indication of how we will react to change. We can seize it and shape it to our advantage. That is the response of a self-confident, vigorous nation, and that is the traditional American response. Or we can put our heads in the sand in the vain hope that change will pass us by.\n\tThat is the response of a nation without a future.\n\tIt is about that future that I would like to talk today. For even as we debate the Uruguay round, we should look ahead to the next round of negotiations that will move the international trading system to the next level.\n\tThe world economy did not stand still while our negotiators hammered out the Uruguay round. It changed in ways unimagined by the ministers who first gathered in Punta del Este in 1986. For example, the end of the cold war combined with broad acceptance of the capitalist model in the developing world introduced billions more consumers and competitors into the global economy. The liberalization of capital movements led to an explosion in foreign investment and unleashed daily currency flows that dwarf trade in goods. The information revolution both changed the way we create and measure value, and increased the importance of intellectual property rights. Meanwhile, our environmental problems continued to mount as an unintended consequence of our economic dynamism.\n\tWhen we ratify this today, we need a new round, sooner rather than later, to adapt the world trading system to these and other transformations shaping the global economy. I see five major areas for a new round to address:\n\tFirst is trade in services. Advanced economies rely on service industries for new growth. We have made progress in disagreement but there is much more to do.\n\tThese already produce over 53 percent of American GDP and provide 70 percent of U.S. jobs. We exported about $200 billion in services in 1993, with a surplus of $68 billion. The new round should address services. It should return to the issue. We have not exhausted it in this agreement.\n\tSecond is investment. With the increase of capital mobility and the triumph of market economics, foreign investment has exploded. This matters because investment is essential to economic growth, and because trade follows investment. For example, studies indicate that over 20 percent of American goods exports are made to foreign affiliates of the American exporter.\n\tThe Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures, TRIMS, is a tiny first step toward bringing investment under the disciplines of the world trading system. APEC and the OECD are working on this issue now. The next trade round should use their thinking as a basis to advance beyond the TRIMS agreement, or the current investment policy of this particular bill.\n\tThird is competition policy. Some of the fiercest debates in the Finance Committee, as in Geneva, where over the dumping and subsidies rules. Our ability to make sense of unfair practices and counter them is severely hamstrung by the disconnect between trade policy and domestic competition policy. These two sides of the same coin currently receive separate treatment, leading to the illogical result that competition within borders is treated differently than competition across them. The next round needs to look at ways to integrate competition and trade policies into a more effective whole that recognizes that business activity now takes place in a global market.\n\tFourth is labor rights. Improving worker rights has been an objective of U.S. trade policy for over a century. However, we are still groping to understand the connection between humane labor practices and trade. Trade policy must not deny developing countries their natural advantage in cheaper labor. At the same time, we cannot condone practices that violate basic human rights. We all want workers to reap the fruit of their labors, but we do not yet agree on where to draw the line between human rights and protectionism.\n\tWe need more work to help us understand which labor practices constitute human rights violations, which afford unfair trade advantages, which represent legitimate comparative advantage, and which are simply the result of underdevelopment. The OECD is doing some work on this issue. We need to do more and integrate the findings into the international trading system.\n\tFinally, there is the environment. We now find ourselves in the untenable position of developing two parallel trade/environment structures. On the one hand, we have our environmental commitments, such as the Montreal Protocol, the Global Climate Change Convention, the Biodiversity Convention, and our obligations under the Stockholm and Rio Declarations. These all have trade effects. On the other, we have our GATT/WTO commitments, which have an impact on the environment.\n\tThese structures intersect in many places. They contradict in others, as demonstrated by the problems we have had with the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n\tArthur Dunkel once told me he thought the next GATT round would be a green round. Clearly, we need to build a conceptual framework to bring together environmental policy and trade policy. The next round must do so.\n\tI have listed a number of issues, identified a number of problems, and provided no answers. That pretty well reflects the current state of thinking. It is incumbent upon the first Director General of the WTO, whoever he may be, to follow Arthur Dunkel's example and, as his first act, appoint a new eminent person's group to lay the conceptual framework for a new round, just as we laid the conceptual framework for this round in the 1985 group.\n\tIn order to participate in new negotiations and meet these new challenges, we must renew the President's fast track negotiating authority. We must make a fast-track bill one of the first priorities of the new Congress. There are many contentious issues to work out, but with a vote in favor of free trade this week we will have the foundation to work out an acceptable negotiating famework.\n\tStill, Mr. President, these are issues for tomorrow. The task at hand is to pass the legislation before us implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement. Before we can move ahead on these issues for the future, we must reaffirm our own commitment to the international trading system.\n\tSome say that we are not ``the'' economic superpower. Japan is. If we turn down the Uruguay round, that may become a selffulfilling prophesy. If we approve this Agreement, continue our efforts to bring the budget deficit under control, provide worker education, fix our pension system, and retain our leadership in the world trading system, the United States will remain what it now is--the world's largest, most productive economy.\n\tIn the NAFTA debate, a number of my colleagues began their statements, ``I'm a free trader, but * * *'' Some said, ``* * * but we'll hear a giant sucking sound as jobs go south.'' Others said, ``* * * but the Mexicans aren't democratic enough.'' Although I disagreed with them on NAFTA these were legitimate concerns, given complexity of the commitment we were undertaking.\n\tWell, the returns are coming in, and they show that NAFTA was a good deal for America. There has been no sucking sound of jobs going south, and we have an adjustment program in place for the 10-15,000 workers who could be displaced by NAFTA this year. Instead, the main sound has been the steady ``whoosh'' of goods, services, and profits crossing our borders in all directions.\n\tGary Hufbauer, of the Institute for International Economics, estimates that, because of lower import prices NAFTA will put $600 million into the pockets of American consumers. American business will have more in gross margin to cover their fixed costs.\n\tIn my state of New Jersey alone, a recent study has found that NAFTA has already led to $287 million in increased exports and over 5000 net new jobs. And the Uruguay Round dwarfs NAFTA in economic size.\n\tNAFTA also served as an anchor to the Mexican political and economic system when it was shaken by the assassination of the ruling party's presidential candidate. It created new economic and financial constraints on the ability of old-style politicians to fix the election. As a result, Mexico ran the cleanest presidential election in its modern history and is poised to do even better next time.\n\tThere are no ``buts'' in the matter before us. We have a clear choice between prosperity and stagnation. We have a choice between enjoying the benefits of a developing international trading system, or retreating into autarky, poverty, and irrelevance. We have a choice between national self-confidence and national decline.\n\tI hope that we will pass this GATT agreement. Opponents have made a number of arguments, one of which is low wages; all the jobs will go to low wage countries. If that were the case, Mr. President, Bangladesh would be an economic superpower. Clearly low wages are not the only criteria for investment around the world.\n\tThey have also made the point that we have the problem of child labor.\n\tMr. President, if there is a problem of child labor in this country, child labor of illegal immigrants in our own country in factories across this land, we have a law now that says if an employer hires an illegal immigrant, whether that is a child or not, he should had been fined and sanctioned.\n\tWe do not fund adequately employer sanctions and because we do not fund adequately employer sanctions there are literally thousands of illegal immigrant children at work in this country today. So those who come to this floor and puff about child labor, let us make sure that we fund the economic sanctions that are already in law.\n\tAn estimate is that they require an additional 10 times what we are now funding to enforce economic sanctions under the immigration law. We have $28 million to do that. Estimates are it would cost $280 million to $300 million.\n\tSo those who are concerned about child labor in Bangladesh or China or somewhere else why not be concerned about child labor in your State, in your town, because it is there today with illegal immigrants and if you want to stop child labor stop it in the United States first.\n\tGATT is a good agreement. We are the most open economy in the world and we will benefit the most from opening other economies.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\tThe Senator from Oregon.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\tMr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and my colleague from Oregon.\n\tMr. BOND. Mr. President, the debate over the GATT and the legislation before us today has raged for many months now. I have been following this very closely both in the public debate and the debate in Congress and the debate in homes and coffee shops and community centers around the country. It is clear that this is an issue that has raised passions, as well as fears, among a large segment of our population.\n\tThe arguments on both sides of the debate have been presented forcefully and extensively as they have here. I have listened to the objections of those who oppose the agreement, and I think I have considered each one of them very closely. I would like to take just a moment to review those objections.\n\tFirst is the budget implication of this bill. Opponents argue that this bill will increase the Federal budget deficit by tens of billions of dollars over the next decade. If that were the case, I would be voting today against the budget waiver and against the bill. The bottom line, however, is that the charge is simply not true. It is based on static budget assumptions which fail to take into consideration the huge impact the new GATT will have on our Nation's economy. By lowering tariffs worldwide, the agreement will result in hundreds of billions of dollars of added economic activity. It is not a zero sum game. It is not just slicing up the pie different. It is slicing up a larger pie.\n\tThat agreement that we will approve today, I hope, will generate significant new tax revenues, which will almost certainly reduce, rather than increase, the deficit.\n\tA second argument that continues to be raised in opposition to this agreement is that it creates a new World Trade Organization which will give unfair power to tiny foreign countries, to tiny dictatorships, and which will have the power to overturn U.S. laws. Again, I have looked at these charges carefully. If they were true, I would be down here today arguing strongly against this agreement. It is clear to me, however, that they are not true. The WTO is a new organization that the United States pushed for to give the GATT more muscle to resolve trade disputes and enforce settlements. The reason we pushed for it is because we are the country which most frequently brings complaints before the GATT. Since we are the ones most often asking for relief, it makes sense to ensure that the GATT has the ability to make its decisions stick. Too often it has been the U.S.A., our farmers, our export workers, our creative producers who have been the losers when GATT did not have the clout to stop unfair practices directed at us. It is time we had a stick instead of a wet noodle to enforce those agreements. This agreement makes a major stride in that direction.\n\tMany opponents have suggested that the United States will find itself on the losing end of a trade dispute--perhaps as a result of many smaller countries ganging up on us in the WTO--and that we will be forced to forfeit our sovereignty by modifying our laws or lowering health and safety standards. I simply do not accept that. That is not true.\n\n\tThe United States is the world's largest economy. The goal of every other country in the world is to sell as much as possible in our great market. They know that they cannot attack us unfairly with impunity. If they try, we will retaliate and their economy--not ours--will suffer. Furthermore, Congress has put the world on notice that we will monitor the WTO like a hawk, and that we are prepared not to comply with an unfair ruling, or even to withdraw if necessary. We are unlikely ever to see such a situation, however. The GATT has worked over the years by operating through consensus. There is every reason to expect that consensus will continue to be the rule.\n\tWith regard to the issue of sovereignty, it is just not true that this agreement will infringe on our right to set our own laws. The U.S. Supreme Court has made very clear that the Government can choose to ignore treaty provisions when it desires. Further, the legislation itself clearly states that no part of the agreement which is inconsistent with U.S. law shall have effect. And finally, we have the right to withdraw from the agreement at any time with only 6 months notice.\n\tThere has also been much criticism of the wide range of non-GATT provisions in this legislation which were included to help offset the tariff cut. Many Missourians have called my office to express their concern about giveaways of their tax dollars. I have looked at as many of these provisions as have been brought to my attention and, although I can see how some might oppose the policy behind them, I cannot agree that they are a giveaway of our tax dollars. It could be argued that the Government could have received more for some of these radio spectrum license sales, and that is something the administration has agreed to review, but clearly it is not a giveaway to tax dollars.\n\tAfter reviewing those concerns, one must then look at the other side of the equation--the benefits that would result from approving the new GATT accord. In my opinion those benefits will be huge both for the United States as a whole and for my State of Missouri.\n\tThis agreement will provide the largest tariff--or tax, because that is what a tariff is--reduction in history. That will mean more money in the pockets of Americans as well as citizens of other countries. That is money that can be saved or that can be spent. Regardless of how it is used, it is certain to result in the creation of thousands of new American jobs.\n\n\tThe benefits of GATT can be seen very clearly just by looking at its impact upon Missouri.\n\tThe new agreement will be a boon to Missouri's farmers who already export a quarter of their output. We know that if you take down the barriers they can export more because they are the world's most efficient producers. That percentage is certain to surge as other countries are forced to lower unfair trade barriers which currently keep out Missouri commodities such as rice, corn and beef.\n\tThe largest manufacturer in Missouri--McDonnell Douglas--will benefit significantly from rules designed to limit unfair Government subsidies to its overseas competitors in the commercial aerospace field.\n\tCompanies like Monsanto, Sprint, Hallmark, Leggett & Platt, and Ralston Purina will find it much easier to sell their products overseas, as well. The tens of thousands of Missourians who make up these companies, and the employees of the small Missouri businesses that supply them, will be the true beneficiaries as new jobs are created, and existing jobs become more secure due to increased worldwide sales.\n\tBut it is not just Missouri's large companies that will benefit from GATT. The growing world market will provide tremendous opportunity to the thousands of small companies across the state. As we enter the 21st century, we are truly entering a global economy, and all companies--large and small--will have to participate to survive. This agreement, which lowers tariffs worldwide and helps to level the playing field, only serves to make it easier for smaller companies to succeed.\n\tThe bottom line is that the U.S. economy is inextricably tied to the world economy. For that reason, we have to use our power and prestige as the largest market and most powerful economy to move the world toward more open and fair trade. That is the best way to ensure prosperity for the greatest number of Americans.\n\tHaving said that, I would hasten to add that in working for free and fair trade, we must be careful not to be played for patsies. We have the muscle to see that the game is played fairly and that our interests are protected. We must do that and, if we find that others are not playing by the rules, then we should retaliate or withdraw from the agreement.\n\tHaving considered all of the arguments before us, it is clear to me that this agreement makes sense for the United States. We will be the biggest beneficiary of its approval. For that reason, I will today support the budget waiver and passage of the implementing legislation, and I ask my colleagues to do so.\n\tMr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I do not see anyone else here on either side of the aisle to speak.\n\tThen, I might speak a bit to elaborate further on a point that I made.\n\tWhen we talk about world trade, there are two kinds of trade. One is in merchandise. Merchandise is what we might call goods--cars, refrigerators, jet airplanes, nuclear reactors, hard goods for lack of a better term. The other is services, insurance, credit cards, and tourism.\n\tThe United States is without question the world's leader in services. Take credit cards, for example--Visa, Master Charge, American Express. These are all American-centered companies, but they sell licenses throughout the world to provide these cards. The licensees pay money for the license and that money flows back to the United States. We are talking dollars, the same kind of dollars you get when you sell an airplane. It just happens to be a different kind of business.\n\tLast year, 1993, we had a $57 billion surplus in services--surplus, more coming in than going out.\n\tIn merchandise, the goods, the refrigerators, the cars, we unfortunately had a $116 billion deficit.\n\tNow we exported a lot last year. We exported almost $450 billion, but we brought in a lot more.\n\tSo the first question is, why? And I think I can guess why, although I cannot prove it.\n\tAt the end of World War II, we were the only major industrial country left that was relatively unscathed. Japan was devastated. Up until that time, Japan had not been a major factor in world trade anyway. Germany, devastated; France, devastated; Italy, devastated; Russia, which never had been a factor in world trade, and really not much of a factor today, devastated.\n\tSo, after World War II, we could sell almost anything we wanted in the world and there was a market. It really did not matter if they were good products or bad products; they were the only products. For years thereafter, we had a tremendous surplus in the merchandise trade sector, the goods sector. It may have been a Caterpillar tractor--and I might say Caterpillar today does very well. But it did not matter what it was, we sold it around the world. It did not matter if the merchandise was relatively shoddy; you either bought ours or you bought nothing.\n\tThe service industry, on the other hand, was an industry that almost did not exist at the end of World War II. I think most of the people listening to me today can remember an era when there were no credit cards, period, we did not have any; when insurance was by and large local. Other than the maritime industry, there were no large conglomerates of insurance companies selling insurance around the world.\n\tBut the whole business of services and high-tech goods like computers have really grown up only in the last 20 to 30 years.\n\tTake a company like Intel, which is the largest private employer in Oregon. The company was founded in 1969. It was not around during World War II.\n\tLook what happens when you are an older company--and this was true of the auto companies, true of the steel companies. They came out of World War II having produced tanks and steel and were the only one left in the world in business. They had no incentive to change, for one thing, and they had no competition for probably 20 years, up until the mid-sixties.\n\tTake cars, for example. The only foreign cars that were sold in this country of any consequence, probably until 1970, were those little Volkswagen beetles, which Germany developed in the mid-1950's. They had a small portion of our market, not a large portion. But they had a little cadre of people who liked the beetles--I liked the beetles--and they had sold a fair number. They did not have a large percentage of our market, but they had hard-core followers.\n\tThen there was also the big imported cars, the Mercedes, Rolls Royces, the very expensive cars. We did not make anything in this country comparable to the Rolls Royce. Therefore, there was a market for them. Again, a small market. They did not have a significant impact on our auto industry.\n\tIt was not until really the 1970's that two things happened. One was the Arab oil embargo and the sharp increase in the price of oil from about $3 a barrel to $12 a barrel in 1973-1974 and then again from roughly $12 a barrel to about $35 a barrel in 1979 and 1980. That pushed up our gasoline prices tremendously. It was almost coincidental that in about 1971 and 1972, the Japanese were starting to introduce into this country high-mileage, good, small cars. And I emphasize ``good.'' They were good. From the standpoint of repair and maintenance, they were a superior car to our small cars. It is probably coincidental that they were just hitting the market as the oil stock and the gasoline prices went up. The result was Americans flocked to these cars in droves.\n\tI can remember when we first passed the mileage standards in this country which required cars to get to a certain minimum mileage each year. There was tremendous opposition from the American auto industry to these standards. They had two arguments. One, it would take them 5 to 7 years to develop that kind of car and get it on the market; two, Americans did not want those kinds of cars anyway.\n\tWell, 5 to 7 years, this from an industry that in 6 months went from cars to tanks in World War II. And pretty good tanks. We did not get really into the war until Pearl Harbor and by the summer of 1942 we were turning out tanks instead of cars and turning them out in droves.\n\tBut the argument the Americans did not want these kind of cars was just fallacious. We wanted cars that got good gas mileage. Amazingly, we liked good cars. We liked cars that were dependable and that did not take a lot of repair.\n\tThe Japanese stole the market from us. Wrong word; we gave it away; gave it away.\n\tNow, to their credit, American manufacturers are now catching up. The Japanese are building cars in this country. I think it will only be another 4 to 5 years until they build more cars here for the American market than they import from Japan. But Ford, GM, and Chrysler are now turning out superior cars, every bit as good as the Japanese, cheaper than the Japanese, as good mileage as the Japanese, and Americans are buying them.\n\tBut it took competition over 20 years to force American manufacturers to catch up.\n\tIf you read the Wall Street Journal yesterday, you will note that steel has also caught up. Steel went through the doldrums in the 1970's and 1980's. It could not compete with the low-wage Japanese, could not compete with the Koreans. Today we are the lowest cost producer of steel in the world. We are competitive every where. But it took us a long time to catch up.\n\tHaving said all that, what is going to happen and what can we do to narrow this terrible trade deficit we keep hearing about?\n\tFirst, when you calculate the trade deficit, you have to take the merchandise deficit, our deficits in the cars, VCR's, and television, and, against that, offset the services surplus. Our trade deficit for 1993 is about $60 billion when you offset the surplus of services against the merchandise deficit.\n\tOf that $60 billion, $44 billion is oil, imported oil; $43 billion is imported cars. You get rid of just those two items, cars and oil, and we have a total trade surplus. I should point out, however, that the deficit in cars is starting to shrink.\n\tNow I will pose the question what we should do about oil. I am indebted to the Library of Congress for this information. I have to say, the Library of Congress' Congressional Research Service is the greatest research organization in the world. I would not trade them for all the rest of the research organizations put together. I only put them on this issue yesterday to see if they could find out if what I thought was probably true is, and they verified that it is true.\n\tNow, I am going to make a bold statement. We import oil because it is cheaper than making oil in this country out of coal. What do I mean by that?\n\tThis country has a cornucopia of natural resources. Japan has no natural resources, no oil, no coal, no natural gas, and no great rivers to dam up to make electricity. They have to import all of their energy. This country has a cornucopia of energy. We have a 400-year supply of coal. We have a 200-year supply of oil shale. If you count all of North America, including Canada and Mexico--and I will add that we are all involved now in this North American Free-Trade Agreement--there is more natural gas than we know what to do with and we are finding more than we are using. But we are short of oil, crude oil, the kind you bring out of the ground in liquid form.\n\tI say we are short. I am not sure, because every time we think we might find some oil, we just have a devil of an environmental argument as to whether we should look for it in Prudhoe Bay or in the Outer Continental Shelf. Should we drill? Should we even do experimental drilling to see if oil is there? The answer from the environmental community very often is no. We do not want to look because, if we look, we might find, and if we find, then somebody may want to bring it out. So we import it instead.\n\tBut let us assume for the moment there is no oil there. What could we do? It is what South Africa did for the better part of 30 years, because their government had a trade boycott against it and they could not buy oil of any quantity overseas. Well, South Africa, which is, again, a country rich in natural resources, took to making gasoline out of coal. You can do it. Transform the coal into oil, transform the oil into gasoline. It is expensive, but it can be done.\n\tI asked the Library of Congress yesterday and they gave me the answer today, could we make coal into oil in this country? Do we have enough coal? The answer is, yes, we have more coal than we know what to do with. Could we turn the oil into gasoline? Yes. Is it much more expensive? Yes, it is much more expensive. How much? And I said put it in terms that are understandable to me, the layman. They answered that, if we were to take our coal, turn it into oil, turn the oil into gasoline, the equivalent price of gasoline, in their estimate, would be $3 to $4 a gallon, instead of what we currently pay. In addition, all other oil prices would go up equivalently. Whatever you pay for fuel oil, whatever you pay for oil to turn the generators to produce electricity, all throughout the economy, you would have these price increases and inflation. But we could get rid of the $44 billion trade deficit in oil.\n\tNow, the question is: Do we want to do that?\n\tCoal is a problem. Coal burns dirty. It takes a lot of money to burn coal clean. If you are going to turn it into oil it is a lot more expensive and a lot dirtier than just pumping it out of the ground. But if we are so all-fired worried about this trade surplus, would we be willing to get rid of $44 billion of it by making our own oil out of coal? If you say to the American public: Yes, this trade deficit is so bad that I think we should have gasoline at $3 to $4 a gallon, we should have fuel oil for our homes, at whatever the equivalent increase will be, we ought to have the inflation it will bring, and the increase in bond prices and mortgage interest rates that come with inflation, we are willing to have all of that to get rid of this $44 billion deficit--that is a fair debate, whether or not we want to trade that off. We should not say we cannot do it. South Africa did it. Japan cannot do it. They do not have the resources.\n\tI am going to predict what is going to happen over the years. I do not think we are going to turn to making oil out of coal. However, our services sector is the fastest growing segment in all of the industrial countries of the world. We keep hearing that our manufacturing base has disappeared. It has not disappeared. It has become more productive. I count agriculture as one of our industrial bases. It is a separate category but it is very capital intensive. We put more money per person into farm equipment and farming than we do any other industry.\n\tAt the turn of the century it took about one farmer to produce food enough for seven people. Today one farmer produces enough food for about 82 to 83 people. I would wager by the turn of the century one farmer in this country will produce enough food for 100 people. That is a tremendous increase in productivity. It is expensive.\n\tA new combine for cutting wheat costs between $145,000 and $150,000. A new tractor to pull that combine is about $130,000. Yet, with that combine and that tractor and a lot of other expensive equipment that goes with it, a husband and wife and a couple of kids and a hired hand can farm a multithousand-acre wheat farm successfully and compete anyplace in the world. That is the situation in agriculture.\n\tThe same thing that has happened in agriculture has happened in automobile manufacturing and steel manufacturing--especially for the last 20 years we have gotten so much better at it that we can turn out more cars with fewer people, more steel with fewer people. We have learned how to become more  productive. It is not that we are producing fewer cars. When people say we have lost our industrial base--we have not lost our base. We are producing more cars with fewer people, more steel with fewer people. We are producing more wheat with fewer people. That is also true in Germany. Not in their agricultural sector which is heavily subsidized and inefficient, but it is true in Germany for steel. It is true in Japan in cars. It is true in all of the industrialized countries of the world. Their manufacturing sector, in terms of manufacturing employment in relation to their total employment, is shrinking. The number of employed stays about the same but their production increases tremendously and the number of employees in manufacturing in relation to the number of employees in services gets smaller and smaller as a percentage because it is the service industry that is growing. And it is the service industry that we are the best at.\n\n\tExample: 5 years ago the trade surplus in services was $25 billion. Five years later it is $57 billion. I will make a bet 5 years from now it will be $100 billion in our favor. And the merchandise deficit will go down. There will be an irreducible minimum in my judgment below which it cannot go if we do not do something about oil. If we want to continue to import oil, I do not know if we will ever get to a trade balance in merchandise, no matter how hard we try. But to the extent we can make up that deficit in merchandise with a surplus in services there is nothing wrong with that. Credit cards are not un-American. Insurance is not un-American.\n\tWe have almost a death wish fascination with manufacturing, that somehow you cannot be a great country unless you are the world's greatest producer of things: Steel, autos, refrigerators, locomotives. You cannot be a great country because you are the best producer of these little computer chips. I held up one yesterday. Intel--I will give an example. I mentioned Intel once before. Intel is the largest private employer in Oregon. It is a company that was founded in 1969. When I was elected to the Senate in 1968, this company did not exist. They are now investing close to $2 billion in Oregon--about $700 million to expand an existing plant and about $1.2 billion to build a new plant and turn out computer chips. They are now the world's largest manufacturer. They have overtaken the Japanese. They are outselling the Japanese around the world. These are chips for export--this counts as services--export.\n\tHow can Intel compete with Bangladesh? Oregon is a relatively high-wage State and a relatively high-tax State.\n\tDo you know what the answer is? And this is true of all of the high-tech industries. You ask them what are your floor labor costs? By floor labor they mean the production laborers, the hands-on workers, not the research and development which they do not plan to move anyplace, nor their management. How much of a percent of your total cost is your floor labor? Seven percent. Eight percent. They are not going to move to Bangladesh where they can pay somebody 50 cents an hour when labor is 7 percent of the total cost anyway.\n\tIt is much more critical to them that they have good transportation to get their products around the world. It is more critical to them they have a clean atmosphere. I was in their plant not 2 months ago and you ought to see it now, what they call the clean room. When I started my business a clean room was a white smock. In their clean room today you would swear you were looking at something out of Star Wars. People clothed almost like an astronaut on the Moon. Their breath being monitored through a tube and through a recirculator on their backs so that their breath does not get on the chips that are being made.\n\tImmense temperature control equipment to keep these rooms almost at a perfectly even temperature. They would have to have these things in Bangladesh, and they cost just as much to put them in Bangladesh as here. Bangladesh does not make machines like that. They are not going to move to Bangladesh.\n\tSo, can we compete? You bet we can compete. And the things that we will compete at best are very frankly the things that have the lowest percentage of labor cost to total cost. I did not say lowest labor cost. Lowest percentage of labor cost to total cost. Those things that have a high labor cost we may not be able to compete in.\n\tOne of those is low-end apparel. I do not mean high-cost apparel. I think even in this country we can compete in apparel made here that is very expensive apparel, but can we compete making a $1.99 T-shirt or a cheap men's suit when we have not yet learned how to automate the making of a man's suit? I doubt it.\n\tJapan learned that lesson 20 years ago. Thirty years ago, Japan was in the top five in the world in the export of apparel and the export of textiles--apparel being the clothing and textiles being the cloth--30 years ago. Today I defy you to go to a clothing store, look at the garments, look at the ``where they are made'' tags, and see if you can find one that says made in Japan. Thailand--yes, Bangladesh--yes, Singapore--yes, Honduras--yes. Japan? No. Japan got out of the apparel business because they figured they do not compete. There was too much hand labor. Japan is still in the top five in the export of textiles. And the difference? Textiles is a highly capital-intensive business. By this I mean it needs machines run by relatively few people. And the machines, just like the Intel machines, cost a lot of money. They cost just as much to put them in Bangladesh, which does not make them, as it does to put them in Kyoto or Tokyo.\n\tJapan also realized something. If we are going to get Thailand to buy our television sets and pay us in yen, they have to be able to make something to sell us to get yen. Why do we not let them sell us apparel? If we want to sell Boeing 747's, General Electric and Westinghouse nuclear reactors, farm products--the biggest single item surplus that we have in our trade is agriculture. We have $19 billion surplus in agriculture. We are the world's best farmers without question. But if Mexico is going to buy wheat, or if Brazil is going to buy Westinghouse nuclear reactors, what are they going to pay us with? We want dollars.\n\tTo pay us, they have to sell us something that we give them money for, so they can buy back what we want to sell them. Mr. President, as sure as we are here we are going to win this battle because time and tide are on our side. In every country that is the big purchaser of anything, it is the services sector that is growing. That is the sector where we compete the best. In the merchandise sector we have become much more competitive than we were 20 years ago.\n\tOil is an ultimate problem and we have to make a decision there as to whether we would like to buy oil from Venezuela, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, at $15 to $16 a barrel--which is roughly what the price is today--and have a $40 billion to $50 billion trade deficit in oil, or whether we want to produce the oil here at the equivalent of anywhere from $32 or $33 to $45 a barrel, get rid of the trade deficit, and have gasoline at $3 to $4 a gallon. Because those are both fair considerations. But for anyone to say that America cannot compete is really saying: America, I do not want to compete.\n\tTo my fellow Senators, for better or for worse, we are in a competitive world. We may choose not to compete. We can put up the barriers. We can make all of our own clothing here, all of our own cars here, all of our own video cassette recorders here; sell nothing overseas and buy nothing overseas. Consumer prices will be higher. Products will be shoddier and America will be poorer. But we will not have to worry about competition.\n\tThere is an old saying, ``If you think you can or if you think you can't, you're right.'' If we think we cannot compete in the world, we will not compete. But if we think we can, then we will develop the Intels of the world and all of the equivalent companies that go with it, and we will master the world in trade.\n\tThe choice is ours, and the vote on the bill that is before us today is perhaps a more significant vote for or against competition, depending which way you vote, than any other vote we will make in this decade. I, for one, am going to opt on the side that America can compete; that we have not scratched the surface of what we can do in terms of competition in this world when we are pushed. This bill gives us not only the push we need but it also lowers barriers in markets overseas that we need to get into. We will never have a better opportunity to improve this country.\n\tI thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\tMr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). Who yields time?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I yield 11 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South Carolina for 11 minutes.\n\tMr. THURMOND. Mr. President, yesterday during debate on this issue, I outlined my opposition to waiving the budget agreement to pass this bill. Today, I would like to summarize some of the other parts of the GATT implementing legislation that concern me.\n\tBefore elaborating on the GATT agreement, I would like to take a moment to talk about how those who oppose this measure have been characterized. It has been said that we are against trade; that we are isolationists and protectionists. As far as this Senator is concerned, nothing could be further from the truth. I support trade because it helps increase our employment and provides economic growth. I have worked to support efforts which expand our country's exports. However, our trade with foreign manufacturers who are subsidized by their Governments and who have primitive labor laws and ridiculously low wages. Unfortunately, the agreement before us does not address these issues and, therefore, places our workers at a major disadvantage in the global marketplace. Consequently, I cannot support the passage of this bill.\n\tIn addition, Mr. President, significant problems exist that are associated with this agreement which go beyond the pure trade provisions of the pact.\n\tFor instance, a major concern that I have with this agreement is the establishment of a new international body, called the World Trade Organization, known as WTO. This supranational bureaucracy will adversely affect the sovereignty of our Nation.\n\tThe WTO establishes a ministerial conference and a general council. The ministerial conference will meet every 2 years and receive decisions on matters covered by trade agreements. The general council will govern the WTO on a daily basis. The dispute settlement body, which will be established under the general council, will be the ultimate arbitrator of trade disputes. The decisions handed down by the WTO will be voted on by the member countries.\n\tEach country gets one vote regardless of the population or the value of trade by a country and, unlike in the United Nations, the United States will not have a veto power over WTO decisions. Further, the United States will finance up to 20 percent of the budget for operating the WTO.\n\tThe WTO will be the arbitrator of trade disputes between signatory countries. By adopting this bill, we will allow our trade disputes to be settled behind closed doors by bureaucrats that are accountable to no one. Let me quote what Ralph Nadar said in testimony before the Senate Committee on Commerce about how the WTO will work:\n\n       This is a tribunal in which three trade specialists preside \n     over a totally secret deliberative process. The press is \n     excluded. Nongovernmental organizations are excluded. All \n     citizens are excluded, State attorneys general are excluded. \n     Only representatives of national governments that are parties \n     to a dispute are given a role. Furthermore, all submissions, \n     all briefs and materials that must be open in our courts, can \n     be kept secret.\n\n\tMr. President, we should not let trade disputes be settled by secretive panels of specialists who are accountable to no one. I want to repeat that. We should not let trade disputes be settled by secretive panels of specialists who are accountable to no one. Our country was founded on a principle of openness. Our Senate proceedings are open to public scrutiny. We have sunshine laws that require us to have an open and accountable Government.\n\tAt the very least, if the United States is to consider entering into the WTO, then this matter should be considered as a treaty. Article 16, paragraph 4 of the GATT agreement states that ``each member shall ensure the conformity of its laws, regulations, and administrative procedures with its obligation as provided in the GATT.'' By changing our laws to satisfy this supranational trade organization, we are giving away our power to make our own laws. By definition, sovereignty is the ability of a country to make and enforce its own laws. When the WTO rules against us and then tells us to change our laws, we are losing our rights as a country.\n\tOne argument used to justify the WTO is that other countries would not impose harsh penalties against the United States since we have such a lucrative marketplace. However, I do not think any of us can really be sure how the developing nations of the world, which account for 83 percent of the WTO membership, will vote when a situation arises. During 1993, more than three-quarters of the WTO members voted against the United States and the other G-7 countries on at least half of the votes on matters before the United Nations. What makes us think that they will not vote against us in trade related matters?\n\tMr. President, those of us who were serving in the Senate during the Tokyo round of GATT talks have heard many of the same arguments that the Clinton administration is currently making in regard to this agreement. The claims regarding the Uruguay round are strikingly familiar to those made by the Carter administration at the close of the Tokyo round talks in the late 1970's. At that time, we were told that the bold new steps which were incorporated into the Tokyo round were needed to eliminate our trade deficit and to make America more competitive in the global marketplace. Yet, history and our trade deficit show that the exact opposite happened. After implementation of the Tokyo round, the United States trade deficit grew from $14 billion in 1979 to over $115 billion for 1993. Further, we saw a major decline in the viability of the steel, textile and apparel, and electronics industries. These industries have struggled to survive in spite of the closed markets that they encountered in other countries.\n\n\tMr. President, in my travels around the State of South Carolina, I get the opportunity to talk to many people. My constituents voice concerns about where our country is headed. They realize that they are working longer, but their hard work is not showing up in their paycheck. Wages are stagnant. They are fearful that their jobs are going to be exported. With this fear comes the loss of hope that they will ever be able to improve their economic status in the current environment.\n\tAccording to Department of Labor statistics, no single U.S. job has been created in industries exposed to world trade for more than 20 years. Every job created has been in areas that do not face foreign competition, such as health care and retail sales.\n\tDuring this debate, many proponents of this agreement will use the argument that for each $1 billion of goods exported, 20,000 jobs are created. I would then ask how many jobs are lost for each billion dollars worth of merchandise trade deficit that the United States incurs? Using the same 20,000 jobs and with our current trade deficit of over $160 billion in 1994, our country could lose over 3 million jobs this year. As I previously stated, with the last GATT agreement, our trade deficit has continued to climb. I doubt that this trend is going to magically reverse itself with the passage of this bill.\n\tMr. President, I urge my colleagues to carefully study this agreement before deciding to disregard our budgeting procedures and eroding our sovereignty to accept the dubious benefits of this agreement. Further, I would ask that they not vote to approve this trade agreement.\n\tMr. President I ask unanimous consent that related materials be printed in the Record.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                               September 14, 1994.\n     President Bill Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As advocates for openness in \n     government, we would like to register our deep concern about \n     the dispute settlement process proposed as part of the World \n     Trade Organization agreement. As it now stands, this proposal \n     is riddled with provisions denying access to government \n     deliberations that are an affront to the democratic \n     traditions of this nation.\n       This unprecedented secrecy is particularly offensive, given \n     the vast powers to punish and penalize that this body will \n     hold, not over just the federal government, but state and \n     local ones, too. Maximum access should be required in this \n     dispute resolution process for the following reasons:\n       (1) The proposed process would have the power to determine \n     the legality of a wide variety of laws at the local, state \n     and federal levels, although officials from all levels would \n     not be able to take part in the deliberations.\n       (2) The deliberations affect not only trade issues, but \n     consumer, worker and environmental protections as well.\n       (3) Penalties exacted in this process could be severe.\n       We urge you to insist that signatories to this agreement \n     understand that when state and federal laws are subjected to \n     an international authority to the extent proposed in this \n     document, that citizens of the United States have a \n     constitutional right to access to those deliberations. Here \n     are some of the secrecy and confidential provisions of the \n     agreement that we hope will be revised to conform with \n     democratic practices and traditions:\n       (1) The public and press should be able to monitor \n     deliberations of the dispute settlement panels. Under the \n     present proposal, those sessions would be closed to both the \n     public and the press.\n       (2) Documents presented during panel deliberations should \n     be made available to the public as they are in the U.S. \n     judicial proceedings. The decisions of the panels in this \n     process have the force of law, with serious penalties for a \n     non-complying nation, yet the only concession to demands for \n     openness on this point has been a proposal to provide a \n     summary of this information. That falls far short of the \n     public's needs in such critical matters.\n       (3) The American public's First Amendment right to petition \n     the government should be made a part of this proposed \n     agreement. As it stands, there are no means of direct input \n     from the people, no right of public comment or amicus briefs.\n       (4) Provision should be made for conflict-of-interest \n     disclosure requirements. As the proposal stands, there is no \n     way for the public to determine whether panelists deciding an \n     issue have economic or other interest in that matter. You may \n     recall that the NAFTA dispute settlement panel operates like \n     the one proposed for the WTO, and during a recent timber \n     subsidy case between Canada and the United States it was \n     discovered belatedly that two attorneys on the panel worked \n     for the Canadian lumber industry.\n       (5) Documents relating to appeals of WTO panel decisions \n     should be made public. Under the current proposal, all of the \n     appeal process is conducted in secret.\n       The First Amendment advocates whose names appear below take \n     no position, as a group, on the World Trade Organization \n     agreement itself. Some may support it, others may oppose and \n     still others may be undecided. But all of us, as a group, \n     urge you and your negotiators to restore democratic openness \n     to this crucial process. To do otherwise would break a sacred \n     pact with the American people.\n           Sincerely,\n       Paul K.

The terms of this Agreement raise serious \n     questions about the plight of children in many nations placed \n     in factories and fields under regrettable conditions.\n       Child labor may be cheap, and an international marketplace \n     which functions solely based upon price competition may allow \n     those who most use child labor to have a concomitant market \n     advantage. Such an advantage drives others into similar \n     practices in order to reduce their costs and preserve \n     marketplace. Unless major consuming nations refuse to buy \n     products produced by inappropriate child labor, or \n     international compacts preclude it effectively, competition \n     will drive producers down to the lowest common cost \n     denominator. That may well mean child labor as a \n     competitively pressured alternative.\n       In some parts of the world, child labor already means \n     irreparable harm to children. While work is also a part of \n     growing up, some children are now forced into sweat shops \n     which may approximate the worst abuses of slavery. Many are \n     deprived of the lost opportunities that an education can \n     bring. Most lose the simple joys of childhood as we have \n     known them.\n       One counterforce has been the possibility of rejection of \n     products produced by abusive child labor practices by \n     consuming nations, particularly the United States. Nations \n     can, individually or collectively, set standards to assure \n     the protection of children from cruelty and abuse, and \n     enforce them with potent pocketbooks.\n       But the Congressional Research Service has recently opined \n     in writing that a national statute which bars purchase of \n     products based upon child labor abuses would be \n     ``inconsistent with GATT articles prohibiting quantitative \n     restrictions on imports * * * and that, further, it may be \n     difficult to justify a ban under GATT exceptions.'' \n     [Congressional Research Service, American Law Division, \n     Report to Hon. Tom Harkin, July 15, 1993] The Report \n     indicates that the GATT drafters did not consider child labor \n     issues in the draft agreement now pending.\n       As advocates for children within the United States, we are \n     concerned about long standing child labor abuses within many \n     nations selling products. We do not support the reward of \n     child labor exploitation by American purchase. If an \n     international treaty binding the United States does not \n     reliably protect children, we would hope that our nation \n     would not surrender its sovereign right to do so.\n       Thus far, the debate on GATT has not involved substantial \n     consultation with those of us who focus professionally on the \n     status of children. We have not had an opportunity to debate \n     fully the momentous implications of this measure as it \n     affects children. We need the time and opportunity to do so.\n       We ask that you not vote precipitously on a measure with \n     such far reaching and potentially permanent implications \n     without opportunity for full debate, particularly as to \n     issues affecting children.\n           Very sincerely,\n     Robert C.

Before U.S. consumer, labor and environmental \n     protection laws and sovereignty are gambled away to the whims \n     of a secretive, undemocratic tribunal in Geneva, the U.S. \n     public, the press, and Congress should look behind those \n     promises. Let's consider five of the predictions:\n\n\n          how treasury created $200 billion in gatt gdp gains\n\n       The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) will increase by $153 \n     billion in the tenth year alone of the Agreement, according \n     to the U.S. Treasury Department. To calculate that $153 \n     billion, Treasury started with ``static gains'' of $88 \n     billion, based on economic models that took for granted \n     improved allocation of resources as a result of GATT. Never \n     mind that most of the model-based estimates were computed \n     before the Agreement was concluded and the final terms known, \n     or that the models assumed full employment and perfect \n     competition. Next, Treasury added $27 billion in ``guesses'' \n     about the GDP impact of nontariff and service trade \n     agreements, an $11 billion estimate for so-called ``model \n     aggregation'' from the Administration's chief GATT \n     cheerleader, $11 billion from the industries most likely to \n     benefit from intellectual property rules in the Agreement, \n     and, to appease the U.S. GATT negotiators, $11 billion for an \n     ``improved'' dispute resolution system. The fantasy was \n     topped off with $53 billion in ``dynamic gains,'' the latest \n     euphemism for supply-side economics. Even the Council of \n     Economic Advisors couldn't swallow the lofty total and \n     demanded a ``cushion'' of a negative $55 billion. (Other \n     estimates range as low as $7 billion in GATT-related GDP \n     gains for the entire first 10 years of the Agreement.)\n\n\n               gatt is no $744 billion worldwide tax cut\n\n       This Agreement will create a $744 billion worldwide tax \n     (tariff) cut over the next 10 years, according to the U.S. \n     Treasury Department. The estimate assumes that all Uruguay \n     Round reductions in tariff and nontariff barriers would take \n     effect immediately. In fact, the decreases would be phased in \n     over a 10 year period. Additionally, the Administration \n     counts as GATT cuts, tariffs that are lowered or removed as \n     the result of unrelated and unaffected agreements such as \n     NAFTA. According to the Economic Policy Institute, adjusting \n     for these two errors brings the tariff cut down to $200 \n     billion, or $3.51 per person per year. The actual cut is even \n     less than $200 billion because the calculations ignore tariff \n     increases that are part of the Uruguay Round Agreement. Even \n     Treasury admits that some of the benefits of tariff cuts will \n     not be passed on to consumers, but will simply line corporate \n     coffers.\n\n\n     88 percent of gatt funding is unrelated to international trade\n\n       The $12 billion in tariff income lost by the Treasury \n     during the first five years of the Uruguay Round cuts would \n     be offset with increases in revenue and reductions in \n     spending in other areas, according to the Senate Finance and \n     House Ways and means committees. More than half of those \n     offsets generate no money to replace the real dollar tariff \n     losses, but instead rely on accounting gimmicks and PAYGO \n     surpluses. For example, the Congressional committees claim \n     to have created $1.207 billion in additional revenues \n     simply by collecting excise taxes in September, before the \n     end of the fiscal year, instead of October, when the taxes \n     would have been due. According to the Joint Tax Committee \n     of Congress, more than $2.5 billion in PAYGO balances (by \n     law intended to reduce the federal deficit) also will be \n     used to offset tariff losses. (PAYGO balances are \n     generated from past legislation that reduced expenditures \n     or increased revenues.)\n\n\n          ``no'' vote on gatt won't cause a stock market crash\n\n       Failure to ratify the implementing legislation will cause \n     the stock market to crash. Some GATT proponents have even \n     gone so far as to attempt to generate fear of a crash by \n     comparing GATT to NAFTA. They blame stock price decreases \n     prior to the November 1993 NAFTA vote solely on ``anti-\n     NAFTA'' events and increases on ``pro-NAFTA'' developments, \n     even though interest rates, inflation fears, and the release \n     of economic reports had an impact. At the time, a chief \n     technical analyst predicted, ``As soon as the NAFTA vote is \n     done, people will be back to worrying about quarterly \n     earnings and interest rates. The NAFTA vote is just an \n     emotional thing.'' The day after Congress passed NAFTA, stock \n     prices buckled in response to a big retreat in bond prices.\n\n\n             gatt dispute statistics refute kantor's claims\n\n       The U.S. wins 80 percent of the trade disputes deliberated \n     by GATT panels, according to U.S. Trade Representative Mickey \n     Kantor. In fact, the U.S. has won 80 percent of the time only \n     when the U.S. has accused other countries of GATT violations. \n     When other countries have charged that U.S.laws were GATT-\n     illegal, the U.S. has won a comparatively minuscule 21 \n     percent of the time. GATT disputes involving the U.S. have \n     tripled since 1980, compared to the previous fifteen years. \n     The EEC has recently published its Report on United States \n     Barriers to Trade and Investment, which will ``serve as a \n     means of monitoring US measures to implement the Uruguay \n     Round agreement.'' At risk are consumer protection rules of \n     the Food and Drug Administration, incentives for small and \n     minority-owned businesses, recycled content requirements, \n     restrictions on purchases of defense products from foreign \n     suppliers, etc.\n       The implementing legislation for the Uruguay Round is \n     scheduled for a vote in a lame duck session of Congress next \n     week. Under fast track rules, debate is limited and no \n     amendments may be proposed. The House has even adopted \n     special rules which allow no points of order (such as \n     challenging the use of PAYGO) to be raised. The Senate will \n     need to vote to override its balanced budget requirements. \n     Now's the time for the public, the press and Congress to \n     challenge the GATT proponents' numbers game. Otherwise, in \n     response to false promises and threats, U.S. sovereignty may \n     be surrendered to an international bureaucracy whose \n     operating procedures guarantee that consumer, labor and \n     environmental laws will be reduced to the lowest common \n     denominator.\n\n\n      potentially gatt-illegal senate bills of the 103rd congress\n\n       Following is a list of bills introduced in the 103rd \n     Congress that are particularly susceptible to successful \n     challenge under the proposed World Trade Organization if they \n     are signed into law. If WTO dispute panels ruled against the \n     measures, the United States would face a cruel choice: repeal \n     the WTO-illegal measure or pay trade sanctions. Just the \n     threat of such challenges would have a chilling effect on \n     legislative initiatives raised by federal and state \n     legislators.\n       Buy American bills: S. 1359 Intro. 8/4/93 by Leahy with \n     Harkin, Simon, Moseley-Braun, Wofford, Pryor, Kerrey, Baucus, \n     Johnston;

Since the U.S. trucking lobby likes the bigger \n     Mexican rigs that have a 175,000-pound ceiling, which image \n     do you think your rear-view mirror will reflect in a few \n     years?\n       As a governing regime, the WTO's 123 member-nations are \n     each given one vote. Two dictatorships can outvote the United \n     States, which has no veto. This is why the Bush \n     administration itself opposed this WTO idea before leaving \n     office in December 1992.\n       Remarkably, countries that mistreat their workers, \n     consumers and environment (including condoning brutalized \n     child labor) do not violate the GATT-WTO. But our country, \n     with more humane standards than many other countries, can be \n     charged at those secret tribunals with restricting trade.\n       That is why the proposed WTO is a ``pull-down,'' not a \n     ``pull-up,'' trade agreement.\n       Fifteen years ago, when the prior revision of GATT called \n     the Tokyo round was completed, Washington made similarly \n     inflated promises of more jobs for the United States.\n       Since then, our country has suffered from even larger \n     annual trade deficits, including a deficit in manufactured \n     goods.\n       Even with a cheap dollar, this year's deficit will exceed \n     $150 billion. That is exporting lots of American jobs from a \n     nation experiencing falling real wages for the past two \n     decades.\n       Congress should defeat the GATT-WTO and return it to Geneva \n     for renegotiation under democratic processes and ``pull-up'' \n     standards of prosperity.\n       This would also avoiding busting the federal budget and \n     overcentralizing unaccountable power in Geneva, and it will \n     prevent the foreign regulation of America.\n       This lame-duck Congress, with more than 90 defeated or \n     retiring job-seekers, needs to hear by next Tuesday from \n     concerned Americans, who may call their senators and \n     representatives at 202-224-3121.\nBrief Response to Some Senators Who Employ the Argument That the United \n       States Can Always Get Out of the WTO on Six Months Notice\n\n                            (By Ralph Nader)\n\n       Given the array of power pressing the Congress to get into \n     this World trade pact, consider the unlikelihood that we \n     would ever get the Congress to get out of this Pact. Giving \n     notice and getting out means surrendering 50 years of trading \n     rights with other nations. It is not going to happen in this \n     town.\n       Moreover, the U.S. cannot get out of parts of this Pact. \n     Article 16, Par. 5 of the agreement stipulates that no \n     reservations may be made in respect of any provision of this \n     agreement. The U.S. and all other nations are not permitted \n     any exceptions the way the old GATT (now operating) permits.\n       Therefore, if exiting the Pact is politically impossible, \n     can we fix the trade pact from inside--regarding the \n     autocratic secretive processes, the one-nation-one vote, no \n     veto etc? Can we amend this agreement given the way the \n     voting power is overwhelmingly stacked against the U.S. and \n     the supramajorities needed for such changes? We have less \n     than one percent of the vote, and shrinking as new large and \n     tiny countries are added to the rolls. Maybe someone can \n     explain how we can fix this agreement, as many Senators have \n     been saying, to try to minimize the disadvantageous \n     provisions that are in the text against the interests of the \n     American democracy and economy. Will any of these Senators \n     stand up and explain the practical points?\n       1. Can we really quit the WTO once we are in it?\n       2. Can we really fix the WTO, given the voting odds, once \n     we are in it?\n       3. And isn't it better to reject the WTO proposal (as a \n     prior Congress\\1\\ did when it was called the ITO and a \n     renegotiation occurred in 1947) and send it back to Geneva \n     for renegotiation while we have some bargaining power left. \n     For without the approval of Congress, the Pact would have to \n     be renegotiated--our major trading partners have acknowledged \n     this reality.---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\Congress did not actually vote to reject; its members \n     signalled that the ITO would not be accepted.

Who seeks recognition?\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Iowa.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\tMr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for yielding this time. I may not take all of that.\n\tI just wanted to state for the record that since 1975 when I first entered the House of Representatives I have worked assiduously and tirelessly on behalf of human rights. The first amendment dealing with human rights and foreign policy was in fact an amendment I offered in 1975 in the House of Representatives.\n\tI do not believe there is any more pressing issue regarding human rights in the world today than the exploitive and abusive use of child labor, whether it is in manufacturing, mining, textiles, rugmaking, shoes, et cetera. I have a bill pending in the Senate which I will introduce again next year, S. 613, which basically would cut off the importation into this country of any items that are made by child labor.\n\tFor the record, on September 23, 1993 the U.S. Senate went on record unanimously with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution supporting that legislation. That was just about a year ago. I will read the resolution. It says:\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the economic exploitation of children, especially the \n     practice of bonded child labor should be strongly condemned;\n       (2) it should be the policy of the United States to not \n     allow the importation of products made by children who are \n     employed in industry or mining; and\n       (3) the President should take action to seek an agreement \n     with governments that conduct trade with the United States \n     for the purpose of securing an international ban on trade in \n     products made with child labor.\n\n\tMr. President, that was just over a year ago when the Senate went on record with that resolution. Last year, I funded through my Subcommittee on Appropriations a study by the Department of Labor of those industries and countries that use exploitive child labor. Nineteen of our trading partners were identified. The study documented some of the more serious abuses of child labor. There are more than 19 countries involved in abusive child labor practices. But that was the limit of the study.\n\tThe documentation is irrefutable--millions of children 8 to 14 years of age, bonded labor, working 10 to 12 hours a day 6 to 7 days a week for mere pennies. The facts are clear that as international corporations seek low-wage workers they push down the cost of labor to the lowest level. The lowest level, obviously, is slavery. But since we do not sanction slavery in any country, and to utilize slavery would make a country a pariah, slavery is not utilized.\n\tThe next rung up is prison labor. We do not allow prison labor either. As the distinguished Senator from Nebraska said a few moments ago--I repeat what he was said, it was very, very good--we protect criminals but we do not protect the kids. We do not allow the products of prison labor to come in but we do of children. So we protect criminals but we do not protect the kids. What an odd set of circumstances.\n\tSo we have a situation that we have to address. Again, what is happening is that so many of these products are now produced overseas.\n\tI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, an article from Harper's magazine, August 1992, entitled ``The New Free-Trade Heel.''\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Harper's magazine, August 1992]\n\n\tThe New Free-Trade Heel--Nike's Profits Jump on the Backs of Asian \n                                Workers\n\n                         (By Jeffrey Ballinger)\n\n       Her only name is Sadisah, and it's safe to say that she's \n     never heard of Michael Jordan. Nor is she spending her \n     evenings watching him and his Olympic teammates gliding and \n     dunking in prime time from Barcelona. But she has heard of \n     the shoe company he endorses--Nike, whose logo can be seen on \n     the shoes and uniforms of many American Olympic athletes this \n     summer. Like Jordan, Sadisah works on behalf of Nike. You \n     won't see her, however in the flashy TV images of freedom and \n     individuality that smugly command us to JUST DO IT!--just \n     spend upward of $130 for a pair of basketball shoes. Yet \n     Sadisah is, in fact, one of the people who is doing it--\n     making the actual shoes, that is, and earning paychecks such \n     as this one in a factory in Indonesia.\n       In the 1980s, Oregon-based Nike closed its last U.S. \n     footwear factory, in Saco, Maine, while establishing most of \n     its new factories in South Korea, where Sung Hwa Corp. is \n     based. Sung Hwa is among many independent producers Nike has \n     contracted with. Nike's actions were part of the broader \n     ``globalization'' trend that saw the United States lose \n     65,300 footwear jobs between 1982 and 1989 as shoe companies \n     sought non-unionized Third World workers who didn't require \n     the U.S. rubber-shoe industry average of $6.94 an hour. But \n     in the late 1980s, South Korean laborers gained the right to \n     form independent unions and to strike. Higher wages ate into \n     Nike's profits. The company shifted new factories to poorer \n     countries such as Indonesia, where labor rights are generally \n     ignored and wages are but one seventh of South Korea's. (The \n     Sung Hwa factory and others like it are located in Tangerang, \n     a squalid industrial boomtown just outside Jakarta.) Today, \n     to make 80 million pairs of shoes annually, Nike contracts \n     with several dozen factories globally, including six in \n     Indonesia. Others are in China, Malaysia, Thailand, and \n     Taiwan. By shifting factories to cheaper labor pools, Nike \n     has posted year after year of growth; in 1991 the company \n     grossed more than $3 billion in sales--$200 million of which \n     Nike attributes to Jordan's endorsement--and reported a new \n     profit of $287 million, its highest ever.\n       The words printed on the pay stub are in Bahasa Indonesia, \n     a language created by fusing Roman characters with a dominant \n     Malay dialect. The message, however, is bottom-line \n     capitalism. ``Per hari'' is the daily wage for seven and a \n     half hours of work, which in Sadisah's case is 2,100 \n     Indonesia rupiah--at the current rate of exchange, $1.03 per \n     day. That amount, which works out to just under 14 cents per \n     hour, is less than the Indonesian government's figure for \n     ``minimum physical need.'' A recent International Labor \n     Organization survey found that 88 percent of Indonesian women \n     working at Sadisah's wage rates are malnourished. And most \n     workers in this factory--over 80 percent--are women. With \n     seldom more than elementary-school educations, they are \n     generally in their teens or early twenties, and have come \n     from outlying agricultural areas in search of city jobs and a \n     better life. Sadisah's wages allow her to rent a shanty \n     without electricity or running water.\n       ``Pendapatan'' is the earnings column, and five lines below \n     the base pay figure for the month (50,400 rupiah) is one for \n     overtime. Sadisah and the other workers in this factory are \n     compelled to put in extra hours, both by economic necessity \n     and by employer fiat. Each production line of 115 workers is \n     expected to produce about 1,600 pairs of Nikes a day. \n     According to the column at left, next to ``OT (JAM),'' \n     Sadisah worked 63 hours of overtime during this pay period, \n     for which she received an extra 2 cents per hour. At this \n     factory, which makes mid-priced Nikes, each pair of shoes \n     requires .84 man-hours to produce; working on an assembly \n     line, Sadisah assembled the equivalent of 13.9 pairs every \n     day. The profit margin on each pair is enormous.\n       Here are Sadisah's net earnings for a month of labor. She \n     put in six days a week, ten and a half hours per day, for a \n     paycheck equivalent to $37.46--about half the retail price of \n     one pair of the sneakers she makes. Boosters of the global \n     economy and ``free markets'' claim that creating employment \n     around the world promotes free trade between industrializing \n     and developing countries. But how many Western products can \n     people in Indonesia buy when they can't earn enough to eat? \n     The answer can't be found in Nike's TV ads showing Michael \n     Jordan sailing above the earth for his reported multiyear \n     endorsement fee of $20 million--an amount, incidentally, that \n     at the pay rate shown here would take Sadisah 44,492 years to \n     earn.\n\n\tMr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Harper's magazine article shows the labor cost to manufacturing. For a pair of Nike's made in Indonesia, the cost of labor is 12 cents. They sell for $80 in the United States.\n\tI have here also an article about a rug made in Morocco. The 13-year old girl that made it got $19.34. It sold in Macy's for $499. That is a little better than the Nike shoe example but not much.\n\tI just want to read the last sentence of this article. It says quoting:\n\n       Someone in Morocco says we cannot compete with them in \n     India because in India they pay with a bowl of rice for two \n     rugs.\n\n\tSo that is really what is happening. Companies are bidding down the price of labor. And as they do that, since we do not sanction slavery or prison labor, the next rung up on that ladder is child labor. That is what is happening around the world today. It is becoming a more and more serious problem. It is not alleviated.\n\tI am hopeful that we can do something in this country to address the child labor issue. The only way we can do it is through our market system. We can say to those countries: If you are going to use child labor you will not have access to our markets. That kind of provision is not in the GATT agreement.\n\tI have had discussions with Ambassador Kantor and people within the administration. They say they are going to work in the WTO preparatory committee this month to establish a work program on child labor, labor rights. They are going to work with us to get a bill enacted regarding imports made with child labor. They are going to work with us to deal more effectively with child labor in the GSP, the Generalized System of Preferences, which will be up for reauthorization next year--covering 140 countries, many of them abusing child labor. That is where we ought to also attack this issue of the child labor in other countries. And they have promised to address child labor in future negotiations on regional trade agreements.\n\tMr. President, I do know that the U.S. must take the lead in reducing and ending exploitive and abusive child labor. Only we can do that because of our longstanding advocacy and support for human rights.\n\tMr. President, I also want to make a few remarks specifically on the budget point of order that is expected to be raised against this legislation later today.\n\tIn that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a letter signed on July 15, 1994 to the President, signed by 19 Members of the Senate, be made part of the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1994.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: We write to ask that you join us in \n     opposing any effort to waive provisions of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act for the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade (GATT) implementing legislation and avoid the \n     requirement that such legislation be fully funded.\n       Some of us support GATT, others of us oppose the agreement, \n     and still others of us have yet to make a decision, but we \n     are united in our concern about the precedent waiving the \n     provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act could set, \n     undermining our ability to make further progress in lowering \n     the deficit now and in the future.\n       We are confronted on a regular basis with having to make \n     tough decisions on worthy programs because of our budget \n     rules, and rightly so. The federal budget deficit must be \n     brought down.\n       That GATT is significant is clear, but the importance of an \n     issue should not determine whether or not it should conform \n     with the budget rules we have set for ourselves. Indeed, the \n     true test of our resolve to bring the deficit under control \n     is our willingness to apply the budget rules to the important \n     issues.\n       We recognize your commitment to passing GATT implementing \n     legislation. Your support for making that legislation comply \n     with the budget rules will be all the more meaningful because \n     of that commitment, and we hope you will join us in this \n     effort to oppose any effort to dodge this responsibility.\n           Sincerely,\n         Russ Feingold, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Chuck Grassley, \n           Jesse Helms, Dirk Kempthorne, Dale Bumpers, Strom \n           Thurmond, Larry Pressler, Dave Durenberger, Lauch \n           Faircloth, Larry E. Craig, Trent Lott, Robert F. \n           Bennett, David Boren, John Warner, Hank Brown, Byron L. \n           Dorgan, Alfonse D'Amato, Herb Kohl.\n\n\tMr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the letter sent on July 15, 1994 to the President was signed by 19 Members of the Senate saying that they oppose any GATT implementing bill requiring us to waive the budget rules to provide for deficit spending. I will read one sentence. It says:\n\n       Indeed, the true test of our resolve to bring the deficit \n     under control is our willingness to apply the budget rules to \n     the important issues.\n\n\tNow I understand that some of the people who signed the letter now say they are going to vote to waive the budget rules.\n\tI want to make it clear that I believe we ought not to be waiving the budget rules to provide for the GATT agreement.\n\tTherefore, I cannot and I will not vote to waive the budget rules to provide for deficit spending to enact the GATT agreement.\n\tThere is nothing wrong with bringing this agreement up next year when it should be brought up, once the funding is worked out. I believe that if we want to, if the people really want to enact a GATT agreement, we will find a way to raise the money, to cover the sum of $14.6 billion that we will increase the deficit by in the present GATT implementing bill.\n\tMr. President, I just do not see how Senators can waive the Budget Act to provide for deficit spending, to provide for the enactment of GATT this year. It should be done next year.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be allocated to each side accordingly.\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time not be allocated to either side.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, and the clerk will call the roll. The time will not be allocated to either side.\n\tThe legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n\tMr. MITCHELL. Am I correct in my understanding that unless otherwise agreed to, a quorum call is charged equally against all of those who now hold remaining time?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The quorum call is normally charged against the Senator putting in the quorum call. If a quorum call is not put in, it will be charged equally. Of course, that can be changed by unanimous consent as it was in this instance. In this instance there was a unanimous consent request asking that the quorum call not be charged to either side.\n\tMr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time of the quorum call be charged half to each side and proportionally on the Democratic side equally among the proponents and opponents.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe time will be charged as requested in the unanimous-consent request by the Senator from Maine.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Half to us and half to them; is that correct?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is correct.\n\tThe clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. BREAUX. Mr. President, a parliamentary inquiry.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state it.\n\tMr. BREAUX. I will ask the Chair to inform me of how much time this side has remaining.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The side has 1 hour and 2 minutes remaining.\n\tMr. BREAUX. Let me yield to the distinguished Senator from Florida 10 minutes.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\tMr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you. I appreciate my good friend and colleague from Louisiana yielding me time to make a brief comment on the matter which is before us.\n\tMr. President, I speak strongly in favor of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and hope that our colleagues will approve this historic agreement later today.\n\tI would like to talk about this issue from two perspectives. First, the perspective of my State of Florida, a major export State, and the benefits that it will derive particularly in the area of agriculture and, second, to the importance of this to relations within the Western Hemisphere.\n\tMr. President, yesterday there was a press conference held in the Capitol. ``Ag for GATT.'' Representatives of the major agricultural organizations in America stood together in support of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n\tAmerican farmers, as represented by those gathered yesterday, want to do what they are best able in the world to do, which is to produce food and sell it at competitive prices around the globe.\n\tGATT will help Florida farmers in three ways. First, it will increase access to foreign markets. Second, it will reduce export subsidies. Third, it requires countries to base their sanitary rules on sound principles of science.\n\tFlorida's $6 billion agricultural industry will benefit under the GATT. Florida is expected to gain from the Clinton administration's recent pledge of $600 million in additional funding for agricultural export programs which are acceptable under the GATT.\n\tAs a result of GATT, U.S. agricultural exports are projected to reach $4.7 billion by the year 2000, an increase of $1.6 billion from today. Agricultural exports are expected to reach $8.7 billion by the year 2005. The increased agricultural exports created by the GATT will create as many as 112,000 jobs--112,000 jobs--in the United States, Mr. President, by the year 2000, and 190,000 jobs by 2005.\n\tAs a specific example, GATT will greatly benefit Florida's citrus industry. The European Union, Japan, Korea, Switzerland and Thailand have all agreed to lower tariffs on various citrus products upon the passage of the GATT.\n\tMr. President, there have been considerable statements of concern made relative to the World Trade Organization and some of the powers it will have. I would concede that a consequence of the World Trade Organization is that the United States is going to be less sovereign in terms of its ability to control trade. But the same statement is made about every other country. They are giving up some of their sovereignty and we, Mr. President, have been the targets of some of the misapplication of other nations' economic sovereignty.\n\tAs an example, it was not very many years ago that there were boatloads of Florida citrus products, particularly grapefruits, tied up at a particular Pacific nation's ports, unable to be unloaded because that nation was holding that a particular form of treatment which these grapefruits had received, a treatment which is applied on a worldwide basis, did not meet their sanitary standards. There was no scientific basis for that country's sanitary standards. It was an economic effort to exclude from that market Florida grapefruit products. The consequence of that was that the boatload of grapefruit was lost, the economic gain was denied to our farmers, and access to those quality products was denied the citizens of that nation.\n\tIt is that type of abuse that the World Trade Organization provisions are intended to rectify.\n\tMr. President, this agreement will also be especially important to Florida and to our many other States which have substantial economic interests in what happens within this hemisphere, because the GATT will promote better trade opportunities among the countries of North and South America and the Caribbean. The potential for economic prosperity within this hemisphere has never been fully realized, even though Latin America is the only region of the world in which the United States currently enjoys a substantial trade surplus. Last year, we had about a $3.5 billion trade surplus with the Caribbean and South America. Prior to the break up of the Soviet Union, the United States looked upon Latin America and the Caribbean primarily as a security concern rather than an area of economic opportunity. Now that focus is changing.\n\tLast year, we passed the North American Free Trade Agreement. That is not a book, but rather a chapter in a much larger book of expanding economic relations within the Western Hemisphere. Next week, in Miami, the summit of the Americas will meet, the first time in over a quarter of a century that the heads of Government of all the Nations that are democratically ruled in this hemisphere will meet together. A principal topic of that meeting, Mr. President, will be economic expansion and the particular role which expanded trade will have in increasing the economic opportunities of all the people within this hemisphere.\n\tThe United States prospects for trade with the Caribbean and Latin America are good today, and with the passage of GATT will be better tomorrow.\n\tLatin America has a need for the technologically advanced products that the United States produces. In Mexico, for example, there are 7.3 telephone lines per 100 people. That compares to the United States which has 56.2 telephone lines per 100 people. We have a tremendous opportunity to meet those types of needs which not only will utilize U.S.-produced products, but will also help build a stronger economic infrastructure for our neighbors.\n\tThe fastest growing segment of U.S. trade with the Caribbean and Latin America has been in precision equipment, exactly the type of equipment which is necessary in order to enhance the economy of that region, while also producing jobs and opportunities in the United States. This meeting of an identifiable need has already resulted in a substantial increase in trade between the United States and the Caribbean and Latin America.\n\tThis year, Latin America, including Mexico, will buy 18 percent of U.S. merchandise exports. And, according to U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Mickey Kantor, Latin America will purchase 25 percent--25 percent--of all U.S. exports, totaling $232 billion by the year 2010.\n\tMr. President, within 15 years Latin America and the Caribbean will have a greater share of U.S. export than will Europe and Japan combined. That is the scale of the opportunity that is available to the United States through an invigorated economy in Latin America and the Caribbean and our ability to sell effectively into those stronger economies. The United States direct investment in Latin America and the Caribbean has tripled since 1986 and now accounts for 13 percent of all U.S. investment abroad. Latin America is the second-fastest-growing economic region in the world with a projected growth of an average of 5 to 6 percent a year over the next 10 years. Sales to Latin America increased by $48 billion between 1958 and 1993. This growth created 900,000 new jobs in the United States.\n\tAs Latin America becomes more prosperous economically, the demand for U.S. consumer goods will grow. The growing relationship between the United States and Latin America and the Caribbean can be reciprocal. While the United States responds to demands for products in Latin America and the Caribbean, that same region can assist in providing us with much needed natural resources.\n\tLatin American countries have recognized an opportunity for improved trade with the United States and have begun to dismantle barriers to trade and foreign investment. Latin American countries have lowered their tariffs on U.S. goods from an average of 56 percent just 9 years ago, to 15 percent last year. There is still room for improvement.\n\tAs tariffs remain higher in Latin America than in most developed nations, the GATT will further Latin American Governments' efforts to deregulate sectors of their economy, reduce subsidies in price controls, private state enterprises, establish antitrust and intellectual property regimes and institute democratic political reforms.\n\tMr. President, at this point I would like to indicate that it was only a matter of a few years ago that you could count on the fingers of your hand the number of democratic regimes in Latin America and the Caribbean. Today every nation in the Latin American and Caribbean region is a democracy, except for Cuba.\n\tSo, Mr. President, I say in summary that Latin America and the Caribbean are a significant but underappreciated sector for U.S. economic growth. The GATT will increase Latin America's economic prosperity and thus contribute to the economic prosperity of the United States and jobs for Americans.\n\tI urge the passage of the agreement.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Florida has expired.\n\tWho yields time?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\tMr. COHEN. Mr. President, the global economy is here and offers tremendous opportunities for us.\n\tI was encouraged to find at the two international trade conferences I held in Maine this year that there were literally hundreds of Maine businessmen and women who already are succeeding in the world economy. Most of these businesses are small and their export efforts often go unnoticed, but they are out there. I think it is important to help these small businesses to take full advantage of export opportunities. Small businesses simply do not have the resources to secure foreign sales on their own. The Federal Government, through its export assistance programs, has been helping and must continue to do so.\n\tAt issue today is the largest trade agreement in the history of the world. It is not something that can be approached lightly. It is complex and voluminous. Many legitimate questions have been raised.\n\tIn particular, as was just expressed by my colleague from Florida, there is great concern that the World Trade Organization could undermine U.S. sovereignty. And that allegation must be taken very seriously. Undoubtedly, the WTO will have more power than the existing GATT accord, and people understandably are concerned about the WTO's power. However, after careful consideration, I am not convinced that the WTO poses a threat to U.S. laws.\n\tThe only laws that could be challenged under the WTO are unfair and illegal trade barriers. The United States has nothing to fear under the WTO because it is other countries, not the United States, that have a record of enacting trade barriers thinly disguised as health or public safety laws. For instance, Japan has continually justified its ban on the United States rice imports on the grounds that our rice poses a threat to the health of Japanese population. Of course, this is a ludicrous argument. There is no evidence to support this outrageous claim, and the WTO would expose Japan's law for what it is--trade barrier masquerading as a health law.\n\tMoreover, it is important to note that the WTO does not have the authority to strike down U.S. laws, even if they are found to violate trade law. The WTO does not have powers like the U.S. Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court finds that a law violates the Constitution, that law is automatically declared void. The WTO, on the other hand, has no such power. The most severe action the WTO could take would be to impose fines on countries that refuse to take down their trade barriers. Again, since the United States is already the most open market in the world, we have little to fear from the WTO and much to gain if it can reduce trade barriers elsewhere in the world.\n\tFinally, the United States reserves the right to withdraw from the WTO at any time after providing 6 months notice. And Congress has the ability to vote once every 5 years as to whether or not we should remain in the WTO.\n\tI think, like others who have stood on the floor today and yesterday to express their reservations, that while there are areas certainly where the GATT could be improved, on balance, I think the agreement is in best long-term interests of American workers. Export-related jobs on average pay 17 percent more than other jobs. Therefore, we must encourage and take advantage of our export opportunities.\n\tThe principle goals of GATT are to open foreign markets to American goods and to lower tariffs by one-third.\n\tIn a very important way, the GATT agreement is really about shifting power from governments to individuals. By reducing tariffs, money that would have been coming to Washington will stay in the pockets of consumers. Furthermore, by reducing trade barriers, individuals--rather than governments--will decide where they buy their products from and where they sell them. The cornerstone of free trade policy is that individuals--not governments--should make consumer choices. I believe the GATT agreement makes significant progress in this regard.\n\tIn embracing GATT and the global economy, however, we must make help those for whom the new economy poses more of a challenge than an opportunity. Federal job training programs and other outreach efforts are essential to help those in need. The debate over free trade must never focus solely on the benefits to the Nation as a whole. We must also focus on those who are adversely affected by trade, because if trade policies do not in the long term benefit all Americans, there will be a tremendous backlash against efforts like GATT in the future.\n\tSo, Mr. President, I am supporting GATT today because I believe it will benefit American families over the long term, but I also intend to assure that we do not forget those who, as the result of freer trade policies, may be adversely affected.\n\tLet me just conclude by stating that I recently returned from a trip to Southeast Asia. To my colleagues, let me say: We are succeeding. We are penetrating markets. Barriers are coming down. Products made in Maine and elsewhere are now penetrating those markets that previously had been barred to United States and Maine-made products. So we are competing effectively. We are the most efficient, the most productive Nation in the world.\n\tIt seems to me if we want to continue to promote prosperity on a worldwide basis, from which we can only benefit, this is an agreement that we should support.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I thank my good friend from Maine very, very much. I am must confess when I talked with him yesterday I had some nervous trepidations, but I am delighted with his statement today. I thank him very much.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum and request we charge the time half to the Republican side and half to the Democrats.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. Who yields time? From whose time does the Senator from Indiana seek recognition?\n\tMr. LUGAR. I am a proponent of the bill, so I ask the manager who is managing that side to yield me time.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Indiana is yielded time from that of the Senator from Oregon.\n\tMr. LUGAR. Mr. President, there should be no doubt about the proper course of action for the Senate today: We should approve the Uruguay round trade agreements by an overwhelming margin. At a time when many people around the world are wondering aloud about the future of U.S. international leadership, we have today an opportunity--and an obligation--to reaffirm our leading role.\n\tThe Uruguay round will allow the United States to increase our exports by as much as $150 billion a year by 2004. It will boost economies worldwide, accelerating growth in both developed and developing economies.\n\tAmong the most significant achievements of the Uruguay round is the agreement on agriculture reached after 7 years of arduous negotiation. As incoming chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, I would like to point out to my colleagues that this agreement subjects agricultural trade to rules and disciplines which have been the norm for industrial products over many decades, but have been applied haphazardly, if at all, to trade in agricultural commodities.\n\tThe Uruguay round will require export subsidies to be cut by 36 percent in budget terms, and by 21 percent in terms of subsidized tonnage. This provision helps the United States because for most heavily subsidized commodities, we can export at a competitive price but our European rivals--the major practitioners of export subsidies--cannot.\n\tThe round will also require that import quotas be turned into equivalent tariffs. The resulting tariff levels--and indeed all other agricultural tariffs--must be reduced an average of 36 percent, with each individual tariff cut no less than 15 percent.\n\tFinally, the round also recognizes for the first time the trade-distorting potential of domestic farm subsidies, and provides new disciplines in this area. At the same time, countries will receive credit for cuts they have already made; in the United States, having indeed made some cuts, we will not be compelled by GATT to make more.\n\tThe U.S. Department of Agriculture projects a rise of up to $4.7 billion in exports by 2000, along with a gain of 112,000 new jobs and an increase of $1 billion in farm income. USDA's projections for the following 5 years are even more dramatic.\n\tMainstream American agriculture agrees. My colleagues have probably received a letter of support for the Uruguay round signed by an unusually large and diverse agricultural coalition: about 300 different companies, grower association, and other groups.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter and its signatories be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  AG for GATT,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 28, 1994.\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lugar: Very soon you will vote on the GATT \n     implementing bill, one of the most important pieces of \n     economic legislation since the end of World War II. Passage \n     of the bill will mean more U.S. exports, more American jobs, \n     lower taxes and a real stimulus to our economy. Defeat of \n     this bill would be nothing short of a victory for \n     protectionism both here and abroad.\n       The nearly 300 farm groups, associations and agricultural \n     businesses that make up the Ag for GATT coalition urge you, \n     in the strongest terms, to vote for the GATT and for a better \n     future for American farmers, ranchers and their allied \n     enterprises. With record or near record production of nearly \n     all farm products this year, we need the benefits that GATT \n     will bring to our sector and we need them now, not at some \n     unspecified time in the future.\n       Agriculture will benefit from expanded export markets, \n     lowered export subsidies and an improved ability to challenge \n     unfair foreign trade barriers. It is estimated that the GATT \n     agreement will increase U.S. farm exports by anywhere from $5 \n     billion to $14 billion per year by the end of the transition \n     period. It will also increase net farm income by over $1 \n     billion and create over 100,000 new jobs throughout the food \n     chain. Quite simply, without the GATT agreement, more farmers \n     will be forced to leave farming and government expenditures \n     in agriculture will rise.\n       The direct benefits to agriculture have been well-\n     documented. However, there are two other issues in the GATT \n     debate that we would like to address because they have \n     received a great deal of attention and because they have \n     agricultural implications.\n       The World Trade Organization and U.S. Sovereignty--American \n     agriculture has suffered under exiting weak and often \n     ineffectual GATT dispute settlement rules. We support the \n     improved enforcement of international trade commitments that \n     will come with the WTO. We would not support the agreement if \n     it weakened U.S. sovereignty and we are satisfied that it \n     does not.\n       The bill itself ensures that U.S. laws and regulations are \n     totally protected. Section 102 reads in part:\n       Relationship of Agreements to United States Law.\n       United States Law to Prevail in Conflict. No provision of \n     any of the Uruguay Round Agreements, nor the application of \n     any such provision to any person or circumstance, that is \n     inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have \n     effect.\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to amend or modify \n     any law of the United States, including any law pertaining to \n     the protection of human, animal, plant life or health, the \n     protection of the environment, or worker safety, or to limit \n     any authority conferred under any law of the United States . \n     . .\n       The Budget Issue--A vote against the budget waiver is a \n     vote against the GATT. If the budget waiver is rejected, \n     there will be no vote on GATT and all of the benefits to \n     agriculture from the GATT agreement will be lost.\n       It is essential to recognize that a vote for the waiver is \n     not a vote to increase the budget deficit. The GATT will \n     result in increased revenues to local, state and federal \n     treasuries, by stimulating economic growth and creating jobs. \n     In fact, rejecting the GATT could be a budget buster. In \n     agriculture alone there are a number of budgetary impacts \n     that are receiving little, if any, attention. For example, \n     without the new markets to be opened by the GATT agreement, \n     U.S. surplus farm production will cost the government more in \n     storage costs, higher deficiency payments and larger export \n     subsidies to continue the ag subsidy battle with the European \n     Union. These are just a few examples of how rejecting the \n     GATT could hurt, not help, efforts to reduce the budget \n     deficit.\n       The following organizations therefore, urge you to vote for \n     the budget waiver and for the GATT implementing bill, to help \n     American agriculture compete in world markets and in the \n     years to come.\n           Sincerely,\n

I thank the Chair. Mr. President, these groups state in their letter that Congressional approval of the Uruguay round ``is essential if U.S. agriculture is to remain a growth industry.'' They have put their finger on the key benefit of the round for U.S. farmers and agribusinesses: It will safeguard our future. That is because it will allow the United States agriculture and food industry to use its many comparative advantages: The ability to deliver products in large volumes; the ability to deliver commodities consistently year-round; cutting-edge plant and animal technology and research; the franchise value of many American fast-food firms; U.S. advantages in food packaging, manufacturing and marketing. At the same time, the Uruguay round will bring disciplines in an area where the United States does not have a comparative advantage: subsidies. Here, other countries seem more willing to transfer wealth from their national treasuries and their consumers to their farm sectors. The lesson for the United States is not to copy them, but to work for change in their policies so that our own market-based advantages will have a chance to work. The new GATT accords compel such changes and afford us just such an opportunity.\n\tFor my State of Indiana, the Uruguay round offers many benefits beyond agriculture. The agreement will reduce tariffs to zero or very low levels for important industries like steel, farm equipment and chemicals--basic American industries. It will afford new protection for the intellectual property of pharmaceutical companies, medical device makers and other firms in those allied industries. For insurance providers and other services within GATT disciplines for the first time, although more work remains to be done here. All in all, the agreement promises to be in the economic interest of Hoosier businesses, consumers, workers and farmers.\n\tI do want to express my concern about some of the budget offsets included by the administration in this bill. These provisions are not necessarily bad policy in every case, but they now come before the Senate without any opportunity for amendment, for deletion, or even for very much debate.\n\tAs one Senator, I wish we could have a more thorough debate on the merits of several of these revenue items: not only the ``pioneer preference'' and savings bond provisions that have been mentioned often in this debate and about which many of my colleagues have expressed concern, but the changes in pension law as well, which will have significant effects on some retirees.\n\n\tOn some of these topics, Senator Dole has obtained useful assurances, but I am more concerned about the state of the fast-track process generally. I believe this legislation illustrates that over the years, the fast-track privilege has come to be seen as a vehicle for side deals, special-interest accommodations and provisions of questionable merit--none of which can be changed once included in the implementing legislation, unless a Senator is prepared to defeat the entire agreement, which I certainly am not.\n\tWe will continue to need fast-track authority for future trade agreements, but our recent experience suggests we should make some changes when we renew this authority next year. First, we should set out clear negotiating objectives that must be met before any agreement can be submitted under the fast-track privilege.\n\tSecond, we should allow amendments to provisions of fast-track legislation that are included only to offset apparent budget costs of the trade agreement. In this way, Senators would be able to change revenue provisions they did not favor, or even delete them altogether. Since these provisions are typically unrelated to the substance of the trade agreement itself, there seems to me no compelling argument to give them absolute insulation against amendment. However, the total time for debate and amendment on a bill under fast-track procedures should continue to be limited.\n\tThird and finally, the President should be allowed to include in fast-track legislation only those provisions that are absolutely necessary to implement the agreement. Current law allows provisions that are ``necessary and appropriate,'' and in the real world the latter word constitutes an enormous loophole of which both the President and the Congress have taken full advantage.\n\tThese reforms will help build public confidence in our trade policy by opening up the fast-track process and making it exceedingly difficult to add special-interest provisions. It is essentially these aspects of the current process that have drawn the most criticism from members of the public. Significantly, much of the opposition to the Uruguay round has focused not the specifics of the agreement, where the United States clearly stands to gain, but on the allegedly closed and corrupt nature of the congressional fast-track process. Opponents have exaggerated much, but where they make legitimate points, we should not be afraid to make changes.\n\tAgain, I hope to work with my colleagues, especially those who serve on the Finance Committee, to introduce or join in the introduction of legislation incorporating the principles I have outlined. I welcome the reaction of my colleagues and the public to the changes I have suggested.\n\tWhatever the shortcomings of the fast-track process, they do not outweigh the manifest benefits of the Uruguay round for our economy. To raise questions about some aspects of this agreement is understandable; to reject it would be unthinkable. We should vote for it without hesitation, for it is a good agreement for the United States as we enter a new century in which our Nation must continue to lead.\n\tI will add, Mr. President, that I am heartened by reports that passage of this agreement today will lead to conversations involving the President of the United States, President Clinton, and President Frei of Chile. Chile, for a long time, has looked forward to either a free trade agreement with the United States or accession to the NAFTA treaty or to some other way in which the free trade principles espoused in both of our countries might be enhanced promptly. I am hopeful that stimulus and momentum will continue promptly.\n\tI commend President Clinton for that intent and, likewise, the patience of the Chileans who have waited a long time. I know the occupant of the Chair, who has been involved in many such conversations, will undoubtedly welcome that momentum also of a conference that will occur soon in his great State.\n\tI thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tMr. SIMPSON addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Graham). The Senator from Wyoming.\n\tMr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I ask that the quorum call might be deferred and I can go forward with my remarks. I thank my friend from Indiana.\n\tMr. President, I rise in support of the Uruguay round agreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT. This debate, much like the NAFTA debate, has been riddled with myth and misinformation. I have heard thoughtful arguments against GATT-- indeed I have--as well as for it. And I have also heard some alarms which seem to verge nearly on the hysterical. One would think that some of us are here preparing to bargain away our national sovereignty instead of trying to negotiate away foreign trade barriers. But sadly, that is the level of some discourse.\n\tI admire the people on both sides of this issue. There is no one who speaks with more passion than my friend from South Carolina, Senator Hollings. His position is so clear to us. And the wisdom of our ranking member on the Finance Committee, Senator Packwood, has given necessary balance to the debate. This has been a very good debate.\n\tThe fine people of my State, like those of any State, are deeply worried about their jobs and about the economic future facing them and their children. There are, of course, no simple prescriptions available to create prosperity. One thing is very clear: Jobs are not destroyed by trade; jobs are created by trade. And the more plentiful and fair and open that trade is, the more jobs are created here at home.\n\tWe do not--I repeat, not--produce jobs at home by refusing to participate in the difficult work of dismantling foreign trade barriers. I cannot stress strongly enough that I would never support any piece of legislation that would adversely affect the people and the economy of Wyoming. The GATT agreement is good for the economy, it is good for the people of Wyoming, it is good for the people of America. I would not say that it, or its financing mechanism, is perfect, but it is far, far preferable to the fallout and lost opportunities that would come from rejecting it.\n\tThe United States took a responsible step last year when it approved the North American Free-Trade Agreement. That agreement opened the door to greater exports to our biggest and best trading partners, Canada and Mexico. Exports to these NAFTA partners last year alone accounted for almost two-thirds of our export growth. The exports to Canada and Mexico surpassed exports to Asia and even Europe, and the benefits of this expanded trade are now a matter of record. They are on the record. The GATT agreement gives us the opportunity to build on that success and extend those principles now around the world.\n\tI want to commend Mickey Kantor. Ambassador Kantor has been superb. He has done a tremendous job. I admire his work. And he has always been accessible and receptive to things I have shared with him about issues in Wyoming that have to do with grain and agricultural products. The U.S. Trade Representative calls the Uruguay round a $750 billion global tax cut. That is a direct reference to the tariffs that consumers around the world will no longer have to pay.\n\tIndeed, it is estimated that this trade agreement will be responsible for a gain in global income of more than $500 billion by the year 2005. This is an important decision for our foreign policy, as well as for our domestic economic interests. What sort of a message would the rejection of GATT convey to the world? I believe the answer is very clear. If we choose to reject GATT, then Germany, France, Japan, China, and the rest of Asia will go right back to their old protectionist ways, ways that kept U.S. exporters out of their markets. Our export opportunities will evaporate before our eyes. We will face the same old obstacles to trade as we have in the past.\n\tWe should well remember and recall the stated belief by the Japanese that only Japanese downhill skis worked on Japanese snow. I remember that one. We in Wyoming knew that not to be the case, especially with Wyoming powder. But how about that one? We do not want to go back to that. Japan is one of our finest allies, and one of our finest trading partners. We do not want to hear any more things like that.\n\tDuring the 7 years that the GATT was negotiated I had the opportunity to receive the opinions of more than several hundred constituents. My constituents are not fainthearted. They discussed GATT. Some of the discussion came from individuals who had been fed some fallacious information sent to them by individuals with a big stake in defeating GATT who had been led to fear for their own job security if GATT is passed. I will make a brief comment on those. But first, for the most part, I have heard in great detail about the benefits GATT would provide to my State.\n\tLet me just say that all of us are guided often by provincial energy. Let me say that I represent a State of 473,000 human beings. My good colleague to my immediate left, Senator Patrick Daniel Moynihan, represents a State of millions of human beings. I want to commend the senior Senator from New York for the work he has done on this issue. He has been intrepid, dedicated, and completely forward in his support of it. His energies, I hope, will be met with success this evening.\n\tBut in this State of 473,000 people in 93,000 square miles, if we do not have the ability to export, we will perish. We are the largest producer of trona, which is soda ash, which is in every piece of glass. One-third of the world's trona comes from southwest Wyoming. And this will reduce tariff barriers in Belgium and France on soda ash which will be of tremendous longterm benefit until the end of the reserves in that part of Wyoming. This is the greatest benefit to an entire quadrant of my State that you could ever have had. That is what it will do with the big boys in Brussels and France and the soda ash producers, completely reducing those tariffs.\n\tWe are the largest producer of coal in the United States, bigger than West Virginia, bigger than Kentucky, bigger than Pennsylvania. This will help. We produce pork, beef, sugar beets, lamb, and wool. These are things that Wyoming emphasizes; also, chemical and MTBE production. These are commodities and goods that GATT will benefit.\n\tSo our whole economy is based on trade. That means fair trade. It means the elimination of trade barriers that will continue to exist if GATT is defeated.\n\tWe trade in all of these things, including timber, and a great array of manufactured goods. We are a State rich, rich indeed, in raw materials that amount to far more than whatever we could consume. Without access, without these openings, we would dry up and disappear. This is our export opportunity. This is our future. This is the way we keep our young people in Wyoming to work, and live and play there.\n\tI believe GATT has made some tremendous advancements toward the objective of free and fair trade. Certainly there are key elements that are somewhat disturbing. But I think we have had those answered.\n\tThe key is tariffs, reduction in foreign tariffs, either fully eliminated or significantly cut on approximately 85 percent of world trade including construction, agricultural equipment, even beer--which is a very lucrative world market I might add.\n\tThe General Agreement on Trade and Services, which is GATS, will assist in opening export markets and ensuring fair foreign investment rules for American service companies and professional, business, communications, financial, health, tourism, education, environmental fields, industries which employ millions of Americans.\n\tAgriculture will be included for the first time in a GATT agreement. Here is the one issue that has messed up international trade for decades. Agricultural support systems and the burning of commodities on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, getting rid of potatoes here, grain here. That is absurd.\n\tFinally, we deal with that. Finally we get to that. We increase these trade opportunities. We are going to reduce agricultural export subsidies by a total of 36 percent, which is $8 billion, over half of which is accounted for by the European unit.\n\tMember nations are going to cut $35 billion in support for domestically consumed agricultural products; 18 percent reduction. But it is going to benefit wheat, barley, beef, pork, sugar. And I will have to tell my constituents because somebody has them all worked up and giving them erroneous information. I will be very glad to help educate them and tell them what we are doing here, and that it is not about the loss of sovereignty. It is not about the World Trade Organization. I wish they had picked a different name for it. It seems to have connotations that led to most sinister references. There is a gross misunderstanding about that. Clarifying these misconceptions is very important. And I shall do that because they will wonder why I am voting and so strongly helping to pass GATT.\n\n\tThe Uruguay round would also extend significant protection to American producers, in the realm of intellectual property. The GATT would finally offer some substantial protection for U.S. companies that manufacture pharmaceutical drugs, computer programs and games, semiconductor chips, books, films, and compact music disks. Not only would it provide for recognition of U.S. patents, copyrights and trademarks abroad, but it also requires foreign governments to provide effective enforcement of them. This is an area of unquestionable importance for U.S. exporters. Protections in this area are absolutely critical for preserving the global integrity of those industries.\n\tOne issue on which many people have expressed concern is the establishment of the World Trade Organization [WTO]. I believe there is a gross misunderstanding about that and I would like to try to clarify some of the misconceptions as I mentioned earlier, since the formation of the GATT in 1948, member nations have renegotiated the global trade rules approximately every 5 years. As a result of the Uruguay round, the rules have been substantially expanded and extended to most trading nations on an equivalent basis.\n\tBecause of this expansion, it has become necessary to formally reorganize the current GATT officiating body. The WTO would simply replace that current body. The WTO will provide the world with procedures for negotiating additional reductions of trade barriers and for the prompt resolution of trade disputes between countries.\n\tI strongly believe that no trade agreement, whatever its economic benefits, should be approved if it infringes upon State or Federal sovereignty. But provisions in the GATT agreement clearly state that U.S. law prevails in every situation under the WTO. There are significant safeguards in the implementing legislation--including an outright statement that gives primacy to U.S. laws--to ensure that our sovereignty is fully protected.\n\tBut let me just read one section of the legislation because we are talking about sovereignty. Here it is, section 102(A)(1) of that legislation which clearly States this:\n\n       No provision of any of the Uruguay round agreements, nor \n     the application of any such provision to any person or \n     circumstances, that is inconsistent with any law of the \n     United States shall have effect.\n\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Period.\n\tMr. SIMPSON. I appreciate the emphasis from my colleague from New York, ``period.'' There it is. That is it. You cannot say it. It could have been a little better syntax, I think. But, nevertheless, in its jumbled version it says exactly what people have been concerned about, and I think that is very important.\n\n\tI believe that this provision fully recognizes the fact that the power to create and abolish U.S. law is ultimately reserved to Congress and the State legislatures. That power is derived directly from the U.S. Constitution and I can assure my listeners that there is no method by which those legislative duties will be relinquished to some international trade court in Switzerland. Suggestions to the contrary reveal only how cynical many have become about the patriotism and good faith of those in government, particularly those who negotiated the agreement.\n\tSecond, the implementing legislation sets up procedures by which Congress will maintain oversight of WTO actions as they relate to the United States. It also ensures that the administration will always coordinate with Congress in its responses to upcoming WTO voting issues. That is a very important element which will ensure that Congress--and the public's--voice with regard to U.S. positions on international trade is clearly heard. All briefs and decisions made by the WTO and dispute settlement panels will be available to public inspection. Secret tribunals will not exist nor are they authorized under the WTO.\n\tFurthermore, in the event that Congress becomes dissatisfied with WTO decisions at any time, the bill sets up a special, expedited procedure by which we can decide every 5 years whether or not to revoke the agreements. There is also a safety hatch that allows us to withdraw at anytime with six months notice.\n\tFinally, Senator Dole has negotiated an additional safeguard in the form of an agreement with the President to establish a WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission. The Commission would consist of five judges appointed by the President and the leadership of both Houses. The Commission will review all final WTO dispute settlement reports where the report rules against the United States. If the judges determine on three occasions that the WTO exceeded its authority or diminished the rights of the United States, any member of either House could introduce a resolution to disapprove U.S. participation in the WTO. Three strikes and we're out of the WTO.\n\tIn order to pass GATT, the Senate is required to waive the Budget Act. The budget waiver is required even though most experts agree that the benefits of GATT greatly surpass any losses which would result from reduced tariffs. Our own budget rules here in the Senate require strict deficit neutrality over a course of 10 years as ``scored'' by static scoring models--models which do not account for changes in behavior which may result from the change in law.\n\tThe $11.7 billion tax cut from the GATT legislation for the first 5 years is paid for with $11.1 billion of deficit reduction measures and $600 million of previously enacted budgetary savings. Moreover, because the GATT financing package is mostly outlay reductions, not revenue increases, the net effect of the package is to provide for a substantial net tax cut for Americans.\n\tNonetheless, GATT still requires a waiver of the Congressional Budget Act. A failure to approve the budget waiver for GATT will mean that the bill is dead. A vote against the budget waiver is a vote against the GATT.\n\tThis morning we were at the White House and I wanted to conclude with what our leader, George Mitchell, said, if I may paraphrase correctly. He said something like this: I thought it was devastatingly appropriate. He said: I think everyone will admit that already the United States of America is the most open trading country in the world. That is a given. We have less restrictions, less tariffs, less games, less punishment, less all the things that become tricky in this, and countervailing duties, and so on.\n\tSo if we are already the most open trading country on the Earth, and GATT is about opening trade, how can we miss? We cannot miss. America cannot miss on this. If we are already the most open country on Earth and the sole purpose of this legislation is to open trade around the world, that is good for America and good for Wyoming. It is plain and simple. The agreement will open up important foreign markets for Wyoming, and it will reduce hideous tariffs around the world. We have a choice to chart a course forward, a fairer and more profitable choice.\n\tI am proud to make that choice and to support this historic agreement.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. May I congratulate the distinguished Republican whip for his thoughtful, analytic, factual statement. If we could hear what he has said and extend it to our own States, as is easily done, the case has been made. I thank him for his graciousness and his courtesy, which is unfailing, and the skilled cowboy knows his international trade.\n\tNow I have the pleasure to yield 10 minutes to my friend and neighbor from Massachusetts, the Honorable John Kerry.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\tMr. KERRY. I have been listening to a number of my colleagues who paint a very grim picture of diminishing U.S. sovereignty; the weakening of environmental laws; and the withering away of the U.S. manufacturing base that would result if we pass this bill.\n\tWell, Mr. President, I think those fears, as a number of my colleagues have articulated, are misplaced. This agreement will not do any of these things.\n\tIndeed, with respect to the sovereignty issue, it is interesting to note that a cross-section of American institutions--the American Bar Association, the Consumers Union, and the Heritage Foundation, which I think rarely agree on anything--all agree that the Uruguay round will not harm the sovereignty of this Nation one iota. The ABA stated, ``In particular, the Uruguay round dispute settlement provisions leave United States domestic legal powers totally intact.''\n\tIn point of fact, if the WTO did begin to hand down a number of decisions adverse to the United States, we would have the ability to withdraw from this agreement--by merely providing 6 months' notice.\n\tA second concern is the impact this agreement will have on the environment, but there, too, the GATT recognizes specifically the right of each country to protect human, animal, and plant life; and the health, the environment and consumers. It allows each country to set a level of protection for health, and the environment and consumers that the particular government deems appropriate.\n\tThe third concern, and the most important, is that this agreement will reduce jobs. However, by forcing other countries to play by the same rules of fair play that the United States has always abided by, the agreement will increase--by 300,000 to 700,000 over 10 years. Moreover, annual U.S. income will increase $100 to $200 billion over the same period.\n\tWe are 4 percent of the world's population; 96 percent of the world's population is where 90 percent of the development and growth will take place over the course of the next years. If we do not pass this agreement, we deny ourselves access to that market and we invite our most voracious competitors--the French, Germans, Japanese, Taiwanese, Singaporese, and a host of others--to rush in where we fear to tread.\n\tIn fact, not only will the passage of the Uruguay round not threaten our sovereignty nor our prosperity, but on the contrary, I believe that failure to pass it would in fact subject us to these very fears--by forcing us to confront the inevitable continued globalization of the world's economy, unregulated by a set of multilateral rules.\n\tWhy do so many people oppose this agreement then? I suppose it is because so many do not want to acknowledge that continued globalization of the world economy that we have witnessed is inevitable. It is going to continue whether we like it or not, and whether we pass the Uruguay round implementing legislation or not. We cannot turn back the clock.\n\tIn many ways it is good that we cannot. The jobs created by exports traditionally pay 17 percent higher than the U.S. average. Eleven million people in the United States owe their jobs to exports--one-quarter of our workforce. This number is expected to increase to one-third of our work force in the next 10 years.\n\tThis agreement is an opportunity for us to make this change work for American workers--by increasing U.S. exports.\n\tI was just in India, where I met with the Finance Minister, the Minister of Telecommunications, and the Foreign Minister. I gave each of them a Polaroid camera made in Massachusetts, with two packets of film. I said, ``When you finish these packets of film, you will not--unless a friend brings you more--be able to buy more in India because they are kept out by tariffs of 50 percent. Despite the fact that no Indian company manufactures these cameras --and therefore there is no domestic industry asking for protection--you maintain one of the highest tariffs on film in the world.''\n\tI hope that the Government of India will decide to reduce this tariff in the next several months.\n\tUnder GATT, similar tariffs would be reduced, creating enormous opportunities for companies like Polaroid, and their employees.\n\tThat, Mr. President, means jobs for Americans. In Fall River, MA, there is a company called Quaker Fabrics. They have increased their capacity to make textiles in America and sell them abroad. Of the 500 people they have Hired over the last few years, 300 of them are directly related to the increase in export capacity. They support GATT.\n\tIn addition to those examples as to why GATT is important, let me just quickly summarize a few others. It is the largest tax cut --by virtue of the reduction of tariffs--in world history. It will eliminate major foreign barriers to the export of our goods.\n\tIt will permit--and in some cases actually strengthen--the United States's ability to enforce its laws against foreign unfair trade practices.\n\tIt will protect intellectual property of United States entrepreneurs from piracy in world markets.\n\tAnd it will boost the currently stalled world economy, thereby creating even more export opportunities for U.S. firms.\n\tThe benefits to my home State are especially large. In addition to the direct benefits of the jobs I just mentioned, it will eliminate duties for medical equipment and printed matter. It will lower significantly tariffs on fish and fish products, which are a mainstay of Massachusetts.\n\tIt will provide strong intellectual property rights protection which will benefit particularly exports of semiconductor manufacturers, computers and software.\n\tFinally, I will say this is not a perfect agreement. No agreement is. There are obviously deep concerns that we have about labor standards in other countries. There are concerns that we have about the ability of those countries to meet some of the environmental standards we consider critical.\n\tTherefore, we must bear in mind that with this vote our job is not finished.\n\tOpening up opportunities in the new global economy is important. But we must also prepare all our citizens for the impact of that globalization.\n\tSome of our most vulnerable citizens will be hurt in the transition process. It is a tragedy that in this Nation we have not fully funded worker training and adjustment programs. As some benefit, it should not be at the expense of others.\n\tFurther, we must make certain that we ensure that international labor standards are protected and increased through the World Trade Organization. This will entail a major effort by the United States, but we are obliged to make it.\n\tWe also must do everything we can to ensure that textile markets around the world are opened so that our textile manufacturers, who will be newly challenged under this agreement, do not find themselves relinquishing the protection of the multifiber agreement without finding fairness in foreign markets. I am convinced that it is through the GATT that we can help them to achieve that equity in the marketplace. This agreement will help us to open up those last barriers.\n\tLastly, we must follow the progress of the new Environment and Trade Committee of the WTO to ensure that the goal of sustainable development is not relegated to the marketplace in Geneva.\n\tIn all of these cases, if we find that the new agreement and the WTO are not working to our benefit and are undermining our labor and environment standards, we should be prepared to exercise our option to waive.\n\tThese are the tangible steps that we can and must take in order to guarantee that GATT is not a hollow victory today and that we continue to be concerned for the workers of this country.\n\tBut like NAFTA, Mr. President, this agreement is a good one, and it is good for U.S. workers.\n\tI urge my colleagues to acknowledge the facts, to recognize that we are better off with a world community trading by global agreement rather than the chaos of individual bilateral arrangements. It is precisely those arrangements that have created some of the worst inequities in the marketplace today, and it is precisely this agreement that attempts to redress that.\n\tAgain, I thank the distinguished chairman both for the time and for his leadership on this issue.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I congratulate the Senator from Massachusetts, first for his enterprise in bringing Polaroid cameras to New Delhi and making a very proper neat point.\n\tI can add that the President of Kodak, which is of course a New York firm, has made the point that there are 4 billion people on Earth who never snapped a photograph and he would like to sell them cameras.\n\tI would like to make the point that we surely are heading for the moment where a third of our work force will be in export industries, if we adopt the GATT. If we do not, remember dollar week, remember 1933. That is what Cordell Hull and Franklin Roosevelt tried to take us out of on this very important point about displaced workers and there will be, and multifiber agreement. It happens I was one of the three persons who negotiated for President Kennedy the long-term cotton textile agreement in 1962 which made possible the Trade Enhancement Act of that year that led to the Kennedy round.\n\tThat was involved. The original cotton textile agreement became multifibers. It had been in place 32 years now and we have another 10 years in this agreement, about half a century, but it also provided for displaced workers and that commitment was made and that is when the labor movement was behind us then and we have not kept faith with them.\n\tThe Senator's commitment is a very important one which I think we should all undertake to keep.\n\tMr. KERRY. I thank the chairman.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I see our distinguished friend from Colorado, and I am happy to yield 10 minutes, if that is agreeable, on Senator Packwood's time.\n\tMr. BROWN. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\tMr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\tMr. President, it is quite clear that this measure is going to pass, that the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, and others, have made an excellent case.\n\tI rise out of concerns over the GATT, and I want to raise a couple specific points that I hope at least in the record of this debate will be reflected upon at some point.\n\tAmericans used to take great pride in being called Yankee traders. It was an aggressive term. It was one we liked to call ourselves, and we think it implied that not only were we capable traders when we were involved in the international marketplace, but we were at least savvy about the way we did it, as well as that in the trades we put together we thought of ourselves of at least capable of holding our own and perhaps even at times outtrading everybody else in the world. Perhaps that is part of the American mystique. While we are made up of few from around the globe, we also pride ourselves in having something a little better than the rest of the world.\n\tHow will we evaluate this GATT agreement? Some will say this is simply a free trade agreement that benefits all and so the discussion needs to end there. I have read many editorials lately that have reflected that viewpoint. How could you possibly oppose GATT because you ought to be in favor of free trade?\n\tMr. President, I am in favor of free trade. I am in favor of reducing trade barriers. I do think it is an advantage to our economy and other economies around the world. I think it is a plus for consumers.\n\tBut, Mr. President, the issue that is before us is not free trade. How can I say that? It is in the agreements themselves, in agreement after agreement after agreement, and as I think the distinguished Members know there are a number of agreements included in this measure. It calls on the United States to open its markets but allows other countries to keep their markets closed or exempts them from the requirement to open their markets or exempts them from the marketing opening provision. Please do not confuse this with the free trade agreement that opens both markets. It does not.\n\tMany of the agreements have a specific provision for countries of the free world. What they say is, the United States, you open your market but countries in the Third World can keep it closed for 5 years. For some it is 7 years and for some it is 8 years. In another agreement it goes to 10 years and even one it goes to 12 years.\n\tDoes anybody think that is a good trade? Would anybody be happy to be the U.S. Trade Representative and come back and say look what I got you; I got you the right to make your concessions immediately, but the other ones do not have to match them until a dozen years from now. That is not being a Yankee trader. That is being a chump.\n\tThis is not a good agreement. Those who are advocates of free trade ought to understand there is more involved than simply slogans, that they have to look at the agreements to evaluate them.\n\tSome will say, ``Well, OK, we will suffer for 5 years or a dozen years, but then at least at the end of that time we will have achieved something great. We will have opened those other markets, too.''\n\tMr. President, everybody who believes that I hope will go down and register their name, because we have some real estate in Florida or perhaps Colorado we would like to sell them.\n\tThe truth is, what is included in the WTO, included in this agreement, is an empowerment of the general council or the ministerial conference by a vote to amend the rules.\n\tWell, some will say, ``Well, Heavens, that takes a supermajority to amend the rules.'' Surely no one would come forward after giving those special privileges to Third World countries and would waive the requirement that they eventually come into line.\n\tMr. President, people need to read this agreement. This agreement does give that power. There is the ability to amend the rules. What does it take? Three-quarters. How can anybody, for such a difficult position to defend, assume that you could amend those rules. One reason might be that people who vote in the World Trade Organization are going to vote for their interests. Most of those countries are not what we would call free traders. And, as a matter of fact, if all of the Third World countries join in the WTO, they will have 83 percent of the vote. Maybe they all will not join. Ninety have joined already. They have by now already three-quarters of votes. All they have to do is vote for themselves and they will be able to extend these provisions.\n\tHas anybody talked about it? Yes, they have. There are references to extending them.\n\tMr. President, this is not a good bargain. And it has nothing to do with whether you like free trade or not. It has to do with a lousy job of negotiating a contract and making sure that the other side has to live by the same rules we live by. If anybody is proud of this agreement in terms of negotiation, I hope they will come down and defend it. They may be proud of the concept, and I am all with them. But when you look at the text of the agreement, they have nothing to be proud of.\n\tSome discussion has been made with regard to the expense of GATT, and I want to share this with Members because I want to make a forecast. The United States cost to administer GATT has increased 181 percent from 1984 to 1993. That is because the GATT expenses have increased 72 percent. Is it a lot of money? Well, not in terms of the Federal Government. But $9 million is a lot to some people.\n\tWhat are the chances that it is going to increase? I want to draw the Members' attention to a couple of things. Currently, each country's share of the total annual expense of GATT is equal to the country's portion of total trades in goods and contracting priorities and associated governments. In other words, it is a trade figure. We get to pay between 14 and 16 percent. Currently it is about 14.6, as the distinguished chairman pointed out yesterday, of the cost to operate GATT.\n\tHowever, there is this change and our source for this change is from Focus--an official GATT newsletter published by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Geneva, Switzerland.\n\tBeginning in 1996, every country's assessment will reflect its share in international traded goods, services and intellectual property. Therefore, the U.S. contribution to WTO will significantly increase because we have the largest trade in services and intellectual property in the world. In other words, 14.6 percent is going to go up, not down.\n\tBut, Mr. President, in addition to that, we have been in discussion with people from the State Department and they indicate that the provisions that allocate costs along with the size of the gross domestic product, or the gross national product that incidentally is used in the United Nations, is under consideration here. If we do that, our share to the WTO will clearly go up to about 23 percent.\n\tSome will say, ``Well, wait a minute. We have to have votes on that first.''\n\tLet me draw the Members' attention to this question. One, in this new agreement it is not spelled out. We have not been guaranteed what the allocation will be nor are we guaranteed what the costs will be.\n\tBut, Mr. President, we do know the process. The ministerial conference elects the director general. The director general will reflect that majority. Keep in mind that the countries that will be voting, a majority of them, have voted against the United States in the United Nations over 50 percent of the time. This is not a benign group. This is a group that has opposed us in policies in the United Nations consistently. They will elect the director general, not the United States. The director general helps set up the secretariat and the secretariat is the one that appoints the people who will be judges. We call them panelists, dispute settlement body panelists. But the budget is proposed by the director general.\n\tThat budget is then forwarded to the committee on budget, finance and administration. Once they have made their recommendation it goes to the general council. The general council will have over 80 percent, perhaps as high as 83 percent of its members from the Third World. It only takes two-thirds to approve budget matters. Does not the Third World have the opportunity to skew the budget and to give us a disproportionate cost? Absolutely. Do not kid yourself. Do not kid yourself. They have the votes.\n\tNow, would they possibly do that? I have heard Members convey to me in private, ``Look, we are so influential on trade matters, no one would stick us with a disproportion of the cost.''\n\tPlease take a look at what happens in the United Nations. If any Member of this body is comfortable with the share of the costs we pay in the United Nations, if anybody feels it is proportional to what it ought to be, I would love to have them come forward and say so. It is my impression that it is not anywhere near close. We get taken. We pay far more than our share of the cost.\n\tIs that a good trade? Of course not.\n\tWhat we have had is a negotiation where the United States gave up on most of the key important points and signed a bad deal. And now we are going to ratify it. To have bad negotiators go and represent this country may not be our responsibility, but if we vote for this measure it is our responsibility.\n\tAmericans, Yankee traders, ought to be able to do better than that. They ought to be able to do better in a negotiation than have this country not get equal access. I think it is fair to insist that we have the same access to other countries as they have here. It is not in this agreement. It is the opposite.\n\tI think it is fair for us to have a weighted vote as we do in the International Monetary Fund, or vetoes as we in the United Nations, or at least something that is proportional. We do not have that in this agreement. That is not a good trade.\n\tMr. President, the way the courts are administered does not include due process. No one claims it does. It has the potential of being very abusive to Americans and American interests. That is not a good trade.\n\tWhether it is the cost of the operation, whether it is the trade agreements themselves, whether it is the mechanism that is established, whether it is the quasijudicial procedures that are set up, whether it is the votes in the general council, this country came out on the short end.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\tMr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and I thank the floor managers for allowing me to come in at this time.\n\tMr. President, later this afternoon, we will be casting the 328th vote, and possibly the 329th vote of this second session of the 103d Congress. These will be historic votes not only because they will be the last votes of this Congress, but because on these votes, unlike all of the other votes we have cast, the entire world is watching and awaiting the outcome.\n\tIn reaching my decision, I have tried to balance the positive economic components of the agreement against the uncertainties associated with the idea of creating a supranational body--the World Trade Organization [WTO]--to govern international trade disputes.\n\tI have always believed that an open trading system is in the best interests of citizens of Alaska and the Nation as a whole. And so I wanted to give the proponents of the agreement every opportunity to make their case and help me overcome my very serious reservations about the WTO.\n\tMany Alaskans have asked me why I have waited until today to make my decision on the agreement. The reason I have waited so long is that I had very specific concerns about certain aspects of the agreement, and how they would affect my home State of Alaska. One of my principal concerns was whether Alaska's unitary tax system is protected under the new agreement.\n\n\n                      alaska's unitary tax method\n\n\tMany Alaskans have expressed concern that the State's unitary method of corporate taxation could be challenged by one of our trading partners, and if the WTO ruled against Alaska, the State would either have to dismantle its tax system or the United States would face retaliatory penalties. Last week, I wrote to the U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Mickey Kantor, concerning the potential of a challenge to Alaska's unitary system. Three days ago, Ambassador Kantor responded and assured me that ``Alaska's unitary tax system if fully protected under the new Uruguay round agreements.''\n\n\tAccording to Ambassador Kantor, Alaska's unitary tax system is excepted from the agreement and ``WTO member countries would have no ground on which to suspend Uruguay round trade concessions in response to Alaska's unitary tax system.'' In addition, Alaska's Governor has examined this issue and reached a conclusion consistent with Ambassador Kantor's analysis.\n\tAlthough I am satisfied that Ambassador Kantor's interpretation of the agreement is correct, nothing precludes another country from attempting to challenge the unitary tax systems in my State or the 15 other States that use this method. I would hope that such a challenge would be summarily dismissed.\n\tMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to Ambassador Kantor, his response, and a letter from John Katz, director of State/Federal relations for the State of Alaska, be included in the Record.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n\tMr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, what made my decision so difficult is the fact that there are clear economic benefits that will flow from the agreement. The agreement that was hammered out with our trading partners is designed to enhance international trade in industrial and high-technology products by cutting tariffs by $744 billion over the next decade.\n\tBy some estimates, if the agreement is approved, U.S. exports will increase by $150 billion, creating 500,000 new jobs and increasing the income of the average U.S. family by $1,700 per year over the next 10 years, and the agreement could increase our gross domestic product by $100 billion to $200 billion a year.\n\n\n                          benefits for alaska\n\n\tFor the citizens of Alaska, especially those involved in the fishing and wood products industry, the GATT Agreement promises new jobs and new export opportunities. As the largest producer of fisheries products in the United States, Alaska seafood exports currently account for 48 percent of total seafood exports, accounting for more than $1.5 billion. Under this agreement our seafood exports are likely to increase because Japan has agreed to cut its fishery duties by 24.5 percent and South Korea and other Asian nations will cut their tariffs by 35 percent.\n\tWood products exports from Alaska, which currently account for more than $540 million, are likely to increase because the principal markets for our wood products--Japan, Canada, Mexico, and South Korea--have all agreed to cut their lumber and solid wood tariffs by an average of 28 percent. In addition, in Brazil, where Alaskan wood products have been effectively blocked by tariffs as high as 52 percent, tariffs will be cut by three-fourths to 14 percent.\n\tThese potentially positive elements of the agreement are compelling, especially when one considers how important international trade is to Alaska.\n\n\n                        ISSUEs OMITTED FROM GATT\n\n\tBut it should be noted that this agreement falls far short of achieving the goals we originally sought when the Uruguay round began. We failed to eliminate governmental subsidies for civil aviation and agriculture. We failed to establish workable rules that would allow free trade in financial services and telecommunications, and were unsuccessful in breaking open the European broadcasting and movie industry. These are all industries where the United States clearly maintains a competitive advantage; yet our negotiators were unable to achieve any major breakthroughs with our trading partners in these areas.\n\n\n                                THE WTO\n\n\tWhat is of serious concern to the citizens of Alaska and to me is the dispute settlement process authorized by this agreement. I have heard from many Alaskans over the last several months who have expressed legitimate and serious concerns that the newly created World Trade Organization [WTO] could represent a threat to our Nation's sovereignty. As all of my colleagues know, there is real concern throughout the country that a group of faceless foreign bureaucrats whose interests are inimical to the United States will issue rulings in secret that will penalize American business and force Congress to rewrite our laws to conform to the arbitrary whims of other countries.\n\tIf this agreement were not being considered under the fast track procedure, I would certainly offer an amendment to strip out the WTO and maintain GATT as the body for governing trade disputes. That, in effect, is what our predecessors did in the late 1940's when the Senate refused to approve an organization similar in concept to the WTO--the so-called International Trade Organization. World trade has flourished since GATT was implemented in 1948 and I think it was a mistake for our trade negotiators to replace GATT with the WTO. Make no mistake, world trade will continue to flourish GATT or no GATT. The world market is too competitive to stop now.\n\tInstead of creating the one-country, one-vote WTO, our negotiators should have used the U.N. Security Council as a model for dispute settlement. Using the Security Council model, the major trading countries--the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, and Canada--could have retained a veto over any decision that was contrary to their interests.\n\tAlthough the Republican leader, Senator Dole, should be commended for winning a commitment from the administration to support legislation that will create a WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission here in the United States, this review commission does not have the authority to overturn WTO decisions.\n\tIf the Commission finds that the WTO exceeded its authority in any case involving the United States, all Congress can do is adopt a resolution calling on the President to negotiate new dispute settlement rules. If the WTO issues three such decisions, Congress could adopt legislation requiring the United States to withdraw from the WTO. That is not totally satisfactory to this Senator.\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET WAIVER\n\n\tFinally, Mr. President, I believe the administration made a fundamental mistake when they sent the implementing legislation to Congress without fully complying with our budget rules. Since the administration has claimed $1.7 billion in savings from unrelated legislation passed since the 1993 budget, and since the financing package only offsets 5 years' tariff reductions, the GATT Agreement is subject to a budget point of order.\n\tOur Federal debt is approaching $4.7 trillion. Interest to service that debt will exceed $225 billion this year. With this extraordinary amount of fiscal red ink, it is fundamentally irresponsible for the administration to have submitted unamendable legislation that is not fully funded. We should not be adding to the debt and the deficit in order to finance this trade agreement.\n\tInstead, the administration should have submitted a series of real spending cuts to finance this entire package. We all know the significance of the debt and what we are doing here is basically additional deficit financing. That is something I abhor.\n\tI refuse to support any legislation that adds a further debt burden to our children and grandchildren.\n\tIn the final analysis this is a vote about winners and losers--American winners and losers. Depending on who is counting, either the winners are in the majority or the losers are. The irony of this loud, emotional, and well-meaning debate about free trade is that we lose sight of what we do to ourselves regarding free trade. How can we urge free trade, presumably urging our trading partners to lower their barriers, as we seek entry for our products, when we prohibit by our own laws, the export of our products?\n\tHow can we prohibit the export of our own Alaskan North Slope oil for 20 years and yet plead for fairness from our trading partners.\n\tIn the old saying, we have met the enemy and it is us.\n\tThis would be a very close call on the merits and the issues. I hope we will have an opportunity to send this back for improvements, and I especially hope we will be honest about paying for the agreement with spending cuts before final consideration.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 22, 1994.\n       Dear Ambassador Kantor: Concerns have been expressed by \n     some individuals in Alaska that under the terms of the \n     uruguay Round GATT agreement, the state's unitary tax system \n     could be jeopardized. In particular, there is concern that \n     the state's unitary tax system could be challenged before the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO), and if the WTO ruled that \n     this method of taxation is inconsistent with the principles \n     of national treatment, the state would have to dismantle its \n     tax system or face retalatory penalties.\n       GATT Article XIV, subsection (d) provides that nothing in \n     the agreement prevents the adoption of a taxing system \n     ``aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition of \n     direct taxes in respect of services or service suppliers of \n     other Members.'' The footnote to subsection (d) attempts to \n     define tax measures that are designed to ensure the \n     ``equitable or effective'' collection of taxes. Included in \n     this list are tax systems which ``determine, allocate or \n     apportion income, profit, gain, loss, deduction or credit of \n     resident persons or branches, or between related persons or \n     branches of the same person, in order to safeguard the \n     Member's tax base.'' (FN 6, (vi). Although this definition \n     appears to encompass a unitary tax system, it does not \n     clearly and specifically approve the unitary tax system.\n       Because of the uncertainty surrounding this issue and its \n     importance to my state, I would appreciate if you would \n     provide me with a written answer to the following questions \n     before the Senate's scheduled vote next week on GATT.\n       1. What is the status of worldwide unitary tax systems \n     adopted by states such as Alaska under the GATT?\n       2. Can the state's unitary tax system be challenged before \n     the WTO?\n       3. If the WTO determines that Alaska's unitary tax system \n     is inconsistent with the principles of national treatment, \n     what sanctions can be imposed on the state, or kthe United \n     States, as a result of this determination?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Frank Murkowski,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    The U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 28, 1994.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Murkowski: Thank you for your letter of \n     November 22, 1994, expressing concerns from some of your \n     constituents that Alaska's unitary tax system might be \n     vulnerable to challenge in dispute settlement proceedings \n     under the proposed World Trade Organization (WTO). I want to \n     assure you that Alaska's unitary tax system is fully \n     protected under the new Uruguay Round agreements.\n       As you may know, the two Uruguay Round agreements that most \n     directly apply to taxation measures are the General Agreement \n     on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) and the General \n     Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). For the reasons \n     explained below, neither agreement provides a basis for \n     challenging state unitary taxation measures.\n       The relevant provisions of GATT 1994 apply to taxes \n     assessed on the goods rather than on income. Thus, GATT 1994 \n     could not be successfully used to challenge Alaska's unitary \n     tax system. I would point out that the GATT 1994 rules on \n     this subject are no different than those that have been in \n     effect under the GATT since 1948.\n       With respect to the GATS, its relevant provision--the \n     national treatment (nondiscrimination) rule--does apply to \n     income taxes, subject to a broad exception under Article XIV, \n     which you cited in your letter. The United States insisted on \n     the broad carveout in Article XIV(d) and the language in \n     footnote 6(vi) precisely in order to protect both our federal \n     and state income tax systems, including state unitary tax \n     regimes. In addition, we ``reserved'' (that is, specifically \n     excluded) from our commitments under the GATS all:\n       ``Sub-federal tax measures which afford less favorable \n     treatment to services or service suppliers of another Member \n     based on the method of allocating or apportioning the income, \n     profit, gain, losses, deductions, credits, assets or tax \n     based of such services suppliers or the proceeds of a \n     services transaction.''\n       Accordingly, even if Alaska's unitary tax system were found \n     to treat foreign service suppliers less favorably than \n     domestic service suppliers, it would be protected from \n     successful challenge both by the exception in Article XIV(d) \n     and by this reservation.\n       Our negotiators took great pains to ensure that state \n     unitary tax systems, such as Alaska's, will be fully \n     protected when the Uruguay Round agreements take effect. As a \n     result of their efforts, I am pleased that I can respond to \n     your specific questions as follows:\n       First, Alaska's unitary tax system is excepted from the \n     relevant provisions of the GATT and GATS;\n       Second, Alaska's unitary tax system is protected from \n     successful challenge to WTO dispute settlement proceedings; \n     and\n       Third, therefore, WTO member countries would have no ground \n     on which to suspend Uruguay Round trade concessions in \n     response to Alaska's unitary tax system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Kantor.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  State of Alaska,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 30, 1994.\n     Hon. Frank Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senator: Thank you for your letter of earlier today \n     regarding the potential impact of the GATT on the State's \n     collection of income tax based on the `unitary tax' method. \n     As you know, the importance to the State of Alaska of \n     maintaining this manner of taxation cannot be understated.\n       We have reviewed this question with the Governor's office \n     in Juneau, with the Departments of Law and Revenue, and with \n     the MultiState Tax Commission. Our assessment at this hour, \n     as it has been previously, is consistent with the analysis \n     shared with you by Ambassador Kantor.\n       However, notwithstanding a protected status, the United \n     States could be challenged based on Alaska's use of the \n     unitary tax. In such an instance, reliance must be placed on \n     the Federal government in defending its position and upon the \n     World Trade Organization in upholding the reservation.\n       If we can be of any further assistance, please let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 John W. Katz,\n\n       Director of State/Federal Relations and Special Counsel to \n                                                     the Governor.\n\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. I yield the Senator from North Dakota 3 minutes.\n\tMr. DORGAN. Mr. President, during this debate I heard a number of people referring to NAFTA, saying the information we received about NAFTA is that it is working very well. We have already created substantial new jobs. They know that because they have been given part of the story.\n\tLet me give it to you in automobiles. They say we have sent 30,000 more automobiles to Mexico under NAFTA during the first 9 months of this year. That is true. They did not tell the rest of the story, that 70,000 additional cars came into this country from Mexico. That means we lost jobs.\n\tI asked the Joint Economic Committee to do an evaluation of the net job situation between here and Mexico with NAFTA. They said it is hard but they put together a staff study. I just got it yesterday. It says the following. I want to read the paragraph.\n\n       This analysis summarizes U.S. trade data with Mexico \n     through the first 9 months of 1994. It provides a preliminary \n     and partial perspective on the effects of NAFTA on the U.S. \n     This analysis will show that, while increased exports have \n     created jobs during the period, changes in the overall trade \n     balance with Mexico have resulted in a net deficit of 10,000 \n     U.S. jobs since the agreement went into effect.\n\n\tThe overall trade balance changes have resulted in a net deficit of 10,000 U.S. jobs since the trade agreement went into effect. So the next time someone stands up and says, ``Boy, this NAFTA is really working well,'' it is because somebody gave them a part of the story. The rest of the story is here. NAFTA, like GATT, means that companies can access cheap labor and that is what the next paragraph says:\n\n       This analysis demonstrates that NAFTA has not increased \n     U.S. employment but rather increased global access to \n     Mexico's low-wage labor supply, as reflected in growing \n     shipments of capital goods and production inputs to Mexico \n     from the U.S. and foreign countries and rapidly rising \n     imports of finished products from Mexico to the U.S.\n\n\tThat is the full story. That is NAFTA. And that is what we are going to read about GATT, after this GATT agreement passes.\n\tMr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from South Carolina.\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\tMr. President, let me thank the distinguished Senator from North Dakota for the astute approach that he has made to the problem at hand. There is no question with respect to that sucking sound. We can only look at the facts with respect to electric machinery, sound, TV equipment--since NAFTA was enacted a deficit of $671 million. Optic photo medical-surgical equipment, a deficit to the United States of $241 million; an 87 percent increase over the same period of last year. Vehicles and parts, $218 million.\n\tThe fact of the matter is, Mr. President, that what we have had is 244 industries apply for adjustment assistance, representing the loss of 35,000 jobs. I do not question the Joint Economic Committee study about the loss, but we know when 35,000 people lose their jobs, by past experience, less than half will get their jobs back. And if they do get another job it pays 20 percent less.\n\tSo down to Mexico, they go with their automobile factories. I counseled a friend from Michigan. I said, ``Look, there is no question about their intent after NAFTA, Volkswagen says they are going to expand the plant to produce a million cars to sell in the United States.'' You do not have to wait for economic projections. Nissan, Ford, Chrysler, General Motors have all announced new facilities. We know that recently General Motors has downsized 71,000 jobs. They are all moving down there.\n\tWith respect to the productivity, the biggest mislead is when they talk about low income, they think of low skill. The fact of the matter is, they are very high skilled. J.D. Powers made a study of all automobile productivity in the world and found that the most productive Ford plant was not in Europe, not in Detroit, but in Mexico right this minute.\n\tSo we know, as we can train them to make automobiles productively, as we never have done before but now have just started in South Carolina, hard common sense says you can do that in Mexico. Fiat has a plant in the Ivory Coast and the automobile industry will move around and go that way.\n\tAnd, incidentally, BMW has moved to our State, and has also announced a $180 million new facility investment in Mexico--in Mexico under NAFTA. So we have had, yes, an increase in exports of 17,000 cars, but we have had imports of cars of 154,000. Since the distinguished Senator from Oregon started talking about trucks, the overall we have imported 176,000 cars and trucks. So there is no question in my mind that that sucking sound is there, but, of course, the Fortune Fifth Column in the trade war continues to muffle it.\n\tTo try to get into this debate, they said in the Wall Street Journal that trade was not an issue in the last election. You could not get this to be an issue. You could not get on a program. You could not get in a news column. I publicly thank the Christian Science Monitor which finally accepted a column from this particular Senator. Now, in my hometown, I get one this morning after they have been editorializing for the past 3 months against my position; they finally put in an article today.\n\tNow, Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from New York talked about textiles in the Kennedy round. I want to emphasize that just exactly, because in the Kennedy round, we had cotton in the 7-point Kennedy program. Before President John Kennedy could institute that particular program, we had to get Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg and Secretary Dillon from Treasury and Dean Rusk--actually George Ball subbed for Dean Rusk over there at the State Department--Luther Hodges at Commerce, and our friend Orville Freeman from Agriculture. The five of them got together, and I happened to bring a good many of the witnesses before them.\n\tWe found that next to steel that textiles was the second most important industry to our national security. I pointed out how it brings down the crime in the city. Those are good, valid sewing jobs. Those are the enterprises that we have in the enterprise zones. People do not seem to understand it here: 96,000 of those jobs are in the inner city of New York; 63,000 in Watts in Los Angeles. And you pass this GATT; yes, those sewing jobs are bound to leave to the Pacific rim. And when they leave, you have unemployment, you have unemployment compensation, you have increased taxes there, health costs go up, welfare costs go up and, of course, the crime rate goes up. We have those running around all over the country saying what we ought to do in the inner city is get enterprise zones and give businesses more tax cuts to get them there, as we affirmatively this afternoon remove them. That is the tragedy of this entire debate.\n\tWhen it comes to the competition we are in, the best headline is from November 23--today is December 1--exactly a week ago: ``Japan Defends Plan to Erect Textile Barriers.''\n\tThis is the crowd they are talking about dealing with on free trade. This GATT does not open the market in Japan, Malaysia, Korea--you can just go right on down the list. Anybody that believes that is whistling Dixie. Come on, let us wake up.\n\tThe Senator from Oregon said on Crossfire that we did not have a study showing job loss. We put the study in the Congressional Record. According to this study, we lose 1,390,000, almost 1,400,000 textile jobs, under this GATT. Very, very important jobs. But they say, ``Oh, here comes the textile Senator.'' Well, here comes a Senator who is interested in those high-technology jobs in the aircraft industry. Boeing fired 28,000. Or high technology jobs in computers. Well, IBM fired 60,000. But before I get to the high-technology jobs, I want to get particularly to some of these things that get passed over.\n\tWith respect to the $500 billion increase to the world GNP, we had a hearing--eight hearings, actually--before the Committee on Commerce. They started out with an OECD study that said $200 billion. When they were told that that meant only .07 percent to the world GNP, they came up with $500 billion. Then the Special Trade Representative came up with $1 trillion. So you can see how statistics are irresponsibly thrown around.\n\tWith respect to the $750 billion tax cut, Mr. President, let us get right to that one because what it says is really a $750 billion tariff cut. If you cut the tariffs, the Senator from Ohio brought out that they are not getting the garments any cheaper. Similarly, with the Senator from Iowa, he pointed that out. I pointed it out time and again that when Nike moved offshore from the United States and out of Oregon, the price of shoes did not go up, the profits went up. So, yes, we hope it will give you a cheaper price, but we know that the retailers, part and one of the main troops in the Fortune Fifth Column in this trade war, are only interested in bigger profits. They are not interested in your job and my job or middle America. They are interested in more money.\n\tI want to thank Senator Brown. I am hissing along here. He talked with respect to the intellectual property. Yes, but they have exceptions in there, for developing countries, of 10 years. On agriculture, but the Europeans have subsidies greater than ours. What kind of agreement is that? It leaves the United States economy wide open and it keeps their particular economies closed.\n\tNow, with respect to specifically 301, if I was a trade lawyer, I would say the whole thrust of this Uruguay round is to eliminate United States unilateralism under section 301 and super 301. We know from the finding already made by the European commission, and I will read:\n\n       The GATT does not allow for any unilateral interpretation \n     of the rights and obligations of the contracting parties, nor \n     for unilateral action by any one of the contracting parties \n     aimed at inducing another contracting party to bring its \n     trade policies in conformity with GATT.\n\n\tThen, of course, on the next page it says specifically:\n\n       Accordingly, for the United States, this means that section \n     301 and its hybrids will have to undergo revision in order to \n     ensure compliance with the new WTO dispute settlement \n     structure.\n\tThey say no laws are changed. But, nevertheless they mentioned here a minute ago, the Senator from Massachusetts, the Consumers Union, and the American Bar Association--they are wonderful groups. But, nevertheless they are not the judges. The World Trade Organization and the dispute resolution panels--they are the judges. It is said we select them and the opposition selects one, and then WTO. We do not have a veto over that deciding party. We do not have a veto over the GATT agreement itself and the World Trade Organization. We have one man, one vote. Castro cancels us out.\n\tArticle 16, section 4, each member shall ensure the conformity of its laws under the obligations of the agreement. That is very simple and clear. Oh, it does not change the law automatically, Mr. President. But, nevertheless I tell you what it does do. It says you play along with this agreement that you signed and confirmed in a national Congress or you pay. You pay or play. You pay with sanctions that can be cross-indexed to other particular industries not even in the particular dispute.\n\tI asked them in the committee hearings, Mr. Ambassador Kantor, or any of them who came up, all of the officials. I said show me the page, the line that has the veto. I asked them today on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Show me the page, the line and do not give me this gobbledygook about consensus because they say, yes, it goes to consensus, and the next line says you cannot get together by consensus. Then the World Trade Organization, one man, one vote, one country, one vote.\n\tWith respect to the budget itself, a moment ago when they talked about the $750 billion tax cut. Of course, it is a tax. I mean it is a tax increase. Here we have a $31 billion deficit that they are going to have a waiver on the point of order, my distinguished colleague from West Virginia.\n\tI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter of July 15 by 25 Senators, asking that you join us in opposing any effort to waive the provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1994.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: We write to ask that you join us in \n     opposing any effort to waive provisions of the Budget \n     Enforcement Act for the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade (GATT) implementing legislation and avoid the \n     requirement that such legislation be fully funded.\n       Some of us support GATT, others of us oppose the agreement, \n     and still others of us have yet to make a decision, but we \n     are united in our concern about the precedent waiving the \n     provisions of the Budget Enforcement Act could set, \n     undermining our ability to make further progress in lowering \n     the deficit now and in the future.\n       We are confronted on a regular basis with having to make \n     tough decisions on worthy programs because of our budget \n     rules, and rightly so. The federal budget deficit must be \n     brought down.\n       That GATT is significant is clear, but the importance of an \n     issue should not determine whether or not it should conform \n     with the budget rules we have set for ourselves. Indeed, the \n     true test of our resolve to bring the deficit under control \n     is our willingness to apply the budget rules to the important \n     issues.\n       We recognize your commitment to passing GATT implementing \n     legislation. Your support for making that legislation comply \n     with the budget rules will be all the more meaningful because \n     of that commitment, and we hope you will join us in this \n     effort to oppose any effort to dodge this responsibility.\n           Sincerely,\n           Russ Feingold, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Chuck Grassley, \n             Jesse Helms, Dirk Kempthorne, Dale Bumpers, Strom \n             Thurmond, Larry Pressler, Dave Durenberger, Lauch \n             Faircloth, Larry E.

Dorgan, Alfonse D'Amato, Herb Kohl.\n                                  ____\n\n                                Executive Office of the President,\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 8, 1994.\n     Hon. Larry Pressler,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Pressler: Thank you for your letter to the \n     President of July 15th, requesting that the President oppose \n     any effort to waive the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) for the \n     General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) implementing \n     legislation. The Administration shares your concern about \n     such efforts.\n       The Administration firmly believes that the recently \n     completed Uruguay Round accords under the General Agreement \n     on Tariffs and Trade will increase economic growth, here in \n     the United States and around the world. We know that our view \n     is shared by many others in the economic and international \n     trade communities. This Administration has continued to work \n     to bring those negotiations to a conclusion to increase \n     economic growth in the future.\n       Nonetheless, we do not believe it is necessary to sacrifice \n     budget discipline to pass GATT in the Congress. In fact, we \n     fear that if Congress were to reverse the progress that has \n     been made on budget discipline over the past few years, we \n     could lose more than we would gain from the GATT accords.\n       Instead, I hope that we can work with you and other Members \n     of Congress to find offsets for the costs of GATT \n     implementation.\n       Thank you again for your letter. I hope to be working with \n     you soon on these matters.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Alice M. Rivlin,\n                                                  Acting Director.\n\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there it is as the Senators see it, at least 20 of them.\n\tHere we go. Alice M. Rivlin, a letter dated August 8 to Senator Pressler. ``Nonetheless,'' says Ms. Rivlin, the Acting Director at that particular time, and now the Director of the Executive Office of the President Office of Management and Budget.\n\n       Nonetheless, we do not believe it is necessary to sacrifice \n     budget discipline to pass GATT in the Congress.\n\n\tBut that is what they are doing, fixing the jury. I have talked to the Senators. ``The President just called me.'' That is not what his Budget Director said. We do not believe in sacrificing the discipline with respect to export jobs.\n\tFifty companies in that Fortune 500, the top 50 companies account for over half of the total U.S. manufacturing exports. As a result, we look to see whether they are increasing as they talk, increasing the jobs.\n\tUnder those export industries, aircraft parts, since 1987 lost 67,000 jobs, industrial machinery, 284,000, electronic and electrical equipment, 694,000, transportation equipment, 278,000.\n\tI ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the list be printed in the Record. I can read them all. But I want to make sure that they understand that export jobs are not the ones created.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       JOBS LOST TO THE CHRONIC U.S. TRADE DEFICIT                                                      \n                                      [Allocation to States by gross State product Shares; in millions of dollars]                                      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Merchandise Trade deficit exports, f.a.s./imports,    Trade Related job loss: U.S. Govt. estimates $1 \n                                                                        customs                               billion of net exports=20,000 jobs        \n                      State                      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      1991         1992         1993      1994 est.       1991         1992         1993      1994 est. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    United States total.........................

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we print in the Record, the Business Week 21st Century, this weekly edition of Business Week entitled ``High-Tech Jobs All Over the Map.''\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n         The Skills Explosion--High-Tech Jobs All Over The Map\n\n       As training and experience in less developed countries \n     rapidly improve, the West's workers may be left behind.\n       If any megatrend kindles hopes of producing megajobs for \n     skilled Americans, it is the coming of age of the Information \n     Revolution. U.S. companies are already setting industry \n     standards and pioneering virtually all of the key \n     technologies. Plus, America possesses the wealth of creative \n     talents needed to lead the coming wave of newfangled \n     software, multimedia gadgetry, and ingenious programming. \n     There will be jobs enough, it would seems for anyone with a \n     decent education.\n       But trek out to the laboratory of Kenneth Chou in a new \n     business park on the outskirts of Beijing, and you begin to \n     wonder. There 30 artists, software engineers, and computer \n     programmers at Chou's Bilingual Educational Computing Inc. \n     are busily designing interactive CD-ROM programs, complete \n     with voice and animation, for teaching English. Since 1991, \n     Bilingual has sold 50,000 sets of its First Aid English \n     multimedia lessons, now $55 apiece, to institutes from Japan \n     to Germany.\n       In fact, practically anywhere you go in Asia these days, \n     local workers can be found doing the same highly skilled \n     tasks you would expect to find in Palo Alto, Boston, or \n     Tokyo. At a Silicon Graphics Inc. joint venture in Bangalore, \n     India, software designers earning $300 a month are developing \n     programs to produce three-dimensional images for diagnosing \n     brain disorders. In a sleek industrial park in Singapore, \n     engineers design future generations of personal digital \n     assistants for Hewlett-Packard Co. In Taiwan, Hong Kong, and \n     South China, research and development teams are at work on \n     multimedia gizmos ranging from digital answering machines to \n     interactive computers for children.\n       New World Order. The message is that anybody who still \n     thinks the only competitive edge of developing countries is \n     cheap, unskilled labor has a lot of catching up to do. One of \n     the less-heralded developments in the emergence of a global \n     economy is that there is an increasingly better balance of \n     skills in the world. The worldwide shift to market economies, \n     steady improvements in education, and decades of overseas \n     training by multinationals are all producing a global \n     workforce in fields ranging from product development to \n     finance and architecture that is capable of performing tasks \n     once reserved for white-collar workers in the West.\n       What's more, dizzying advances in telecommunications are \n     making these workers more accessible than ever. As a result, \n     just as Westerners learned in the 1970s and 1980s that \n     manufacturing could be moved virtually anywhere, today it is \n     getting easier to shift knowledge-based labor as well.\n       Conventional notions of comparative advantage are getting \n     blurred in the process. In electronics, cities such as \n     Taipei, Edinburgh, Singapore, and Penang (Malaysia), which \n     are far away from the end-user and technological \n     breakthroughs, already have emerged as global product-\n     development hubs.\n       Service providers, too, can now spread across the globe. \n     Citibank taps local skills in India, Hong Kong, Australia, \n     and Singapore to manage data and develop products for its \n     global financial services. Houston-based M. W. Kellogg Co. \n     farms out detailed architectural-engineering work for power \n     and chemical plants it builds around the world to a partner \n     in Mexico. And everyone from law firms to U.S. nonprofit \n     groups cuts costs in managing and analyzing documents by \n     hiring ``outsourcers'' such as International Data Solutions \n     Inc. in Herndon, Va., which employs thousands of workers in \n     the Philippines.\n       What makes Third World brainpower so attractive is price \n     (charts). a good computer circuit-board designer in \n     California, for example, can pull down $60,000 to $100,000 a \n     year. Taiwan is glutted with equally qualified engineers \n     earning around $25,000. In India or China, you can get top-\n     level talent, probably with a PhD, for less than $10,000.\n       Tedious tasks. Where the big savings can come is in the \n     ``back end'' of product development--the painstaking work of \n     turning a conceptual design into blueprints, computer code, \n     or working models and in testing the final product. Take \n     Bilingual's cd-roms. With wages ranging from $75 a month for \n     a Chinese keypunch operator to $400 for a good artist, \n     Bilingual can produce a cd-roms product for anywhere from a \n     quarter to one-tenth of the cost in the U.S. In a business as \n     tough as cd-roms, where the few titles that succeed can have \n     a shelf life of less than a year, keeping costs under control \n     is critical.\n       It doesn't matter that few of the staff speak English. \n     Bilingual writes the scripts, the most creative part, in \n     Taiwan. The rest of the work, from, animation to voice-over \n     recording, is done on the mainland. ``When you get down to \n     it,'' says Chou, ``about 80% of the labor in producing \n     software is very tedious.''\n       Since marketing and creativity will always be in hot \n     demand, graduates of Stanford University business school or \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology probably needn't worry. \n     Trouble is, the back end happens to be where millions of \n     Americans are employed. And they're well-paying jobs: \n     software designers, bookkeepers, mechanical engineers, \n     draftsmen, libraries. Most require a bachelor's degree or at \n     least a few years in a polytechnic institute. Yet in theory, \n     at least, none of these jobs can be regarded as secure from \n     foreign competition. ``Just as with the move of manufacturing \n     overseas, you're going to see a increasing flux of technical \n     jobs out of the U.S.,'' predicts Intel Corp. Chief Operating \n     Officer Craig R. Barrett. ``We don't have any protected \n     domains anymore.''\n       New view. Policymakers have only begun to ponder what all \n     this means for American, European, and even Japanese white-\n     collar workers. Until recently, it seemed the impact would be \n     minimal. Groups such as the National Science Foundation have \n     been warning that as the Digital Age makes industries \n     technology-intensive, there will be an acute shortage of \n     technicians in the West. Skilled workers displaced by \n     outsourcing would simply move on to higher value-added \n     sectors.\n       But this view is being challenged. In a jarring keynote \n     speech to the annual convention of the Institute of \n     Electrical & Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in September, Edith \n     Holleman, counsel to the House Science, Space & Technology \n     Committee, warned that exciting new high-tech jobs ``are \n     not reserved for you in the First World.'' What's more, \n     she said, high-tech breakthroughs in the U.S. ``cannot be \n     counted on to spin off into domestic manufacturing \n     facilities providing employment for many engineers and \n     skilled workers.''\n       Consider what already has happened to the PC motherboard, \n     the circuit card loaded with chips that runs every computer. \n     Five years ago, most motherboards--regarded as the guts of a \n     PC--were produced in-house by U.S. computer makers. Today, \n     some 60% are subcontracted to Taiwanese companies and their \n     army of 150,000 information-technology engineers. And now, \n     the Taiwanese are becoming a major force in customized \n     computer-chip design and local-area networks. Little wonder, \n     it would seem, that unemployment among U.S. electrical \n     engineers hit a record 5.9% this summer, according to the \n     IEEE, and the situation is expected to get worse.\n       Still, a host of factors suggests that the outflow of \n     skilled work to cheap Third World havens is only a temporary \n     phenomenon. For one, the wage gap is bound to close \n     eventually, as technicians and engineers in the developing \n     world command more. Also, the Information Superhighway is a \n     two-way street, allowing U.S. and European engineers to \n     compete for work in Asia as well as the reverse. Moreover, \n     experts fear that education systems in Thailand, Malaysia, \n     Indonesia, and Mexico, among others, are not producing enough \n     skilled workers for those nations to guarantee advancement up \n     the industrial ladder.\n       ROBO-TECH. What's more, as factories in the Third World \n     turn to state-of-the-art automation to stay competitive with \n     domestic rivals and meet international quality standards, \n     that automation could threaten Third World job growth. \n     Meanwhile, technological leaps in areas such as text and \n     voice recognition and computer-aided design software that \n     reduce the time-consuming code-writing process will wipe out \n     jobs in service industries.\n       But for now, the ground is shaking under skilled workers as \n     Western companies take advantage of big wage disparities. \n     Anyone who has witnessed the exceptional performances of \n     Chinese, Indian, and Vietnamese emigres in U.S. schools and \n     labs knows that developing countries are loaded with talent. \n     The rapid growth of Asia's economies means they can now apply \n     their skills at home.\n       A wild card in the global skills game is \n     telecommunications. Consider Hong Kong's Johnson Electric \n     Holdings Ltd., a $195 million producer of micromotors that \n     power hair dryers, blenders, and auto features such as door \n     locks, windshield wipers, and automatic windows. With \n     factories in South China and an R&D base in a Hong Kong \n     industrial park, Johnston is thousands of miles away from a \n     leading auto maker.\n       This hasn't stopped the company from virtually cornering \n     the market for the electric gizmos it makes for Detroit's Big \n     Three. ``My customer is right here,'' says Managing Director \n     Patrick Wang Shui Chung, pointing to a videoconferencing unit \n     in the midst of hundreds of engineers. For two hours each \n     morning, design teams ``meet'' face-to-face with their \n     customers in the U.S. and Europe. Concepts are transmitted \n     from R&D centers in North America and Europe to Hong Kong, \n     where 200 engineers on a network of workstations develop the \n     motors using CAD/CAM software.\n       Their specifications are programmed directly into Hong Kong \n     production lines. The process is so streamlined that Johnson \n     can take a concept and deliver a prototype to the U.S. in six \n     weeks. To cut that time even further, the company is \n     investing in more advanced telecommunications to link its \n     9,000-worker operations in China. ``Today, your location \n     doesn't matter,'' says Wang. ``It's turnaround time. I want \n     to be the fastest gun in the world.''\n       Knowhow. The pioneers in bringing foreign technicians into \n     the global workforce are multinationals such as Motorola, \n     Hewlett-Packard, and Philips Electronics. Originally, they \n     set up plants in Asia chiefly for cheap labor. But many of \n     these assembly shops have gathered so much knowhow that they \n     now do critical design-and-engineering tasks.\n       A good example is Motorola Inc. Its paging-device plant in \n     Singapore boasts 75 local engineers and a new $35 million \n     building dubbed the Motorola Innovation Center. There, the \n     Scriptor pager was developed almost entirely by Singaporean \n     industrial designers using Singaporean software.\n       Hewlett-Packard has gone even further. It encourages each \n     of its manufacturing sites around the world to become the \n     global base for its product. Penang, Malaysia, has become a \n     global center for many components used in HP's microwave \n     products and is taking over responsibility for computer hard-\n     disk drives from Palo Alto. And in Singapore, a plant HP \n     opened in 1970 to assemble keyboards is now the global R&D \n     and production center for its line of portable ink-jet \n     printers. It is also the base for all handheld devices, such \n     as persona digital assistants and calculators.\n       Intensive training by multinationals is another reason that \n     skills are rising rapidly. A key training locale is the \n     Penang Skills Development Center, a 360-student \n     polytechnic institute funded by 57 foreign companies and \n     the government for local high school and university \n     graduates. Intel donated a $140,000 microprocessor lab. A \n     20,000-square-foot ``team building park'' for leadership \n     training and a clean room for vacuum technology came \n     courtesy of Seagate Technology Inc., which has a big hard-\n     disk plant nearby, Motorola Inc. kicked in $320,000 for PC \n     software training and a bachelor-of-science program.\n       India, China, and Russia are closely watching the successes \n     of Malaysia and Singapore. The potential of all three is \n     staggering given the heavy emphasis their schools place on \n     math and basic science. In these countries, notes Intel's \n     Barrett: ``I see a ton of people who are as technically well-\n     educated as people in the U.S.''\n       India has the second-largest pool of English-speaking \n     scientific talent in the world, after the U.S. This includes \n     100,000 software engineers and technicians and hundreds of \n     companies, many locally owned, that supply software to \n     Western customers. The number of engineers could double by \n     the end of the decade. And a monthly salary of $800 for an \n     engineer with five years' experience is enough to place a \n     worker squarely in India's upper-middle class.\n       Central Europe also is peppered with brilliant scientists \n     rapidly being discovered and unleashed. The most promising \n     spots as production bases by 2020, according to a study of \n     404 European locations last year by Cologne-based market \n     researcher Empirica, are Bratislava (in Slovakia), Western \n     Bohemia (in the Czech Republic), Gyor-Sopron (Hungary), and \n     Poznan (Poland).\n       Germany's Robert Bosch has been making engine parts in the \n     Czech Republic since last year. ``Czech engineers have the \n     technical competence we require,'' says Heinz G. Grewe, \n     Bosch's head of management systems for gasoline engines. \n     Despite added startup and training costs, industry \n     analysts say, auto-parts makers can still save 30% by \n     outsourcing to Central Europe. Farther east, in Russia, \n     most multinationals have been slow to exploit the huge \n     pool of technologists who worked in the former Soviet \n     Union's defense industries. But pioneers such as Sun \n     Microsystems Inc. and ABB Asea Brown Boveri (Holdings) \n     Ltd., which already employ thousands of Russians, are \n     bullish, particularly about the hard-driving younger \n     generation that is eager to get rich (page 128).\n       Well-stocked waters. The deepest pool of untapped skills is \n     in China. Dataquest Inc., the research firm, estimates that \n     there are at least 350,000 information-technology engineers \n     in Chinese research institutes, state companies, and \n     universities. The average salary: about $105 a month. And \n     with the Chinese government placing electronics, \n     telecommunications, and software industries high on its list \n     of priorities, colleges across the country are preparing to \n     train hundreds of thousands more (page 126).\n       Multinationals are fishing in these well-stocked waters. \n     Northern Telecom Ltd. just opened a lab at the 10,500-student \n     Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications that will \n     soon employ 250 engineers. NT will work with faculty and \n     students on cellular phones, multimedia-transmission devices, \n     and software. In the northern city of Tianjin, Motorola will \n     have 3,000 workers making semiconductors and telecom \n     equipment by yearend. Meanwhile, AT&T, which is just getting \n     started in China, plans to link up the telecom plants it has \n     scattered across the country.\n       For now, these facilities will focus on the enormous \n     telecom needs of China. But it's only a matter of time before \n     Chinese engineers start playing key R&D roles in products \n     sold globally. ``All of our joint ventures can be technical \n     centers in their businesses,'' says AT&T China Inc. Human \n     Resources Director Albert Siu. ``I've never found people more \n     open to learning. They soak up everything.''\n       Many of the lessons companies are learning in high tech can \n     also be applied to the West's other big job generator; \n     services. There, the potential of offshore skilled labor is \n     just beginning to be tapped. For more than a decade, \n     companies such as American Airlines Inc. and Citicorp have \n     been loading tons of ticket stubs, credit-card receipts, and \n     insurance forms onto planes headed for places such as the \n     Dominican Republic or the Philippines, home of low-paid \n     keypunch operators.\n       Many experts think high-end services can also be farmed out \n     to overseas workers. Why not let specially trained Filipino \n     accountants do much of the grunt work in preparing tax \n     returns for multinationals? Or how about outsourcing the \n     legal research for expensive product-liability cases? Using \n     CD-ROM libraries, paralegals in India could churn out the \n     mountain of writs and affidavits for such cases at a deep \n     discount. Anupam P. Puri, managing director of McKinsey & \n     Co.'s Bombay office, says such task transfers are long \n     overdue. ``Most of our multinational clients are still very \n     behind in seeing how they can redistribute service work \n     around the world,'' he says.\n       Regulatory hurdles remain, of course. But the technological \n     barriers are falling fast. International Data Solutions, for \n     example, scans case and client files for U.S. law firms and \n     transmits them in digital form via satellite to the \n     Philippines. There, workers organize and index the documents \n     so they can be readily retrieved by a computer network in the \n     U.S. International Data employs two full-timers in Virginia--\n     and up to 3,000 Filipinas. ``With the Information \n     Superhighway revolution, this trend is accelerating \n     dramatically,'' says International Data President Kenneth R. \n     Short. ``It really doesn't matter where the work is done as \n     long as quality, price, and service are right.''\n       Broader View. In the construction industry, Houston's M. R. \n     Kellogg has teamed up with Mexico's Bufete Industrial on \n     contracts to build petrochemical-refining systems worldwide. \n     After developing conceptual drawings on a computer, Kellogg \n     transmits them to Bufete, of which Kellogg owns 21 percent. \n     The Mexicans turn the drawings into detailed blueprints. The \n     arrangement, says Kellogg Manager Robert Salazar, ``makes us \n     competitive all over the world.''\n       While this flexibility sounds great for corporations, it \n     could be traumatic for professionals who are not well-\n     equipped for a global economy. As gaps between experience \n     levels and wages narrow around the world, skilled workers \n     will compete on a more equal footing. To profit from the \n     emerging trends, workers will require broader training than \n     is now provided by most education systems--in both the East \n     and the West.\n       Rather than focus on one discipline, for example, \n     professional workers will need to understand the economics \n     and technologies that are revolutionizing their industries. \n     In the banking world, ``the pure technologist is already \n     dead,'' says George P. DiNardo, Singapore-based chief \n     technology officer for Citibank's Asian consumer business. \n     ``And so is the pure businessperson.''\n       In electronics and telecommunications, engineers discarded \n     by Corporate America are taking advantage of cheaper access \n     to data and video networks by forming their own design houses \n     for Asian manufacturers. In many other fields, professionals \n     may have to similarly redefine their jobs in order to prosper \n     from the globalization of work rather than be at its mercy.\n\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the message is that anybody who still thinks the only competitive edge of the developing countries is cheap unskilled labor has a lot of catching up to do.\n\tMr. President, the Senator from Oregon referred to Intel. Well, here is what is happening at Intel. ``Just as with the move of manufacturing overseas, you are going to see an increasing flux of technical jobs outside of the United States,'' predicts Intel Corporation chief operating officer, Craig R. Bennett, in Business Week.\n  ``We don't have any protected domains anymore.''\n\tThen it goes on to say,\n\n       ``Consider what already has happened to the PC mother \n     board, the circuit card loaded with chips and runs of \n     computer. Five years ago most mother boards, regarded as the \n     guts of a PC, were produced in-house by the U.S. computer \n     makers. Today, some 60 percent are subcontracted to Taiwanese \n     companies and their army of 150,000 information technology \n     engineers.\n\n\tOn and on, Mr. President. Dispelling that myth, I read from the Business Week of December 17, 1990. Here it is. I quote:\n\n       From all the fuss about the United States becoming more \n     export oriented, hardly any additional industries have joined \n     the exporting sector in the past 10 years.\n\n\tDo not keep coming up here talking export jobs.\n\n       Moreover, success overseas is not translating into job \n     creation at home.\n\n\tI quote then not reading the entire article, but quoting word for word:\n\n       These trends show no sign of abating. Using government \n     employment forecasts Business Week is projecting an increase \n     of 9.6 percent in the size of the exporting sector over the \n     next 10 years, far less than the projected national \n     employment growth of 14.6 percent. True, the exporting sector \n     could expand faster if import competing industries such as \n     machine tools, some domestic industries' machine tools and \n     our tools regain market share in the United States or if some \n     domestic industries learn how to be big exporters. Barring \n     these competitive gains, the proportion of Americans \n     producing for world markets will just continue to shrink in \n     the 1990's.\n\n\tMr. President, why can't we understand what is going on? We are in a decline.\n\tMr. President, Vermont is due to lose 6,100 jobs this year under GATT. The total loss from the trade deficit is 3,100,000 jobs.\n\tWith respect to being in decline, we have none other than Lee Kuan Yew, and I quote:\n\n       America is not the surplus country. It is Japan and \n     Germany. It is New York with the expertise but Tokyo and Bonn \n     with the actual cash.\n\n  ``The greatest problem for Americans,'' he said, ``was coming to terms emotionally with this shift, accepting in our guts that there is a permanent change in competitive position.''\n\tMr. President, read this language and listen to it very, very clearly. Talking about GATT agreements, ``These agreements, saying it word for word, offer new opportunities for all Americans. For American farmers the agreements expand world markets for American farm products. For American workers the agreements offer more jobs, higher income and more effective responses to unfair competition.\n\tThat was none other than Robert Strauss in 1979, the Tokyo round under which we are in. What did his Texas colleague and our good friend and former chairman of the Finance Committee say in 1987 with respect to that particular Tokyo round in 1987? I am reading word-for-word, because we never seem to learn. We listen to the same babble, technobabble and statistical babble, but we do not look at the reality. Here is what Senator Bentsen in the Finance Committee itself reported:\n\n       The Committee is concerned that the Tokyo round trade \n     negotiations and the legislative branch and executive branch \n     actions to implement the Tokyo round trade agreements, have \n     not had the effect of improving the American standard of \n     living as intended. Perhaps worst of all--\n\n\tListing many things.\n\n     the composition of the merchandise trade deficit has changed \n     from mainly an oil deficit--\n\n\tTalking about oil jobs, which was bad enough.\n\n     to mainly a manufacturing and agricultural deficit, which \n     strikes at the heart of U.S. export strength.\n       Agricultural exports alone have fallen from about $40 \n     billion in 1980 to about $25 billion in 1987. And if \n     petroleum prices in 1986 had been the same as in 1980, then \n     the 1986 trade deficit could well have been over $200 \n     billion. The mainstays of American trade competitiveness are \n     in trouble.\n\n\tThis is the now Secretary of Treasury.\n\n       By last year, West Germany surpassed the United States as \n     the world's leading exporter and Japan had 10 percent of the \n     world's exports in 1986, compared so 10.3 percent for the \n     United States, who may well move into second place in 1987. \n     The size and composition of the trade deficit have caused \n     retching adjustments on the American farm and American \n     industry and among American workers. For example, the \n     widening trade deficit reduced real potential GNP by nearly \n     20 percent in 1983 and 1984, according to the International \n     Trade Commission. The National Association of Manufacturers \n     found that 2 million fewer jobs were created as a result of \n     the growth of the trade deficit in this period. The deficit \n     deterioration of American high-wage industrial employment \n     concentrated employment growth this decade in the lower-wage \n     service sector.\n\n\tMr. President, how can you do it any better than that? What happens is, as we put in the Record on yesterday from Lars Erik Nelson--and I have the entire article. I will read a paragraph:\n\n       The economists keep foisting their theory on the Clinton \n     administration. No proposition enjoys greater unanimity among \n     economists than the idea that free trade will, on net, be a \n     win-win situation, says Bob Shapiro, a nondogmatic economist \n     at the Progressive Policy Institute. This is why, Shapiro \n     says, economists close their eyes to the social cost of free \n     trade. They don't know how to deal with the problem, but they \n     can't give up the economics of free trade. The fact is there \n     are significant social costs.\n\n\tThat is what the election in November was all about. Here we have 40 million living in poverty. Their take-home pay is 20 percent less; they are working longer hours and being paid less. We have gone from the biggest creditor Nation to the biggest debtor Nation. Our manufacturing, since 1985, has gone from 26 percent of the work force down to 16 percent. And the inner cities are in turmoil with crime and drugs and deprivation. Yet, they are telling us we are on ``a rising tide,'' as they said in the Washington Post. There is no rising tide. We are going out of business, and the social costs are there. Here the group that came to town for the middle class, Mr. President, is decimating the middle class.\n\tI heard the Senator from Texas earlier today say if he had a Republican President, he would vote for this. Well, on this particular trade policy, he has a Republican President, I can tell you this now, because we are not protecting the middle class, the jobs, and we are not striking out against the social instability caused by the unemployment, not striking out against the deficits caused by unemployment compensation, increased health and welfare costs, increased crime costs, and the like. We are not doing it. We are exacerbating it here with this debate this afternoon and with this vote.\n\tI reserve the remainder of my time.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeConcini). Who seeks recognition?\n\tMr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. On whose time does the Senator seek recognition?\n\tMr. BYRD. Mr. President, I believe the distinguished Senator from South Carolina has assured me that I might have 14 minutes?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from South Carolina yield 14 minutes?\n\tMr. HOLLINGS. I yield the time remaining to the Senator from West Virginia.\n\tMr. BYRD. Mr. President, GATT is a budget buster, any way you want to slice it. By itself, GATT would increase the deficit by more than $25 billion over the next 10 years. To partially offset this deficit increase, the pending bill includes a number of so-called ``revenue raisers,'' several of which I find very questionable.\n\tAmong those provisions is one which would repeal the 4-percent statutory minimum interest rate on U.S. savings bonds. Under current rules, a person can lose, at most, one month of interest. Under the repeal contained in this bill, a purchaser of U.S. savings bonds can lose up to 6 months worth of interest.\n\tIn other words, to help pay for this trade deal, we have gone so far as to undermine the U.S. savings bond. That same bond that we have for generations given to our grandchildren and to our sons and daughters will no longer be quite the dependable, sound investment it has been for decades--so that we can pay for GATT.\n\tWhile this GATT Uruguay round agreement may arguably be good for U.S. businesses, U.S. workers are placed at a competitive disadvantage under this agreement.\n\tFor businesses in developing countries, and motivated by a ``greatest-profits-at-lowest-cost'' mentality, a return to the world of Dickensonian sweatshops populated by underpaid, overworked, uneducated, and uncomplaining children will be irresistible.\n\tFor example, the export of U.S. jobs overseas has hit my own State of West Virginia hard over the years, as U.S. trade liberalization has made it more advantageous for firms to move manufacturing and assembly jobs overseas while still retaining easy access to the U.S. marketplace. While part of this decline is due to improvements in mechanization that require fewer workers to produce the same level of output, jobs in the coal mining industry in West Virginia have declined 28 percent just since 1988.\n\tThe once-thriving glassware and pottery industries in West Virginia have fallen victim to overseas competition as well. Jobs in the stone, clay, and glass products industries have declined 68 percent since 1960, dropping from 22,400 jobs to just 7,100 jobs in 1993, according to the Department of Labor. Tariff reductions will not help those companies.\n\tI am not generally opposed to trade agreements if those agreements are good for the United States and its workforce. But let me make clear that this country and the U.S. workforce in West Virginia and throughout the Nation are this Senator's paramount concerns.\n\tThere is a lot of leeway granted in this agreement to developing countries. The aid is to help improve the economies and the standards of living in other nations.\n\tFree trade is fine, but fair trade should be our goal. Yes, our workers are among the most productive in the world, but how can they hope to continue to compete with workers who are willing to toil for 50 cents an hour or 25 cents an hour?\n\tI cannot support the new, slick trend toward one-worldism which seems to be emerging with this agreement. It is almost as if some people in this country feel that the United States should sacrifice so that other nations can grow--that Uncle Sam ought to blush if the United States prospers much more than other nations.\n\tTo that point of view I say, beware of the ``idiot who praises with enthusiastic tone, all centuries but this and every country but his own.''\n\tSupport for this agreement flies in the face of the results of the recent election. Look at these poll figures. This poll was taken by the Yankelovich Partners survey, November 23 through November 27, 1994.\n\tDo you favor or oppose passing GATT?\n\tFifty-one percent oppose; 33 percent favor; 16 percent not sure.\n\tWhat about the budget wavier on GATT? Is it inappropriate or appropriate?\n\tSixty-seven percent inappropriate; twenty percent appropriate; thirteen percent not sure.\n\tWhat about deferring GATT over to the 104th Congress?\n\tSixty-three percent say defer it to a new Congress; 29 percent say let the old Congress do it; 8 percent not sure.\n\tThen, what about the WTO and U.S. law? Do you think the World Trade Organization should be able to override the laws of member nations?\n\tSeventy-two percent say ``no''; 17 percent say ``yes''; and 11 percent say ``not sure.''\n\tSo, Mr. President, the people's view is clear. Only in this convoluted Capitol City could doing what the people want ever be perceived as bad for the President.\n\tSome Senators have said to me that putting GATT over into the next Congress would damage the President if this waiver is rejected. Not according to these polls. Not according to these polls. In my view, rejecting this agreement as it presently stands would be doing a service to the President because it would give him time to go back to the table and get a better agreement--one that the people can support, as reflected in the poll. Those who support this Agreement now may say that they like what they are getting, but they may, in the final analysis, not get what they like.\n\tIt is a fig leaf that has been concocted by our distinguished Republican leader and the administration. First, the Review Commission cannot even review the record of the GATT panels, since the proceedings will be secret.\n\tMr. President, Members of the Senate who read the Scriptures, and I take it that Members do read the Scriptures, will remember Ezekiel and the valley of the dry bones. Senators have probably heard sermons on that scripture. The spirit of the Lord sat Ezekiel down in the valley of the dry bones. The Lord told Ezekiel to speak prophecies unto the dry bones and God would put sinews and flesh and skin on them; bones would be joined together, the four winds would breathe breath into these bones and they would come to life.\n\tMr. President, the Lord God kept his promise to Ezekiel. Flesh and sinews came upon the bones, and they lived, and stood upon their feet. Those old dry bones became an exceeding great army.\n\tMr. President, there will be no life breathed into this dry bone that has been worked out between the minority leader and the Administration. This fix will not work. This miracle will not work. This dry bone is a dry bone is a dry bone is a dry bone. And no amount of hocus pocus is going to change it.\n\tHere is the dry bone. Here it is in my hand. Here is the dry bone put out by the Bureau of National Affairs containing an explanation of the agreement between the Clinton Administration and Mr. Dole.\n\tWell, this dry bone will only serve as a rhetorical cover for Senators to vote for something that is seriously flawed.\n\tThis is an agreement in disguise. It is the Mrs. Doubtfire trade agreement. What you see is not necessarily anything like what you may get.\n\tMoreover, the WTO cannot be fixed by the Dole legislation. First, the Review Commission cannot even review the record of the panels, since the proceedings are secret.\n\tSecond, the idea that we would withdraw from the WTO after three adverse decisions in a five-year period flies in the face of a history in which we have never withdrawn from any important international organization. It would take a resolution passed by both Houses, and most probably over a President's veto--a highly unlikely scenario.\n\tSo this is a fig leaf only serving as rhetorical cover for Senators to vote for something that is seriously flawed and can be manipulated regularly against the best interests of our country and our people.\n\tThis fix is in the time-honored tradition of such legendary promises as, ``The check is in the mail.'' It ranks right up there with, ``Yes, I will still love you tomorrow,'' and ``Don't call me, I'll call you.''\n\tUnless one's I.Q. is lower than the air temperature, it should be plain that none of these so-called promises can be counted on. Neither can the Senate count on this so-called fix.\n\tHanging one's hat or one's vote on this so-called future fix may produce nothing but future shock. It is like trying to hang one's hat on a greasy flagpole. The hat will not stay and the people will not buy this fix as a cover for a bad vote.\n\tThe President and others argue that to delay action until next year will kill the GATT.\n\tHere we see this headline on Business Week, ``Delay Will Mean the Death of GATT.'' Don't you believe it. Don't you believe it.\n\tThat is a bogus scare tactic. The thing that might really kill GATT is scrutiny by 100 Senators and the discovery that it is a mega-turkey. The implementing legislation can be introduced again next year, and we have until next July to approve it. No other major nation's legislature has approved it--everyone is waiting to see what good old Uncle Sam will do. So there is no rush.\n\tWe hear the siren song of doom from the rafters of the White House. The dead will live again and flourish. Jesus, according to the scriptures, brought Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, back to life. Jesus brought back to life the son of the widow of Nain. He brought back to life the daughter of Jairus. And Elisha breathed new life into the child of the Shunammite woman. Let me assure Senators that miracles are not over. If this budget waiver is rejected today, this matter will only be put over until next year. It will be child's play for the spin doctors, for the trading giants to breathe life into the treaty. Just you wait and see what happens if we sustain the budget point of order. Then the spin doctors will go to work.\n\tAll our major allies will be brought together, those who have all been sitting on their hands, like Japan and our European allies, waiting to see what we will do. You can bet that if this Agreement is so great for everyone, there will be a rush for airline tickets to get on planes bound for Geneva. The restaurateurs in Geneva will be putting in extra supplies of turkey for the occasion.\n\tI would also argue that delay is not always bad. It does wonderful things for a cheese and and old wines and old violins. Delay will not kill this treaty. Delay may well improve this Agreement. I have every confidence that our President and our trade negotiators who have listened to this debate could then negotiate a better agreement in the months ahead.\n\tThe argument that delay until next year would kill the Uruguay Agreement is a G-string under the fig leaf of the so-called ``fix'' we have all heard about. It is the last argument. If all else fails, proponents can claim that a delay will kill this Agreement.\n\tFor these extremely important budget, institutional, and political reasons, I believe that the legislation before us today should be deferred until the next Congress, at a time when Senators will have had the time to study the Agreement more closely, and when there is ample time for debate and deliberation. And the way to accomplish this is to vote against the waiver.\n\tMr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from South Carolina has expired.\n\tWho yields time?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, how much time is left on each side?\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 1 hour and 4 minutes. The Senator from New York has 35 minutes.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I thank the Chair.\n\tMr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may need.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I think it was Disraeli, but I would not bet the mortgage on that, who once said there are three kinds of lies. There are lies, there are damned lies, and then there are statistics.\n\tWe have heard the statement made over and over that for every $1 billion of imports, 20,000 jobs are lost. That figure is premised on a study that said for every $1 billion of exports, 20,000 jobs are created. And those who choose to take that statistic and use it in their favor on imports has simply turned it on its head, as if 20,000 jobs for $1 billion of exports means 20,000 jobs lost with $1 billion of oil imports.\n\tLet me give you just two examples, then I have other points to touch on, where this just is not true.\n\tI have talked several times about the import of oil in this country. We imported last year about $44 billion worth of oil. We import this oil because we do not have, or have not chosen to look for, in one way or another, to get oil out of the ground in this country. We need the oil.\n\tFirst, the drilling for and the extraction of oil is capital intensive, not labor intensive. I doubt that there are 20,000 jobs associated with $1 billion worth of oil exports or $1 billion worth of oil imports.\n\tBut I want you to think what would happen in this country if we did not import $44 billion of oil. Do you think if we did not import it, we would create 880,000 jobs? That is 20,000 jobs for every $1 billion of imports.\n\tI will tell you what would happen if we did not import $44 billion of oil in this country. We would have an absolutely up- to-your neck depression in this country because this country runs on oil. We generate electricity with it; our industries run on it; we run our cars on it. And we do not have the capacity in this country to produce it immediately.\n\tI had indicated earlier we could produce it if we wanted to make it out of coal. We have a 400-year supply of coal, but it is expensive to make oil out of coal.\n\tI had the Library of Congress check for me--and I want to give them credit again, the Congressional Research Service, for the extraordinary research they do, because I only asked them yesterday.\n\tSouth Africa, of course, has produced oil out of coal for years. They had a trade embargo when the white-only government was in power and they could not import, so they had to produce it. And they have lots of natural resources. They produced oil out of coal and gasoline out of oil, but it was very expensive.\n\tThe Library of Congress said, yes, we have enough coal to make oil out of it. If we did, the Library of Congress' estimate is--and they did not want me to hold them too closely to it--that the cost of gasoline, if we produced it from coal in this country, would be between $3 and $4 a gallon instead of what we pay for it now. And, of course, home heating oil would go up equivalently; the oil we use to generate electricity would go up equivalently. I have no idea what that would do to inflation. I have not asked the Library of Congress to check about the impact of an increase in inflation, which would in turn increase interest rates, home mortgage rates, and everything else. My hunch is that approach is not going to help this country.\n\tSo let us put this bogeyman--that because we are importing $44 billion worth of oil, we are losing 880,000 jobs--to rest.\n\tNow, let me move to a study my friend from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, has cited over and over and over again. This is a study by Charles McMillion. He is a business consultant who testified against the GATT before the Commerce Committee. Mr. McMillion took this 20,000 figure and he calculated, therefore, what every State would lose in terms of jobs based upon $1 billion of imports in that State.\n\tStates have customs districts which keep track of imports. Oregon imported about $1.6 billion in imports through the Portland customs district. Therefore, he multiplied 1.6 times 20,000 and said Oregon would lose 32,000 jobs. Mr. McMillion says Oregon will lose 32,000 jobs because of imports.\n\tWell, Portland is the fourth largest importer of cars in the United States. Different ports excel at different things. Portland excels at importing cars. As a matter of fact, we are also the largest exporter for Hondas in the United States. They are made in Marysville, OH, trucked to Portland, and off they go throughout the world.\n\tFor the moment, just stick with the imports. Do you think that Oregon would have more jobs or fewer jobs in Oregon if we did not import cars? We do not make any cars in Oregon, but we do have longshoremen that unload cars and we have teamsters that drive the trucks upon which the cars are loaded. We have a rather thriving little industry in Portland on importing cars. We are not going to lose jobs because of these imports. We gain jobs.\n\tThat is the trouble with statistics. So I want to put aside statistics and I want to talk about real world cases, if I might.\n\tBefore I do, I want to emphasize the principal thing the United States asked out of this trading negotiation. I am going to quote a very short sentence from the Trade Act of 1988.\n\n       The principal negotiating objective of the United States \n     with respect to dispute settlement is to provide for more \n     effective and expeditious regulation of the disputes and \n     enable better enforcement of United States rights.\n\n\tWe bring far more cases in the GATT--we have not yet gotten to the World Trade Organization; it is not established yet--complaining about overseas trade practices than are brought against us. Say we get into a dispute with Germany and we ask a GATT panel to look into it. The GATT panel is a group that listens to the two sides and says who is right and who is wrong. Under the current GATT arrangement, even if we win, it is not enforceable unless the loser agrees.\n\tWell, the loser never liked us to begin with. That is why we are having this dispute panel settle things. So we insisted in the Uruguay round negotiations that these panel decisions involving trade disputes between countries have some modicum of enforcement.\n\n\tUnder GATT, and I see no reason it is going to change under the World Trade Organization, we won 80 percent of all the cases in which we were a complainant. It is no wonder we want them enforceable. And it is understandable why we bring more cases. We are a more open country. We allow things easier into this country than other countries allow into their countries. And we are asking for a level playing field. We want in. We want as much access to their countries as they have to ours.\n\tThe reason we brought all these cases in the past is that we have not had that access and this trade agreement that we are about to enact--and I am confident we have the votes to enact it--is going to lower the barriers for our getting into these countries. The agreement makes these panel decisions enforceable unless all of the countries to the panel agree not to enforce it. It is just the opposite of what we had before.\n\tBefore you had to have all of the countries that are a part of the panel dispute agree to enforce the panel decision. Under this new agreement, the panel decision is enforceable unless all of the countries disagree. The only reason that would happen is as follows: The United States has a case with Germany. We win. And then Germany says, ``OK, you win. Now we negotiate some kind of agreement. You have won. We concede that, but we really do not want to give up on what you have won but we will give you some other trading preference.'' And we negotiate and say OK. Then both parties would agree not to enforce the panel decision. And that is going to happen from time to time with both sides. So we have won in the GATT what we hoped we would win.\n\tI listened to Senator Byrd from West Virginia talk about industries in his State and what is happening. I want to take just a cross-section of industries in Oregon. Not necessarily unique, not just timber products--we are a big timber producer--but a cross-section, and give you an example of what industries big and small can do in foreign trade.\n\tTake Smith Frozen Foods, of Weston, OR. Weston is a town 225 miles east of Portland in the modestly populated wheat and cattle section of our State. Smith Frozen Foods almost went bankrupt 10 years ago. Then the young son of the founder took it over and built it up, now, to 800 employees. It processes frozen peas, carrots, corn, and beans and what not. About 125 of the 800 employees are pretty much directly related to the sale of the products overseas.\n\tI might say, the founder's son is an extraordinary man. In fact this body would appreciate his success. He spent 10 years building up this business. Then, in 1992, he decided to go into politics and was elected to the Oregon State Senate in November of 1992 and took office in January of 1993. Perhaps in May or June of 1993 the Republican leader in the Oregon State Senate resigned, for whatever reason. And this young man, Gordon Smith, was selected as the leader in his first 4 months in the legislature.\n\tThe Republicans took control of the senate this year and he will be the senate president in his second session of the senate. This is an extraordinary talent at business and politics. That is Smith Frozen Foods.\n\tAnother company is Met One of Grants Pass, OR. Grants Pass is a town of 15,000, 260 or 270 miles south of Portland and about 450 miles north of San Francisco. Again, here we have a very small town with a small airport and a trucking service on the interstate. It is not a major metropolitan area. Met One makes indoor pollution monitoring devices, especially lab equipment monitoring devices. It has 110 employees, 35 of them related to sales overseas. This business is growing tremendously. As we are becoming more pollution conscious throughout the world, both indoors and outdoors, this company is doing very well.\n   Medford Steel, of Medford, OR, is another company 300 miles south of Portland and about 400 miles north of San Francisco. It makes industrial parts for mining and manufacturing and has 135 employees, 40 of them related to overseas trade.\n\tSabroso, I have talked about so often on this floor, is also located in Medford, OR, has 160 employees, about half of them involved in foreign trade. This company takes fruit and makes a puree out of it. It is the largest supplier of the base for baby foods for the three principal baby foods in the United States: Beechnut, Heinz and Gerber's. I used posters yesterday showing labels from their cans: one in Arabic, one in Spanish. They sell all over the world. They look at this agreement as an absolute bonanza and an opportunity. Operating out of Medford, OR.\n\tWing-Lynch makes photo-processing equipment. It is a small company, 23 employees; 5 of them responsible for foreign trade.\n\tEnway is one of my favorites. Enway, a 20-employee firm, sells everything they make overseas. They make frozen processed potatoes and they have found some way--secret or not--of processing them and selling them overseas and doing it wonderfully and successfully.\n\tThen let me mention a couple of lumber companies. North Douglas Wood Products in Drain, OR, is 200 miles away from Portland; 65 of their 70 employees were involved in overseas sales. Starfire Lumber in Cottage Grove has a similar experience.\n\tOne of my favorites, though, is Vanport Lumber, because I remember a particular circumstance. You have to understand the humor in some of this, as to how old-line American industries look at things as opposed to newer industries. When I first came to the Senate, elected in 1968, one of the big debates we were having with the Japanese and with other countries was over what we called size standards. We wanted them to buy our two-by-fours. Of course, do not worry they are on the metric system and they do not measure the same way we do. Any other normal business says, ``What does my customer want? I will make it for my customer.'' The American wood products industry wanted Japan to change its measuring standards so that they could buy our standard two-by-fours.\n\tJapan is very conscious about high-quality wood with their post and beam interior construction and exposed wood. They do not want bad wood and they want it exactly measured. We must have gone through 10 years of this debate on size standards.\n\tThen along comes Adolf Hertrich. I think he was either Swiss or German by birth and spoke English with a Germanic accent. I do not think he had a background, really, in lumber. I do not know when he came to this country or how, but he forms this Vanport Lumber Co. and produces lumber using relatively outmoded equipment, as a matter of fact, then. He was convinced you could crack this Japanese market and he had enough money to last initially 2 or 3 years.\n\tHe would go over there and explain this is what he could do and he would show the quality he could produce. Then ``no, they were not satisfied yet.'' Finally, in about 1981, he got the Japanese to agree they would send an inspector over and look at his plant. He would have to pay for it, have to put him up, have to feed him, but the inspector would come over and look at his plant and maybe they would buy some things if he could do what they wanted. He had a Japanese inspector over for a couple of years. Finally, by 1983 he convinced them he could, indeed, produce the wood they wanted. They did not have to have their inspectors there anymore. And hallelujah, it had taken him 5 years to get to this place.\n\tI did not know him at this time. I discovered him in about 1984 when he calls me and he has a problem. Bear in mind he has 220 employees and is selling all of his product to Japan. He calls me because the Internal Revenue Service refused to let him deduct a Japanese tea house he had built on his property to show buyers when they came over. IRS said this is not an ordinary and necessary business expense. You do not need a tea house.\n\tHe says all I do is sell to the Japanese. They use this wood for tea houses. I want to show them what we have.\n\tI went out there. Picture this. Here is Adolf Hertrich, speaking with his Germanic English. My chief of staff is an English woman who speaks like Eliza Doolittle at the end of ``My Fair Lady'' with very proper English. Then there was a Japanese buyer there speaking in sort of Japanese English. And me--whatever. We all sit down with our feet under the table in the Japanese tea house, and are served tea by a woman dressed in the Japanese outfit. After hearing English English from the administrative assistant and Japanese-English from the Japanese buyer and the German-English, finally the IRS gave up and let him construct the tea house. But we had to go through that. But here is an example of a guy who says, ``I know I can do it.''\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Yes, by all means.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. On what he has been saying about this combination in the State of Oregon, you are the largest importer of cars on the west coast.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. We are the fourth-largest importer of cars in the United States.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. And you export.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. We are the largest exporters----\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. It is a practice that has been in place, understand, as long as this Republic. I took the occasion of this debate to read the Report on Manufacturers, Communication to the House of Representatives, December 5, 1791 from Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury. He was saying we cannot, need not remain a simply pure agricultural nation. We can manufacture and we can trade. And he spoke the wonderful phrase--he had that wonderful language and he was a New Yorker at this point, as you know--he spoke of those who would sacrifice the interests of a mutually beneficial intercourse to the vain project of selling everything and buying nothing. Have we not heard some of that on this floor?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. As a matter of fact, that is some people's definition of a level playing field. They will buy from us, but we will buy nothing from them.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. We will sell to them and we will buy nothing from them.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Take another company, a big company, Tektronics. This is a company founded in the 1940's or 1950's by an Oregonian. The company invented a state-of-the-art oscilloscope that sold all over the world. This is the kind of business you cannot stay still in very long. They were up 25,000 employees one time at the top of the market maybe 15 or 20 years ago. They went way down. Now they have branched into all other kinds of things. They have about 4,500 employees, which is big for Oregon. It would be big in New York. Two thousand of their employees are directly involved in sales overseas in high-tech computer products.\n\tMorale II is a research subsidiary of United Parcel Service. They came up with a device to keep track of where packages were in the delivery system. I visited them when they were experimenting with the device.\n\tBut they thought to themselves, ``Wait a minute, wouldn't this be a wonderful thing for police departments,'' or ``Wouldn't this be a wonderful thing for any company that delivers to be able to, by satellite, communicate up and back and on your screen have an entire grid of a city you can push buttons and change the grid and exactly tell where your truck is in the city.''\n\tThe police thought it was a wonderful idea. They can tell exactly where the police car is. Without even having to call them, you know where it is.\n\tThis company has been very successful in moving beyond just products for the United Parcel Service. Obviously, navigation equipment is a natural.\n\tLektro is located in Warrenton, OR, on the Oregon coast, about 110 miles from Portland. It is a small company with 20 employees. They make aircraft towing devices. Those things you see hooked up on the front of trucks that drag planes around. They sell these all over the country and are involved in world trade. When I first saw them, they were operating out of an old airplane hangar. They are very successful.\n\tYesterday, I mentioned Denton Plastics. They are a fun company. I discovered, by the way, since yesterday, they have 40 employees. Denton recycles plastics, such as, the sacks from grocery stores, the sacks from dry cleaners, and plastic wraps from frozen food. They put them into something like a vat and heat it quickly. They turn it, grind it, take all the color out, and it comes out in little black pellets. Then they sell them around the world in Korea, in China. People make toys, garbage pails, et cetera, out of the pellets. Denton, with 40 employees, is the biggest company north of Los Angeles and west of the Mississippi River in this business. Denton is an excellent example that you do not have to be a big company to be, relatively speaking, a giant in an industry.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. I have learned that.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. This is the amazing thing we all learned in our States. I wager the Senator from New York has had the same experience. You go around and run across companies you never heard of that are doing very well in foreign trade, and they have a handful of employees. They have a niche that they are doing well at.\n\tSo when people say America cannot compete, I just look at these examples in Oregon of all kinds of different companies. But there is almost one thing they all have in common: Brains and patents, trademarks or copyrights--intellectual property, as we call them--things that they have thought up that nobody else thought up and they have protected with a patent or a copyright and they are selling it around the world.\n\tIf there is any single thing where there is a quantum leap forward in this GATT agreement, it is in the protection of what we call intellectual property, patents, copyrights, trademarks around the world. All it can do is benefit these companies.\n\tI will make one last comment about these companies. Not a single one of these companies is a minimum-wage company. Some of them are not high wage, but there is not a single one that is minimum wage. Some of them are in the $7 to $8 an hour bracket, some in the $9 to $10, some of them more. But how often have we heard on this floor that you cannot compete with Bangladesh or India paying $1, $1.50 an hour? Without exception, every one of these companies is competing.\n\tI will use a last example, and then I will close because this is a company everyone has probably heard of: Freightliner. They make those large trucks and cabs that you see on the highway. Freightliner has a large plant in Portland with over 2,000 workers, a large plant in North Carolina with over 2,000 workers, and another plant in Cleveland, NC. This is high-wage employment.\n\tIn Portland, the plant is unionized, organized by the International Association of Machinists. At the high end of their production floor workers, counting fringe benefits, earn about $25 an hour. About a third of that is fringe benefits, and that is the high end of the production work.\n\tAt the moment, there is a 20 percent tariff on trucks going into Mexico. So Freightliner packages up its trucks in kit form and sends them to Mexico where they are assembled. If you send them that way, the tariff does not apply. At the moment, about 10 kits a day are going out of the North Carolina plant to Mexico.\n\tI talked to the president of the company yesterday morning. He said the 20 percent tariff is scheduled to come down to zero in the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico. Around 1998, the tariff will be reduced enough where it will be economically justifiable to make the entire truck in the United States instead of the kit.\n\tAt that stage, they are going to quit sending the kits to Mexico and make the trucks here and send them down in final form. Their U.S. workers make $25 an hour. Do not tell me we cannot compete.\n\tFreightliner just landed a contract with Israel for 800 to 1,200 trucks which will be made in its North Carolina plant. That is a big order, having to compete with trucks apparently made in India or trucks apparently made in Brazil, or wherever trucks are made. Do not tell me we cannot compete.\n\tTonight, in about an hour, we are going to have a chance to vote up or down on this agreement. A vote for this agreement is a vote to give the green light to the best companies in America--and they are not all big, most of them, as a matter of fact, are small--to compete throughout this world on a much fairer basis than they have been able to compete to date.\n\tA no vote is a vote to say, no, we really cannot do it when State after State, company after company, even under adverse circumstances today, are proving they can do it.\n\tSo I say to the chairman, Senator Moynihan, it has been a thrilling time working with him on this. There are moments when he and I had some fears and trepidations, I think. I cross my fingers; I think we now have the votes. For the good of this country, I hope in the next hour that overwhelmingly we pass this agreement.\n\tI thank the Chair.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, may I congratulate my future chairman and past chairman for the extraordinarily important exposition of the proposition. We are told that the Fortune 500 have not added an employee in the last 10 years. That is because American enterprise is working. Firms with 20 are going to 30. That is a 50-percent increase. And they are working all over the world.\n\tIf I may just one last time invoke that great West Indian, New Yorker, Alexander Hamilton, and his report on manufacturers, who talked about those misguided nations which sacrificed the interests of a mutually beneficial intercourse to the vain project of selling everything and buying nothing. It cannot be done. He saw the future, and it is here. The future is now. And the future will be ours if we seize it this evening. In an hour's time, we shall have the opportunity.\n\tI have the great honor and pleasure to yield 10 minutes to the learned, indefatigable--a great citizen, a great citizen of Pennsylvania--Senator Wofford.\n\tMr. WOFFORD addressed the Chair.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Wofford].\n\tMr. WOFFORD. Mr. President, that gentleman from the West Indies and New Yorker, Alexander Hamilton, began the Federalist Papers, as I recall the first sentence, the first proposition, by saying that it is reserved to the American people to determine to prove whether our fait accompli must be forever controlled by accident and force, or whether it is possible to determine it by reflection and choice.\n\tI congratulate the Members of this body in these last 2 days of debate for making sure that we make this important decision by reflection and choice.\n\tMr. President, after much thought, I rise in support of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade because I believe that on balance, it is good for our country. This agreement is far from perfect. No agreement forged in compromise is likely to be perfect, certainly not one negotiated with more than 120 nations.\n\tSome of the arguments voiced by opponents of GATT are strong and disturbing. They are right that GATT does not give America enough leverage in critical areas such as child labor, human rights, and environmental standards.\n\tMr. President, I believe it is wrong in trade negotiations for economic concerns to supersede all other concerns. It is wrong for the conditions of child labor described by Senator Wellstone this morning to be ruled out of consideration in any limitations on trade.\n\tOn questions of economic justice, human rights, and environmental health, the world should be able to look to America for leadership. We have a responsibility to provide that leadership--a responsibility that is not given adequate scope in the World Trade Organization provided for in this agreement.\n\tSo in the years to come, as we work within GATT and within the new World Trade Organization, and as we move forward to negotiate new bilateral trade agreements, we must honor that obligation to give leadership and work and fight to supplement the trade-only approach of GATT.\n\tThose of us who will be on the outside of government will have a responsibility to take action in these matters. For not all of the pressure needed to uphold America's ideals should come from government. Much of it must come from private citizens.\n\tWhen I was head of the International League for Human Rights, I often pressed the point that the concept of human rights goes beyond just political rights. It must include abuses of human rights in the form of the child labor portrayed by the Senator from Minnesota.\n\tDetermined support by private citizens helped change our trade policies with South Africa and helped bring about the changes that are underway in that nation today.\n\tSo concern about the exploitation of labor and the unfair competition that follows from it should not be the province solely of the American labor movement. It should be the concern of this Congress and of the American people at large.\n\tLet me add another vital point for the future American agenda.\n\tWhile I believe GATT will benefit most industries and most Americans, some industries and some workers and their families will suffer, at least in the short term.\n\tIn Pennsylvania, the textile and dairy industries--both already hard pressed--will lose certain protections on which they have come to rely.\n\tWe should take special responsibility for the fait accompli of such industries. This includes a responsibility to help those men and women who lose their jobs to learn new skills and pursue new opportunities. That will come to the fore when this Congress turns next year to the reemployment bill that is before it. These industries need our special concern and help.\n\tDespite these strong reservations that I have just added my voice to, I will be casting my vote in favor of GATT for the reasons that have been eloquently given in this body already in the last 2 days because, on balance, I am convinced it is good for the economy of Pennsylvania and good for the American economy, because I believe it will, in not many years, prove not to increase our deficit but to reduce it; because I believe it would be wrong to go back to the drawing board after so many long years of negotiations; and because I have faith in America's ability to compete successfully and to provide leadership, leadership for human rights as well in the global economy.\n\tMr. President, I yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the time be charged equally to each side.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President and Members of the Senate, we are in the closing moments now of an epic debate, a defining moment in American history. It has been said that the vote we will cast this evening is comparable to votes--a half dozen, at most, in the 20th century--such as the Marshall Plan, to name but one. We are going to define the American future on how we vote this morning.\n\tWe are about to hear from our leaders, after which time the votes will commence. It cannot be stated too strongly that we are choosing a future for the United States, and the distinguished chairman-to-be of the Committee on Finance and I feel confident; we feel ebullient, if I may say. Sixty years of American foreign trade policy that began with Cordell Hull and Franklin Roosevelt in the depths of our Depression and the world depression in 1934, in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, culminating now in the Congress--as Cordell Hull called it, a ``Congress of international trade'' in a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives in 1916. It is not a large one. The World Trade Organization has 450 employees--the GATT, rather--after 40 years. It is contemplated that an additional 15 will be employed now. But a world trading system will be in place for settling disputes, for making agreements, and for creating a future.\n\tI am confident that we will make the right choice, Mr. President, hugely acknowledged not only by your support but by Members on both sides of the aisle. I make the simple point that this measure was reported from the Committee on Finance 19-0. I do not know that the margin will be quite that emphatic in the next hour, but I hope it will be sufficient so that the world will know that the United States has not only led the world to this moment, but means to continue to do so.\n\tMr. President, I thank the Chair and I suggest the absence of a quorum, the time to be charged equally to the two parties.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tThe clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. DOLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\tMr. DOLE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague, Senator Moynihan, the chairman of the committee, and Senator Packwood. I have been listening to some of the debate, and I certainly know of the impact their statements have had.\n\tLet me say also that we sort of reached the point right now, the moment it is going to happen, now, in the next 30 or 40 minutes. It has been 8 years in the making, 8 years, a long time.\n\tI must say, just having come back from a very brief trip to the United Kingdom and Brussels, I said to Secretary Bentsen this morning at the White House in a meeting with the President and others who were undecided on this particular matter--Secretary Bentsen had been telling me for some time that the whole world was waiting for America to act in a positive way--I said, Lloyd, by ``the whole world'' you mean everybody is waiting for the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House to vote on GATT? He said yes, nearly the whole world.\n\tI want to confirm that statement, because while we were in Belgium, Brussels, we talked about NATO we talked about Bosnia. But there were ambassadors there from countries all over the world. When we were in London, we talked with the Prime Minister. I think his first question was about GATT. We talked to Margaret Thatcher about GATT. I spoke at a meeting last night made up of former Prime Ministers and others, people interested in trade, about GATT.\n\tThe point I am making is this is a decision we are making today that is going to have impact around the world, a positive impact. And if we did not act in a positive way, it would have impact, it would be a very negative impact.\n\tSo I would start by saying that I want to thank all of my colleagues who are supporting GATT, who are supporting us on the waiver of the point of order, that is the critical vote.\n\tI want to thank Secretary Bentsen.\n\tI want to thank Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade Representative. He has done an outstanding job and worked with me and others to resolve some of the real differences that we have and it has made a difference.\n\tI want to thank the President for his efforts, and former Presidents, Republicans and Democrats up and down the line, who understand the importance of trade and the importance of this particular vote and this particular moment, after 8 years.\n\tThere are a lot of countries involved and like any other big trade agreement, it was up and it was down, and people thought it was going to break down. People walked away, and they came back. But anyway we persevered and finally got it worked out, and about the eighth round of negotiations finally concluded last December.\n\tI think it is fair to say, because there are critics--and I have said many times we are getting about 2,000 phone calls a day in our office opposed to GATT, two or three slip in in favor of GATT--if you took the phone calls that this is a measure of support in America, you could say there is no reason to bring this matter before the Senate. Many of the callers are certainly well-intentioned. Many of the calls are orchestrated. Many of the callers have a strong point of view. Many of the callers are critical of any of us who even think about even trying to fix it, they are just flat against it, they want it killed, they do not want any trade agreement, they are concerned about sovereignty and other issues that I will discuss later. But I must say most of the callers are well-intentioned and they are concerned, concerned about their jobs, concerned about their children, concerned about something.\n\tSo I think we need to state for the record this is not a perfect agreement. On the way back last night I had a big book, it weighed about 10 pounds, briefing material. I did not read the entire document, but I read many, many of the arguments on the pros and cons. It is not a perfect trade agreement. We never achieve all of our objectives. We have to go back and complete the work in some of the areas, especially services, including financial services, telecommunications and audio-visual.\n\tIn addition, Mr. President, the overall economic impact of the Uruguay round agreements I think probably has been overstated. But it is always the case around here that with each administration, maybe overstatements are made from time to time. But in this case there are overstatements in both directions.\n\tTo hear some of the supporters you would think this agreement cures everything but the common cold, and maybe even the common cold. If we just vote yes our troubles are over.\n\tIf you listen to the other stream on the other side, you get a different picture.\n\tWe are told this is going to create hundreds of thousands of jobs, maybe millions of jobs, billions of dollars. And I know for some reason Wichita, KS sort of became the anti-GATT capital of the world, and I have heard a host of statements and a lot of information, a lot of letters from people that I know--a hundred times worse than NAFTA, a stealthlike power grab by the bureaucrats, by international bureaucrats--and all the other arguments you heard on the floor today and before.\n\tBut I believe on balance that this is a good trade agreement. The benefits certainly are going to be modest or better, but clearly going to be a net gain for the American people. No doubt about it, for if our trade policy does not serve the American people, we ought to change it or we should not extend it. I am talking about the American people, the working family making $20,000, $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, a year, they are ones who are concerned, they are the ones who, in many cases are calling or going to the meetings. Others have different motives.\n\tSo this creation of a new trade bureaucracy is not our objective. It is domestic and economic growth, and increasing the standard of living of hardworking American families. Trade should serve the people and not the other way around, and I think this does.\n\tIt will be tested. We will find it is not complete in many areas, we will find that probably some things will have to change. This is going to create jobs and opportunities. I am not going to say how many jobs, I will leave that to the experts. But let us face it, we are going to be the big beneficiary, the United States of America. Any way you cut it, we are the biggest beneficiary.\n\tIt is going to bring down tariffs worldwide, and that is why we are going to be the big beneficiary, because our tariffs are already low, around 4 percent. And around the rest of the world they are relatively high, around 20 percent. One-third cut in global tariffs under this agreement certainly means disproportionate benefits to U.S. exports. That is what it is all about.\n\tIt means tariffs are going to be lowered, some estimate, $744 billion. That is a huge reduction in the most tangible barrier to trade that exists, the direct tax on imports. That is going to be reduced.\n\tIn some sectors--construction equipment, agricultural equipment, steel, beer, distilled spirits, paper, toys and furniture--tariffs are not just reduced they are eliminated, they go to zero. And these are the so-called zero-for-zero products. These are sectors in which the U.S. producers are already very competitive. This trade agreement is going to make us even more competitive.\n\tOverall, U.S. merchandise exports, it is estimated, will be over $150 billion per year over the next 10 years. So maybe it is not $150 billion, maybe $140, or maybe it is $160. They are estimates. But they are positive estimates. Let me talk about agriculture.\n\tI met last week, or the week before, I guess, with representatives of 20 different sectors of agriculture--cattle, hogs, wheat, soybeans, farm bureaus, different farm groups, corn growers. There is no doubt that the U.S. farmers are the most productive in the world. They are going to be forced to compete--or would have been forced to compete--primarily with foreign treasuries had it not been for some changes in this agreement. Because if we lower the subsidies, and we are prepared to do that--in fact, our subsidies are already so low it is not going to take additional effort from the Americans, it is going to take additional effort elsewhere.\n\tBut our subsidies are low compared to other countries. So we are going to require not as much as we wanted to do, do not misunderstand me, but we are going to level out the playing field, something President Bush started and President Reagan announced years ago about eliminating subsidies so we could compete worldwide. And if we can compete, we will win more than our share of the market. That is what it is all about: Market access and market share.\n\tMarket access, as far as agriculture products that are produced in my State and nearly every State in the Nation, are going to increase as tariffs come down--we are going to expand--as nontariff barriers are converted to tariffs and then reduced, and as minimum access levels are implemented. These are certainly important goals if you are talking about global agriculture and global agriculture trade.\n\tAnd, again, these are estimates, but again they are expected to increase exports by $4.7 billion to $8.7 billion by the year 2005. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, exports of grains and feeds will increase $2 billion to $4 billion; cotton by nearly $600 million; meats, dairy, and other animal products by $1.7 billion to $2.5 billion. That is real money. Horticultural products by $200 million to $400 million; and oilseeds and products by $800 million to $1.3 billion.\n\tWhat does that mean? It means more farm income. It means that the average farm family, whether it is in New York or Kansas or Oregon or New Mexico, or wherever, is going to have more income. Some estimate--and again these are all estimates, and I think this is where much of the problem is, because nobody knows precisely where it is--but the estimates are it will increase agriculture income by $2.5 billion by the year 2005. So we are talking about 190,000 jobs in that same timeframe--190,000 jobs. That is a lot of jobs.\n\tAnd I think one thing that we have received assurances on--and I would like to put this in the Record. My colleague in the House, Congressman Pat Roberts, from Kansas, who will become the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee starting the next Congress, does an outstanding job for agriculture. He is not concerned that agriculture may be cut as other programs are cut, but he did not want agriculture singled out by saying, ``Well, we will take it all out of agriculture and more out of agriculture somewhere else.''\n\tSo at his request, I was able to receive assurances from Leon Panetta, the Chief of Staff at the White House, concerning agriculture and agriculture programs, important not just to Kansas but other States.\n\tI ask unanimous consent that that material be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                                       Washington.\n     The Honorable Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: It was good to meet with you on Saturday \n     regarding a number of your concerns about the GATT \n     legislation. Lloyd Bentsen, Mickey Kantor and I felt that we \n     had a constructive discussion and are hopeful that you will \n     be joining all of us on both sides of the aisle who are \n     supporting the GATT legislation.\n       You had raised some specific concerns related to \n     agriculture, which I wanted to follow up with this brief \n     note. Overall, as you know, U.S. agriculture is projected to \n     benefit substantially from the GATT agreement. The coalition \n     of some 265 agricultural organizations who are supporting \n     GATT cite the projections that GATT will lead to increases in \n     U.S. agricultural exports by $5 to $14 billion over the next \n     5 years, which will help to create over 110,000 new jobs in \n     the agriculture sector and help to generate $10-$30 billion \n     in related economic activity throughout the U.S. economy.\n       One of your concerns was whether the Administration was \n     singling out agriculture programs for spending cuts. I can \n     reassure you that is not the case. The Administration will \n     honor the commitments in this area made by Director Rivlin \n     and Secretary Espy in their September 30, 1994 joint letters \n     to the leadership of the Senate and House Agriculture \n     Committees. Those letters committed the Administration to \n     maintaining discretionary spending on USDA agricultural \n     programs at or above the FY 1995 level in the FY 1996 and \n     1997 Budget requests to Congress. Regarding mandatory \n     programs, the Administration will consider potential spending \n     changes only in the context of its overall reviews of \n     entitlement programs and in the farm bill process.\n       You asked specifically about the Export Enhancement Program \n     (EEP) and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). With \n     respect to the EEP program, we are following through on our \n     commitment to use it to the maximum extent allowed, as \n     demonstrated by our recent EEP actions on wheat, barley, and \n     pork. In fact, for the FY 1995 budget just enacted, the \n     Administration requested full funding for EEP and it was the \n     Congress that reduced the funding by twenty percent. We have \n     also decided, as part of the implementation of GATT, to \n     reform EEP to focus on market expansion and promotion, not \n     just for combating unfair trade practices.\n       Regarding the CRP, the Administration strongly supports and \n     will propose reauthorization and extension of the CRP in \n     1995. In addition, we will take further administrative \n     actions as needed to support a continuation of the CRP at the \n     fullest possible level. That will be reflected in the FY 1996 \n     Budget baseline for FY96 and future years.\n       In the context of concerns held by wheat growers, you asked \n     if the Administration is willing to streamline the approval \n     process for EEP decisions. I am happy to report that we \n     already are moving forward on our commitment in the Rivlin/\n     Espy letters to do exactly that. As a result, the most recent \n     EEP decisions were cleared in periods ranging from one to \n     four weeks, in contrast to earlier actions which sometimes \n     took six months.\n       Finally, you raised questions about how the Administration \n     could aid the oilseed industry. Unfortunately, the funds that \n     you identified to pay for purchases of vegetable oil for food \n     assistance programs have already been included in the GATT \n     legislation to help cover the overall costs of the package. \n     However, oilseed products are specifically included in the \n     additional $600 million of ``greenbox'' export promotion \n     program levels that the Administration proposed to carry \n     forward if the GATT passes. Decisions on greenbox spending \n     will be based on criteria such as the importance of programs \n     in promoting value-added products, additionality, and other \n     criteria to be developed in consultation with the Congress.\n       Oilseeds would benefit from further reductions in trade \n     barriers. The U.S. industry took the lead on the oilseeds \n     zero-for-zero initiative in the Uruguay Round, and the \n     Administration, as stated in the Statement of Administrative \n     Action accompanying the GATT legislation, intends to pursue \n     negotiations to achieve duty reduction and elimination for \n     oilseeds. Our negotiations with China are directed in part \n     toward achieving meaningful access for U.S. agricultural \n     products, including oilseeds, to the Chinese market.\n       We appreciate the stong support for GATT that the overall \n     U.S. agriculture community has given over the past weeks. I \n     hope that the information I've provided here will reinforce \n     that support and demonstrate the seriousness of our \n     commitments to the industry.\n       I hope we will have your support in passing the GATT \n     legislation for the good of agriculture and the whole U.S. \n     economy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leon E. Panetta,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n\n\tMr. DOLE. So, on the whole, let me say very clearly that we are going to be able to demonstrate next year and the year after that and the year after that that the GATT agreement did help the American farmer, the American producers, the American rancher, and the farm families.\n\tThe GATT agreement also establishes for the first time rules governing intellectual property, services, and investment trade. It is my hope that coverage of these areas by trade rules will especially benefit the United States. We have a big trade surplus, nearly $60 billion, and I think this is going to help us with that, as we bring rules and disciplines to trade in services that allow us to continue to be the leader in global services.\n\tAnd, again, no country in this case--and I reconfirmed this last night; read it time and again to make certain I understood it. Under this agreement, as opposed to previous agreements, you are not going to have any single country out there be able pick and choose from the benefits of the agreement, sort of ``a la carte.'' For the first time, the selections on the menu must be taken all or nothing. You cannot pick out what benefits you want and leave what does not benefit you. You cannot do that anymore. So whether it is on subsidies, antidumping, customs valuation, or standards, everyone will have to observe the same rules. This, too, will benefit the United States, since we will not have to change our practices much, while many other countries will have to come into conformity.\n\tNow, let me say there is one aspect of the agreement that I think we have had more phone calls on, more letters, more concern, more frustration, than any other, and that is the question of the World Trade Organization. It is new. Maybe another name would have been better, any other name. When you start talking about world trade, world anything, people are nervous. So perhaps here, too, the benefits and dangers I think have been overstated. I think, judging from the thousands of phone calls and letters we have received, no aspect of this agreement is of deeper concern to the American people.\n\tI have heard from Ross Perot; I have heard from Pat Buchanan; I have heard from Ralph Nader; I have heard from Lane Kirkland. They are all good people; all feel very strongly that this agreement ought to be killed on the spot. Do not fix it. Do not fix it; kill it.\n\tWell, my intent never was to kill it. My intent was to fix it. If we can fix it, and it is good for America, let us fix it.\n\tSo while I have respect for their views and their opinions, I hope in fairness they will say, ``Well, maybe you did fix it a little. Maybe it is a little better.''\n\tSo there are a couple of major concerns behind the criticism of the WTO. One is that the WTO could produce bad decisions that might be grossly unfair to U.S. interests. Now, the more I looked at the issue and the more I studied the issue, the less likely I feel that could happen. But the other is that somehow we are diminishing or selling out our ``sovereignty'' if we sign up as a member of the WTO; that the WTO represents ``world government.'' And when you talk about world government, as I say, you are fighting a lot of people.\n\tThe first concern seemed to me to have some real substance, Mr. President. The WTO is not just an international ``watchdog'' organization. It will have judicial powers, in effect. What will we do if the WTO decides to exercise those powers in an ``activist'' way? Here in the United States, our judiciary has a tradition of judicial restraint, but no such tradition exists in the World Trade Organization. It is a brand new organization.\n\tFurthermore, decisions by the WTO dispute settlement panels will be automatically adopted by the WTO, unless all members, including the winning country, agree the decision should not be adopted. This is an important change from current GATT practice, which permits any country, under present law, to block or veto the adoption of a decision. I believe that most of the time, this change will benefit the United States since so many times in the past, we have won cases in the GATT only to have the losing countries refuse to comply with the rulings against them. We win the cases, they do not comply, and nothing happens. The Europeans repeatedly refused to comply with the soybean decision against them, and Japan thumbed its nose at the GATT on beef imports. Nevertheless, in cases where the United States is the loser and the WTO dispute settlement panel exceeded its powers or simply made an arbitrary decision, it seemed to me important to have additional protection.\n\tAnd I want to make this very clear. There was a concern here. We believed it was real. We understood that people who were calling us were concerned about it. They understand it, or someone else understood it, and had them call. So we went to work.\n\tI talked to the chairman about it, Chairman Moynihan. I talked to Senator Packwood about it. I talked to Mickey Kantor about it. I said, ``Mickey, what can we do? How can we fix it? I want to support the trade agreement.''\n\tSo they agreed we needed some additional protection against decisions by the WTO that go beyond the WTO's authority. And we agreed that next year, a dispute settlement review commission would be created to review WTO actions and determine whether the WTO exceeded its power and authority. After three such cases, Congress would vote on whether to withdraw from the WTO. It is as simple as that, Mr. President.\n\tI know, ``you can withdraw in 6 months,'' but that is the Executive. They are not going to withdraw. We wanted Congress to have some say. And Congress now has some say. It is going to allow us to get out if necessary, if the decision is arbitrary and capricious, and we have about 3 other standards. We can get out of WTO if our rights are being trampled by dispute settlement panels in Geneva. I would like to have printed in the Record at this point the agreement we made with the administration in this area.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                    The U.S. Trade Representative,\n\n\n                            Executive Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, Nov. 23, 1994.\n     Hon. Bob Dole,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: Secretary Bentsen, Leon Panetta, and I \n     appreciated the chance to discuss the remaining issues of \n     concern to you in the Uruguay Round implementing legislation. \n     We believe that your concern can be addressed in a way that \n     enables you to join us in providing the leadership to bring \n     the Uruguay Round effort to a successful conclusion.\n       You have expressed concern about (1) the World Trade \n     Organization (WTO), dispute settlement, and sovereignty; and \n     (2) the change proposed in the term of patent protection. Let \n     me respond on each issue.\n       WTO, Dispute Settlement, and Sovereignty.\n       Critics of the Uruguay Round have charged that proposed WTO \n     and the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU) would \n     unacceptably infringe U.S. and state sovereignty. I agree \n     that no trade agreement, whatever its economic benefits, \n     should be approved if it infringes U.S. or state sovereignty. \n     But it is clear, as I have testified many times, that the \n     critics' fears concerning sovereignty are without foundation.\n       Three Administrations--two Republican and one Democratic--\n     steadfastly safeguarded our sovereignty throughout the \n     negotiations. This year, working together on a bipartisan \n     basis, the Administration and Congress established further \n     protections for sovereignty through the implementing \n     legislation.\n       A broad range of individuals and groups of diverse views \n     across the political spectrum support the view that the \n     Uruguay Round agreements do not affect U.S. sovereignty. \n     These include Consumers Union, the Heritage Foundation, the \n     American Enterprise Institute, Judge Robert Bork, the \n     National Governors Association, the National Conference of \n     State Legislatures, Citizens for a Sound Economy, the \n     American Bar Association, just to name a few.\n       Section 102(a)(1) of the implementing legislation \n     unequivocally reaffirms that U.S. law prevails in every \n     situation over any conflicting provision of the Uruguay Round \n     agreements. Further, Articles IX and X of the WTO agreement \n     make it clear that no substantive right or obligation of the \n     U.S. can be altered or changed unless we agree. Article IX \n     establishes that the WTO will operate by consensus--just \n     as the GATT has. The charge that the United States will be \n     outvoted on important issues in a system where each \n     country has one vote is a ``scarecrow'' in the view of \n     Judge Bork. In its recent report on the WTO, the Heritage \n     Foundation posed the question: ``Does the WTO have any \n     power over the United States that could undermine U.S. \n     sovereignty?'' The Foundation's unequivocal answer was \n     ``none whatsoever''.\n       Neither the WTO nor WTO dispute settlement panels will have \n     the power to change, or order any change, in Federal, state, \n     or local laws or regulations. Only we in the United States \n     can change our laws. Longstanding practice of the GATT, \n     continued in the WTO, assures that in disputes, we will only \n     be in front of panelists approved by the United States.\n       Moreover, while the dispute settlement process is not yet \n     as open as the litigation process in the United States, it is \n     far removed from being the ``secret tribunal'' that critics \n     allege. U.S. briefs in panel cases will take into account \n     Congressional advice and the views of the public. In addition \n     we will provide prompt access to our submissions, and access \n     to at least non-confidential summaries of other WTO member \n     submissions. Panel reports will be made public as soon as we \n     receive them, and our response to any panel report will be \n     developed with Congress. Also, section 123(g)(3) of the \n     implementing legislation permits the appropriate committees \n     of Congress to vote on whether the United States should \n     comply with a panel report.\n       We have fully safeguarded the right of federal, state, and \n     local governments to protect human, plant, and animal health \n     and safety at whatever level of protection we see fit. \n     Furthermore, state governments may impose more stringent \n     standards than the Federal government and we will be free to \n     exceed international standards when necessary to achieve the \n     level of protection we believe appropriate.\n       Thanks to extensive consultation with groups of state \n     officials, led by the National Association of Attorneys \n     General and the Multistate Tax Commissioners, state \n     sovereignty is fully protected. This includes the right of \n     the states to participate at every stage of the dispute \n     settlement process if a state law is challenged.\n       Finally, while the Administration believes that U.S. \n     interests are fully protected, the WTO agreement permits the \n     United States to withdraw on six months' notice at any time \n     and for any reason. Additionally, section 125 of the \n     implementing legislation provides an expedited process by \n     which Congress can review U.S. participation in the WTO every \n     five years, and revoke approval of the WTO agreement if it \n     so chooses.\n       Sovereignty has been the central issue in the debate on the \n     WTO throughout this year. When members of Congress or other \n     individuals or groups have come forward with concerns, we \n     have worked hard, and effectively, to address them. \n     Nevertheless, we recognize that concerns remain, in Congress \n     and around the country, about our sovereignty under the WTO, \n     and particularly the impact of a dispute settlement system \n     where ``blocking'' of panel reports is no longer permitted. \n     We believe that it is important to approve the Uruguay Round \n     agreements with the broadest possible bipartisan support and \n     public confidence. Consequently, the Administration wants to \n     ensure that WTO dispute settlement decisions are fully \n     consistent with the Uruguay Round agreements by providing \n     additional guarantees that WTO dispute settlement decisions \n     will be vigorously monitored to ensure that U.S. sovereignty \n     is not adversely affected.\n       To that end, the Administration will support legislation \n     next year to establish a WTO Dispute Settlement Review \n     Commission. The Commission would consist of five Federal \n     appellate judges, appointed by the President in consultation \n     with the Leadership of both Houses and the Chairmen and \n     Ranking Members of the Ways & Means and Finance Committees. \n     Each Commissioner would have a four-year term with possible \n     renewals. Provision would be made for appropriate staggering \n     of the terms of the Commissioners.\n       The Commission will review all final (i.e., adopted) WTO \n     dispute settlement reports (by a panel if the panel report is \n     not appealed or by the Appellate Body) where the final report \n     is adverse to the United States. In each such case, the \n     Commission would determine whether the panel or Appellate \n     Body:\n       1. Demonstrably exceeded its authority or terms of \n     reference or, where the matter concerned the Uruguay Round \n     Antidumping Agreement, failed to apply Article 17.6 \n     concerning standard of review;\n       2. Added to the obligations or diminished the rights the \n     United States assumed under the pertinent Uruguay Round \n     agreement;\n       3. Acted arbitrarily or capriciously, engaged in \n     misconduct, or demonstrably departed from the procedures \n     specified for panels or the Appellate Body in the agreements; \n     and whether\n       4. The action in 1, 2, or 3 materially affects the outcome \n     of the report.\n       The Commission would issue its determination within 120 \n     days after the report is adopted. Three votes would be \n     required for an affirmative determination. The U.S. \n     Government and interested parties would have the right to be \n     heard by the Commission.\n       Following issuance of any affirmative determination by the \n     Commission, any Member of each House would be able to \n     introduce a joint resolution calling on the President to \n     negotiate new dispute settlement rules that would address and \n     correct the problem identified by the Commission. The \n     resolution would be privileged. The resolution would be \n     discharged from the Ways & Means and Finance Committees under \n     the same procedures provided in section 125 of the \n     implementing legislation; floor action would be expedited \n     under the same procedures.\n       If there are three affirmative determinations in any five-\n     year period, any Member of each House would be able to \n     introduce a joint resolution to disapprove U.S. participation \n     in the Uruguay Round agreements under the same procedures set \n     forth in section 125 of the implementing legislation. If the \n     resolution is enacted by the Congress and signed by the \n     President, the United States will commence withdrawal from \n     the WTO Agreement.\n       Term of Patent Protection.\n       You have expressed concern about the provision of the \n     implementing legislation which would change the terms of \n     patents in the United States. Specifically, you have asked \n     the Administration to support legislation next year which \n     would change the patent term to grant patents for a term \n     beginning on the date on which the patent issues, and ending \n     on the later of 20 years from the date on which the patent \n     application was filed in the United States or 17 years after \n     the date of the grant.\n       Under present law, patent rights exist for a term of 17 \n     years measured from the date the patent is granted. The \n     legislation would change our current system to provide for a \n     patent term of 20 years measured from the earliest effective \n     filing date of the application that leads to the patent.\n       This change, which has the strong, bipartisan support of \n     the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, has been \n     recommended numerous times by expert study groups starting as \n     far back as 1967. One reason the Committees support both the \n     change and the approach taken in the implementing bill is \n     that it will address the problem of ``submarine patents''.\n       A ``submarine patent'' can exist when a patent applicant \n     delays grant of the patent, sometimes for years, even after \n     the Patent and Trademark Office has determined that a patent \n     can be granted. In the meantime, an entire industry has built \n     up around the technology, since patent applications are held \n     secret until after the patent is issued. When the patent \n     issues, the inventor often demands high royalties as the \n     price of not suing companies for patent infringement. The \n     proposal of providing a term of the longer of 20 years from \n     filing or 17 from grant of the patent would not address this \n     problem, since there still will be no incentive for the \n     patent applicant to stop delaying patent grant.\n       Under the implementing bill, almost all U.S. patent owners \n     will have a longer term of protection than they now have. \n     There are several reasons for this, but the key point is that \n     we included provisions that would add up to five years to the \n     20-year term provided under the implementing bill if there is \n     delay in getting the patent and that delay is not the fault \n     of the patent owner.\n       For all these reasons, we believe that the case for the \n     change is compelling, and it will bring great benefits to our \n     patent holders and innovators. The proposed change has \n     extraordinarily broad support in the business and \n     intellectual property communities, ranging from manufacturing \n     and chemical companies, such as 3M, Dow Chemical, \n     Westinghouse, MARS, Exxon Research and Engineering Company, \n     Deere & Company, Bridgestone/Firestone, DuPont, Cincinnati \n     Milacron, Pioneer Hybred, and Fisher-Rosemount to the \n     Intellectual Property Law Section of the ABA, the American \n     Intellectual Property Owners' Association (AIPLA), and the \n     Intellectual Property Owners' Association (IPO).\n       We believe that if Congress reconsiders the issue next year \n     it will reach the same conclusion reached by the \n     Administration and the Judiciary Committees over the nine \n     months that we work on the implementing bill. Nevertheless, \n     if the Congress does revisit the issue and reaches the \n     conclusion that a change in accordance with your proposal \n     should be made, the Administration would not oppose \n     legislation to achieve that change.\n       Once again, thank you for discussing this matter with us. I \n     look forward to working with you to secure approval of this \n     historic agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael Kantor.\n\n\tMr. DOLE. That is the first concern and it has merit.\n\tThe second concern in my view has no merit. The World Trade Organization is not world government. Our sovereignty is not threatened by this agreement or by the WTO. The WTO has no power to force the United States to do anything. They cannot make us do anything. It is not a world power.\n\tIf the WTO finds that U.S. law does not square with the obligations we have assumed under the agreement, we remain totally free to disregard that finding. It does not change U.S. law. It does not change State laws, as some of the critics have said. The critics should be answered, and they have been answered. But they keep coming back with the same message.\n\tI do not know who you could go to, if you want to talk to somebody who felt strongly about something and you wanted some conservative jurist to give you a legal opinion. So somebody asked Judge Bork to address this issue. I know it has been recited on the floor before. Judge Bork has a pretty good reputation as being a scholar and understanding the law. As he pointed out, our ultimate compliance with the agreement is a matter of international comity or accommodation, not of sovereignty. We are talking about comity or accommodation--not sovereignty. Our legislative and executive branches will continue to function exactly as before. Let me quote Judge Bork. I know he has been quoted before, but I want to quote him again because I think the well-meaning people in America who oppose this agreement because of the sovereignty issue ought to know about the quote. Maybe they will read it. Maybe they will hear it. I would be happy to send them a copy of the letter. This is what Judge Bork said:\n\n       The U.S. constitutional framework safeguards U.S. \n     sovereignty by providing the motion recent action by the \n     political branches of the Federal Government supersedes prior \n     laws or international agreements. As long as the United \n     States can relieve itself of any international obligation \n     that conflicts with U.S. law by enacting a subsequent \n     statute, U.S. sovereignty is protected. Arguments to the \n     contrary distort American law and contradict principles \n     recognized by the Supreme Court for more than one hundred \n     years.\n\n\tThat is not Bob Dole. That is not Bob Packwood. That is not Pat Moynihan. That is Judge Bork. He is not infallible, but he has a great reputation. So I would say to those who rant and rave about the sovereignty issue, I think it has been answered.\n\tI would also note one of the most vocal critics of the WTO's infringement on our sovereignty, Professor Lawrence Tribe, of Harvard, recently reversed his position on the issue. He was a critic. He was on the other side. He was supporting Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan and Pat Choat and Ralph Nader and others who feel strongly about this issue. This is the memorandum he sent to me and other Senators dated November 28, and I quote:\n\n       Although it might be less embarrassing for me simply to say \n     nothing, I regard it as my responsibility, in light of \n     Assistant Attorney General's Dellinger's recent forceful \n     analysis, to say that I believe the Clinton administration \n     has based its position on the Uruguay round agreements on \n     constitutional arguments that are both powerful and \n     plausible.\n\n\tNot Bob Dole, not Pat Moynihan, not Bob Packwood--Laurence Tribe.\n\tSo the sovereignty issue is a red herring. And, if our rights are being trampled we are going to be able to fix it. We have worked it out. We are going to have to pass a law next year and we will have administration support, and bipartisan support in the House and Senate. Our sovereignty could not be better protected. No one in this Chamber is going to stand up and diminish our sovereignty or somehow sell out or diminish some of our sovereignty that I know of on either side of the aisle.\n\tLet me finally say this. I know the majority leader is waiting to conclude the debate.\n\tWe were also concerned about some of the measures in the implementing legislation. Frankly, we thought there were too many things added. It was not clean. There were just too many things added to the implementing legislation. So a lot of charges have been made that millions and millions and billions of dollars are being spent. It is almost like a reconciliation bill. You cannot amend it. All you can do is debate it and vote it up or down.\n\tSo we raised some of those questions with the administration. I think it is clear that one reason the fast track process may be in danger from now on is we have to clean up our act. We cannot load up the implementing legislation with extraneous provisions that have nothing to do with trade because this bill is not subject to the normal rules of debate. As I said, you cannot amend it. You debate it and vote it up or down. So it has a whole variety of things in there that benefit certain people, probably certain interests that should not be there at all. And I have addressed those.\n\tI ask at the appropriate time those letters be printed in the Record. One is a pioneer preference provision. I am just trying to find out if it is fair. If it's fair that is fine with me. But we are going to try--going to review it next year. We have a promise from the administration to work next year with the administration to ensure that Government is fully and fairly compensated for the licenses in question. That is all we want. We are not after anybody.\n\tSo I guess the truth of the matter is, the fast track vehicle is carrying a lot of unauthorized cargo. And it is abuse of the fast track process and I hope that, if we use the fast track process again, we will be able to clean that up. I voted for the fast track extension and I think certainly this undermines the process if that is going to be approved next year.\n\tWe have another term dealing with patents. This was raised by a colleague on the House side, Congressman Rohrabacher. That has been addressed. We think the administration now agrees it will not oppose legislation, if it is offered next year. I ask that statement by him be made a part of the Record. That was from the Trade Representative, from Mickey Kantor.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                    Washington, November 23, 1994.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: I appreciate the opportunity to respond \n     to your concerns about the so-called ``pioneers' preference \n     provision,'' which is found in Title VIII of the GATT \n     implementing legislation.\n       As you know, this provision serves two basic purposes. \n     First, it prevents the pioneers from obtaining the use of \n     radio spectrum for free. Absent the GATT provision there is, \n     in our judgment, an unacceptable risk that the pioneers will \n     succeed in overturning the current FCC Order which, reversing \n     an earlier order, now requires payment from the pioneers. \n     Second, it rewards the innovation produced by the pioneers \n     who, in the judgment of the FCC, have helped to spur the \n     current interest in the provision of Personal Communications \n     Services. Indeed, we are only days away from the beginning of \n     the broadband PCS auction. The PCS auctions, which were \n     proposed by President Clinton and established in the budget \n     reconciliation act of 1993, are expected by OMB to raise \n     $12.6 billion for the federal government.\n       Under the GATT provision, the three pioneers will \n     contribute a significant percentage of the total proceeds to \n     be gained from the PCS spectrum. OMB estimates that, over a \n     five-year period, the three pioneers will pay about $1.5 \n     billion to the federal treasury.\n       We are aware, of course, of competing estimates that have \n     been made by opponents of the GATT agreement and potential \n     competitors of the pioneers. In general, those assertions \n     attempt to compare mature, small markets for established \n     wireless services that possess a significant customer base \n     with the incipient, multistate, demographically-diverse \n     markets for new PCS services. In our judgment, no known \n     alternative estimate establishes a credible basis for \n     analysis.\n       Of course, as the Administration has consistently noted, no \n     one can predict with certainty the outcome of the coming PCS \n     auctions and, therefore, it is impossible to be absolutely \n     sure how much the pioneers will pay under the GATT provision \n     or how much that payment might differ from the alternative \n     formulae contained in the current FCC Order.\n       I can commit to you, therefore, that the Administration \n     will work with Congress next year to do the following:\n       1. Compare the price paid by the pioneers to the payments \n     paid by the PCS auction winners;\n       2. Determine whether the government received a fair return \n     for the licenses obtained by the pioneers;\n       3. If the determination in (2) above is negative, pass \n     legislation that would adequately compensate the United \n     States in accordance with the determination on fair return.\n       Congress, of course, could still act on its own. We are \n     sending under separate cover a letter expressing our views \n     with regard to the constitutionality of future legislation on \n     this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leon E. Panetta,\n                                                   Chief of Staff.\n\n\tMs. MIKULSKI assumed the Chair.\n\tMr. DOLE. The rest of my statement deals with the budget. I understand Senator Packwood made a brilliant speech. I was not here to hear it, but I have had people fax me notes on how he explained the budget process and the waiver. And I thank him for that.\n\tBut it is pretty clear to me that if we do not waive the budget, we are going to doom the whole process. There is no question about it. And that is a steep price to pay. So we have addressed it. We think it has been addressed as much as we could. And we have to keep in mind, too, we are talking about cutting tariffs, going to create more jobs, more opportunities--a lot of things are going to happen in the second five years. So I think in the long run, increased economic activity which is going to result from this trade agreement certainly is going to outweigh the losses and obligations caused by the tariff cuts. In other words, over time, tariff cuts pay for themselves. In fact this argument is reminiscent of an argument we have been making for a long time with regard to capital gains rate reduction. I hope next year, as I said in my letter to my colleagues, the administration will be receptive to this argument in the context of the capital gains debate.\n\tSo, finally, I would just say, Madam President, that I think the bottom line is we just cannot isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. We have to have a big ``open for business'' sign all over America. Everywhere in America it has to say we are open for business. We want your business in America. He want to create jobs, we want to create opportunities in America. We do not want to put a ``closed'' sign in America, ``Not welcome in America.''\n\tWe want them to bring down the barriers for our products and our services. We are going to lock in this agreement--market opening measures pave the way for further measures.\n\tI have always thought that we could compete with anybody else in the world as long as we have access to that market and that we have assured access. I think this agreement is going to help us in that regard.\n\tSo, Madam President, I ask any other material I have not included in the Record relating to this agreement be printed at this point. And again thank my colleagues for their leadership.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                            General Counsel of the\n\n\n                                  U.S. Department of Commerce,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 23, 1994.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dole: One of the revenue measures included in \n     the GATT implementing legislation would require the Federal \n     Communications Commission to recover for the public a portion \n     of the value of the public spectrum that has been awarded by \n     the Commission to licenses granted under the ``pioneers \n     preference'' program. The legislation requires the pioneers \n     to pay not less than 85 percent, on a per population basis, \n     of the highest bids for licenses in the 20 largest markets in \n     which no applicant has obtained preferential treatment (the 3 \n     pioneer markets). Assuming enactment of the GATT legislation \n     free from constitutional infirmities that re-calculates the \n     fees to be paid by the pioneers. This subsequent legislation \n     would likely occur after the FCC proceeds to issue the \n     licenses to the pioneers and would raise a constitutional \n     question whether such subsequent legislation could be \n     effective on a retroactive basis. We believe that the \n     Congress retains wide discretion to enact retroactive \n     economic legislation to support legitimate legislative \n     purposes and such legislation would be permissible from a \n     legal perspective.\n       In a case decided June 13, 1994, the Supreme Court held in \n     United States v. Carlton, 114 S.Ct. 2018 (1994), that due \n     process was not violated by retroactive application of an \n     amendment to a federal estate tax statute limiting \n     availability of a deduction despite evidence that a taxpayer \n     detrimentally relied on the previous provision and had no \n     notice that the provision would be retroactively amended. In \n     the case, the Court noted that the due process standard to be \n     applied to tax statutes with retroactive effect ``is the same \n     as that generally applicable to retroactive economic \n     legislation.'' 114 S.Ct. at 2022. In quoting from its \n     decision in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. v. R.A. Gray & \n     Co., 104 S.Ct. 2709 (1984), the Court stated:\n       ``Provided that the retroactive application of a statue is \n     supported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by \n     rational means, judgments about the wisdom of such \n     legislation remain within the exclusive province of the \n     legislative and executive branches.''\n       We believe that the Supreme Court's holding in the Carlton \n     case would be controlling if the Congress enacted subsequent \n     legislation with retroactive effect regarding the price paid \n     by the pioneers. There, as here, the subsequent Congressional \n     action would be intended as a ``curative'' measure to correct \n     previous legislation with ``significant and unanticipated'' \n     revenue consequences (Congress had estimated the revenue loss \n     from the deduction in the Carlton case at $300 million over 5 \n     years but subsequently discovered the loss could be as much \n     as $7 billion). There, as here, the ``corrective'' \n     legislation would be enacted promptly with only a ``modest \n     period of retroactivity.'' Just as a taxpayer ``has no vested \n     right in the Internal Revenue Code,'' no party has a vested \n     right in conveyance of Government spectrum at a discount. See \n     114 S.Ct., at 2023. In addition, two factors which the \n     appellate court found troubling in that case, a lack of \n     notice and detrimental reliance, would not be present \n     provided the Congress included floor statements in the \n     Congresisonal Record noting the possibility of subsequent \n     legislation relating to the fee question.\n       For these reasons, we believe that Congress could, if it \n     wished, enact subsequent legislation with retroactive effect \n     regarding the assessment of fees to be paid by the pioneers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Ginger Lew.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Department of the Treasury,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 23, 1994.\n     Hon. Robert Dole,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: I appreciate the work you have done to address \n     the concerns of your constituents and other Senators before \n     making a final decision about the GATT agreement. I am \n     encouraged that the sovereignty issue has been resolved. I \n     believe your announcement today in support of GATT will \n     certainly bring us closer to the 60 votes needed for the \n     budget waiver.\n       As the President stated in his press conference Tuesday, \n     the Administration is unwilling to link any conversation \n     regarding capital gains to GATT. But Members of the 104th \n     Congress will no doubt set forth ideas for capital formation. \n     I can assure you that these proposals will be carefully \n     reviewed.\n       It would of course be our hope that the work of the 103rd \n     Congress be completed next week with a bipartisan victory, \n     not by a narrow margin, but by a resourcing vote of \n     confidence. You and I have lead important fights in the past \n     to expand economic growth in our country. Few are as \n     important as this one. If we can achieve this, I believe the \n     American people will hold both our political parties in \n     greater esteem. With my best wishes for a Happy Thanksgiving.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Lloyd Bentsen.\n\n\tMr. DOLE. I want to commend my colleagues who are on the other side. They feel very strongly about it. I think it has been our hope that we could answer some of the concerns they had.\n\tSome are just flat opposed to it. Some believe there is a conspiracy out there. Some believe that some of us are out to do in America. That is not my record and I do not think it is the record of anybody else.\n\tIt seems to me we had two choices: Kill it or make it better and pass it. In my view we have made it better. It is better than it was, because of the cooperation we have had with the administration and because they, too, understand that the WTO was causing real concern with real people all across America. And now Congress has some say or will have some say when we pass the legislation next year.\n\tSo, Madam President, I hope that--we probably cannot have a unanimous vote--but let us try for 70 votes, at least 70, on the budget waiver.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. I yield the remainder of the time I have to Senator Warner.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 2 minutes 40 seconds.\n\tMr. WARNER. Madam President, I shall be very brief. I wish to associate myself with the remarks of the distinguished Republican leader. I have counseled with him on this matter from the very beginning, and he has laid forth the precedents, the points that I shall place in the Record in support of my decision on this measure.\n\tAn easier vote perhaps would have been to vote against the point of order, then vote for the treaty. But to me that is not being honest. That is not being straightforward, and I feel that as the distinguished Republican leader feels, we ought to stand and be counted and vote if it is in our judgment this is in the best interest of the United States.\n\tI waited, Madam President, such that all across Virginia calls came, as the distinguished leader said, and others, in opposition, in large measure. I did not want to cut off the avenue of my constituents to reach me with their views, and I forced an open mind. But it is the wise counsel of our Republican leader and that of the two managers of this bill, the Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, and the Senator from Oregon, Senator Packwood, and others, to persuade me this is in the best interest of the United States.\n\tMr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for H.R. 5110, legislation to implement the Uruguay Round Agreement reached under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). After many months of closely scrutinizing the agreement, I have come to the conclusion that this agreement is in the best interests of Virginia and the Nation as a whole. It moves the United States toward free trade and positions us to compete vigorously in the worldwide market.\n\tVirginia recorded merchandise exports in 1993 of $8.2 billion--the second largest State total in the South Atlantic region. Nationally, Virginia ranked 15th among the States in the value of export sales. Over the 1978-93 period, Virginia's merchandise exports rose by 159 percent--well above the 90 percent increase for the Nation as a whole and the 12th largest percentage gain among States. Virginia's top three export markets in 1993 were Japan, Canada, and Belgium and 87 percent of Virginia's 1993 export sales consisted of manufactured goods. Also, it should be noted that Virginia posted substantial export gains in virtually all major manufactured product categories over the 1987-93 period.\n\tI anticipate that under the Uruguay Round Agreement reached under GATT Virginia will experience greater economic expansion particularly in the areas of: fish and fish products, maritime industry, household and office furniture, renewable energy technology, industrial machinery, electronic equipment, tobacco, and high technology exports. In the area of agriculture, economic expansion is expected in, among others, these areas: corn, soybean, small grains, apples, beef, poultry, and horticultural products.\n\tThose areas listed above are just a few of the areas that will benefit under the agreement. The worldwide lowering of tariffs will help open other countries' markets, therefore creating markets in the future for many other Virginian goods and services.\n\tMr. President, I would like to say a few words about the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its impact on U.S. sovereignty. The WTO will have the authority to pass out penalties to member nations that have violated the agreement. After reviewing the WTO provisions of the agreement I, like many others, was concerned with that aspect of the agreement.\n\tHowever, I believe that former U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert H. Bork, in a letter to Senator Don Nickles, helped clarify this matter. Judge Bork stated that ``the U.S. constitutional framework safeguards U.S. sovereignty by providing that the most recent action by the political branches of the federal government supersedes prior laws or international agreements.'' Judge Bork concluded by saying that ``as long as the United States can relieve itself of any international obligation that conflicts with U.S. law by enacting a subsequent statute, U.S. sovereignty is protected.''\n\tIn addition, incoming Senate Majority Leader Dole reached an agreement with the Clinton administration on the matter of the WTO. The Dole-Clinton agreement commits the Clinton administration to support prompt enactment next year of legislation creating a permanent commission of five sitting U.S. appellate court judges, appointed by the President in consultation with appropriate House and Senate leaders. The commission will review all final WTO dispute settlement reports, subjecting them to a three-part test. If the majority of the commission believes that the WTO panel did not demonstrate adherence to certain guidelines then action could be taken by Congress to request that the President negotiate new dispute settlement rules addressing the problems identified by the commission. If the commission issues three affirmative decisions in a 5-year period, any Member of Congress would be able to introduce a joint resolution to disapprove U.S. participation in the WTO.\n\tMr. President, we must not sit idle and let the world pass us by. We are the worlds largest exporter and we can only benefit from a lowering of worldwide tariffs that in turn allow us access to more foreign markets. The Uruguay Round Agreement does just that and I intend to support it.\n\n\tMr. President, in closing I ask unanimous consent that an Op-Ed written by Mr. John W. Snow, Chairman, President, and CEO of Richmond, Virginia based CSX Corporation and Chairman of the Business Roundtable, be included in the Record following my statement.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Richmond Times Dispatch, Nov. 27, 1994]\n\n              Virginia, U.S., Have Stake in Expanded Trade\n\n       Let's cut to the heart of the GATT debate: If America wants \n     more jobs, higher living standards, and lower taxes, then \n     this vital international trade agreement must be approved by \n     the U.S. Congress immediately. Defer action and we lose.\n       The latest round of GATT (shorthand for General Agreement \n     on Tariffs and Trade) has been seven years in negotiation and \n     represents the cumulative work of 123 nations to reduce trade \n     barriers and encourage economic growth. It is the most \n     comprehensive trade deal in history and would not have \n     happened without American leadership. Presidents Reagan, \n     Bush, and Clinton have all championed this effort.\n       The present ``Uruguay Round''--the eighth in the history of \n     GATT--stands as the latest, best opportunity to continue the \n     process of making American values a fixed part of the \n     international economic system.\n       Yet we hear objections. It is argued, without factual \n     basis, that the U.S. will lose control of its destiny. Others \n     say, ``Why rush, let's improve it''--ignoring the years of \n     difficult, step-by-step struggle this agreement represents.\n       A lot of this is disturbingly familiar. The road to passing \n     the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was littered \n     with exaggerated dangers and unsubstantiated claims by \n     opponents. In fact, the early report card on NAFTA is even \n     more encouraging than many proponents had predicted.\n\n\n                     NAFTA Has Benefitted Consumers\n\n       For unrestricted trade to be of benefit, both imports and \n     exports should rise. In the first six months of 1994, the \n     U.S. Commerce Department reports that Mexican exports to the \n     U.S. rose 21 percent, to $23.4 billion, from a year ago, and \n     U.S. exports to Mexico rose 16 percent, to $25.5 billion. \n     Such numbers portend solid growth for American businesses and \n     respectable savings for American consumers.\n       GATT, like NAFTA, will be a plus for the American people, \n     because America wins with free trade. The United States is by \n     far the world's largest exporter and the world's most open \n     market. Any agreement like GATT that binds more than 100 \n     nations to the same discipline we impose on ourselves can \n     only benefit our economy over the long term.\n       It is simply remarkable that anyone would oppose this \n     opportunity for economic growth--particularly in Virginia, \n     where exports have driven and sustained our economy, where \n     from 1987 to 1993, merchandise exports soared by 159 \n     percent--way above the national average of 90 percent. Last \n     year alone, Virginia racked up $8.2 billion in export sales. \n     so much a part of Virginia's past, international trade \n     requests our best chance in the future.\n       The state's exports touch on many sectors of its economy, \n     from agriculture and livestock, production to manufacturing \n     of products ranging from electronics and computers to \n     chemicals and heavy machinery, and encompass the gamut of \n     large to small employers. A study done in 1987 found that 95 \n     percent of Virginia enterprises involved in export trade had \n     fewer than 500 employees.\n       Without a doubt, the citizens of the Commonwealth would \n     benefit from overall business growth and creation of new jobs \n     resulting from more open international trade. Several \n     gubernational administration representing both Democrats and \n     Republicans have seen the Value equation in international \n     trade and have worked effectively to market Virginia's \n     exports to the world. The GATT stands to extend those \n     economic benefits will into the 21st Century.\n       Since the GATT process began in 1947, world trading nations \n     have cut average tariffs from 40 percent to 5 percent today, \n     thanks largely to U.S. efforts that have once again spanned \n     both Republican and Democratic administrations. The result \n     has been the fastest global economic growth in history. The \n     newest GATT agreement obligates signatory nations to take \n     serious action against discriminatory non-tariff import \n     barriers and to reduce or eliminate tariffs and quotas on a \n     range of products affecting 85 percent of world trade. The \n     result will be a $744 billion reduction in tariffs on world \n     trade, the largest tax cut in the history of the world.\n       Implementing the Uruguay Round is expected to cost the \n     United States $40 billion in foregone tariffs over the next \n     10 years. However, for every dollar lost in revenue from \n     tariff cuts, the Clinton administration estimates an \n     additional $3 in new revenues will be generated from \n     increased economic activity. Obviously, one aspect of the \n     GATT debate focuses on how much additional growth the United \n     States can expect.\n       The administration estimates that the GATT will pump an \n     extra $100 billion to $200 billion into the U.S. economy \n     every year after the agreement takes full effect in 10 years. \n     This assessment recently was boosted by a study released by \n     the GATT Secretariat showing that the trade accord would add \n     another $122 billion to the U.S. economy by the year 2005.\n\n\n                       Gains Outweigh Any Losses\n\n       But even the most conservative assessment of the GATT by \n     independent analysts shows that the accord will contribute an \n     extra $25 billion to $30 billion per year to the U.S. gross \n     domestic product. That would be far in excess of the GATT's \n     projected 10-year cost of $40 billion.\n       The truth is that more open trade will generate far more to \n     the American economy than it will cost. Right now the biggest \n     danger is that the Congress will fall prey to GATT \n     opponents who are using the complexity of the agreement to \n     urge delay on ratification until next year's formal \n     deadline. Those who oppose free trade expansion know that \n     delay crushes political chances for approval and certainly \n     damages America's standing with its trading partners.\n       It is worth repeating that talks began on the latest trade \n     pact more than seven years ago under President Reagan and \n     enjoyed the support of President Bush during the 1992 \n     campaign, before being embraced by and concluded under \n     President Clinton. Improving the climate for international \n     trade was, until recent times, a subject that enjoyed broad \n     bipartisan leadership.\n       Earlier this month, voters sent a strong message to \n     Washington that they expect more leadership on a host of \n     issues connected to the nation's future direction and a \n     collective sense of well-being for our families and \n     communities.\n       The upcoming vote on the GATT agreement is certainly a \n     once-in-a-generation opportunity: for the President to \n     govern, for the Democrats to vote their great hopes for the \n     nation's future, and for the Republicans to show their \n     leadership. Even a delay in considering the GATT agreement \n     could cost future generations of Americans immeasurably, as a \n     number of our political leaders have expressed the view that \n     a delay on the GATT vote will ultimately kill its chance for \n     implementation. Such is the power of America's position on \n     this issue around the world.\n       Our representatives in Congress will be asked to \n     demonstrate their bipartisan leadership in the next few days. \n     They will have the opportunity to sow the seeds of future \n     prosperity for our nation and our fellow citizens by \n     approving the GATT agreement.\n       In the final analysis, GATT is about change. It's about \n     moving toward the future, not away from it. It's about \n     knocking down barriers to global commerce and allowing \n     economic competition to flourish throughout the world.\n\n\n                       american products will win\n\n       Congress should approve the agreement, thereby opening the \n     doors, leveling the playing field, and preparing the way for \n     an American victory. America will win with GATT because our \n     workers are the most productive in the world. America will \n     win because our science is better, our products are superior, \n     and our companies are more efficient. America also will win \n     because of the ideas we hold dear. It's really extraordinary. \n     In this decade, the ideological battle between command \n     economies and market-driven economies has ended. The verdict \n     is in. Markets win!\n       The worldwide advance of economic liberty is the great \n     victory of the late 20th Century. Freedom has momentum on its \n     side. The U.S. and 17 other Pacific Basin countries--a group \n     constituting half of the world's production and 45 percent of \n     world trade--have just agreed to opening their economies and \n     removing all trade barriers by the year 2020. Other \n     expansions of freedom beckon; the future is promising. But \n     nothing is guaranteed. A defeat of GATT would send the wrong \n     message at the worst possible time.\n       Congress must not let that happen. If anything, the recent \n     election affirmed Americans' desire for greater economic \n     opportunity. Now, at a time when the world has come to \n     embrace that same desire, for freedom and prosperity, it \n     would be a sad irony for America to step backward. We should \n     approve GATT now--and I urge Virginians to so inform their \n     congressional representatives.\n\tMr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the decision on how to vote on the implementing legislation of the Uruguay Round of GATT has been a particularly difficult one for me. I have painstakingly studied the bill. I have corresponded extensively with USTR and others to obtain clarification of many of its provisions and I have carefully weighed the pros and cons of this agreement. There are many strengths.\n\tThis agreement will put in place a set of rules which will allow the U.S. to compete on a more level playing field in trade relationships with other nations. Overall, I believe progress toward free trade is good for the United States. This agreement includes many positive steps toward that end.\n\tFirst, GATT would create a new international trade framework and establish rules to govern international trade. It would also expand the number of participating nations from 40 to 123.\n\tSecond, GATT's intellectual property provisions would broaden and strengthen the protection of U.S. patents, copyrights and trademarks around the world. This would provide new and better protection in world markets from piracy of U.S. entrepreneurship, copyright and invention in industries such as pharmaceutical, entertainment and computer software.\n\tThird, the Uruguay Round would expand the trading system to include services and agriculture for the first time. This includes many important U.S. industries such as accounting, advertising, computer services, tourism, engineering and construction.\n\tFinally, this GATT agreement would set forth multilateral trading rules for all member countries to abide by, including developing nations. Furthermore, it would establish a forum and procedures to resolve trade disputes that might arise among trading partners. Together, these measures would create a more level playing field in international trade than exists today.\n\tBut let us be candid--the Uruguay Round Agreement does not bring about free and fair trade. This agreement permits a number of countries to continue to engage in blatant protectionism. And as a result, certain countries and industries will do better under this agreement than others.\n\tI am deeply troubled by the fact that this agreement continues to allow unfair foreign trade restrictions which adversely affect key Michigan exports in autos and auto parts. GATT fails to address the discriminatory trade barriers of greatest importance to Michigan. I'm speaking of Japan's keiretsu system, the collusive and unfair Japanese business practice whereby producers and suppliers form strategic alliances and effectively block outside competition. Measures to break down such non-tariff trade barriers such as these are conspicuously absent in GATT.\n\tSince this GATT agreement does not specifically cover Japan's keiretsu system, we would most likely have to fight barriers to trade such as this using U.S. domestic trade remedy laws. I specifically asked the Administration to indicate how it would deal with Japan's keiretsu system under the new GATT agreement. I was assured by the USTR that they would continue a firm bilateral approach with Japan in an effort to bring about an end to Japan's discriminatory trade practices. But this is the same decades-old method that has failed to produce any result.\n\tThis agreement could actually make matters worse and weaken remedies under U.S. trade law that we can use to retaliate against unfair trade practices. I am concerned that the use of quotas and tariffs to retaliate against unfair trade practices, such as those contained in Section 301 and Super 301, would be in violation of the agreement. Under the new system, should the U.S. choose to use sanctions, such as Section 301, to respond to unfair and restrictive Japanese trade policies not explicitly prohibited by GATT, such as keiretsu, the WTO could well rule that such U.S. action violates the GATT agreement and such finding could no longer be blocked by a United States veto under the new GATT. In my view, this might tend to undermine the credibility of a threat to use Section 301.\n\n\tIn the Statement of Administrative Action, the Administration has made assurances that it intends to use Section 301 to pursue vigorously unfair trade barriers that violate U.S. rights or deny benefits to the U.S. under the Uruguay round agreements. The Administration has also stated their intention to use section 301 to pursue foreign unfair trade barriers that are not covered by the GATT agreements. The implementing legislation specifically identifies two important manufacturing industries that face unfair competition policies that are not clearly covered under GATT--auto parts and flat glass--to be addressed under the revised Section 301 law. The Administration has strongly committed to the continued use of U.S. trade remedy laws unilaterally when deemed necessary.\n\tI also have a serious problem with an agreement that reinforces Mexico's local content requirements which discriminate against U.S. auto parts. These requirements have often resulted in U.S. manufacturers locating production in Mexico rather than in the U.S. While the Uruguay Round Agreement will eventually eliminate all such local content requirements, Mexico is allowed to maintain these protections for ten years under the terms of this agreement. Although I am glad to see Mexico's local content requirements phased out, I think we got a bad deal in this area under NAFTA and now GATT reinforces it.\n\tThe Uruguay Round also allows the European Union to maintain its limits on imports of vehicles from Japan for five more years. Because the U.S. government has no similar import restraints, and under the Uruguay Round we will be restricted from imposing similar restrictions, I am concerned that there is the danger that Japan will dump its excess auto capacity into the U.S. market.\n\tOn the other hand, the European-Japanese agreement exists now and is unlimited in duration. This GATT agreement arguably has the virtue of setting a time limit on it.\n\tThe issue is close surely. But a factor pointing toward a ``yes'' vote is the impact of rejection of GATT on American leadership in the world. If we abandon this hard fought agreement, after eight long years of negotiation, with the nations of the world looking to us to lead, it will be a blow to America's role in the world.\n\tOn balance, I have decided to cast my vote in favor of the budget waiver and the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreement.\n\tMrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached letter by John O. Wilson and Robert Kramer be printed in the Record.\n\n\n                                              Bank of America,\n\n                                                  August 10, 1994.\n     Hon.

We \n     have attached the results of a study of this question using \n     the bank's California macroeconomic model (attachment 1).\n       We used the model to project out the likely effects of the \n     Agreement over the next five years on: employment, \n     unemployment rates, exports through California ports and \n     exports originating within the state. Since the Agreement \n     will be phased in over a ten year period not all of the \n     impact is captured by this five year projection, however, the \n     trend is quite apparent. California will benefit \n     substantially from passage of the Uruguay round, and delaying \n     passage could have serious repercussions of the state's \n     ongoing economic recovery (attachment 2).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John O.

Contact: John O. Wilson, Chief Economist. The        \n\tCalifornia econometric model captures movements of key economic components of the California economy. It      \n  consists of about 20 annually estimated equations for California's important economic indicators such as      \n  employment, gross state product and personal income. It is structured for the corresponding U.S. economic     \n  indicators and their forecasts (generated by BofA using DRI's U.S. macroeconomic model) to directly drive the \n\tCalifornia economy. However, significant differences between California and the United States in the ways     \n  these indicators vary over time are also carefully specified.                                                 \n\n                             [Attachment 2]\n\n          Impact of GATT on California Economy--August 8, 1994\n\n       After seven years of negotiation, a GATT accord was signed \n     in December, 1993. The U.S. Congress is now debating \n     ratification of the GATT accord, and the outcome of that \n     ratification is far from certain. That outcome will have a \n     very significant impact on the California economy. If the \n     GATT accord is not approved by the United States, the current \n     recovery in the California economy would be greatly weakened.\n       GATT establishes the basis for world trade, and the GATT \n     accord emphasizes such important areas to California as \n     gaining greater access to foreign markets in high-tech goods, \n     capital goods, business and computer services, and \n     agriculture. All of these are leading industries in \n     California. Furthermore, GATT will reduce the average level \n     of tariffs by one-third and eliminate many non-tariff \n     barriers over the next ten years. Since California is such a \n     large exporter, the lower barriers will lead to even further \n     gains in California trade and jobs related to trade. \n     Furthermore, GATT, through its new structure referred to as \n     the World Trade Organization, sets up new dispute settlement \n     mechanisms which would prevent trade wars which would be \n     detrimental to California exports.\n       California accounts for 15 percent of U.S. merchandise \n     exports, and the value of exports to the California economy \n     has grown significantly during the past several years. As \n     shown in Table 1, the value of California merchandise exports \n     through California ports has increased from $54 billion in \n     1988 to $82 billion in 1993. Some of these exports were \n     actually manufactured in other states, and transported to \n     California for shipment. This creates jobs for Californians \n     engaged in the transportation and shipping, but not the \n     manufacturing of those goods. However, $70 billion of the $82 \n     billion shipped out of California ports in 1993 was \n     manufactured or produced within the state, and this \n     represents the greatest source of trade related employment to \n     California. That employment is significant.\n\n                 TABLE 1.--CALIFORNIA MERCHANDISE TRADE                 \n                          [Billions of dollars]                         ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Exports                \n                                                 through       Exports  \n                                               California    produced in\n                                                  ports      California ------------------------------------------------------------------------1988........................................         $53.6         $47.81989........................................          63.0          53.51990........................................          68.6          58.41991........................................          73.8          63.11992........................................          81.0          68.91993........................................          82.3          70.3------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       The exports which are produced in California account for \n     one million direct jobs. These are jobs that are directly \n     related to the manufacture, production, and transportation of \n     California exports. Another 800,000 jobs support trade \n     employment through the provision of services and support \n     industries. Thus, the total number of jobs created through \n     exports in California is 1.8 million. This represents 13 \n     percent of our entire employment of 14 million.\n       There have been major changes in the relative importance of \n     California's trading partners during the past several years. \n     While Japan remained the number one export partner in 1993, \n     two neighbors, Canada and Mexico, significantly increased \n     their imports from California during the 1990-93 period. In \n     1993 their combined imports easily surpassed Japans imports. \n     Furthermore, California's exports to China increased a \n     staggering 145 percent during the 1990-93 period.

Globally, we could \n     anticipate the following developments in world trade and \n     growth: (1) a general negative impact on global economic \n     growth due to loss of productivity gains that occur in a \n     free-trade economy; (2) an increase in intra-regional trade \n     such as trade within the European Union, trade within ASEAN \n     in Asia, and trade within NAFTA countries in North America, \n     but a reduction in inter-regional trade between Asia, North \n     America, Latin America, and Europe; (3) a move towards \n     unilateral protectionism in the form of higher tariff and \n     non-tariff barriers which will reduce overall world trade.\n       Specifically for California, we could anticipate the \n     following developments: (1) an increase in tariff and non-\n     tariff barriers to California exports to Asia, Latin America, \n     and Europe; (2) a reduction in California exports to those \n     regions, and particularly to Japan, China, Germany, and \n     France; (3) little impact on trade with Canada and Mexico \n     which would still be guided by the NAFTA agreement; and (4) \n     an immediate loss of 173,000 jobs in California (1995) \n     growing to a loss of 252,000 jobs by 2000. This would \n     increase the unemployment rate by a full one percent.\n\n                                               John O. Wilson,\n\n                                      Executive Vice President and\n                                 Chief Economist, Bank of America.\n\n\tMr. MACK. Mr. President, when all is said and done, the GATT agreement lowers tariffs by one-third across the board between a majority of the world's trading partners. This, without question, is good for Florida and the United States and therefore I will vote for this agreement.\n\tThis GATT agreement is the result of efforts made during the last three administrations. The agreement will mean an expected $100-$200 billion increase in our GDP by the year 2005. By any accounting, this will be a tremendous benefit for our country.\n\tExpanding trade opportunities is something the United States should aggressively pursue. It is one of our most promising opportunities for continued economic growth. Our future prosperity lies not in tariff wars but in our ability to capitalize on our strengths and export the resulting products to the world's markets.\n\tOver the last few months, I have heard from businesses in Florida and from across the country in support of the GATT. They have told me how vital this agreement is to their firms and to the people they employ. They're right, and we should continue to knock down foreign trade barriers for American products. The GATT will allow us to do just that.\n\tRecent data from the Commerce Department's International Trade Administration shows the potential benefits the GATT agreement can provide to Florida. Between 1987 and 1993, Florida's exports grew by almost $7 billion. Over two-thirds of these exports were from industries such as industrial machinery, electric and electronic equipment, chemical products, and scientific measuring equipment. With the lower tariffs under this agreement, Florida will clearly benefit.\n\tThe Commerce Department also shows Florida as the Nation's eighth leading exporter of merchandise, with nearly 10,000 businesses who sell goods abroad. What's more, virtually all of these businesses have fewer than 500 employees. Clearly, this agreement is vitally important to the small businesses that create capital, produce jobs and generate an impressive share of this country's economic growth.\n\tMany countries provide subsidies and impose significant tariffs. These trade practices destroy American jobs, and should not be tolerated. The American worker is the most productive in the world, and has always excelled on a level playing field. The GATT will help level the field for U.S. exports.\n\tThere is an additional element in this debate that is important to note for both this and future debates. In this legislation, the administration has conceded that there are legislative changes which will pay for themselves, even if the static accounting models used by both the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget do not capture the resulting revenue increases.\n\tIn particular, the Clinton administration--and now many in the Democratic leadership--acknowledge that the economic growth created by the passage of GATT will increase revenues to the Federal Government. So despite the loss of some tariff revenue, the economic effects of GATT are a plus for the Federal budget.\n\tThis is precisely the same argument that has been made for so long about a capital gains tax reduction. Capital gains tax cuts will generate revenue increases through economic growth just like tariff reductions. I would hope, therefore, that the Clinton administration will concede this point next year when Republicans pass a capital gains tax cut.\n\tLike a reduction in the capital gains tax rate, the GATT will create opportunities, and stimulate the creation of new jobs and new businesses. I look forward to the expansion of the Florida and U.S. economies that will follow the passage of this agreement.\n\n\n           the u.s. must endorse the uruguay round agreement\n\n\tMr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for the Uruguay Round Agreement reached under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n\tAmong the nations of the world, the United States of America has long been the foremost advocate of open trade. The Uruguay Round Agreement is the culmination of decades of work--by Americans of all political persuasions--to extend that advocacy. And it is that rare example of a treaty that allows us to benefit while our neighbors in the global community also benefit.\n\tThis agreement consolidates the triumph of political freedom we have witnessed in the past few years and extends the philosophy of openness to the field of international economics. It continues the process of tearing down the barriers that hinder trade among nations.\n\tSome critics of this measure say it tears down too many walls, and exposes America too nakedly to the vagaries of the international marketplace. I say, this Nation need never fear fair competition.\n\tSimply put, we are already the most open Nation on earth. We have nothing to fear from further opening the international trading system so long as all nations stand on the same level field. More than ever, this agreement ensures that our trading partners will extend the same openness to us. To deny this agreement would be to deny our national heritage, substitute fear for optimism, and forsake the economic benefits that will accrue to our Nation from free and fair international trade.\n\tThis agreement is first and foremost an indispensable tool for facilitating economic growth and job creation in our country. Its benefits to American workers in the form of increased incomes and better job opportunities will extend from high tech industries in the Silicon Valley to farms and ranches in the Heartland to the steel mills of Pennsylvania to the furniture factories of the Carolinas.\n\tBut, as beneficial as are the agreement's immediate specific benefits to individual Americans, so too are the principles of multilateral free trade that it advances.\n\tOne strong advocacy of a free and fair multilateral trading system began shortly after World War II with the establishment of GATT. The expanded trade resulting from GATT was largely responsible for reviving the depressed, war-torn economies of Europe and creating thriving new markets for American products.\n\tThat experience demonstrated the benefits free trade bestows upon both the United States and its trading partners. Since that time, we have been steadfast in our support for GATT, and it has served us well. The many trade agreements reached under its auspices have fueled economic growth around the world and brought more countries and consumers into the international marketplace served by American industry.\n\tMeanwhile, as many are quick to point out, circumstances have changed over the years. While the United States still dominates the international marketplace, competition for market share is becoming fiercer every year. In the face of this new challenge, some have been tempted to turn away from multilateral arrangements toward protectionism.\n\tThe concerns and frustration underlying that protectionist sentiment are powerful. And they are understandable. However, the policy response those emotions elicit is myopic. In international trade, our course should be charted along the lines of our enlightened self interest, not by a visceral reaction to the history of our grievances with other nations.\n\tClosing our markets to foreign goods will close our goods to foreign markets. In the long run, that will harm more than help American interests.\n\tBy contrast, joining other nations in a multilateral trading system on equal terms will expand opportunities for American businesses to sell their goods and services abroad. This is truly a case of a rising tide lifting all boats.\n\tThere is no dispute about our stake in international trade. Exports are vital to the continued growth of the U.S. economy.\n\tOver the past 5 years, international trade has been the bright spot of our economy, generating more new jobs and more economic growth than any other sector. International trade represents roughly 25 percent of our gross domestic product [GDP], a share that has almost doubled in the past 20 years. During the past four decades, new jobs in trade-related fields grew at three times the pace of overall job creation. As a result, export-related industries and companies currently employ over 10 million American workers.\n\tThe reduction of trade barriers is absolutely essential to the continued expansion of the U.S. economy. The Uruguay Round Agreement will reduce import tariffs, export subsidies and other trade distorting practices. Moreover, it will create a structure that will hold signatory countries to their commitments to fair and more open trade.\n\tThe agreement is particularly beneficial to the United States because we already have significantly fewer trade barriers than our foreign competitors. Cutting tariffs worldwide by an average of 38 percent over the next 6 years, combined with standardizing and simplifying customs procedures and licensing, will further reduce the cost of exporting U.S. goods and services.\n\tThe lower cost of exporting goods and services will encourage more U.S. companies to sell their products abroad. Currently, less than 10 percent of U.S. companies that could export products or services choose to participate in the international marketplace. With the Uruguay Round Agreement, these companies will have new incentives to develop markets around the world. They also will have new assurances that the time they invest in developing new markets will not be squandered on trading partners that abruptly change their rules and close their markets. Such assurances will be especially important to small and innovative companies.\n\tThe Uruguay Round Agreement also holds great promise for American agriculture, consistently one of our most successful economic enterprises in the international marketplace. Experts estimate that agriculture exports will increase by as much as $14 billion over the next 10 years, creating perhaps 190,000 new jobs in the process. And when the agreement is fully implemented, the United States can expect an additional $10 to $30 billion of economic activity in agriculture.\n\tAs one who is intimately familiar with the economics of the heartland, I can attest that this increased growth is essential to the continued prosperity of rural America.\n\tThis new trade environment will be a tremendous advantage for the United States. American workers, farmers and entrepreneurs are the best in the world. If we make everyone play by the same rules, we will continue to excel. The Uruguay Round Agreement is a significant landmark in the march toward free and fair trade.\n\tThe projected results of the agreement speak for themselves. Most important is the bottom line: the Uruguay Round Agreement is estimated to create over 1 million new high-wage jobs in the United States over the next 10 years as a result of increased exports of U.S. products and services.\n\tCertainly, this agreement is not perfect. We would all make some changes if given the opportunity to draft it on our own terms. But that is not the way trade agreements are reached. In fact, when one considers the torturous, multiyear negotiating process that brought us to this point, it is surprising how favorable the resulting agreement is to American interests.\n\tBefore I conclude, Mr. President, I want to address the controversy surrounding the World Trade Organization. Many Americans are concerned that this new body will undermine American sovereignty. That is a serious concern that should not be minimized. And it has not been minimized.\n\tThe WTO has been widely mischaracterized as a world regime with unlimited jurisdiction that will run roughshod over American interests and American laws. In fact, the role of the WTO is limited. It will serve primarily to facilitate resolution of disputes over rules to which the signatories of the Uruguay round have already agreed.\n\tIn this role, the WTO will help ensure that our trading partners abide by the commitments they made when they signed the Uruguay Round Agreement. When American companies venture into the international marketplace, they will be able to do so with confidence, because they will know the rules of the game and they will know that those rules will be enforced.\n\tCritics have charged that the WTO will undermine our worker protection, environmental, and food inspection laws. That is not the case. The authority to change or make U.S. laws rests solely with the Congress of the United States. By the express terms of the agreement signed by over 120 countries, even negative rulings of a WTO dispute resolution panel are mere recommendations. The WTO does not have enforcement powers. This fact is reaffirmed in section 102(a)(1) of the implementing language, which explicitly states that U.S. law will not be superseded by any provision of the Uruguay Round Agreement.\n\tWhile the protections in the agreement and the implementing legislation are significant, those who still have doubts about the WTO should find reassurance in the recent agreement reached between the administration and the Senate Republican leader. The agreement ensures that the United States will have the opportunity to pull out of GATT if the WTO's decisions are repeatedly inconsistent with American interests.\n\tMr. President, we cannot afford any further delay. Some of my colleagues will oppose this agreement because it violates a technicality in the Senate's budget rules. Others will oppose it because they would like to change various details in the agreement and implementing legislation. I myself am not without some reservations.\n\tBut the simple fact is that the time for equivocation has passed. Too much hangs in the balance to back away.\n\tIf we fail to act, we risk setting a dangerous protectionist precedent that could nullify all of the gains we have made in market access over the last four decades. If we fail to act, we could begin a process that will break the world into trading blocs--and cause the walls to go once again.\n\tThe Uruguay Round Agreement represents an important continuation of our decades-long advocacy of free and fair trade and will serve as a building block for future trade agreements. To balk now, after 7 years of negotiation under three administrations, would send dangerous signals around the world about our commitment to the principles of free and fair trade.\n\tThe agreement we consider today reflects the collective bipartisan belief of three presidents that an international trading system that is both free and fair serves the American national interest. I share that assessment.\n\tMr. President, on November 8 we experienced a remarkable election. While individual members have different reactions to it, the overriding message delivered by the voters was unmistakable. The American people are tired of what they perceive to be ``business-as-usual,'' partisan wrangling among professional politicians. They question our motives and relevance in the face of our inability to address very real national problems. And they want the Congress and the President to work together to deal constructively with these problems and improve the quality of their lives.\n\tWhile the new congressional line-up does not take effect until January, this debate marks the initial post-election test of whether Congress learned the lesson of the election and can respond to the will of the American people. There will be policy differences between our political parties and among individual members. That is inevitable in a democracy, and it is healthy.\n\tVotes are judgment calls, and our constituents elect us to analyze facts and make judgments. Americans are, however, becoming less tolerant of our penchant for seeking to score political or rhetorical points while their concerns go unattended.\n\tIt is time to stop bickering and start governing. This vote, on this issue, at this time, will demonstrate that we have heard the voice of the people and can work together for the common good.\n\tMy judgment is that approval of the Uruguay Round Agreement is important to the future growth of our national economy, and I am delighted that the President and the Republican Leader were able to work together to reach consensus on the implementing legislation that we consider today.\n\tI urge all my colleagues to approve this historic agreement.\n\tMr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Uruguay round agreement.\n\tIn this town, we talk a great deal about winners and losers. We wonder who will benefit and who will be hurt by the decisions we make. But on the issue before us today, the answer to this question is quite easy.\n\tThe typical working family in America would be the true winner if we approve this trade agreement. To be sure, American business would be a winner, but that's not why we should vote aye. Our standing around the world would be strengthened, but that's not why we should back GATT.\n\tWe should back GATT because of what it would mean to working people in this country. Although people in some sectors would unfortunately be hurt, the gains overall would be impressive. Working people would enjoy a major tax cut on many essential products they buy. They could find better employment opportunities in a growing export sector. Their children would look forward to a brighter future in a competitive, vibrant global economy.\n\tThat's what is really at stake here this week. We will hear a great deal of ominous talk about a something called a world trade organization. We will hear about dolphins and tuna. We will hear philosophical discussions about national sovereignty and abstract ruminations over international law.\n\tBut when it comes right down to it, GATT is about two things a great deal more immediate and a great deal more real to families all across this country: better jobs and lower taxes.\n\tA major boost in family income and a $12 billion tax cut over five years for the working people of America. When we get through the pages and pages of abstract trade language and the hours and hours of red-hot rhetoric, that's what GATT is all about. Better jobs and lower taxes.\n\tThis vote presents us with our first opportunity since the election to come together--Republican and Democrat, conservative and liberal--on behalf of the working families of this country. Passing this trade agreement is just about the best holiday present we could give them.\n\n\n                         u.s. trade leadership\n\n\tFor almost 50 years, the United States has been the principal leader in efforts to expand world trade. After World War II, we vigorously pursued trade liberalization not only to increase our own economic prosperity but also to bolster the stability of our allies and former enemies alike.\n\tExpanded trade has been the success story of the post-war economy. Since the beginning of multilateral trade negotiations, GATT membership has increased from 23 nations to 124, and tariffs--which are simply taxes on traded goods--have been cut from 40 percent to 5 percent. During that time, the global economy has grown faster than during any comparable period of world history, and U.S. job creation in trade-related fields has grown at a rate several times faster than over-all job creation.\n\tIncreased trade has also proven to be a foreign policy success. Prosperous nations linked together in trade are far less likely to go to war. People engaged with each other in commerce are far less likely to engage each other in violence.\n\tIt took two world wars to teach us this lesson, and it's as valid today as it was half a century ago.\n\n\n                       where do we go from here?\n\n\tToday the nations of the world are linked together in a complex web of overlapping trading relations. More than one trillion dollars a day is traded in the global markets. And the growth industries in the industrialized nations of the world are disproportionately those that are succeeding at trade.\n\tMost have sought these opportunities because the domestic markets for their products have been saturated. Their growth--and ours--is dependent on increased trade opportunities.\n\tRecognizing this fact, the past three presidents--Republican and Democratic alike--have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to opening markets and expanding world trade. A major step was the North American Free Trade Agreement, Already responsible for increasing our exports to Mexico at a rate more than three times as fast as U.S. exports to the rest of the world.\n\tThe next step is the Uruguay round of GATT, launched under President Reagan, advanced by President Bush and completed by President Clinton. At the start of negotiations, we enacted legislation outlining our principal trading objectives. The Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 established three overall goals: increased market access, a reduction of over-all trade barriers and an improved and strengthened dispute settlement process.\n\n\tThe final Uruguay round agreement achieves all of these objectives. It will cut overall tariffs by approximately one-third, expand GATT discipline to new areas of commercial activity and increase enforcement authority for trade violations.\n\n\n                        world trade organization\n\n\tBy far, the most controversial part of the Uruguay round agreement is the formation of a world trade organization to administer, oversee and enforce the conduct of trade relations among participating member nations.\n\tThe formation of a governing body with teeth was one of the American business community's top priorities during the Uruguay round. Current enforcement procedures have proven inadequate. Insufficient deadlines for resolving trade challenges have frustrated and delayed decisions for years.\n\tThe current reliance on decision-making by consensus has allowed one country to block favorable decisions from being implemented. And lax surveillance and implementation of final decisions have prevented corrective action.\n\tThese deficiencies have disproportionately harmed American businesses, which export more products than those from any other nation. Since the United States has fewer trade barriers than other countries, we have the most to gain by creating and enforcing more fair and open international economic playing rules.\n\tWe have nothing to fear from fair competition and an even playing field. A team that plays by the rules should have no problem with a referee.\n\tBut, as the agreement worked out between the administration and Senator Dole last week makes clear, congress can pull the United States out of the World Trade Organization if it repeatedly and groundlessly rules against us.\n\n\n                what expanded trade means to connecticut\n\n\tMy State of Connecticut is already taking advantage of the Global economy and is poised to do even more should we pass GATT. Exports have been one of the few profit-making and job-creating sectors of Connecticut's economy during the recent downturn. The state's exports grew by $5.5 billion from 1987 to 1993.\n\tFor years, Connecticut has been one of the most defense-dependent states in our Nation. The decline in Federal defense dollars has had a severe and lasting impact on our economy. We are fortunate, however, that exports helped fill the gap--increasing at approximately the same rate as defense dollars declined.\n\tConnecticut businesses are no longer asking why they should export, but how. And they are doing so in greater numbers, thanks to the increased level of awareness in the business community heightened by the NAFTA debate last year. Connecticut firms and their employees are thirsty for trade, and they are anxious to benefit from more targeted and coordinated export and financing opportunities.\n\tThe benefits in Connecticut are seen by small and large businesses alike. The commerce department reports that 97 percent of all exporting businesses in Connecticut have fewer than 500 employees.\n\tLet me give you just one example of how international trade is benefiting Connecticut. Heublein Corportion--which employs 2,000 Americans, 800 of them in Connecticut--is now selling American-manufactured Smirnoff vodka in Russia. Smirnoff--produced from a Russian recipe by American workers--is a status symbol in Russia. This year, Heublein will sell 500,000 cases of Smirnoff, up from zero in 1990. Most of the vodka is produced in Hartford.\n\tHeublein has barely tapped this market. The 500,000 cases of vodka represent only one-half of one percent of Russian vodka consumption. If Heublein can increase Smirnoff's share of the Russian market to just five percent, it will see substantial profits, and Connecticut workers will hopefully see more jobs.\n\tThe entire New England region--with its large export industries and high-technology companies will benefit substantially from the intellectual property provisions and increased market access included in the Uruguay round.\n\tLet's take just one example: The pharmaceutical industry, which supports 10,000-12,000 jobs in my state alone. While the industry leads the world in the development and production of new medicines, it loses as much as $5 billion a year through international piracy. A lack of recognized and enforced patent protections have enabled foreign businesses to easily and inexpensively reproduce U.S. drugs, drugs that often take years and millions of dollars to bring to market.\n\tThe Uruguay round agreement will help remedy this problem by providing 20 years of patent protection for pharmaceuticals and strict enforcement of intellectual property rights, including special border measures to prevent the importation of infringing imports. That means fair competition for American pharmaceutical firms, and better jobs for American workers.\n\n\n                     western hemisphere free trade\n\n\tI hope we will approve this trade agreement, and then look beyond it to find other dramatic ways to cut taxes and create high-quality jobs for working families through international trade. I believe the first step should be a concerted effort to expand trade opportunities in our own hemisphere.\n\tThirty years ago, John Kennedy proposed a new alliance for progress to strengthen our ties to our Latin American and Caribbean neighbors. Kennedy implored:\n\n       Let us once again transform the American continent into a \n     vast crucible of revolutionary ideas and efforts--a tribute \n     to the power of the creative energies of free men and women--\n     an example to all the world that liberty and progress walk \n     hand in hand. Let us once again awaken our American \n     revolution until it guides the struggle of people \n     everywhere--not with an imperialism of force or fear, but \n     with the rule of courage and freedom and hope for the future \n     of man.\n\n\tThree decades later, the political and economic conditions necessary to give fruit to these hopes have improved substantially. In my view, the hemisphere is ready to move toward free trade and closer ties.\n\tI believe that we should give the President the authority to negotiate a comprehensive and inclusive western hemisphere free trade agreement by the end of this century. We should seize the opportunity presented by the historic summit of the Americas meeting in Miami as the first major step in this direction. If we act with leadership and vision, the western hemisphere will enter the 21st century strengthened by democracy, warmed by friendship and linked by free trade.\n\tLatin America and the Caribbean are rapidly becoming larger players in the global marketplace, providing promising new markets for American exported goods. Since 1989, U.S. exports to the region have grown by 60 percent. The region is now our third largest trading partner, surpassed only by Canada and Western Europe.\n\tA western hemisphere free trade area would comprise the largest single market in the world. It would include nearly three-quarters of a billion people and have a gross domestic product of more than $7.3 trillion.\n\tA hemispherewide free trade agreement would cement and further recent democratic and economic reforms in Latin America. Expanded trade is the best tool we have to strengthen the democracies of the region and prevent civil strife. And it is the best tool we have to expand markets thirsty for U.S. products.\n\tIn addition to expanding market access, our participation in a hemisphere-wide accord would strengthen our hand in trade negotiations with the Europeans and the Japanese. It would give us more leverage in opening up markets around the world. And it would position our economy for success in the coming century.\n\n\n                    caribbean interim trade program\n\n\tI want to briefly address another piece of unfinished business involving trade in our hemisphere.\n\tOriginally, President Clinton had intended to submit as part of the GATT implementing bill a measure that would expand our special trading relationship with the Caribbean basin. This provision, called the Interim Trade Program (ITP), was intended to encourage trade liberalization in the Caribbean region while stimulating a growing market for U.S. exports.\n\tIt was--and still is--necessary because of increased pressures on the U.S.-Caribbean trading relationship as a result of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Uruguay round of the GATT.\n\tDuring the past few months, I have been contacted repeatedly by U.S. and Caribbean business leaders and government officials who are concerned that without the Interim Trade Program trade relations between the United States and the region will be slowly undermined. Already, there is evidence that Caribbean garment exports to the United States have been displaced by exports from Mexico and Asia. Further erosion of these trade patterns could have a disastrous effect on investment, economic growth and, ultimately, peace and stability in the region.\n\tI understand that the Clinton administration has pledged to resubmit this legislation early next year, and that it ``staunchly'' supports its enactment as soon as possible. The Caribbean now ranks as our 10th largest trading partner, and it is one of the regions with which we consistently maintain a trading surplus.\n\tSo I hope my colleagues will join me in urging the administration to move quickly on this pledge so we can continue to strengthen our mutually beneficial relationship with our Caribbean partners.\n\n\n                     enhancing u.s. competitiveness\n\n\tExpanding trade opportunities--whether in the Caribbean, Latin America or elsewhere--is essential to our nation's future prosperity, but it alone is not enough. Throughout our trade debates, concerns have been voiced about the impact of increased international competition on our work force.\n\n\tWhile I disagree with these critics' conclusions that we should turn back the clock on free trade, I share many of their concerns. If all Americans are to benefit from expanded trade, it is critical that we enhance the competitiveness of our nation's work force.\n\tThe American work force is in the process of substantial structural change. Increased global economic competition and rapid advances in technology have transformed the economy, streamlining manufacturing processes and placing a premium on highly-skilled and highly-educated workers.\n\tWhile the demand for skilled workers has increased, the number of jobs available for those lacking skills has declined. According to the congressional research service, over the past fifteen years, manufacturing jobs--the bedrock of the middle class--declined by 19 percent, and real wages dropped by 10 percent.\n\tThese trends threaten traditional American middle-class life, and they undermine our shared sense of opportunity and experience that form the basis for our success as a nation.\n\tThe solution to these difficulties, though, is not to turn back, but to confront the obstacles head-on. And we are doing so.\n\tAs a result of the Clinton administration's new investment priorities and broad, bipartisan congressional support: 130,000 more children will enroll in head start each year, and enter school ready to learn; national education standards and goals will help guide student instruction for the first time; new school-to-work programs will assist students who choose to move directly from high school to work through job training programs, apprenticeships and vocational education; student loan reform legislation is expanding college access, permitting more flexible repayment options, and saving taxpayer dollars through direct student lending; our unemployment system is shifting to a reemployment system, ensuring that Americans who lose their jobs receive skills and job-search assistance to help them find new ones--not just an unemployment check.\n\tWe must do more--and we will. I look forward to working with colleagues in both parties in the Congress ahead to increase the security and competitiveness of the American work force.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n\tThe United States entered the twentieth century as a struggling young democracy, and here in the century's closing days we find ourselves the world's only superpower. The twentieth century has been correctly labelled the American century. If we are to continue our extraordinary and unprecedented record of success and leadership, we must embrace the future with enthusiasm, strength and foresight.\n\tThe United States has proven itself to be the strongest and most resilient nation on earth. Our citizens are our greatest source of talent and strength. Time and time again, they have been at their best when they have risen to face difficult challenges.\n\tThe American people will face the challenge of the global economy, and they will prevail.\n\tAnd this Congress will face a decision over whether we will march into the economy of tomorrow face first, with our eyes wide-open, or whether we will be dragged into it from behind, with our eyes firmly fixed on the past.\n\tI urge my colleagues to support the Uruguay round and cast a vote for the working families of America.\n\tMr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will vote for this agreement today, Mr. President, because I am convinced that it is a good deal for our country, that it will open more opportunities for our workers--the most productive in the world today--to sell their products in expanding overseas markets.\n\tBut before I explain my decision, I want to say a few words about the concerns of those Americans who oppose this agreement.\n\tIf this is such a good deal, why do we hear so many voices raised in opposition? I believe that there are real reasons for Americans to be concerned about the place of our economy in the world, and concerned about the possible effects on our standard of living from increased international competition.\n\tIn recent years, American faith in the future, American confidence in dealing with the rest of the world, has been replaced with a growing anxiety. Before we have had a chance to enjoy our victory in the cold war, we now face a world that appears to many of us as a threat to our economic wellbeing.\n\tMr. President, if you take a hard look at what has happened to our standard of living over recent decades, you know why many Americans no longer face the future with confidence.\n\tTwo key elements that traditionally supported Americans' faith in the future were job security and growing incomes. If you worked hard and played by the rules, America was the land where you could make a better life for yourself and your children.\n\tThis was the promise, and the reality, of the American economy for a whole generation after World War II.\n\tBut in recent years, that reality, that promise, has too often been replaced by stagnant wages and declining job stability. In particular, middle-class manufacturing jobs have become scarcer, and the security of lifetime employment has been replaced by an era of downsizing and restructuring.\n\tIn my own State of Delaware, we have worked hard, and succeeded in keeping unemployment below the national average, but those trends have still hit every key industry.\n\tIn an atmosphere like this, it only makes sense for Americans to be concerned about the future, and something that appears as new and different as a World Trade Organization as yet another threat to American wages and job security.\n\tFor the average working American, wages have not grown for over two decades. Families now have to run faster--with both parents working--just to stay in place. And the jobs that they do find no longer offer the promise of security.\n\tNo wonder Americans are skeptical about, even frightened, by an agreement that appears to draw us deeper into a world economy, and, they are told, ties us to a new international organization over which we have no control.\n\tBut these changes that worry us today were not caused by the GATT agreement, and rejecting this agreement will not make it any easier for us to deal with those changes.\n\tOther forces have been the source of the changes that rightfully concern us. A revolution in technology--led by the United States--has transformed virtually every industry in this country. Almost every kind of work has been made easier and faster by computers and many other new ways of moving and handling information.\n\tThese advances in productivity allow us to make more products with less labor. Productivity gains in turn have caused companies here to restructure the way they do business, reducing workforces and changing the job structure in our country.\n\tUnder these new conditions, we must find new, expanding markets for our products if we hope to create new jobs. Those markets exist, overseas, but we need agreements like this one to open them to American goods.\n\tMr. President, if we reject this agreement, we will give up a $700 billion cut in other countries' tariffs, $700 billion in barriers to American products and American job growth.\n\tIf we reject this agreement, we will give up American negotiating victories that won us fairer treatment of agricultural and service exports. For the first time, these sectors--our most competitive internationally--will be subject to fairer rules and will be sold at lower prices and higher volume overseas.\n\tIf we reject this agreement, we will give up powerful new protections for American intellectual property--the scientific achievements embodied in the advanced products and processes we protect with patents. Other countries are required for the first time to honor those protections.\n\n\tThat means more jobs here at home, jobs that without this agreement will go to countries that will continue to pirate our formulas, software, and other American inventions.\n\tMr. President, another revolution--against State-controlled societies and economies--was led by the United States. The obvious superiority of democracy and free enterprise--the lesson America helped to teach the world--weakened and then toppled totalitarian systems. Communism failed; we won.\n\tAlong with the rise of new, developing, industrial countries, this revolution has opened a huge new market to international competition. We won the cold war, and our way of life is the most copied and most envied on the planet. Now, people in other nations seek their fortunes in a global economy in which we are the best prepared to compete.\n\tDespite the many dangers and evils still abroad in the world today, we now see a world less hostile to our way of life, not a world split by two irreconcilable visions.\n\tMr. President, we are a long way from a world in which everyone enjoys the rights and privileges of Americans. And as some of my colleagues have argued, there remain far too many countries where wages and living standards are low. But in recent years we have seen more nations look to the American way as the guide for economic development.\n\tThis is a world in which our workers, our entrepreneurs, scientists, and inventors, can compete and win. But to win, we must compete, not retreat.\n\tJust this year, our economy returned to its position as the most productive in the world. A world reshaped by our inventions and convinced of the superiority of our way of life offers us rich new opportunities in expanding markets, if only we will stick to our principles of free trade and vote to approve this agreement.\n\tI have listened to the charges that opponents of this agreement have made. They scared me, Mr. President, as they have scared some Americans. If I thought those charges were true, there is no way I could vote for it. But this agreement is not the cause of the problems we face in our economy. In fact, I am convinced that it can be part, but only part, of a solution.\n\tMr. President, like most of the legislation we pass here in Washington, this latest trade deal is neither all its supporters or its detractors claim it to be. This legislation is a compromise among many different interests, representing something most of us here can agree on but that none of us is completely happy with.\n\tThat is also what happened in the years of international negotiations, conducted under the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations, during which this deal was put together. They produced an agreement that is the best accommodation among the one hundred and twenty countries that have committed themselves to the world trading system.\n\tAnd this agreement is just the latest part of a long history of international trade agreements since World War II.\n\tMr. President, some Americans might gather from some of the discussion about this agreement that this is something new for the United States, something that will permanently affect our trading relations with the rest of the world.\n\tIn fact, this is the eighth round of negotiations we have conducted under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade since 1947. As the leading market economy in the world, we have consistently pressed negotiations with our trading partners to reduce artificial barriers to free markets.\n\tThe Uruguay round is a significant step forward, including for the first time trade in services and agriculture--areas in which the United States has a real advantage, and bringing the frustrating and chaotic practices and procedures of the GATT system into a more formal structure, the new World Trade Organization.\n\tAs important as those changes are, they are incremental, not a radical departure from the past.\n\tFor those citizens whose attention is drawn to trade policy for the first time with the debate on this, the eighth round of GATT agreements, it is important to put its features into that historical context.\n\tI see this process a little differently, from a perspective that I gained in a very different policy area--our arms control negotiations over this same period. In some ways, our attempts to lower trade barriers is similar to our attempts to reduce the threat of weapons around the world.\n\n\tFrom the beginning of the cold war, we recognized that we could not achieve our own goal of national security by ourselves. We saw that if every nation went its own way, building more and more weapons to match the threats of others, no one would be safe.\n\tNot everyone thought each deal we struck was the best for us--some criticized arms control agreements for giving too much to the other side, some thought they did not reduce weapons fast enough. But we continued to keep the talks going, in the belief--which proved to be right--that these complicated issues would only yield to long-term, patient negotiation.\n\tTaking the best we could get at each stage, our arms control policy achieved real progress. Today, new, equally difficult negotiations continue this process. The alternative--demanding complete capitulation by the other side, or abandoning negotiations altogether--will gain us nothing.\n\tInternational trade negotiations follow this same pattern. Because there is no final authority to compel countries to follow any trade rules, progress can only be made on those areas in which there has been agreement.\n\tThat point bears repeating, Mr. President. The new World Trade Organization has authority over trade rules only as long as we agree that those rules are in our interest. By the terms of the agreement, we can get out of the organization at any time, on six months notice.\n\tIn addition to that fundamental safeguard, we have put into this legislation requirements for an annual report on the benefits of this deal to the United States, and have scheduled votes every 5 years on whether we should stay a member.\n\tA final, additional safeguard sets up a panel of judges to look at any rulings that the World Trade Organization may make affecting the United States. If those rulings are not made according to procedures we accept, that is grounds for a vote to get out.\n\tMr. President, some of my colleagues have argued that we will have only one vote in the new World Trade Organization, and claim that will put us at an obvious disadvantage in an organization of 120 countries, many of which are smaller and less developed than we are.\n\tBut the formal operating rule of the WTO is decision by consensus--everyone, including the United States must agree before a decision is made. Under the current GATT, consensus is used, but only by tradition, not by the formal rule required in the Uruguay round before us today.\n\tIf a vote is taken, if consensus fails to produce a decision, no important change in our rights or obligations can be made without a two-thirds vote, a supermajority in which the influence of the largest market and the most productive economy--the United States--will be felt.\n\tBut even if we fail to get support to prevent a two-thirds vote, Mr. President, any change in rights or obligations will apply only to those who vote for it, not to those who disagree. Only by a vote of three-quarters of the members can change in rights and obligations apply to all members, and even then there are provisions for waivers.\n\tThese are hardly the procedures of an organization designed to steamroll our country.\n\tAnd no action of the WTO has any bearing on State laws, such as Delaware's incorporation and other laws that make our State such a good place to do business. The Association of State Attorneys General, National Governors' Association, and National Council of State Legislatures support the Uruguay round agreement because they worked closely with the U.S. Trade Representative to get additional protection into the legislation we will vote on today.\n\tThis is not the end of the process. It is one more step in a series of negotiations to improve the long-term growth opportunities for American industries. There are certainly many more barriers and unfair practices out there that we want to remove. But there will be other agreements, if, and only if, there is a structure that continues to serve the interests of the United States.\n\tDo I like every aspect of the deal? I do not. But I am sure of two things: First, with this agreement, American products have better access to more markets around the globe than ever before, and opportunities are better now for future job creation--in the highest paying jobs, in exporting industries.\n\n\tAnd second, I am sure that we have preserved our options--we can continue to use the forum of the World Trade Organization to fight for American economic interests in the future. Without the organization--including the stronger rules that we fought for--countries would go their own way, back into a system where every nation looks after its own narrow interests, and everyone loses.\n\tMr. President, that retreat into protectionism will cost American jobs, as companies move overseas to beat the tariffs other countries raise against products made here. To keep out cheaper imports, we might try to raise the cost of products from overseas--by raising tariffs, which are taxes on American consumers. We lose jobs, and prices increase--this is no answer to the very real problems in our economy.\n\tIf there is any doubt about that, just open your history books to the period of the 1930's. That was when we and the rest of the world retreated behind protectionism, and we accelerated the slide into a world-wide depression. We learned from that bitter experience, and after World War II we established the GATT, and have systematically pushed back trade barriers ever since.\n\tMr. President, my own State of Delaware has been in a great position to take advantage of lower trade barriers that we have achieved under the GATT. And many of the successes scored by United States negotiators in the Uruguay round directly benefit Delaware's key industries.\n\tAt Wilmington, Delaware boasts one of the most important seaports on the East Coast, and many of the world's most important high technology, chemical and pharmaceutical companies. We stand at the edge of our country, and have always looked out to the rest of the world for new opportunities.\n\tThe chemical industry is the nation's, and Delaware's, biggest exporter--last year, our companies sold $2.3 billion of their products overseas, over two-thirds of the State's total exports.\n\tThe Uruguay round cuts tariffs of our most important trading partners, widening the markets for Delaware chemical exports. But I want us to do more, particularly to bring developing countries under the same rules our biggest customers have agreed to. That is why I support the creation of a strong organization to continue to press for more open markets.\n\tOur chemical and pharmaceutical companies will also gain important protection for their patents--the ``intellectual property'' in their formulas and processes. For years, other countries have pirated these formulas and processes, but at the insistence of the United States, they will now be protected.\n\tThe Delaware Department of Agriculture endorses the Uruguay round agreement, because it will increase American exports of poultry and other products important to Delaware. United States poultry exports are predicted to rise 32 percent over the next ten years under the terms of the Uruguay round agreement.\n\tNot just our biggest companies and industries will benefit from this agreement. Delaware has more than 250 exporting businesses. Fully 96 percent of them are small businesses, with fewer than 500 employees each. Throughout our state, jobs are tied to the international economy which will continue to grow with the global tariff cuts in the Uruguay round agreement.\n\tMr. President, this agreement is one step toward a fairer, more predictable world trading system, one in which the specific advantages of the United States--in the fast growing service sector, in agricultural products, in high technology products--receive new protection and greater access to the markets of the world.\n\tAmericans are understandably concerned about the changing role of our economy in a changing world. In response to those concerns, this agreement will open more growing markets to our workers and factories--the most productive in the world. The agreement will remove $750 billion in tariff barriers in the international economy, increasing the flow of trade in a system where we have the advantage of the biggest single market and the most productive workers.\n\tMr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have several concerns with the proposed World Trade Organization [WTO] and associated trade agreements.\n\tThe latest series of negotiations on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT] was officially completed on April 15 of this year when representatives of over 100 countries signed the final act of the Uruguay round in Morocco, coming over 4 years after the original completion date of December 1990.\n\tIn some important ways, trade barriers are reduced and free-trade is enhanced by the most recent GATT. According to the Congressional Research Service, tariffs will be reduced an average of one-third on thousands of manufactured goods, and it is my understanding that a number of improvements have been made in the area of intellectual property that may benefit U.S. companies.\n\tBut, Mr. President, there are aspects of the proposed agreement that are troubling. There are clearly imbalances in the costs and benefits flowing from the proposed agreement, and for certain sectors of the economy, the proposed agreement may be a bad deal.\n\tOne of the most important small businesses in my own State of Wisconsin, the family dairy farmer, may be particularly hard hit.\n\tUnder the proposed agreement, European nations will be allowed to subsidize 30 billion pounds of dairy exports while we will have reduced subsidized exports to just 1.5 billion pounds. In addition, we have agreed to open our domestic markets to increased dairy imports which will, in all likelihood, reduce domestic prices for our own producers.\n\tA recent analysis of the proposed agreement by Cornell University economist Andy Novakovic concluded that the proposed GATT trade agreement could lower U.S. milk price by as much as $2 per hundredweight.\n\tIn Wisconsin, such a price drop could result in the devastating loss of as much as $480 million in annual farm income.\n\tMr. President, the economic consequences of such a drop in income would extend well beyond the family farms themselves. That kind of blow could send many rural areas into significant economic downturns, at a time when many are still recovering from last year's floods, and dairy farmers are already having to cope with the arrival of bovine growth hormone, and the continuing loss of dairy farms to the west and south due in large part to a Federal milk marketing order system that discriminates against them.\n\tMr. President, the potential economic consequences could go even further, underscoring my second concern that there may be an effort to implement the proposed trade agreement without funding that pact.\n\tMr. President, some have argued that we should waive the budget rules, and allow the implementing legislation to add to our Federal budget deficit. According to a number of estimates, this will amount to an additional $40 billion in deficit increases over the next 10 years, not including the additional interest that will accrue because of those higher deficits.\n\tAdding such a huge additional burden to the Federal deficit not only betrays future generations of taxpayers, it arguably undercuts everything we have accomplished in the last year and a half to reduce the deficit. By ducking our responsibility on the proposed implementing legislation, we will have undone the progress we made to reduce the deficit, progress which was so difficult to achieve.\n\tWaiving our own budget rules in this instance also makes it all the easier to do so again whenever finding sufficient funding for a politically appealing proposal becomes difficult.\n\tMaking exceptions to tough budget rules will soon render those rules meaningless.\n\tPerhaps even worse than waiving the provisions of our budget rules, some are now proposing to change the way we calculate fiscal effects to allow controversial assumptions to be made about potential economic behavior. The effect of this risky new procedure would be to make it much easier for legislative proposals to be considered without being fully funded.\n\tAt least a motion to waiver our budget rules is an open, public act, for which each Member may be held accountable. Changing the way fiscal estimates are calculated is a surreptitious and disingenuous attempt to circumvent our budget rules.\n\tI strongly reject such an effort to sidestep our tough budget rules merely to make it easier to promote a political agenda.\n\tThe only way we will continue to reduce the Federal budget deficit is to maintain strict budget discipline and fully fund legislative proposals with real offsets, not by ``cooking the books'' with questionable assumptions.\n\tIf any savings are realized above and beyond those that are calculated under the current, more conservative approach, then they can be applied to further reducing the deficit.\n\n\tAre we now to change the budget rules every time compliance with them becomes inconvenient or even difficult?\n\tMr. President, we are confronted on a regular basis with having to make tough decisions on worthy programs because of our budget rules, and rightly so. The Federal budget deficit must be brought down.\n\tThe proposed World Trade Organization is certainly a significant matter, but the importance of an issue should not determine whether or not it should conform with the budget rules we have set for ourselves.\n\tIndeed, the true test of our resolve to bring the deficit under control is our willingness to apply the budget rules to the important issues.\n\tTo those who suggest that we will generate more revenues than will be lost, I say, ``all the better.'' Let us fully fund the implementing legislation. Then, any hoped for additional revenues we realize will reduce the deficit that much further.\n\tMeasure that against the terrible precedent of waiving the budget rules, or even worse, of changing those rules to meet our convenience.\n\tMr. President, the last concern with the proposed World Trade Organization I want to discuss relates to the potential impact it may have on how this body, and other democratic policy-making institutions, will be affected by our adoption of the proposed agreement.\n\tDespite a comprehensive set of rules, detailing what trade activities are permitted and what are not, as well as a dispute mechanism, the world trade system has largely been one of concensus. As the senior Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan] has pointed out, this is because there never has been a formal ratification of what was to have been the treaty formalizing our membership in something called the International Trade Organization, proposed just after World War II.\n\tInstead, we have operated in the trade system by unanimous consent.\n\tMr. President, this system has worked both for and against our trade interests, just as the rules of this body sometimes stymie legislation we may want, while also providing individual members and groups of members protection against possible abuse of majority power.\n\n\tAn example where the United States has exercised its effective veto power by refusing to consent is the tuna-dolphin issue. Despite findings against our Marine Mammal Protection law, the United States has not consented to those findings. As a result, we have not had to change our Marine Mammal Protection law, nor have we been forced to pay compensation, nor have we been subjected to trade sanctions because of the findings against us.\n\tThis would not be the case under the proposed WTO. If we were to lose the tuna-dolphin dispute as a member of the WTO, and there is every reason to suppose that we will, the United States would be put into the position of having to choose between changing one of our laws, paying compensation, or being subject to trade sanctions.\n\tWe would be faced with these same three options any time we lost a dispute with respect to a domestic law.\n\tMr. President, responsible representatives of a number of different organizations have noted that there may well be a significant impact on our current laws and regulations as well as on future policy and policy-making.\n\tThe response that some forward--that the proposed WTO and associated trade agreements will mean freer trade--is not sufficient reason for the Senate to ratify membership in the proposed WTO.\n\tWith respect to our Nation's domestic policies, and aside from the noneconomic goals of our country, though free trade may be a priority for our economy, no trade agreement should come at the expense of the policies that enhance the 90 percent of our economy that is entirely domestic.\n\tNor is free trade the only goal of our foreign policy.\n\tMr. President, a foreign policy that promotes democratic ideals, that enhances human rights, that protects the common environment of the world in which we live, is certainly also a goal. Two useful methods of achieving these goals have been through trade levers and economic sanctions.\n\tThe proposed agreement greatly diminishes our ability to use these tools, and leaves us with fewer, more perilous alternatives.\n\n\tAnd, Mr. President, as others have noted, in addition to our federal laws, our State and local laws would be subject to the oversight of the WTO as well.\n\tThe ominous and far-reaching effect of this agreement has been felt already. Responding to a number of Members who expressed concerns about the effect the proposed agreement would have on our ability to ban imports made by child labor, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Kantor, in a letter to those Members, conceded that nothing in the proposed agreement would change previous GATT rulings that the United States could not block the importation of a product made by child labor.\n\tOf broader concern were Ambassador Kantor's additional comments in that letter in which he also conceded that it was likely that the administration will oppose legislation they consider to conflict with the rules of the proposed new World Trade Organization.\n\tIn fact, this may have occurred already as it is my understanding that during the past session the administration voiced their opposition to at least one telecommunications reform proposal as being GATT illegal.\n\tMr. President, because of this very aspect of the pact, some have suggested this proposal should be considered as a treaty. Given the potential impact our membership may have on our federal, state and local laws and lawmaking, and on our ability to promote the foreign policy goals I noted earlier, requiring the agreement to be ratified as a treaty may be appropriate.\n\tMr. President, there have been some recent developments with respect to the proposed implementing legislation that I also want address. In particular, I know many were interested in the agreement reached between the administration and the Republican Leader, Mr. Dole.\n\tAs I understand this agreement, a judicial panel that would advise Congress is created to review the WTO dispute settlement process, and to determine whether WTO dispute panels exceed their authority or act outside the scope of the GATT agreement.\n\tOn the charge given to this proposed judicial panel, I would only note that much of the foreboding that surrounds the WTO dispute settlement procedures have not been that a WTO panel would act outside its scope or exceed its authority, but that the scope and authority granted such panels in the first place are enormously broad and overly intrusive.\n\n\tBeyond that, Mr. President, the creation of a judicial review panel to advise Congress on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, whatever its charge, does not satisfy the concerns I have outlined.\n\tThe creation of a judicial advisory panel does nothing to solve the deficit problem created by the GATT implementing bill. Not one more penny in offsets is added to the current inadequate level of funding, so the implementing legislation still violates our budget rules.\n\tNor does the creation of judicial panel correct the gross inequities confronting our domestic dairy industry. European nations will still be allowed to subsidize 30 billion pounds of dairy exports while we will have reduced subsidized exports to just 1.5 billion pounds, with potential devastating economic consequences for family farms and many rural communities.\n\tNor does the creation of a judicial panel change the outcome of any ruling by the WTO, nor would it change the impact such a ruling could have on our Federal, State, and local laws, or on our ability to conduct foreign policy.\n\tIn this respect, the defect in the current agreement, as presented to Congress, is that we are asked to choose between increased trade and independent democratic institutions. That choice is fundamentally flawed, and the creation of a judicial panel does not correct the shortcoming.\n\tMr. President, I hope we will not decide that, in the name of free trade, we should join a new international organization that may dramatically alter and even harm the ability of our democratic institutions to set trade and non-trade related policies.\n\tMr. President, we should reject the proposed pact, and seek a new one--one that provides truly free and fair trade for all sectors of the economy, one that is fully funded, and one that preserves our cherished democratic institutions.\n\tMr. RIEGLE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this bill to implement the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade--GATT. While this is not perfect legislation, and there are parts of this bill that I am deeply concerned about, I believe it is important for our Nation's economic future that we pass this legislation.\n\tThe Uruguay round opens foreign markets to U.S. goods and services by lowering tariffs and non-tariff barriers in foreign countries, which will benefit many Michigan industries. For example, it will, on average, reduce foreign tariffs on autos by over 50% and on auto parts by over 25% by our major trading partners. It will cut foreign tariffs on household appliances in our major markets by over 40% on average. It will eliminate duties on furniture exports to Japan and the European Union as well as strengthen intellectual property protection for furniture designs. And it will cut foreign tariffs on machine tools and open up foreign government procurement markets to U.S. companies.\n\tWhile lowering foreign trade barriers, the legislation preserves U.S. trade laws. For example, this bill includes a 1-year legislative extension of Super 301. While the provision is not identical to the original Super 301 provision I coauthored with Senator Danforth in the 1988 Trade Act, I am pleased that the administration and the Congress have recognized the usefulness of this important tool for overcoming foreign trade barriers.\n\tThe bill also includes a provision directing the President to request the establishment of a working group on trade and labor rights within the new World Trade Organization--WTO. While I would like to have seen more on labor rights in this legislation, I believe that such a working group is an appropriate first step toward grappling with these issues.\n\tThere are a number of specific issues included in this legislation that I would like to briefly mention. First of all, let me point out that there are losers as well as winners under this Agreement. One of those industries that we face increased pressure under this Agreement is the zinc alloy industry. Because of reduced U.S. tariffs on zinc alloy imports, this industry is in danger of facing a surge of low-priced imports.\n\tI am pleased that the Statement of Administrative Action--SAA--accompanying this Agreement, which has the force of law, contains a provision which I sponsored requiring the administration to monitor zinc alloy imports. This monitoring will continue as tariffs are reduced for a period of at least 8 years, to determine if there is an injury or threat of injury to the industry and to the national security. If there is reason to believe that there is either severe injury or the threat of severe injury, or injury to national security due to imports of zinc alloys, the administration will initiate a section 201 or section 232 investigation to halt the injurious surge of imports. I hope the administration will be aggressive in its monitoring and investigation activities concerning zinc alloy imports.\n\tA second provision relates to how the anti-dumping laws are applied agricultural growers and processors. This problem came to my attention in the late 1980's when Michigan cherry growers complained that dumped cherry concentrate was causing them injury, even though the domestic processors themselves, the concentrators, were not necessarily affected. Because it was concentrate, and not cherries, that was being dumped, and because not all of the Michigan cherries went into concentrate, the domestic growers did not have a remedy under current law.\n\tThis is a very complicated problem, affecting many agricultural products. The SAA commits the administration to review the issue and propose legislation, if appropriate, to solve this problem. Again, I hope the administration will be aggressive is addressing this ongoing problem.\n\tThere are other provisions in this legislation, specifically in the area of anti-dumping and countervailing duties, that continue to concern me. One outstanding issue is that of duty absorption. In too many cases, importers who have been caught unfairly dumping or subsidizing their products are simply absorbing the costs of the duties imposed on them. By not raising prices by the amount of the duty as they should be doing, the importers continue their unfair practice of buying market share even though they may be losing money. The result is that the anti-dumping and countervailing duties are not effective in stopping the unfair practices.\n\tThis bill takes steps to correct the problem by requiring that duty absorption be considered when the International Trade Commission undertakes its administrative reviews of a dumping order to determine whether those orders should continue. However, the bill does not go the next step to require a calculation of the size of the duty absorption. Such a calculation as part of the review process would help policymakers by showing the extent of the problem. The Administration does not need legislation to perform this calculation; nor does the legislation prohibit such a calculation. I hope they will take it upon themselves to make this calculation.\n\n\tI am also concerned over the method used to calculate the exemption for start-up costs in an anti-dumping or countervailing duty case. This legislation contains a provision clarifying that such an exemption is available only for true start-up costs and not for costs such as a model year change over in the auto industry. However, the legislation allows variable costs, as well as fixed cost, to be excluded from the calculation of costs in start-up situations. While fixed costs are a legitimate start-up expense, variable costs are an on-going operational cost and should not have been included in this exemption. I hope this issue will be revisited by a future Congress.\n\tIn addition, I am concerned about the Agreement's new subsidies code. Some of my colleagues fear that the new subsidies rules will force the U.S. into a subsidies war by allowing only a very limited amount of government funding for industrial research. I disagree. The subsidies war started long ago, and America has been losing. I fear that these new subsidies rules will push us more toward unilateral disarmament while not stopping our foreign competitors. An Agreement will not stop other nations from unfairly trying to wreck American industries. That will take vigorous action by the Federal government in enforcing the new rules and in pursuing assistance to industry where allowed under the rules. We must continue to do all that we can to promote and maintain America's technological competitiveness.\n\n\n                             gatt and nafta\n\n\tMr. President, I was a strong opponent of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). I felt, and still believe, that NAFTA was fundamentally a bad deal for American workers and the American economy. Much of the recent celebratory noises about NAFTA are, at best, premature. Shifts in investment and the movement of plants and jobs takes years to show up in the statistics. However, the trend is very clear. One just has to look at the number of petitions for the special NAFTA Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits to realize that companies are already shipping jobs south.\n\tBut the GATT agreement is not NAFTA. At its core, NAFTA was all about the economic integration of a developed nation with a developing nation. It was a merger between two economies with fundamentally different structures and situations.\n\tI supported the U.S.-Canadian Free Trade Agreement (CFTA). The CFTA was essentially a deal between like-parties. The U.S. and Canadian economies are similar in their structure and level of development, and were already highly integrated. The CFTA was an agreement to set in place rules to govern our already intertwined economies. NAFTA was designed to put in place rules to force a joining of very different economies.\n\tIn that sense, the new GATT agreement is much more similar to the CFTA than it is to NAFTA--even though GATT does not go as far as toward integrating economies as the CFTA does. GATT is more a deal between equals. While the agreement broadens the scope of GATT coverage to include more developing countries under its rules, its core is comprised of the developed nations--especially the so-called ``quad'' of the U.S., Canada, Japan and the European Union.\n\tWhereas NAFTA was, at heart, an issue of economic integration, GATT is, at heart, an issue of lowering foreign trade barriers. The Uruguay Round includeds an over 40% reduction in tariffs on the most important manufacturing exports to Europe and Japan. It includes large tariff reductions in developing nations, such as the rapidly expanding markets in Asia and the Pacific. It also includes an important agreement on agriculture, including the opening of the Japanese rice market.\n\tAt the same time, unlike NAFTA, the Uruguay Round does not eliminate all U.S. tariffs. Under NAFTA, all tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods will be eliminated. Under GATT, some tariffs will be phased out, others will be reduced, and yet others will remain in place.\n\tA look at the dispute settlement process in GATT and NAFTA confirms the difference. Under NAFTA as an economic integration process, the binational dispute settlement panels can review and overturn decisions by the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission in cases involving U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws. The new WTO dispute settlement panels under the new Uruguay Round agreement don't have the power to overturn U.S. decisions. They can authorize other nations to seek retaliation, but they have no power directly over U.S. decisions. Rather than seeking economic integration, as under NAFTA, the Uruguay Round Agreement seeks to set up a mechanism to manage the rules of the road on international trade.\n\n\tFinally, and very importantly, the issue of investment is treated very differently in GATT and NAFTA. NAFTA was, in my view, an agreement to make Mexico safe for U.S. investments. One of its major purposes was to reduce the barriers to U.S. companies who wanted to set up operations in Mexico. The proponents of NAFTA couched this in terms of being able to have Mexican plants to serve the Mexican market. I think time will show that the results will be to move U.S. plants to Mexico to then sell products back to the U.S. market.\n\tGATT, on the other hand, says very little about investment. To some, this is a great short-coming of the agreement. However, I believe that the entire issue of the link between investment and trade is one which we need much more time to discuss and understand. Had the uruguay Round Agreement taken major steps that would have increased incentives for U.S. companies to move overseas, I would be strongly against it. But the new GATT Agreement, unlike NAFTA, does not include these incentives.\n\n\n                                funding\n\n\tOne of the areas that concerns me about this bill is the financing package. Under the current pay-as-you-go budgeting rules, Congress must insure that the bill will be budget neutral. Since implementing the agreement involves reducing tariffs on foreign goods sold in the U.S., Congress must either raise new revenues or cut spending to replace the revenues lost due to these cuts in tariffs. The amount in question is almost $12 billion over the first 5 years of the agreement. The bill sent to us by the Clinton Administration includes a $12 billion financing package, worked out in cooperation with the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\tTechnically, however, the bill does not cover all the revenues lose. Under a special Senate rule, revenues offsets are required for a full 10 years. This rule is separate and beyond the budget deficit reduction requirements we have enacted over the years, As I stated earlier, the funding package included in this bill covers only the first 5 years. Thus, the bill is subject to a point of order under the Senate rules, which requires 60 votes to waive.\n\tI firmly believe that this legislation, by opening foreign markets to U.S. goods and services, will promote economic growth here in America and will not result in an increase in the Federal budget deficit. Therefore, I will vote to waive any budget point of order that may be raised with respect to this bill. We should not allow technical accounting rules to get in the way of doing what must be done to ensure that America remains a strong player in the global economy.\n\tWhile I generally do not oppose this funding package, I am opposed to one element of it--the provisions concerned with the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation [PBGC]. I stand committed to ensuring that secure retirements are available to the working men and women in this country and understand that PBGC reform may be needed. However, the PBGC reform proposal included in this legislation has been subject to few hearings and almost no formal scrutiny by the relevant committees. I am concerned that we may be enacting far reaching changes to the pension system in our country without adequate debate or discussion.\n\n\n                               fast track\n\n\tThe issue of the PBGC reform proposals highlights my second concern over this bill--the so-called ``fast track'' process. Under the fast track procedure, legislation to implement a trade agreement proceeds under a specific timetable for Congressional consideration with no amendments allowed. My concern is not over the timetable for debate. I am, however, deeply concerned over the no amendment rule.\n\tAs the PBGC issue illustrates, fast track is being used for more than simply trade-specific items coming out of a multilateral negotiation. At a very minimum, future Congresses should not allow fast track procedures for trade agreements to be used beyond the intended scope to enact non-trade legislation. Any future procedure for handling trade agreements should allow amendments in general--and must, at least, allow amendments to non-trade, non-germane provisions.\n\tThere are those who claim that trade agreements must be an all-or-nothing vote by the Congress. They claim that to allow amendments to such a large agreement, negotiated by so many countries, would result in an unraveling of the agreement and its certain death.\n\tI disagree. The Congress, as the elected representatives of the people, should and must have a say in not only the final product of such trade agreements but also in the details.\n\tEven if such a fast track procedure were critical for large, multilateral agreements, the same procedure need not apply to bilateral trade agreements. Proponents of fast track claim it would be impossible to renegotiate an amendment with over 100 other nations. Even accepting that, surely it would be possible to renegotiate with a single nation over an issue held by the Congress to be important. Our experience with the NAFTA side-agreements confirms that such renegotiations are possible.\n\tLikewise, there is no need to extend fast track to the financing packages of a trade agreement. Under the current budget rules, any amendments to the fund provisions would have to be completely offset by a substitute funding provision. Opponents could not kill the agreement by amendment, as some fear. Changes in the financing package would not require renegotiations of the trade agreement itself. Thus, the rationale for fast track does not apply.\n\tI believe that our experience with this GATT implementing legislation should serve as a lesson to future Congresses. When used, if at all, fast track procedures should be explicitly reserved for truly multilateral trade provisions. They must be clearly restricted to only those parts of a multilateral agreement negotiated with other nations. All other parts of the bill must be subject to amendment--including the right of the Congress to add additional safeguards if necessary. Under this process, the rights and obligations of Congress are preserved while the negotiated parts of the agreement are not subject to amendment and the threat of renegotiation.\n\tThis system I have proposed would, I believe, overcome the flaws that have become evidence in the current fast track process, while continuing our ability to negotiate trade agreements. I hope future Congresses will look carefully at this suggestion when debating any renewal of fast track authority.\n\n\n                     sovereignty and related issues\n\n\tWhile I have concerns over this Agreement, I do not believe that it violates U.S. sovereignty, as some have claimed. The rules under which the WTO will operate are generally the same as for the current GATT--something not well understood. In most cases where there have been changes to the rules, the new rules have a stricter voting requirement--such as increasing the voting requirement from a simple majority or two-thirds to three-quarters, or even to requiring a consensus. Thus, the fears that the U.S. will be ``out-voted'' are even less under the new rules than under the existing system.\n\tIn addition, the WTO, like the GATT, provides a mechanism for leaving the Agreement. This is the ultimate safeguard of U.S. interests--one that I hope this Administration and future Administrations will use wisely.\n\tThere is one change in the rules that has caused legitimate concern. Under the existing system, any finding by a dispute settlement panel can be blocked by either party. In other words, if we challenge another country's trade laws as unfair in the GATT, that country can block a GATT finding that their law or practice is an unfair trade restriction. Likewise, we can block any finding against us.\n\tSome have claimed that this means that all U.S. laws are at the mercy of foreign governments. This is not the case. First of all, the finding of a dispute settlement panel is only that--a finding. Such findings do not overturn U.S. laws or regulations. Only Congress can change U.S. law.\n\tIf another nation does win a dispute settlement finding against us, there are only four things that could happen. First, the U.S. could change its law or regulation. Second, the U.S. could give the other nation a trade compensation--such as lowering existing tariffs on some good exported by that nation to us. Such a compensation must be in the same amount as the economic harm to that nation's trade caused by the U.S. law. Third, the other nation could retaliate against some U.S. export by, for example, raising their tariffs in the same amount as the economic harm.\n\tFinally, nothing might happen. The U.S. might decide not to change its law or regulation and not to grant a trade compensation. And the other nation might decide not to retaliate, even under WTO sanction, for fear of starting a trade war.\n\tWhile I reject the claims that the Agreement violates U.S. sovereignty, I share the concern that adverse rulings by the dispute settlement panel will be used as political pressure to force a change in U.S. law. We must keep up our vigilance to ensure that U.S. laws, especially those concerning worker rights and health and safety issues, are not changed merely to suit the convenience of other nations. I commended those who have raised this concern and hope that they will continue as strong watchdogs of this Agreement.\n\n\n                            future of trade\n\n\tMr. President, as all my colleagues know, I share the concern of many that for too many years, America has been the patsy of the world when it comes to trade. We have opened up our markets while others have kept them closed--a situation I hope this Agreement will finally reverse.\n\tLabor Secretary Robert Reich has coined the term ``the anxious class'' to describe the feeling that has afflicted the middle class in this country. Wages, incomes and standards of living for working Americans stagnated over 20 years ago. Two incomes are now needed to maintain middle-class status. At the same time, job security has declined as too many companies continue to look upon workers as a cost rather than as an asset.\n\tRecessions have made matters worse; but recoveries have not helped. Even now, the benefits of the most recent economic recovery have been too few for too many Americans.\n\tMany are opposed to this Agreement--based on these all to real fears. However, rejecting this Agreement will do nothing to advance our agenda to create an effective trade strategy. It will only slow us down as it forces us to re-open all of the old trade arguments of the past decade.\n\tRather than turn inward, we need to continue to insist on a trade strategy that opens foreign markets to U.S. goods and services. We need a trade strategy that targets our export promotion activities toward those markets and those products were we excel. And we need a trade strategy that aggressively uses all the tools at our disposal to counteract unfair and predatory practices by our trading partners.\n\tWe have the elements of the strategy today. For example, the work of the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee (TPCC) within the Administration has strengthened our export promotion activities. The TPCC has produced and is implementing a strategy to target the so-called Big Emerging Market and Big Emerging Sectors.\n\tThese efforts need to be backed up with strong efforts to counter closed markets and unfair trading practices. We have begun to make progress in some cases, such as in telecommunications and government procurement in Japan. But much more is needed, especially in the area of autos and auto parts.\n\tFinally, we need to proceed carefully with the next steps of trade talks. We should not let the heady rhetoric of global free trade obscure the harsh reality of the strategic nature of the global economy. We should proceed slowly with grand plans for free trade areas in the Asian-Pacific region and Latin American--carefully weighing the costs and benefits of such plans. Opening of foreign markets and the reduction of trade barriers should be our goal--not the headlong rush toward economic integration regardless of the costs.\n\tI am convinced that we can craft a strategic trade policy for America--one that opens markets to U.S. goods and services abroad and raises workers' standard of living at home. The first step is to move forward, not backward. Adoption of this legislation to implement the Uruguay Round Agreement is that step forward. We need to pass this Agreement and move on.\n\tMr. PRYOR. Mr. President, today we face one of the most important votes in the economic history of this Nation. The job growth and expansion opportunities for our country hang in the balance of this vote and it is up to us to make the right decision. As the world becomes smaller because of the explosion in communications and information technologies, we must make the transition to this global economy in a way that provides the maximum benefit for these United States of America. Will this task be easy--No. Is it possible--Yes. Well, how can we get there--By passing the Uruguay Round GATT Agreement, the United States can take advantage of our inherent competitive advantages in these new global markets.\n\tMr. President, our historic debate on GATT, which culminates in a final vote today, should answer a number of important questions for the American people. In the next few minutes, I would like to pose some of those questions and provide some answers.\n\tWhat is GATT? Simply put, this agreement sets up a system to help govern how the various member countries will trade. With varying cultures, customs, and laws, this type of agreement is necessary to facilitate open and fair trade among nations. GATT reduces tariffs around the world by roughly one-third. Since a tariff is nothing more than a tax on exports, this translates into the largest worldwide tax cut in history of some $744 billion. Just as the NAFTA agreement has helped open markets with our trading partners to the north and south and set up a better defined system to facilitate trade, the GATT will accrue these same benefits with over 120 countries.\n\tIs the GATT agreement perfect?--No, few things are. Will every sector of our economy win under this GATT?--No, but rejecting this agreement on behalf of a handful of industries is hardly equitable for the overwhelming majority of our economic sectors that stand to benefit greatly by expanded opportunities around the world.\n\tWhat does GATT mean for my home State of Arkansas?--It means new markets, new jobs and economic growth. Just look at what Arkansas has experienced the last few years in terms of exports. In 1987, Arkansas exported merchandise worth around $408 million. By 1993, Arkansas exports had grown to over $1.1 billion--an increase of 172 percent, giving it the eighth largest percentage increase among all the States. We have clearly demonstrated our ability to compete in the world and this agreement only facilitates more opportunities with new markets.\n\tWhere are Arkansas exports going?--All over the world. In the Pacific rim alone, exports from Arkansas totaled some $269 million. In addition, we enjoyed approximately $174 million in exports to the European union and had sales to Latin America and the Caribbean region totaling $107 million.\n\tWhat kind of exports does Arkansas make?--Some 95 percent of Arkansas' export sales in 1993 consisted of manufactured goods which translate into jobs and opportunities for Arkansans. Specifically, $305 million of these from the food products industry, $185 million from the chemical products industry and nearly $122 million from the industrial machinery and computers industries, not to mention electric and electronic equipment, transportation equipment, and fabricated metal products representing over $250 million cumulatively.\n\n\tMr. President, I am confident that America will benefit from GATT. But it is also my responsibility to look after the effect GATT or any other measure before Congress will have on the State of Arkansas. Mr. President, the facts I have just mentioned make if abundantly clear that Arkansas will be a major winner under this trade agreement by increasing the trade exports that have benefited our State tremendously during the last several years. I for one, will not sit back and take a pass on an opportunity to increase Arkansas' prosperity.\n\tIf it is true that 95 percent of the world's population is outside the United States, then why shouldn't Arkansas and the rest of the nation be the ones to sell food, goods and products to these consumers. If we don't, someone else will. We cannot afford to allow some other country to surpass our position as the world's largest exporter.\n\tRoughly, 60 years ago, this country turned away from foreign markets and sought to build a wall around our country. This legislation was known as the Smoot-Hawley Act and helped lead us to our worst economic depression. Today, the Congress is again faced with the choice between free markets or isolationism. -I believe we should learn from our mistakes and not let history repeat itself. We should take advantage of the enormous benefits this agreement will bring to Arkansas and the rest of the country.\n\tThere have been red herring arguments galore in this debate predicting gloom and doom should we pass this legislation implementing the agreement. For example, some have argued the very sovereignty of our country may be jeopardized. Mr. President, as much or more than any member of the Senate, I am concerned anytime our sovereignty may be threatened, but this agreement does not. Even the conservative jurist Robert Bork has studied this agreement and in his legal opinion GATT does not pose a threat to the sovereignty of the United States. The Congress of the United States and only the Congress can change any law of the United States.\n\tMr. President, let us not fall into the easy traps of being against change especially when the benefits can be so great. The United States needs this GATT agreement and it is up to us to deliver. Let's pass the GATT and any procedural votes necessary to do so.\n\tMs. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I support the GATT implementing legislation. I believe that the GATT Agreement is good for the American people, good for our international competitiveness, and good for our collective future as a nation and a people.\n\tThe history of expanding trade opportunities has been a history of increasing economic growth, both here in the United States and overseas. Lowering trade barriers has consistently produced new jobs--good jobs--here at home.\n\tOver the last 50 years, the United States has provided an enormous market to the countries of the world. At the same time, we have worked to gain market access for American products. Both Americans and the rest of the world have benefitted. Eliminating trade barriers and increasing trade has therefore been a win-win proposition for the United States.\n\tThe Uruguay round agreements of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is designed to continue that ``win-win'' tradition. It opens markets and reduces tariff and nontariff barriers, in order to expand trade, economic growth and job opportunities.\n\tThe evidence is convincing that this agreement will be good for the American people. Over the next 10 years, United States GDP will expand by $100 to $200 billion as a result of GATT. It will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs. It will increase U.S. productivity, real wages, and living standards. In 1992, 10\\1/2\\ million U.S. workers owed their jobs to exports of goods and services. And jobs related to exports pay an average of 13 percent more than the national average wage.\n\tUnder the new GATT Agreement, the United States achieved a 40 percent average reduction of tariffs that our major trading partners impose on U.S. products. In the area of industrial goods, worldwide tariffs on construction equipment, farm equipment, medical devices, pharmaceuticals, steel mill products, and beer and distilled spirits will be eliminated. Tariffs on electronic equipment and scientific instruments will be halved.\n\tThese are all areas where U.S. products are of the highest quality in the world. What is more, workers who make medical devices and construction equipment are well paid. When we sell more of these products to the rest of the world, we create high skilled, high paying jobs.\n\tIn agriculture, the Uruguay round has been very successful in reducing trade-distorting subsidies. The United States Department of Agriculture expects U.S. agricultural exports to nearly double from $4.7 billion to $8.7 billion in the next 10 years as a result of the Uruguay round agreements. Increased exports will raise U.S. farm prices, increase farm income, and lower U.S. Government outlays on price and income support programs. Agricultural export-related employment is expected to increase by as much as 190,000 jobs in the next 10 years.\n\tFor the first time ever, the GATT Agreements establish multilateral, legally enforceable rules for trade in services. Areas such as accounting, advertising, architecture, and engineering services, as well as financial services, will come under the General Agreement on Trade in Services. Foreign governments' will no longer be able to discriminate against U.S. banking and insurance companies. Service providers from other countries will receive no less favorable treatment than that accorded to local service suppliers. U.S. firms will also have the right of repatriate profits.\n\tSeventy percent of U.S. jobs are in the service sector. The General Agreement on Trade in Services provides new international rules that will greatly benefit this largest sector of the American economy in its effort to compete overseas, and that will mean additional new jobs here in the United States.\n\tIn the area of intellectual property, the trade-related intellectual property rights agreement establishes enforceable multilateral obligations to protect copyrights, patents, and trade secrets. Computer software and databases will finally have the same protection as a literary work.\n\tThese agreements will have a very positive effect on Illinois, because Illinois is a major exporting State. In 1993, Illinois exported just over $20 billion of merchandise and services. From 1987 to 1993, Illinois exports doubled, and the GATT Agreement will lead to further major increases in Illinois exports.\n\tMore importantly, the GATT reduces tariffs imposed by our largest trading partners. Illinois exports $4.7 billion of goods and services to the European Union. Those tariffs will be reduced an average of 54 percent. Illinois exports almost $2 billion of goods and services to Japan. Those tariffs will be reduced an average of 39 percent.\n\tThis agreement eliminates and reduces tariffs in areas where Illinois products are strongest. Illinois exported $5.5 billion in industrial machinery. We exported $3 billion in agricultural products. With the reduction of tariffs and trade distorting agricultural subsides, these numbers will only increase. And that means more Illinois jobs for urban, suburban, and rural communities.\n\tI would like to address some of the concerns I have heard from people in Illinois regarding the World Trade Organization, and the new rules regarding dispute resolution. Under the WTO, the procedures of investigating a trade dispute will be much the same as the current process. The difference is that decisions, which are the outcomes of these investigations, will be enforceable.\n\tThe United States will continue to be able to reject a decision of the WTO. If a decision is made against the United States, and subsequent negotiations cannot resolve the issue, the plaintiff can retaliate by lifting tariffs back to where they are today. Further, the President will support legislation to establish a WTO dispute settlement review commission to ensure that the WTO acted fairly.\n\tI do not believe that the United States will be losing its sovereignty by joining the WTO. Quite the opposite, the WTO will ensure that the rest of the world practices the kind of fair and open trade that the United States has always practiced.\n\tI would like to take a moment to address the anxiety of labor unions, environmental groups, and consumer groups, who have expressed their deep concerns bout the GATT agreements. To my friends in the environmental movement, I would like to say that I would not support the GATT if I thought it would lower American environmental standards. I do not believe that laws that protect food safety and air quality will be found GATT illegal. As we saw in the recent ruling on cafe standards, our environmental laws are legal as long as they do not favor domestic producers over foreign ones.\n\tWith regard to labor, I understand the concerns of Americans who worry about losing jobs to low-wage workers overseas. I think it is worth keeping in mind, however, that fully 40 percent of our overall trade deficit is with Japan, a country that pays its workers even more, in dollar terms, than American workers earn. Yet Japan not only runs an enormous trade surplus with the United States, but with the entire world.\n\tIt is also worth keeping in mind that defeating the GATT will not protect Americans from low-wage workers abroad. U.S. tariffs are already far lower than tariffs in most other nations, and defeating GATT would not increase them. Our future depends not on high tariffs, but on continuing to do what we are already doing, working much smarter, working much more productively, than our international competition.\n\tTo take just one example of what I mean, it wasn't very long ago that many people were writing off the U.S. automobile industry. U.S. manufacturers were steadily losing market share to foreign competitors. Now, the U.S. is the place to manufacture. Foreign car companies eagerly build plants in the United States because of the advantages of manufacturing here, and one of the most important of those advantages is the American work force. In one industry after another, Americans are demonstrating that we are the most productive workers in the world. We can compete--and win--internationally, and that is what we must continue to do.\n\tMr. President, the Uruguay round builds upon the long U.S. tradition of open markets. It increases the volume of trade and investment worldwide, which will create jobs at home and abroad. It anchors the United States in the family of trading nations, and it sets fair and universal standards for us to compete in the global marketplace.\n\tThe GATT agreements are, in essence, about confidence, confidence in our future and confidence in our children. I am voting for GATT because I am confident that Americans will prosper under the new trading regime. Americans are ready to compete and succeed, and GATT will help them to be more successful.\n\tMr. KERREY. Mr. President, after a careful listening to those on both sides of the issue, I have decided to support the implementing legislation for the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT], as well as the motion to waive the budget point of order against the bill. I have concluded that the Uruguay Round Agreement, on balance, offers a promising opportunity for the United States--already the largest and most open market the world--to secure its fair share of a growing world marketplace, and more importantly, to generate here at home the kind of good-paying, skilled jobs that, in my view, give purpose to our efforts to pursue trade reform.\n\tThis agreement, as some of its detractors unfortunately fail to mention, is actually the product of nearly 8 years of negotiations involving over 120 countries. It is a work that has been many, many months in progress, and the subject of numerous hearings and debates in Congress ever since this trade round was inaugurated in September, 1986. This implementing measure would have been voted on months ago, except for the procedures governing consideration of the bill which specifically provided various committees of the Congress an established timetable to examine the bill's provisions and weight its impact. But for the fact that a single committee exercised its full rights under these procedural timetables, we would have voted on this agreement well in advance of this fall's election. Although this bill is indeed a very complex piece of legislation, this is not, in other words, a document that has been sprung on Congress and the American people without notice, without debate, and without the opportunity for challenge. It's a sad commentary on the state of civic debate in this country that the agreement's opponents have resorted to describing the current situation in a manner deliberately intended to fuel public suspicion that this is a back-room deal, written in secrecy under the direction of multinational corporations at the expense of U.S. workers and consumers, presented for rushed, last-minute approval by defeated Members of Congress.\n\tAs the largest but already the most open economy in the world, the United States has something to lose but certainly much to gain as we reduce our trade barriers still further but in turn secure from our GATT trading partners, as this agreement does, the obligation to provide even greater access to their markets. The vast majority of the economic assessments that I have seen point to the agreement's likely result in creating more American jobs, boosting national income and returning more, not less, to the U.S. Treasury, despite the known revenue loss associated with the tariff reductions included in the implementing bill.\n\n\tThe likelihood that this agreement will increase Treasury receipts rather than decrease them is the reason why I will support the motion to waive the budget point of order against the agreement. This bill, I believe, is as clear an example as any why our budget procedures rightly provide a limited opportunity for a waiver. Under our current budget rules, we are required to acknowledge the known costs of a bill--in this case, the revenue losses resulting from the tariff cuts. However, those same rules prevent us from assuming--on the ground that they are too speculative--the likely gains to the Treasury that most studies conclude should result from the increased U.S. employment, income, and tax revenue expected to be generated by the pact. I support the waiver, in short, because I agree that the Uruguay round is likely to lead to increased trade and increased economic activity that will offset expected tariff revenue losses, leaving our annual budget deficits no worse than currently projected. I believe strongly that free trade, fairly conducted, is good for the world economy and particularly good for the United States and its workers. From agriculture, to services, to technology, to basic manufacturing, the U.S. ranks among the world leaders and has the potential, under this agreement, to strengthen its position still more.\n\tA central source of controversy surrounding this agreement involves, of course, the proposed new World Trade Organization [WTO] that will be established to replace the current GATT body as the forum for considering and resolving trade disputes. In my view, this issue essentially boils down to one question: Do we favor finally putting some teeth into the enforcement of decisions that arise from international trade disputes? Or do we prefer to continue the current system under which the United States has, on several occasions, brought unfair trade complaints against other countries, and prevailed under a subsequent GATT review, only to have the offending country ignore the GATT decision and snub the United States? I believe the United States has much more to gain than to lose by giving meaning to the resolution process governing international trade.\n\tI understand that there is strong concern, quite legitimate, about the impact of a WTO finding that may go against the United States. Despite considerable misinformation to the contrary, an adverse WTO decision could not force the United States to change a Federal, State, or local law or regulation. What it would require the United States to do, however, is to decide whether to comply with the WTO decision by enacting changes in our laws or regulations, or to ignore the decision, thus providing the opportunity for the country that prevailed in the dispute to impose compensatory tariffs on U.S. exports to that country. But it's up to the United States to decide how to comply or whether to comply, and possibly face sanctions. In any event, only the United States may change its own laws, if that's what we decide to do.\n\n\tOn the other hand, it must be pointed out, and I believe this is vital, that the same risks the United States accepts by becoming a member of the new WTO affords the United States, for the first time, the assurance that we can obtain redress and compensation if we win a fair trade case brought before the WTO. As the largest and most open economy already in the world today, it only stands to reason that we have considerably more to gain than to lose by agreeing to participate in a world market suddenly obliged to adhere to enforceable standards of fair trade.\n\tAlthough I have reached the conclusion, Mr. Prsident, that this legislation, on balance, is good for the United States and deserving of strong support, I believe the agreement itself is deficient in some key respects.\n\tFor example, nothing in the agreement prompts the United States and its trading partners to cooperate in a deliberate way to develop the type of environmental and labor standards that we have adopted in this country to help ensure that our economic gains do not come at the cost of environmental degradation and worker exploitation. Yet, I agree with those who espouse the belief that increased trade, and the economic activity and jobs it generates, tends to list the living standards of those individuals it touches, but I think that as civilized nations, we can and should do more. Those who bring fervor and ideological force to the argument for breaking down trade barriers should be called upon to bring a concurrent commitment to elevating the living and working standards of all those who paritcipate, in whatever small part, in the world economy. We in the United States should cede no economic or trade advantage to another country simply because that country has, for example, no Clean Air Act, no Clean Water Act, no child labor safeguards, or no wage and hour standards. Such countries enjoy no real advantage because they lack such measures, and the United States bears no unacceptable burden because it has them. But we should, as a member of the WTO, do much more to ensure that all nations engaged in international commerce adhere to similar standards. This must be a central objective of the trade agreements of the future.\n\tFinally, Mr. President, I must note that many of those who have expressed to me their opposition to this agreement have cited their deep-seated concerns about economic concentration in this country; the stressful impact of today's changing and uncertain economy on struggling workers--especially those families with children; the eroding sense of community and company loyalty; and evidence of failed domestic policies in such areas as agriculture. In short, they have expressed to me their personal anxiety about a rapidly evolving economy that they fear--and the operative word is indeed fear--is producing more losers than winners.\n\n\tI say to these opponents that I understand and agree with these sentiments. But an international trade agreement alone will not and cannot be expected to overcome the effects of failed domestic policies. Those policies deserve our separate but equally focused attention. And no new trade agreement will halt the fundamental changes that are rocking our economy and are likely to continue apace with or without this agreement. But I am confident, and I urge them to consider, that one of our best opportunities, as a country, to overcome these dislocations in our economy and relieve the anxiety felt by families is to build on the strengths of the many U.S. industries that currently make up our competitive export sector and employ millions of Americans.\n\tFor all of these reasons, Mr. President, I intend to support the GATT implementing bill and urge its adoption.\n\tMr. DURENBERGER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the legislation to implement the GATT Agreement. The agreement represent 7 years of hard work by over 100 countries to overhaul a GATT system that was not working--that was not imposing the needed disciplines which enable countries to work together and prosper in a global economy.\n\tThe new World Trade Organization will enable our country, for the first time, to effectively address unfair trade practices by other countries. We will no longer have our complaints blocked by an offending country. This is major progress. A more effective dispute settlement mechanism is something we fought for during the entire negotiation process--and we got it. It will not affect our sovereignty. It will not force us to weaken our environmental protection laws. It will not impose world government. It will help Americans sell their goods and services abroad under a level playing field. It will impose a discipline which I believe will avoid the pursuit of protectionist efforts by other countries as well as to remind our own leaders how counterproductive these efforts can be in our own country.\n\tThe Uruguay round agreement achieved significant progress in many areas. Agriculture, services, investment and intellectual property rights will now be covered under GATT disciplines. Tariffs have been cut significantly and important market access goals have been met. Improvements were made in the subsidies and antidumping codes. There will be fewer standards barriers. There was an explicit recognition of the right of all nations to retain their tough health and environment standards--unless those standards are imposed solely for the purpose of restricting imports. This is important progress for Minnesota as well as the whole country.\n\tThe progress we made on tariff cuts alone--a global tax cut of $744 billion over next 10 years--and on expanded market access to help us export more of our Minnesota products and services, is worth a vote for the agreement through its implementing legislation. That is progress we can all understand.\n\tWe have also achieved major progress on more esoteric areas such as subsidies and antidumping. We now have a better system to identify and control the use of government subsidies abroad as well as to maintain and improve our own tough antidumping laws which have benefited industries such as steel. Yet we have attempted to control the kinds of changes in our antidumping laws which could result in more dumping cases against U.S. companies operating in other countries. I have worked with the steel industry in Minnesota throughout my entire career in the Senate to help them combat unfair trade practices and to improve their own competitiveness. That industry has gone through a very painful, but necessary, modernization and restructuring process and appears to be well on its way to regaining its competitiveness globally. But, it, and all of our other industries, need the level playing field of this Agreement to continue to compete.\n\n\tThe agreement is a definite plus for Minnesota, as an export economy which will significantly benefit from lower tariffs abroad as well as fewer barriers and further access for Minnesota products. Minnesota exported $10 billion in 1993--the 13th largest State exporter. Minnesota's exports grew by 80 percent over 1987-93 and will only increase under this agreement. Minnesota service companies and agricultural producers will now be able to use the disciplines of the GATT to ensure that they can trade fairly. Tariff cuts will help many of our Minnesota companies cut their costs in order to increase competitive opportunities abroad. Intellectual property protection abroad is instrumental to Minnesota's huge high tech community.\n\tIn my judgement, agriculture fared very well in the agreement. Minnesota's agricultural exports are vital to its economy. Agricultural exports in Minnesota increased 25 percent from 1987-93 and totaled $2.8 billion in 1993.\n\tThe USDA has estimated that the GATT Agreement will boost agricultural exports by $5 to $14 billion over the next 5 years. Ag subsidies abroad, particularly in the European Union, have been slashed significantly, albeit not to the extent we desired. I am pleased that so many agriculture interests strongly support this agreement--the Corn Growers, Barley Growers, Pork Producers, Cattlemen's Association, the Farm Bureau, Poultry and Egg Council, Sugar Industry and many others.\n\tThe dairy industry has protested the market opening which will bring dairy imports up to about 1 percent of consumption--but dairy now has more access for its exports abroad. The soybean growers wanted lower tariffs. The administration is committed to continuing efforts to lower tariffs worldwide. The GATT Agreement does not halt that progress.\n\tTo recognize further efforts to help our important agricultural in Minnesota, I was pleased to hear that Bob Dole has secured a commitment by the administration to propose $600 million in additional greenbox programs which will help us export even more agricultural commodities, including dairy and soybeans. Further, the administration indicates it will not propose ag program cuts in the fiscal year 1996 and 1997 budgets.\n\tMinnesota has a long history of support for trade agreements and legislation which expands trade opportunities, My record, from my support of the Tokyo round implementing legislation in 1979, for the two major trade bills we have passed since then, and for the NAFTA has been consistent with the interests of my State. I am proud to have played a role in each one of these efforts, just as I am proud to have been an active promoter of the GATT Agreement.\n\tDespite opposition from labor, I have been encouraged by estimates of job creation due to the GATT Agreement. The DRI-McGraw-Hill study estimates an employment gain, over that of normal economic expansion, of 1.4 million jobs by the 10th year.\n\n\tI was also pleased that soon-to-be majority leader Dole was able to work out an agreement with the administration to satisfy some of the concerns about the agreement itself, as well as its funding mechanism. While I had thought the 6-month notification period in the agreement that would enable us to withdraw from the WTO was adequate, the Dole-U.S. review panel was a positive improvement and should satisfy some of the concerns that the WTO panel process could be used unfairly against us.\n\tMr. President, I am well aware that this agreement is controversial, largely because it is not easily understandable by many people. It has not received much attention by the press, partly because much of it is so technical in nature. I regret the opposition by many of my friends from labor unions, from environment groups, from the dairy industry.\n\tParticularly I regret what has been an unfair characterization of the agreement by Ralph Nader and others who have tacked many of the world's evils onto this agreement. They are the ones who do not understand the agreement--who have not read the agreement.\n\tI admit that the agreement fell short in some areas. We did not, and could never, achieve 100 percent of our negotiating objectives. In my judgement, we reached far more of our objectives than other nations. We should not delay the agreement. It cannot be reopened next year to achieve further progress. That just will not happen--no other country would agree to that. So the significant progress we made over 7 years will be lost if that happens.\n\tIn addition, the administration communicates that even a 6-month delay would cost the united States $70 billion in lost production and reduce employment in the United States by 25,000 jobs a year for 10 years. There is no need to delay. The final agreement has been before us for well over a year. We have known our negotiating objectives and have had briefings over the last 7 years from our negotiators.\n\tThe budget waiver vote before us is the only real vote on the implementing legislation. If we do not waive the Budget Act, the GATT Agreement will die.\n\tEarlier in the year, I joined many of my colleagues to protest what I had heard was an intention on the part of the administration to waive the full 10 years of the agreement. This was not acceptable, and I strongly communicated that to the administration. However, the administration was able to waive the first 5 years, and I believe that the economic growth this agreement will bring to us will definitely pay for the second 5 years. In fact, the Treasury Department reports $100 to $200 billion in added income per year as a result of the Uruguay round agreement progress. As a result, I will vote to waive the budget rules, although I am generally loathe to do so.\n\tMr. President, we have far more work to do in the area of addressing unfair trade barriers and to expand export opportunities for American interests. I wish we could have solved all of the problems in the Uruguay round, but we didn't. But we cannot scrap 7 years of hard work that is significant progress. There will be future trade negotiations. There will be efforts to improve the WTO as we gain experience with it. There will be discussions in many international fora to focus on the unfair labor practices and the need for more environmental protection efforts in other countries. We can pursue such issues as CBI parity, which is necessary to afford the same benefits to our CBI friends as that granted under the NAFTA, again next year.\n\tWe must adopt this progress and move on to develop and pursue future trade goals which will bring us even closer to where we should be. I believe that as we do move toward implementing the agreement, it will become evident to the public that this is a positive and fair agreement.\n\tI urge the support of my colleagues for the implementing legislation. I particularly urge support for the waiver of the Budget Act and to oppose any constitutional point of order that the agreement should be considered a treaty. Trade agreements have never been negotiated as treaties, and this one was no exception.\n\tMr. DANFORTH. Mr. President, there has been some controversy about section 801 of the GATT implementing legislation, which requires PCS pioneers to pay at least half a billion dollars for their FCC licenses. Some have questioned whether this provision is the product of some unfair sweetheart deal for the pioneers.\n\tI am intimately familiar with this provision, which was crafted over the course of several months in an open fashion. I am also familiar with the history of the proceedings at the FCC by which the pioneers obtained their preferences. I believe that section 801 guarantees a more than fair return for the government. That is why I supported section 801 in the first place. As far as I am concerned, the matter of the PCS pioneers should now be considered closed.\n\tThe FCC promised for four years to guarantee the pioneers a license as a reward for their innovative efforts--not just an option to purchase a license, but a guaranteed license. In January of this year, the FCC clarified that it would give pioneers free licenses, even though it now can auction licenses. Only in August of this year did the FCC change its mind. The pioneers have taken the FCC to court, and all informed observers believe the pioneers will win. They will receive licenses for free--the taxpayers will get nothing.\n\tThe GATT bill guarantees the taxpayers will get payments of 85 percent of an average auction price from the pioneers. The pioneers will make a minimum payment of some $530 million even if bid prices are lower than expected. No other company has committed to minimum price. And the pioneers have not been granted a ceiling--if the auction yields billions, they will pay according to the GATT legislation's formula.\n\tThe GATT implementing legislation's formulation of 85 percent of the auction price for the top 20 non-pioneer markets will produce a fair return for the American taxpayer. The Office of Management and Budget estimates that the GATT bill's formula will bring in $1.5 billion--more than the FCC formula, which used a figure of 90 percent of the top 10 markets.\n\tWhatever the projection, it is important to remember that the goal of the FCC's pioneer preference policy, which we permitted the FCC to continue in the 1993 auction legislation, was to provide incentives for innovators. Raising revenue was not a consideration. The three companies that received preferences created the new PCS technologies, and their efforts will benefit the public as a whole. Jobs will be created. Tax revenue will be produced. Competition to cellular duopolies and telephone monopolies will be created. And consumers will pay lower prices.\n\tIt would have been fair for the pioneers to have received their licenses without charge. Requiring pioneers to pay an 85 percent average auction price is more than fair. The pioneers worked for five years to develop PCS and made their research and development available to the public so that all could learn and benefit from it. The pioneers relied on a ten-times-reaffirmed promise of a free license--a promise the FCC broke only after the pioneers had performed their side of the bargain. They put millions of dollars at stake at a time when PCS was a glimmer in an entrepreneur's eye.\n\n\tSome have called for an assessment after the auctions of whether the payments from the pioneers made a fair return to the taxpayers. I would like to make a few points with regard to this proposal:\n\tFirst, everyone agrees that the pioneers should be immediately granted their licenses. Section 801 specifies that the FCC cannot delay issuing licenses to the pioneers more than 15 days after the legislation's enactment. I do not expect the FCC to have any difficulty complying with that mandate. The license applications have been pending most of this year, and the pleading cycle has been completed for months. The Administration's letters to Senator Dole on November 23, 1994, recognized that the pioneers would be issued their licenses now.\n\tSecond, all of us who are involved in this issue understand that all relevant factors must be taken into consideration. These factors, as I mentioned before, include the hard work of the pioneers, their commitment of high-risk capital, their public sharing of research results, their longstanding reliance on the FCC's promises, and the extent to which the work of the pioneers created all the auction revenues that the Treasury will receive.\n\tThird, no one involved intends the potential for some future review to have a chilling effect on the commercial plans of the pioneers. We assume that the pioneers will be turning to investors to fund the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to pay the Government for their licenses and build out their systems. These investors should not be concerned that Congress will ignore the contributions of the pioneers and force them into an unfair and retroactive payment scheme. I believe that there will be no further legislation. It is my view, and, I believe, the view of my colleagues on the Commerce Committee, that Section 801 already provides a fair return to the public. This matter should be considered closed.\n\tFinally and most importantly, retroactive legislation to increase the price of the pioneers' licenses would be grossly unfair. For years, the pioneers were led to believe their licenses would be issued early in 1994 and would be free. Then the legislative process delayed insurance of the licenses and we required the pioneers to pay 85 percent of the average auction price for those licenses. Now that the pioneers have some finality, we cannot in good conscience enact legislation to increase the price again. We should let the pioneers get on with the business of PCS. Further retroactive legislation would just be plain wrong.\n\tMr. SMITH. Mr. President, I believe in free trade. I think that lowering tariffs, eliminating quotas, and reducing other trade barriers is clearly in the best economic interest of the United States. I disagree with those who have taken the floor in opposition not just to the GATT agreement before us, but to the very principles of free trade. In my opinion, the principles of free trade are clear and unwavering.\n\tFor far too long, U.S. exports have not had a real chance to compete in many foreign markets. American producers of goods and services are not looking for a handout in the international marketplace. They are looking for a level playing field. They know that they can compete in world markets if they are given adequate access to those markets.\n\tFree trade is not a complicated proposition. If we lower tariffs abroad, American products are less expensive to the foreign consumer. It's like a permanent ``sale'' on American products. It is the holiday season in America, and any shopper at any store will tell you that they're more likely to buy an item on sale. After all, why pay more when you don't have to?\n\tSo free trade means more foreign consumers buying more American goods and services for less money. Foreign sales means American jobs. That is called a win-win agreement. Who could find fault with that?\n\tMr. President, if the GATT agreement stopped right there, this Senator would be its strongest supporter. I have no qualms with the tariff reduction schedules included in the agreement. I have no problem with the elimination of non-tariff barriers. But the GATT that we are required to vote on today does not stop at that point. It goes much, much further.\n\tThe agreement jumps off the free-trade track with the creation of the World Trade Organization (WTO). This Senator doesn't believe we need another international bureaucracy of any kind. But the WTO is particularly offensive, and it should be of grave concern to every American.\n\tThe WTO is given substantial legislative, executive and judicial authority. Under the WTO, any member nation--and there are 117 of them--can challenge another nation's law if they believe that the law is ``WTO-illegal.'' ``WTO-illegal'' is a vague term that has far-reaching implications. Any domestic law that restricts free trade could be subject to challenge.\n\tChallenges would then be investigated by a three member panel. The dispute panel--or tribunal--would be staffed by trade experts who would not have to adhere to any conflict-of-interest rules. Nor would the panels be required to adhere to previous precedents--the cornerstone of the judicial system in the United States.\n\n\tThe tribunal would meet in secret: no press, no citizen groups, no industry groups. Only national governments would have standing to address the tribunal. Even worse, the final decisions of the panel would be binding unless there is unanimous agreement among all WTO participants to set aside the findings--a highly unlikely scenario at best.\n\tIf a country appeals the decision of the tribunal, the resolution process is no better. Instead of an ad-hoc tribunal, the challenge would be considered by three people from the seven member WTO appellate body. The appellate panel again issues recommendations or findings that cannot be reversed except by unanimous consent of the members.\n\tSo let us assume for a moment that among the thousands of state and federal laws on the books, one is challenged as a barrier to free trade. The initial tribunal is formed and rules that the law is ``WTO-illegal.'' The United States appeals the decision, and the appellate tribunal also rules that the law is ``WTO-illegal.'' What is our nation to do?\n\tUnder such circumstances, the United States can: (a) negotiate a settlement, or (b) change the offending law, or (c) face fines and/or sanctions from the WTO.\n  ``None of the above'' is not a choice under the stringent rules of the WTO.\n\tWhat leverage would be United States have under such a scenario? The answer is: none. The dispute settlement procedures under the World Trade Organization are clearly and unequivocally flawed.\n\tOther procedures governing the World Trade Organization are similarly defective. Changes to the WTO rules or interpretations will be put to a vote unless--again--there is unanimous consensus among all 117 participating nations. According to article IX of the agreement, ``each member of the WTO shall have one vote.'' The United States is not given a veto, as it is under the United Nations security council. The United States is not given weighted votes, as it is in the World Bank. Instead, the United States is given one vote--the same as Cuba, and Chad, and Haiti, and Mexico, and on and on and on.\n\tMr. President, not all nations of the world are equal trading partners, and creating an international bureaucracy to make them equal just doesn't make it so.\n\tThere is no reason to believe that--when the votes are cast in the World Trade Organization--the outcome will be favorable to the United States. Let me give a few examples from the voting record of the United Nations:\n\tNation and percentage of Votes Against U.S.: India--81.5; Cyprus--77.6; Morocco--78.1; Sri lanka--78.8.\n\tThe rest of the 117 nations are not much better. In fact, some have worse voting records. All told, developing nations will hold 83 percent of the votes in the World Trade Organization. When the results are consistently anti-American, no one should feign surprise.\n\tMr. President, we have a free trade agreement burdened with the ill-conceived World Trade Organization. But the problems do not stop there.\n\tIn August, 1994, OMB Director Alice Rivlin wrote that: ``We do not believe it is necessary to sacrifice budget discipline to pass GATT in the Congress.''\n\tYet the Clinton Administration is asking Senators to do just that. Implementing the GATT is projected to result in a budget shortfall of $26.7 billion over the next ten years. Congressional budget rules require that $26 billion of this shortfall be paid for by spending cuts and/or tax increases.\n\tThe Agreement before the Senate would finance the GATT with $4.7 billion in tax hikes and $3.1 billion in spending reductions. The implementing legislation makes changes in the U.S. Savings bond program, pension law, licensing fees and a host of other areas wholly unrelated to free trade. And still, the Clinton Administration failed to reach its goal. The remaining $18.9 billion will simply be added to the national debt.\n\tThat is unacceptable to this Senator. I had looked forward to supporting a clean GATT agreement that would move America forward. Instead, I will vote against an agreement that takes us two steps back.\n\tMr. President, the GATT legislation before the Senate should be about free trade, and only free trade. It should not be saddled with the weight of an uncontrollable international bureaucracy and unrelated domestic provisions.\n\tI urge my colleagues to oppose this agreement so we can support an improved GATT next year. That is the only way to achieve an unfettered, win-win free trade agreement.\n\tMr. HATFIELD. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a matter of great importance to the citizens of our United States: The Uruguay Round Free Trade Agreement, a bill that needs our immediate attention and support in this turbulent era of international trade. Free trade is truly the road to economic success, both foreign and domestic. By supporting open markets and ensuring our industries have the room they need to compete internationally, the United States will remain the world's trade leader.\n\tConceived under President Reagan, nurtured under President Bush and finalized by President Clinton, it is time for the Uruguay Round GATT to be implemented. In the United States, lower tariffs and trade restrictions mean increased productivity. As our firms are allowed to compete globally, our workers will maximize their skills and talents. As the demand for U.S. products rises, so too will our Gross Domestic Product. We can welcome a net gain in employment and a stronger economy due to this dramatic rise in exports. When this happens, we will experience the strongest international economy the world has ever seen.\n\tShielding and protecting domestic industries can lead to preposterous outcomes. The U.S. has come a long way since our protectionist trade policy was so strikingly and detrimentally enacted during the pain of the Great Depression. What happened, in response to these substantially higher tariffs, could be predicted by any first-semester, economics student--international trade came to a stand-still, reduced to twenty-five percent of its pre-tariff level. The Great Depression became even greater.\n\tA combination of the 1934 Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act, which lowered some tariffs, and World War II, which taught us the power of working with our partners and not against them, laid the groundwork for the first General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947. Anything less than multilateral negotiations for significantly reduced tariffs and the practical elimination of trade barriers, would drastically hamper the international economy. The original GATT called for this and international trade took a huge step towards increased efficiency and effectiveness through trading partner cooperation. The original GATT agreement and its successors have served us well by expanding world trade. However, the current GATT is not enough, we need the Uruguay Round Trade Agreement in order to keep pace with our rapidly changing global economy.\n\tBe it stopping tariff wars, clamping down on import quotas, or any number of other types of restrictions, international trade needs a boost. For example, the U.S. is constantly and unjustifiably accused, by other nations, of dumping its exports into their economies--consistent, specific antidumping laws simply do not exist outside of the United States. Secondly, unfair agricultural subsidies have been a thorn in the side of U.S. farmers for decades. Fearing U.S. competition, nations resort to protectionist economic policies which not only hurt their industries, but their citizens as well.\n\tWhen the U.S. brings these disputes to the current GATT Council in Geneva, years may go by before any settlements are suggested. Furthermore, members of the pre-Uruguay Round GATT have been known to completely ignore Agreement rules and dispute settlements. Uruguay Round GATT provisions and the World Trade Organization can bring order to the whirlwind of chaotic bilateral trade agreements and broken promises.\n\tThe current system's chaos and inefficiency represent more than mere inconvenience; it translates into lost U.S. efficiency, lost U.S. competitiveness and lost U.S. jobs. Furthermore, without a World Trade Organization, countries who are not members of GATT, who have not agreed to lower their trade restrictions, will continue to unfairly reap the benefits of trade with members who have lowered tariffs. The institution of an organization which efficiently and objectively reports on trade disputes and expedites the process through which a settlement is reached, will benefit current GATT members and give all world traders incentives to play by the rules.\n\tThe Uruguay Round includes, for the first time in history, the service sector in a world-wide economic agreement. Members of the new GATT, over 100 nations, are making commitments to open their economies to business, health, environmental, engineering and construction services, to name just a few. This is an incredible boost to the U.S. service sector.\n\tIn addition, the agreement strengthens international trade law with regard to intellectual property rights. America loses billions of dollars each year as everything from CDs to computer circuits are pirated in foreign countries. The Uruguay Round GATT would make copyrights, patents, trademarks and even trade secrets enforceable amongst all trading partners.\n\tAdvances in biotechnology would also be protected by the new patent rules. While I believe this is a positive step, I continue to express concern over the ethical and moral implications of patenting genes and animals, now magnified in the global sphere. My concern is compounded by the intrusion of ``use'' doctrines, currently regulated at the national or local level. Therefore, I strongly urge the establishment of a forum to discuss these issues surrounding the sanctity and essence of life, while preserving the beneficial advancement of biotechnology.\n\tAs crucial as this new GATT is to the nation's economy, it runs the risk of being lost if we do not pass the budget waiver. With one vote the Senate can approve using the PAYGO balance of $1.6 billion and waive the Senate's rule requiring the bill to be financed for ten years. I have not taken budget waivers lightly in the past, nor do I take this one lightly, but we must find the courage to pass this bill. The Budget Rule Enforcement Act was not meant to inhibit our legislative ability. Every so often, in the name of good legislation, an exception needs to be made--this is one of those times. Make no mistake, those who preach ``free trade'', but do not support the waiver are not friends of free trade--they are signing this agreement's death warrant.\n\tAny fair discussion of the Uruguay Round GATT must clarify the World Trade Organization's ``one member one vote'' policy. Some are worrying that less developed or communist countries will have as much voting power as the United States. It is important to keep this in perspective: The United States is the world's largest importer and this assures economic and political clout, giving a major player such as the U.S. a dominant role in the WTO system; we will take a backseat to no single nation or group of special interests.\n\tIt must be emphasized that the WTO cannot change U.S. law and U.S. sovereignty is not in jeopardy. Any vote to add an amendment which affects certain fundamental GATT obligations, such as Most Favored Nation status, the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights, requires a consensus by WTO members. Moreover, any amendments that change the rights or obligations of members, while requiring a two-thirds majority to go into affect, affect only those members who vote for the amendment.\n\tWhile I believe the Uruguay Round satisfies all sovereignty concerns, the Administration has assured Senator Dole that if the WTO Dispute Settlement Body rules adversely against the United States, even three times in a five year period, we will begin withdrawal from the WTO Agreement. This is only one part of Senator Dole's efforts to make the Uruguay Round GATT more palatable. I congratulate the Republican Leader for his courage and foresight in building these safeguards into the agreement.\n\tFinally Mr. President, I want to get specific and discuss how vitally important this legislation is to my state. The Uruguay Round GATT clears the road for statewide economic growth. Oregon has an export economy of over $6.2 billion, during its 1987 figure. While Oregon is ranked only 29th in population, it ranks 18th among all states for the number of business establishments that export. Oregon's whole economy is preparing to feel solid and significant.\n\tThe revised GATT actually provides overlapping benefits for some of Oregon's largest industries. For example, in 1993 Oregon exported one billion dollars worth of industrial machinery and computers. Under the Uruguay Round rules, the European Union, which imports more U.S. computers than any other member of GATT, will reduce its tariffs on U.S. computers by 80 percent. Not only will Oregon benefit from this reduction in trade restrictions, but strengthened intellectual property rights will aid the computer industry even more.\n\tThe hi-tech sector is not the only one which stands to gain. The paper industry, one of Oregon's largest exporters, would face tariff cuts of 100 percent. The U.S. Department of Commerce expects a $2 billion increase in U.S. paper and allied product exports--this means millions for Oregon. Electronic components, industrial and analytical instruments and semiconductor manufacturing equipment are other Oregon industries that will reap huge rewards if the Uruguay Round passes. Agriculture, one of Oregon's mainstays, generates over $1.4 billion in economic activity. Over five years, the Uruguay Round GATT would increase agriculture exports anywhere from $5-14 billion.\n\tThe Uruguay Round GATT will spur trade on with Oregon's leading trading partners. Looking towards the future, it has the potential of opening up whole new territories such as Russia, the Far East and the markets of developing economies. President Clinton, at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, laid the groundwork for economies to be opened and all trade restrictions of Pacific Basin countries to be removed by the year 2020. Let the Uruguay Round finish the job so that Americans can benefit from the buying power of the Asian nations, including Japan.\n\tThe United States Congress found the courage to vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Since then, we have seen our exports to Mexico increase by 20.5 percent and Canada by 11.4 percent. NAFTA is working, let GATT work too. This is the time for the United States and our trading partners to completely turn our backs on the destructive, isolationist and protectionist policies we have seen this century.\n\tOther countries are looking for us to take the lead--it is time we did. In the realm of international trade, the United States has no choice but to be the leader, but it requires our vote to be a member. The best way to be a champion of the U.S. economy is to support free trade. Let me have the foresight to pass the Uruguay Round Free Trade Agreement.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Daniel Patrick Moynihan", "Ernest F. Hollings", "Pete V.

Mr. President, for a variety of reasons, I have been \nvery torn about my vote on this implementing legislation for Uruguay \nround agreement of GATT.\n  I am in complete agreement, though, with the provision in this \nagreement that addresses pioneer preferences granted to innovators in \npersonal communications systems technology by the FCC. Administration \nofficials, FCC officials, and company officials came up with a deal \nthat is fair, and that deal should hold regardless of whether this \nlegislation passes. Those who decry this provision as ``elitist'' or \nworse simply do not understand the history and facts.\n  In 1992, the FCC awarded pioneer licenses to three PCS innovators. \nOne of the companies is Omnipoint Communications, Inc., a small \nentrepreneurial company based in Colorado Springs. At that time, the \nFCC did not charge anything for any spectrum license. In August 1993, \nCongress enacted budget legislation requiring the FCC to auction off \nspectrum licenses. Initially, the FCC excluded the PCS pioneers from \nthis requirement. But in August 1994, 2 years after naming the PCS \npioneers, the FCC ruled that the pioneers including Omnipoint would \nhave to pay for their licenses, up to 90 percent of average fees in \nother large markets.\n  The pioneers promptly sued, arguing that the FCC had no authority to \nretroactively impose such huge fees. Instead of fighting in court and \nrisking complete failure, the FCC crafted an agreement with the House \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce: PCS pioneers would pay fees at a rate \nof 85 percent of average fees for the 20 next largest markets.\n  Even though this compromise will cost the PCS pioneers from $500 \nmillion to $1 billion in unanticipated fees, they accepted it rather \nthan waste time and resources in court--assuming that this was a done \ndeal and that they could get on with their development work. Now, \nhowever, some people are calling this a ``giveaway,'' and some want to \nrevisit the issue next year and attempt to force the PCS companies to \nfork over even more dollars.\n  It seems to me that the PCS companies, awarded pioneer preferences \nand working constructively with Congress and the FCC, make this \nagreement in good faith, and it ought to stand. It would be very unfair \nto retroactively charge these companies more money. Already, the \nuncertainty over this issue has hurt Omnipoint's ability to attract \ninvestors.\n  By converting military technology to commercial applications, \nOmnipoint is now the manufacturer of the only American noncellular PCS \nradio frequency technology. If PCS is launched soon, Omnipoint is \nlikely to become a leading manufacturer of PCS equipment. This will \nmean hundreds of jobs in my State. When coupled with spin-offs and \nexport opportunities, it also will mean hundreds of jobs for Americans \nelsewhere in the country. If the deployment of PCS is delayed, many of \nthese opportunities will be lost to foreign competitors.\n  Whatever happens with this GATT legislation, I will continue to work \nto support Omnipoint's efforts and to protect jobs in Colorado.\n  Mr. MATHEWS. Mr. President, in the final hours of this Congress we \nhave an opportunity to keep America on the course of economic growth \nand trade expansion that have been the hallmarks of the Clinton \nadministration and the high point of bipartisan cooperation in this \nbody. With a single vote, we have the chance to increase jobs and \nincomes for American families, open closed markets for American goods, \nand bring American consumers a broader variety of lower priced \nproducts. We have the chance to build upon the success of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, and to establish the United States as an \neconomy to contend with in a new world order. We should--and must--make \nthese possibilities into realities by voting to affirm the Uruguay \naccord of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n  Mr. President, the prospects from an affirmative vote are \noverwhelming. Conservative estimates suggest that implementing GATT \nwill create 300,000 to 700,000 American jobs over 10 years. Over that \nsame period, we stand to increase our gross domestic product by upward \nof 3 percent, an amount equal to somewhere between $32 billion and $50 \nbillion. That translates into an average pay raise of $1,700 a year for \nAmerican families.\n  Beyond this, strengthened trade rules under the Uruguay GATT will \ngive American exporters the level playing field they have demanded and \ndeserved for far too long. GATT will implement more effective \nmechanisms for resolving trade disputes, preserve our ability to \nprosecute unfair trade practices, augment our ability to combat foreign \ndumping, and enable us to take more effective action to assure that \nproduct standards do not bar imports.\n  Little wonder, Mr. President, that support for this agreement has \ncome from businesses large and small, manufacturers and farmers, \ncompanies that have long been exporters and companies that long have \nwanted to be, companies with globally established products, and \ncompanies that desperately need recourse against infringements of \nintellectual property. These people know what is good for their \nbusiness, and we must listen to them if we are to do what is good for \nthe United States.\n  I know that there will be winners and losers under this accord. But \nthat is a fact of economic life which we need to face as a fact and \ndeal with realistically. Their experience should teach us that there is \nno safe haven against change, and we are foolish to deny the spectrum \nof American business a world of opportunities in their name.\n  I also find it significant that many of the loudest arguments of \nresistance to NAFTA have been retreaded for GATT. In the few slim \nmonths since we passed NAFTA, the evidence against those arguments has \nmounted. The disasters they predicted have not materialized. That giant \nsucking sound we were supposed to hear is nowhere to be heard.\n  You sure do not hear it in my native Tennessee. Tennessee sold more \nthan $6 billion in exports last year. Our exports more than doubled \nbetween 1987 and 1993. Canada, Mexico, and Japan now are Tennessee's \nNo. 1, 2, and 3 export customers. They purchased nearly $2.5 billion \nfrom Tennessee farms and factories in 1993--an increase of 175 percent \nin sales to those nations over 5 years.\n  The only thing that keeps Tennessee companies from selling more goods \noverseas and creating new jobs at home are foreign barriers to trade--\nthe kind of barriers that GATT removes. Through substantially expanded \nand enforced trade rules, the Uruguay accord will be positive for \nTennessee and for America's Sunbelt.\n  Last year, Tennessee's top manufacturing sectors ranked by exports \nwere chemical products, transportation equipment, and industrial \nmachinery and computers. That jives with the Sun Belt as a whole, where \nleading exports are electrical and electronic components, chemical \nproducts, and transportation equipment. These are the very industries \nthat will have continued export and jobs growth because tariffs will be \nreduced or eliminated by whopping percentages in Japan, South Korea, \nand the European Community.\n  That goes for American farmers and farm products, too. American \nfarmers are the most efficient producers on the globe. But what keeps \nthem from being the most financially fertile producers is the kind of \nforeign production subsidies, export subsidies, and import trade \nbarriers that GATT will reduce--especially in Europe. U.S. agricultural \nexports stand to gain between $1.6 billion and $4.7 billion in the year \n2000 and nearly $9 billion by 2005 as a result of this agreement.\n  Mr. President, we are just beginning to count the winners from this \naccord, and one of those winners will be our trade deficit. In 6 to 10 \nyears after we pass the Uruguay accord, the Economic Strategy Institute \nprojects an annual improvement of $13.5 billion and 25 billion in our \ntrade deficit, including an increase of $3 billion in annual U.S. \nexports of services.\n  Another winner will be our budget deficit. We all know what we need \nto do in order to waive the budgetary point of order because of the \n$11.9 billion in lost revenues that GATT will claim. But is we do it, \nGATT soon will more than pay for itself by increased economic gains \nthat offset tariff cuts.\n  Yet another winner is American ingenuity and innovation. The \nInternational Trade Commission has estimated that foreigners' piracy of \nU.S. copyrights costs American businesses between $43 billion and $61 \nbillion every year and costs the American economy 750,000 jobs. The \nUruguay accord resolves key problems in copyright protection. U.S. \nsoftware producers, pharmaceutical companies, semiconductor \nmanufacturers, chemical producers, publishers, and entertainment \nindustries will be beneficiaries.\n  Just as the benefits of action are great, so are the costs of \ninaction. Fast track authority expires at the end of this year. If we \nopen this measure to amendment, a 6-month delay in implementing GATT \ncould cost the United States $70 billion in lost production, 25,000 \njobs, and $200 billion in the Nation's economic well-being. Vice \nPresident Gore is right when he says that delay of GATT will mean the \ndeath of GATT.\n  We must not let that happen. This accord is the culmination of \nAmerican postwar trade policy, the continuation of efforts we have made \nwith NAFTA and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative, and the climax of \nhard efforts by three U.S. administrations. And beyond all these \nthings, GATT is the future. Let us embrace all the possibilities that \nfuture brings--face the future without fear, confident that American \nworkers and American businesses can compete and prosper. Let's vote \nthis agreement into law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the vote before the Senate on the Uruguay \nround of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is more than a \nindication of how well a Republican Congress and Democrat \nadministration can work together. I imagine that we will continue to \nhave very sharp disagreements on a variety of issues.\n  But trade has always been a special case. There has been, since the \nend of the Second World War, a shared vision regarding our Nation's \ntrade policy. The bipartisan consensus on the benefits of free trade \nhas led to the successful conclusion of seven previous rounds of GATT \nand a corresponding high level of prosperity both in the United States \nabroad.\n  Far from simply signaling the level of collegiality the American \npeople can expect from the new Congress, today's vote will determine \nwhether free trade has a place in both parties' vision for America's \nfuture. We will decide with this vote whether to take counsel from our \nfears or our aspirations; whether we yield to unfounded fears of \ncompetition or affirm our confidence in the ability of the American \nworker.\n  The agreement before us is historic in its scope. It builds on \nprevious GATT rounds by cutting tariffs by over one-third and breaching \nareas formally beyond the reach of international trading rules. It \nseeks to make transparent the sort of barriers that have been used, in \nlieu of high tariffs, to keep American products out of foreign markets. \nNations will have a greater burden to prove that regulations governing \nsuch matters as licensing, inspection procedures, and production \nmethods are purely a matter of domestic politics and not intended to \nprotect national industries.\n  The GATT contains the first multilateral agreement to open up trade \nin services, an increasingly important part of the American economy. \nThe U.S. service sector will have greater market access in the areas of \ngeneral business services, professional services, information and \ncomputer services, health services, and environmental services, among \nmany other areas. Although our Nation remains the largest exporter in \nterms of goods, and is the world's greatest industrial power, exports \nin the area of services now add $180 billion to our economy annually. \nCreating additional opportunities for these businesses is no small \naccomplishment.\n  All together the GATT agreement will add $100 to $200 billion to the \nU.S. economy annually when fully implemented and 1.4 million new jobs \nover the next 10 years.\n  In the debate on GATT, we have heard the same old arguments from \nopponents about these numbers: ``They're cooked.'' ``We'll lose more \njobs than we produce.'' ``Low wages in foreign countries make it \nimpossible for American companies to compete.''\n  During the NAFTA debate last year, Congress exhaustively considered \nand rejected these claims. There is no need to go over the \ncounterarguments again. Let's just look at the facts. NAFTA has been in \neffect for a year. United States exports to Mexico are up 17 percent \nand growing. Increased trade with Mexico has already produced thousands \nof new U.S. jobs, and with our exports growing at the current rate, it \nwill produce thousands more.\n  The gains from the GATT are goals that three successive \nadministrations, Democrat and Republican, have sought to achieve. The \nClinton administration deserves credit for bringing the negotiations to \na close, but as was the case with NAFTA, it will take Republicans to \nput the agreement into law. Unfortunately, we will also put into law \nprovisions in the implementing legislation that could have been more \ncarefully crafted, or are simply unrelated to the GATT.\n  Many in my State, and I know many across the Nation, continue to be \nconcerned about U.S. sovereignty and the effect that our membership in \nthe World Trade Organization will have on our right to decide our own \nlaws and regulations. The implementing legislation states unequivocally \nthat ``no provision of any of the Uruguay Round Agreements, or the \napplication of any such provision to any person or circumstance, that \nis inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have effect.''\n  The implementing legislation, however, is not clear with regard to \nthe course of action should the WTO demonstrate a pattern of unfair \ndecisions against the United States.\n  This is where the Republican leader's initiative to establish a WTO \nDispute Settlement Review Commission is important. As a nation that \ndemands our trading partners establish fair trading practices, we \nshould seek no unfair advantage abroad, nor should we seek to keep \ncompetitive products out of our markets. However, we should not be in a \nposition where we are forced to comply with the decisions of the WTO \nwhich go beyond our commitments under the GATT, or that are reached on \nother than an objective basis.\n  If there is a demonstrated pattern of unfair decisions against the \nUnited States, Senator Dole's proposal establishes a mechanism whereby \nwe can withdraw from the agreement--our right to set the terms of our \ncontracts with foreign governments being the ultimate expression of \nnational sovereignty.\n  In some provisions, the implementing legislation breaks with the \ncontinuity of purpose over three administrations by encompassing issues \nunrelated to the agreement.\n  In the case of patents, this tendency has created a perilous \nsituation for our Nation's inventors--historically one of our greatest \nresources. The implementing legislation goes beyond any of the \ncommitments made in the Uruguay round to seek changes the \nadministration believes prudent in United States patent laws.\n  Signatories agreed that patents should run for 20 years. This is a \nsignificant achievement for American companies which lose an estimated \n$15 to $17 billion a year to various forms of piracy. In drafting the \nimplementing legislation, however, the administration has sought to \ncodify a 20-year protection from the date of filing. Because some \npatents take as long as 10 years--and longer--to be approved, the \nlegislation threatens to weaken U.S. protection of patents. U.S. \npatents are currently protected for a period of 17 years after they are \nissued.\n  Senator Dole also sought to address this issue. He obtained \nassurances that the White House would not oppose changing the terms of \nthe implementing legislation if Congress reviews the issue and decides \nto guarantee the current period of 17 years. Many inventors believe \nthis is not quite enough. There is no guarantee either that Congress \nwill decide to change the law next year or even whether they will \nreview it. Despite the serious effort of the Republican leader, we \nwould have been better off had the administration simply waited until \nnext year to address the issue at all.\n  There are other areas of the implementing legislation where I believe \nthe administration exceeded the terms of the agreement, or delved into \ncompletely unrelated areas, either for the sake of convenience or to \ngarner support. In addition to patents, the implementing legislation \ncontains unnecessary provisions relating to rules of origin on \ntextiles, African economic development and workers' rights.\n  In an effort, apparently, to gain the votes of members from textile \nproducing States, the administration changed the rules of origin on \nimported textiles and apparel to prevent our competitors from spreading \nthe production process out among various countries. Because many \ntextile producers find it costly to produce goods wholly in one \ncountry, the provision in the implementing legislation is sure to raise \nthe cost of production and the prices of imports.\n  Another provision resembling the sort of deals the President thought \nnecessary to gain congressional approval of NAFTA is the section \nregarding workers rights. The President is required under section 131 \nto ``seek the establishment * * * in the WTO of a working party to \nexamine the relationship of internationally recognized worker rights'' \nto GATT obligations. One cannot help but speculate that this was \nincluded in part to appease those disappointed over the \nadministration's failure to win fast-track authority for a new round of \ntrade talks focused on workers' rights.\n  Provisions such as these put traditional supporters of free trade in \na very difficult position. Aware that there are many shortcomings in \nthe legislation, we are forced to support it in order not to jeopardize \nthe overwhelming benefits of free trade. Unless the implementing \nlegislation is intolerably flawed, when it comes to a vote on a \nhistoric worldwide reduction in tariffs, we have to weigh the virtues \nof the agreement itself against our reservations about the implementing \nlegislation.\n  In the future, I hope we can avoid loading implementing legislation \nwith deals intended to pad the voting margin. Free trade can, and \nshould, stand on its own. Although the legislation before us today is a \nfar cry from the Christmas tree the NAFTA implementing bill became, the \nextraneous provisions it does contain take away from the cause of free \ntrade. It is difficult to portray an affirmative vote for the agreement \nas a vindication of the principles of Adam Smith, when opponents can \njustly point to provisions in the implementing legislation with no \nconnections to the agreement.\n  The revenue measures contained in the implementing legislation create \nsimilar complications for the agreement.\n  It is a simple matter of common sense that reducing tariffs and other \nbarriers to American products increases exports; greater exports mean \ngreater productivity; and greater productivity means more Federal \nrevenues. In fact, it has been estimated that for every dollar lost \nbecause of lower tariff rates, the increased economic activity \nresulting from the GATT will create $3 in new revenues.\n  Despite indications that the administration subscribes to this \ntruism, the implementing legislation contains a score of revenue \nmeasures, at least one of which has opened the agreement to \nconsiderable criticism. It seems to me that if anticipated Federal \nrevenues negate the need to offset a portion of the tariff losses \nresulting from the GATT, they should negate the need to offset any \ntariff losses.\n  Like other unrelated provisions, the revenue measures undermine the \ncase to be made for the agreement. Those of us who are perfectly \ncomfortable advocating free trade find ourselves defending measures \nthat have nothing at all to do with the GATT. The most visible of these \nextraneous issues has been the deal struck over pioneer preferences. It \nseems inappropriate that discussions on GATT, an agreement likely to \nresult in an average increase in income of $1,700 per family, would \nfocus on the issue of pioneer preferences. We should have the \nopportunity to debate of pioneer preferences. We should have the \nopportunity to debate the issue of pioneer preferences on its own \nmerits. It should not be settled in a manner which jeopardizes the most \ncomprehensive trade agreement in history.\n  All of the shortcomings of the implementing legislation aside, I will \nsupport passage of the Uruguay round of GATT. The benefits it offers \nAmerican businesses, workers and consumers are simply too great to \nforego. That America's advocacy of free trade is critical to our \ncontinued prosperity and world leadership should be beyond dispute. It \nis my sincere hope that free trade will remain at the center of both \nparties' vision for America, and that we will demonstrate this \ncommitment, as the other House did yesterday, by approving the GATT.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation \nto overhaul the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by \nimplementing the Uruguay round agreements. This legislation is the end \nof a long road that began in 1986--the result of thousands, quite \npossibly millions, of hours of negotiations with our trading partners. \nAfter 8 years of wrangling over the agreement, I am tempted to agree \nwith the observation of Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore that GATT actually \nstands for the ``general agreement to talk and talk.'' Fortunately all \nof that talk led to something that will have concrete benefits for this \ncountry and for the world trading system as a whole.\n  The agreement reduces import duties with our major trading partners \nby an average of 40 percent. Since import duties into the United States \nare already quite low, one of the great benefits of this agreement for \nthe United States is to bring down the tariff and non-tariff barriers \nthat other countries have built, barriers that have made those markets \ntough for American exporters to enter. And 40 percent is just an \naverage, in many cases, the drop in duties is much more dramatic. For \ninstance, under the Round Agreements the duty on getting paper products \ninto South Korea will go from 10.32 percent to 0 percent; the duty on \naerospace items into Japan will go from nearly 5 percent to 0 and the \nduty on pharmaceuticals to the European Union will go from 5.89 percent \nto 0.\n  Reducing the cost of exporting U.S. products has particular \nimportance for my home State of Connecticut. The dramatic rise in \nexports has been one of the few bright spots in my State's economy over \nthe last decade. According to the Department of Commerce, Connecticut's \nexports totaled over $10 billion in 1993. Those exports translate into \njobs and lots of them. Commerce's Hartford District Office says that a \nconservative estimate of the number of Connecticut jobs linked either \ndirectly or indirectly to exports is 176,800.\n  Smaller exporters are also uniquely poised to benefit from the GATT \nsince the agreement simplifies and standardizes customs procedures. The \nreduction in paperwork and red tape will let small exporters spend more \ntime making sales to a wider range of customers and less time trying to \nmeet the paperwork requirements of each individual country. This is \nparticularly important in Connecticut where over 95 percent of our \nexporters have fewer than 500 employees.\n  The reduced tariffs under the Uruguay round agreements will also mean \nlower tariffs for American consumers. This cut in tariffs has been \ndescribed as one of the largest tax cuts in history. the U.S. Treasury \nDepartment has conservatively estimated that the round will cut tariffs \nworldwide by $744 billion over the next 10 years. Since tariffs are \nlargely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, consumers \ncan expect to share in lower prices as a result of these tariff \nreductions.\n\n  In the area of intellectual property this agreement is historic; it \ncreates international standards for the protection and enforcement of \nintellectual property rights for the first time. A July 18 letter from \nseven former U.S. Trade Representatives rightly notes that,\n\n       One of our greatest, strengths as a nation is our \n     creativity. Our software, pharmaceuticals, films, and sound \n     recordings are sold around the globe, and export revenues \n     from products that depend on the protection of intellectual \n     property totaled $20 billion in 1992.\n\n  While I believe we should eventually go further in reducing trade \nlosses due to piracy and counterfeiting, I am convinced that the \nagreement takes a sizable step forward in this area.\n  As anyone who has followed this issue knows, a tremendous amount of \ntime and energy has gone into debating the merits and pitfalls of the \nWorld Trade Organization [WTO]. I understood and shared some of those \nconcerns about the WTO. But I have now concluded that most of those \nconcerns have been addressed. At present, GATT decisions are made in \nmuch the same way that Parent-Teacher Associations and Kiwanis Clubs \nacross this country make their decisions-by consensus. The WTO \nexplicitly continues this practice of consensus. Since the U.S. is the \nworld's largest trader, it is clearly in everyone's best interest to \nget our consent before any big decisions are made.\n  There has been understandable anxiety expressed about the WTO's \npotential ability to overturn U.S. law. If the WTO had the power to \noverturn our laws, I would not support the legislation before us today. \nThe decision to adopt, repeal or amend U.S. laws was ours under GATT \nand remains ours under the WTO. To be sure, the WTO offers more than \nlip service to GATT's dispute settlement procedures. This was done \nlargely at the insistence of the United States since some of our \ntrading partners had been taking advantage of our open market and \ntaking advantage of us in their markets. As the Chamber of Commerce \nnoted in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\n       The Chamber has long been concerned with the inefficient \n     workings of both United States and multilateral dispute \n     settlement processes. Far too often, companies with \n     legitimate grievances against foreign trade practices have \n     had to wait years before their cases get resolved--by which \n     time those companies could very well end up out of business.\n\n  A Chamber survey found that unfair trade cases that went to the GATT \ntook 4.6 years on average to resolve. By streamlining that process, \norganizations like the Chamber believe the WTO dispute settlement, \nprocedures are significant improvements over the status quo for \nAmerica's businesses and workers.\n  Even if a WTO dispute settlement panel finds that a country has not \nlived up to its Uruguay round commitments, it is up to the countries in \ndispute to decide how to resolve that dispute. One option that is not \navailable is overturning another country's laws. A defending country \nmight choose to make a change in its law or it may decide to offer some \ntype of compensation to the aggrieved country or the defending country \nmay choose to do nothing. In this case, the aggrieved country may \ndecide to suspend a trade benefit or take retaliatory action, mindful \nof the fact that the consequences may be severe if they retaliate \nagainst a major trading partner. As Secretary Bentsen has observed:\n\n       The dispute settlement system is not only fair, it also \n     plays to our strengths. Due to our enormous domestic market, \n     the United States has far more trade leverage than any other \n     country in the world. The new dispute settlement regime is \n     tailor-made for us to use. Most other countries simply do not \n     have the economic clout to make retaliation against us a \n     credible option.\n\n  I am grateful that because of concerns that have been raised about \nthe WTO by Senator Dole and others the administration has developed a \nsystem which would allow the United States to leave the WTO if the \norganization consistently rules against the United States. This should \nbring a tremendous amount of comfort to those who are worried about the \npotential breadth and depth of the WTO's powers.\n  As a former State attorney general, I've also paid particular \nattention to what impact the World Trade Organization [WTO] would have \non State and local laws. After being contacted by the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General [NAAG] I in turn asked Ambassador \nKantor to respond to concerns that had been raised about how the WTO \nwould impact State and local laws. A July 15 meeting between the U.S. \nTrade Representative and the NAAG resulted in a July 27 follow-up \nletter to Ambassador Kantor from the NAAG in which the NAAG expressed \nsatisfaction with USTR's efforts to accommodate their concerns. The \nimplementing package before us today ensures that State governments are \nalerted to any important developments affecting State laws, allow \nStates and localities to formally participate in the defense of their \nlaws, and makes clear that States may maintain health, safety and \nenvironmental standards that are higher than those of other States or \nthe Federal Government. I commend USTR for acting to address the \nlegitimate concerns that were raised by the States.\n  The last issue I would like to discuss is the budget waiver. Under \nSenate rules, we are charged with paying for tariff cuts for 10 years \nwhile the House is bound to paying for these for 5 years. Because of \nvarious constraints, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate \nFinance Committee came up with a 5-year package of tariff offsets. I am \ndisappointed that we are not able to vote on a package that meets the \n10-year test. However, I will not vote against the budget waiver and \nthereby prevent this important legislation from coming to the Senate \nfloor. If there is interest in ensuring that the second 5 years of this \nagreement are paid for by passing a package of spending cuts in the \nnext Congress I will support that effort. During the last Congress I \njoined with a bipartisan group of Senators in offering a package of $91 \nbillion in spending cuts--elements of the package could pay the tariff \ncuts in the second 5 years of this agreement if need be.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this chamber will approve this \nimplementing legislation. The agreement stands on its own merits. In \naddition, I think a strong vote to approve this implementing \nlegislation is the right message to send about the Senate's ability to \ngrow our economy and protect and create jobs for American workers in a \nbipartisan way. Begun under President Reagan, continued under President \nBush and completed under President Clinton, the agreement is proof that \nadministrations from both parties can work together in the best \ninterests of the United States.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I hope that today is the day that our \nnation's economic reality finally replaces knee-jerk ideology and \nbusiness as usual in this body. Because if it does not, the loud scream \nfor change that we heard from voters three weeks ago will seem like a \nquiet autumn breeze when compared with the roar and crash of outrage \nthat surely lies just ahead on the path that we are now headed.\n  We are here today to discuss the most important economic decision \nthis body has faced in many decades--and the least painful opportunity \nthat we are likely to face for many years to change our current ruinous \neconomic course.\n  The cynicism of the American people is nowhere more justified than \nwith the steady diet of broken promises and misleading information that \nthey are fed concerning the international economic forces that now \nshape U.S. jobs, incomes, business profitability and government \nrevenues.\n  For some time, successive Presidents, many of my Senate colleagues, \nrespected academics and the media have talked exclusively about \nexpanding U.S. exports while they have ignored the far larger growth in \nU.S. imports. They have spoken of only 40 percent of the trade story. \nIf we took the same blind approach in our budget debates and talked \nonly about the growth of federal revenue--ignoring federal spending and \nour enormous budget deficits--would we trick the taxpayers into \nthinking that government finance was in great shape and that more of \nthe same would be a terrific idea? I doubt it.\n  The U.S. position in international trade has collapsed since the mid \n1970s. Our 1994 merchandise trade deficit (net exports) could reach a \nworld record $160 billion. While some claim that further world trade \nliberalization would yield a $1 trillion tax cut, the reality since the \nlast (Tokyo) round of trade liberalization in 1979 has been a \ncumulative U.S. merchandise deficit of $1.2 trillion; well over $1 \ntrillion in all goods and services; and almost $1 trillion in \nmanufacturing alone.\n  Although still very poorly understood by most Americans, and by many \nmembers of this body, global market forces and trade are no longer \nmerely esoteric and glamorous marginal aspects of our economy. This \nyear the U.S. will import $550 billion of foreign manufactured goods. \nThat is almost half of total U.S. manufacturing Gross Domestic Product. \nWe now have a net export deficit of over half a billion dollars each \nday just in manufacturing trade. We have enormous deficits in most high \ntech products of the future--including semiconductors. This has \ntremendous effects on every aspect of our economy.\n  Just this week, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced our trade \ndeficit is reducing real Gross Domestic Product by $120.8 billion per \nyear. That figure is particularly important to today's discussion about \nthe budget waiver. Chronic U.S. trade losses are a constant, enormous \ndrain on federal revenues--amounting to a loss of perhaps $30 billion \nin fiscal 1994 alone. And yet many GATT proponents want to ignore the \ntidal wave of imports into the U.S.; ignore our trade deficits; and see \nonly our exports. Wearing self-imposed blinders, they would vote to \nwaive our hard-won budget agreements and insist that these chronic \ntrade losses somehow, magicly, add to federal revenue.\n  Does our experience with NAFTA and trade with Mexico support the idea \nof expanding trade world-wide through a new GATT agreement? Let me say \nthat there has been much hyperbole about US-Mexico trade. The U.S. does \ncontinue to have a trade surplus with Mexico and our exports are \ngrowing. But U.S. imports from Mexico are growing faster than exports. \nSo the U.S. surplus fell by 72 percent from 1992 to 1993. Since NAFTA \nwent into effect, our surplus has fallen another 51 percent.\n  Since NAFTA, the U.S. deficit in electronics trade with Mexico has \ndoubled to $1.4 billion in just the first half of 1994, compared with \n1993. Despite the export hype from the auto industry, since NAFTA, the \nU.S. deficit with Mexico in autos and parts worsened in the first six \nmonths of 1994 to a deficit of $1.1 billion.\n  Again, concerning global trade, while some promise hundreds of \nthousands of new trade-related U.S. jobs, the reality is no net jobs in \ninternationally traded industries for over twenty years; all of the 44 \nmillion net jobs created over the past 20 years have come in non-traded \nservice sectors such as health care, local governments, retail sales \nand building maintenance. If the U.S. Commerce Department's estimate is \ncorrect--that each $1 billion in net exports equals 20,000 high wage \njobs--this year's $160 billion deficit alone would eliminate over 3 \nmillion such jobs.\n  In our flexible labor market, however, the major effect of our \nchronic deficits is not always to terminate jobs, but to erode income \nas workers and businesses give up wages and profits to hold on to their \njobs and markets. While some promise increased prosperity, the reality \nis that real U.S. income growth has slowed dramatically from more than \n4 percent per year 30 years ago to less than 1 percent today.\n  This is a very important point, Mr. President, because it is often \nclaimed that trade provides an enormous benefit to U.S. consumers. As I \nhave indicated, some claim that this current GATT agreement would \nprovide a $1 trillion tax cut. The reality, however, is that only those \nwho are independently wealthy enjoy net benefits, because the \npurchasing power of workers and their families have been driven down \nsharply by trade for a generation.\n  While some promise enhanced U.S. world leadership and status with \nfurther trade liberalization, the reality is that in order to pay for \nits massive and chronic trade deficits, the U.S. has plunged from being \nthe world's leading creditor and banker by far to the world's biggest \ndebtor by far. And the once strong U.S. dollar has collapsed in value; \nit bought 360 Japanese Yen in 1970, 260 in 1985, and less than 100 \ntoday.\n  This collapse in both wages and the purchasing power of the dollar is \npricing more and more Americans out of foreign travel. In 1989, for the \nfirst time in the post-World War II period, the U.S. became a net host \nin world travel. Our services sector shows a trade surplus mostly \nbecause of the travel sector--foreign people come to the U.S., but our \nown citizens can no longer afford to travel abroad.\n  The end of the cold war and today's information technologies have \ngiven us the same sort of primitive market condition for the global \neconomy that existed for many individual national economies 100 years \nago. The current directive for GATT and the World Trade Organization is \nnot some high-minded ``world government'' but a sort of world anti-\ngovernment. Its mandate is not to seek prosperity for workers, adequate \nprofits for business and a healthy environment for everyone. Instead, \nits mandate is to assure that nothing interferes with raw market \nforces, and the mandate will be carried out by a new, secretive world \nbureaucracy.\n  I cannot stress enough how extremely naive and dangerous this is. We \nmust not approve these agreements.\n  The real issue, of course, is how to cope with a fundamentally new, \npost-Cold War global economy in which our new information technologies \nhave radically transformed the way national economies work. Until we \nface the fact that it costs a company $50,000 to $100,000 a year to \nhire a first-rate softwear engineer in the U.S., but $5,000 to $10,000, \nto hire the same talent in Bangalor, India or Moscow, we are not facing \nthe real world. And the unhappy consequences of avoiding this real \nworld are increasing every day.\n  Clearly, trade is vital in today's dynamic global economy. Yet this \nstrategy now serves perversely to bring down our personal income, our \nlevels of productivity, and standard of living, to lead our industries \noff-shore, to cost America millions of jobs, and, in general, to make \nthis nation poorer.\n  The proposed Uruguay Round agreements are more of the same trade \npolicies that are already bleeding this nation. They are the wrong kind \nof trade agreements and ought to be rejected. They ought not be \nrejected in a close vote, but decisively, because they are agreements \nthat hurt America.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the GATT, or General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade, is the regime under which we conduct international trade.\n  Here in the Senate we now have before us a very lengthy and \ncomplicated document referred to as the Uruguay round agreement. This \nagreement, negotiated over several administrations, will change the \nGATT significantly, in both good and bad ways.\n  I supported fast-track authority, and in general support free and \nfair trade.\n  I have expressed opposition to the Uruguay round agreement based \nmainly on the establishment of the World Trade Organization. Also, as a \nfiscal conservative, I have been strongly opposed to waiving the budget \nagreement which would allow passage without covering the cost for the \nfull first 10 years of implementation.\n  In an effort to get a broad perspective on what Idahoans were \nthinking about the Uruguay round agreement, I sent out a mailing to \nbusiness, agriculture and local community leaders. The limited response \nwas mixed, even within the business community.\n  In unsolicited mail and phone calls, the overwhelming majority have \nbeen opposed to the World Trade Organization specifically and the \nUruguay round agreement in general.\n  GATT is expected to be generally good for agriculture. However, the \nagreement has both good and bad components depending on the commodity. \nUnfortunately the agreement is not good for some Idaho commodities such \nas dairy, wheat, and sugar beets.\n  There has been a great deal of talk in the press about Senator Dole's \nefforts in an attempt to strike a compromise agreement on the WTO \nlanguage. I commend Senator Dole for his efforts, but I am not \nsatisfied with the results of negotiations with the White House.\n  The President was only willing to work on legislation dealing with \nthis problem in the beginning of the next Congress. The administration \nexpressed a willingness to support legislation next year to establish a \nWTO dispute Settlement Review Commission.\n  The Commission would consist of five Federal appellate judges, \nappointed by the President in consultation with the leadership of both \nhouses and the chairman and ranking members of the Ways and Means, and \nFinance Committees.\n  The Commission would then review all the final WTO dispute settlement \nreports adverse to the United States to determine whether the panel \nexceeded its authority or acted outside the scope of the agreement.\n  In addition, Mr. President, should the Commission issue an \naffirmative determination a member from either the Senate or the House \nof Representatives could introduce a joint resolution for the President \nto have new dispute settlement rules negotiated, to address the \nproblems identified by the Commission.\n  The agreement allows for withdrawal from the WTO if their are three \naffirmative determinations within a 5-year period. However, it requires \nan act of Congress and Presidential approval.\n   While the agreement is filled with good intentions, I am not \nconfident that it provides the necessary safety-net to uphold U.S. \nsovereignty. The problem with this sort of arrangement is that the WTO \ndispute settlement panel may stay within the scope of authority in the \nagreement, but still pose a problem or threat to our sovereignty.\n  In other words, the problem lies within the parameters that have been \nset in the GATT agreement. Therefore, the issue of sovereignty remains \nunresolved.\n  I have a number of concerns about a provision in the Uruguay round \nagreement which would establish a new international entity, referred to \nas the World Trade Organization [WTO].\n  The World Trade Organization is not a minor change to the structure \nof the GATT. It creates an entity that is, to me, more than an \ninternational organization. Rather, it is a regime with powers stronger \nthan those of the United Nations.\n  There is a fundamental problem with the WTO. It was created as a \nsupranational structure that would strengthen the enforcement of \ntrade disputes under the jurisdiction of the GATT. There have been \nprevious attempts to establish a supranational body to cover trade \nrelations and dispute settlements.\n\n  Mr. President, after World War II, representatives from the United \nStates and Great Britain designed a post-war economic system with three \npillars: the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the \nInternational Trade Organization [ITO].\n  The ITO was intended to be the administrating body covering the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]. As I mentioned earlier, \nMr. President, the U.S. Congress rejected the ITO as a threat to U.S. \nsovereignty.\n  The congress took that action despite warnings from the political \ninsiders that failure to join would impede economic recovery. Our \npredecessors realized that the United States and our trading partners \ndid not need a bureaucracy to free trade.\n  The fear of granting broad authority over our trade rules to a mostly \nforeign entity led to the repeated rejection by the Senate of ``The \nInternational Trade Organization'' between 1947 and 1950 and a similar \nbody known as ``The Organization for Trade Cooperation'' in 1955.\n  The WTO must be dropped or dramatically reformed so that there is no \nquestion about our sovereignty as a nation, and the sovereignty of \nstate governments.\n  Mr. President, when forming the United Nations, special care was \ntaken to ensure that the United States would have both veto power and a \npermanent seat on the security council. However, it is apparent that no \nsuch effort has been made with regard to the WTO.\n  In the WTO, the United States could be outvoted by a small coalition \nof nations, regardless of the overall size of their populations, their \ngeographic sizes, their contribution to world trade, their funding \ncontribution to the WTO, or their commitment to fair trade and \ndemocracy.\n  The WTO would initially consist of a diverse coalition of 117 \nnations. Each member nation of the WTO, including the United States, \nwould have one vote in resolving trade disputes under the auspices of \nthe two agreements--GATT and GATS.\n  The World Trade Organization would vote on amendments and \ninterpretation of GATT provisions.\n  Again, Mr. President, the United States would be only one in 117 \nvotes. Therefore, we could easily be outvoted by third world countries \nin the WTO, as often happens in the United Nations. Another point of \nfrustration is that we will be paying 20 percent of the WTO budget with \na voice behind only one vote.\n  Under the GATT as it currently exists, the United States has veto \npower and can block a panel decision by denying the necessary consensus \nto adopt a panel decision.\n  Consensus is also replaced in the WTO with the following guidelines: \nA two-thirds vote to amend the WTO; a three-fourths vote to impose an \namendment on parties and to adopt an interpretation of WTO provisions. \nUnder the interstate and foreign commerce clauses of the Constitution, \nStates cannot discriminate against foreign businesses, including the \napplication of State tax law.\n  Therefore, under the GATT currently, the failure of a State to comply \nwith these provisions results in a United States court action allowing \nthe parties to receive fair and open redress of their complaints.\n  The dispute settlement mechanism included in the Uruguay round \nagreement, on the other hand, would require such matters involving \nState tax policy and foreign businesses to be brought before the WTO.\n  It is my understanding, Mr. President, that a WTO dispute settlement \npanel can meet in secret and need not consider U.S. constitutional \nstandards, nor follow the constraints of U.S. jurisprudence. This is a \nserious concern that needs clarification.\n  It is also my understanding that no individual U.S. State government \nis guaranteed representation on a WTO dispute panel. And, the United \nStates cannot reject a WTO dispute panel mandate without facing foreign \nretaliation and trade penalties enforced by the WTO.\n  This may be a ``worst case'' scenario, but if it is a scenario that \ncould occur under the WTO, then that provision in the Uruguay round \nagreement must be changed.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss efforts to \nresolve the problems with the Uruguay round agreement and the WTO \nlanguage.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Thurmond offered an amendment which would \nhave been a nonbinding resolution, stating the sense of the Senate that \na joint Senate-administration commission should be convened to perform \na 90 day blue ribbon panel report on whether the WTO should be \nconsidered as a treaty rather than an executive agreement.\n  It also requested further hearings both in Washington, DC, and in the \nfield, so that the ramifications of the WTO could be fully examined and \nunderstood.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear, this amendment did not make the GATT \nAgreement ``DOA'' [dead on arrival]. It simply reflected the importance \nof the agreement and the need to understand fully the development of a \nnew international organization prior to our country's acceptance.\n  In short, it would have provided the kind of real solution I was \nlooking for to ensure U.S. sovereignty.\n  In addition to the amendment, I joined Senator Thurmond in sending a \nletter to Senator Dole requesting the following:\n  1. Mandate that the bill be fully funded.\n  2. Extend, for 1 year only, fast track authority, restricted solely \nto allow the introduction of new Uruguay round implementing language.\n  3. Include in the extension of fast track, requirements that the \nagreement establishing the WTO be considered as a treaty requiring a \ntwo-thirds approval in the Senate. The trade provisions of the Uruguay \nround would need only a simple majority in both Houses for passage.\n  4. Remove the special interest provisions such as the $2 billion \ndiscount of Federal licensing fees to three communications companies.\n  The intent of the letter was to allow ourselves the time necessary to \nresolve problems surrounding the WTO with a view to removing barriers \nfrom passage of the tariff reductions and other, positive components of \nthe Uruguay round agreement. Unfortunately, Senator Dole was not able \nto accomplish these four goals in his discussions with the White House.\n  Before concluding, Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment \nto add that I will be voting against waiving the Budget Act. The bill \nviolates the fiscal year 1994 budget resolution agreement and will be \nadding $31 billion to our budget deficit.\n  As a fiscal conservative and long-term supporter of the balanced \nbudget amendment, I cannot support the circumvention of deficit \nreduction plans.\n  Mr. President, any potential loss of U.S. sovereignty is not worth \nrisking. World trade has progressed well under the current GATT system \nthat is voluntary and requires unanimous consent for decisions. \nInternational trade has grown dramatically since the beginning of the \nGATT in 1948--the value of world trade has increased from about $60 \nbillion to more than $3.7 trillion. The volume of world trade has \nincreased about sevenfold.\n  Trade in Idaho has tripled from $752 million in 1987 to $1.9 billion \nlast year. The increase for this year is anticipated to top $2 billion.\n  I do not argue against the value of international trade. It is \nevident in the growth of Idaho's economy. However, I will argue that \nthe WTO is not necessary for this trend to continue.\n  After all, this growth has occurred under the current GATT rules, \nwithout the WTO. I urge my colleagues to vote against the budget waiver \nand against the GATT agreement.\n  Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have decided to vote for ratification of \nthe Uruguay Round of GATT and the budget waiver necessary under Senate \nfinancing rules.\n  In some areas, such as worker rights and environmental protection, \nthe agreement fell short of the high ideals that the United States has \nhistorically championed. These issues, in particular, concerned me as I \nconsidered this wide-ranging document. I now will look to the \nadministration to pursue further multilateral agreements to achieve the \nsame parity in these areas that the Uruguay round brings to goods and \nservices.\n  In the end, however, the agreement is about trade, and about our \nability to compete in the world. As a leading export State, Illinois is \na strong competitor and will be one of the first to gain from this \nagreement in new jobs and economic growth in our agricultural, \nindustrial and services trade. We will see similar benefits as a nation \nfrom the leadership we are showing through this agreement.\n  There will be costs, and I do not vote to waive our tough budget \nrules lightly. I am concerned that this not be taken as precedent for \nwidespread use of dynamic scoring. But we must be practical and realize \nthe economic benefits that will result in the long term from this \nagreement.\n  The Uruguay round takes a further step toward a truly level playing \nfield for American products in the world. I do not see the WTO as a \nthreat to our sovereignty but as the common forum for global trade \nissues. If we are to set our own destiny we must remain engaged with \nthe economies of the world, leading not by the bullying force of \nprotectionism and veto power but by the strength of our workforce.\n  The more open global marketplace of the Uruguay round will continue \nto place a premium on worker skills and productivity. I hope that the \npassage of the Uruguay round will refocus our efforts to improve our \nNation's educational systems to ensure that our workers remain the most \nproductive in the world.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will support the legislation to implement \nthe Uruguay round GATT agreement and hope that the full Senate will \npass this measure by a substantial and bipartisan majority.\n  The United States is the world's largest exporter; we have the most \nproductive workforce; and we have recently regained the distinction of \nthe world's most competitive economy. Exports have been critical to the \nrebound in our economy, accounting for one half of U.S. economic growth \nover the past 5 years. Further, as has been stated repeatedly, we are \nalready the world's most open market. Hence, competitive goods produced \nin this country, and those who produce them, have much to gain from the \nmarket-opening, tariff-reducing provisions of the new GATT agreement.\n  Like it or not, we are operating in a truly global economic \nenvironment from which we could not, and should not, withdraw. In 1965 \nexports accounted for approximately 5 percent of U.S. GDP; they have \nnow risen to almost 12 percent. We cannot afford to ignore the \nsubstantial contribution of exports to our economic well being. I have \noften said that if we did not have GATT to set the parameters for trade \namong nations, we would have to invent it, or something close to it.\n  I am not sure that this GATT is worthy of all the superlatives being \nattributed to it. However, it is a solid and substantial step forward \ntoward the long standing U.S. goal of freer and fairer world trade--a \ngoal we have pursued since the origin of GATT in the aftermath of World \nWar II.\n  My State of Ohio has a substantial and growing stake in the export \nmarket. We are the sixth largest exporting State. Our exports have \ngrown rapidly in the last several years, from $6.5 billion in 1987 to \n$19.4 billion last year. One of every seven to eight jobs in Ohio's \nmanufacturing sector currently produces for the export market.\n  In this negotiating round, spanning three administrations, Republican \nand Democratic, the United States made substantial progress toward \nrealization of most of our major objectives. The new GATT mandates a \nreduction of worldwide tariffs by about one-third. That's a worldwide \ntotal of nearly $750 billion of tariffs eliminated, of which the U.S. \nshare is $32 billion.\n  In addition to the reduction of tariffs--traditional barriers to \ntrade which earlier GATT agreements primarily focused on--the new GATT \nmakes significant progress in addressing another important U.S. \nconcern--non-tariff trade barriers. For example, the new agreement \nrequires all GATT parties to give greater protection to intellectual \nproperty rights. Lax or nonexistent protection for such intellectual \nproperty rights has proved a very effective non-tariff barrier to \nresearch-and creativity-sensitive industries such as pharmaceuticals, \nelectronics, software and recorded entertainment, costing U.S. \ncompanies billions of dollars a year.\n\n  The new GATT agreement more fully incorporates into the GATT system \nmajor new sectors of world trade not previously covered or not fully \ncovered; for example services, textile products, and agriculture.\n  In agriculture, the new GATT agreement requires non-tariff trade \nbarriers, like quotas, to be converted to tariffs and then reduced. \nFurther reductions in tariffs on agricultural goods in the future will \nbe made easier by the requirement to quantify these non-tariff \nbarriers.\n  The reduction of agricultural trade barriers in this GATT agreement \nis expected to result in increased agricultural exports by $5 to $14 \nbillion over the next 5 years. U.S. farmers are the most productive in \nthe world, already producing substantially more than we can consume at \nhome. Presently, exports take about one-third of U.S. agricultural \nproduction. For U.S. agriculture to prosper, it must aggressively \npursue markets abroad. This GATT provides an important tool to support \nthat effort.\n  The agreement brings all parties, developing and developed, into the \nGATT system, with all the obligations and responsibilities that \nmembership entails. Previously, developing countries had been free to \nopt out of certain GATT obligations.\n  Many critics of the new agreement have focused on the new World Trade \nOrganization and its alleged ability to overturn U.S. laws. Let me \nreiterate, as clearly as I can, what has been repeatedly stated \nthroughout the debate on this question--the Congress, and only the \nCongress, makes the laws of this country. A dispute resolution panel of \nthe new WTO could rule that a U.S. law is contrary to our obligations \nunder the GATT, but there is nothing self-enforcing about such a \nruling. Any decision to amend that law to conform to GATT would have to \nbe a U.S. initiative approved by both Houses of Congress and signed by \nthe President.\n  In addition it has been suggested that somehow the provisions for \ndecisionmaking and voting within the WTO create a tyranny of a majority \nwho oppose U.S. interests. Let us examine the facts. The WTO agreement \nprovides that the current GATT practice of decisionmaking by consensus \nwill ordinarily be followed. This process of consensus decisionmaking \nis so well established within the current GATT that, it is my \nunderstanding there has never been a formal vote taken in GATT since \nthe system was established after World War II. If consensus fails, then \na matter may be decided by a majority of votes.\n  However, major issues such as waivers of agreement obligations and \ninterpretations of most agreements will require a super majority of \nthree fourths. Amendments to agreements will require a two thirds \nmajority, with those affecting basic rights and obligations of Members \nto take effect only for those Members that have accepted them. Further, \namendments to certain cornerstone GATT obligations will take effect \nonly if all WTO Members accept them.\n  I do not expect that the WTO will become a vehicle for attacking U.S. \ntrade and economic interests. Indeed, I fear a more reasonable \nprediction is that an international organization with over 100 members \nwhich operates by consensus will be greatly challenged to do anything \nat all. Nevertheless, if experience proves contrary to my expectation, \nthe United States should not hesitate to exercise its right under the \nagreement to withdraw, with 6 months notice.\n  As chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, I would \nlike to say a word about subtitle E, which makes necessary changes in \nU.S. law in order to implement agreements reached by the member nations \nof the GATT Government Procurement Code. The primary objective of the \nGATT Procurement Code is to ensure the establishment of Government \nprocurement systems based on the principles of transparency, openness, \nand fairness.\n  Highlights of the revised code include a threshold of $182,000 for \nwaiver of buy national requirements for central Government purchases. \nU.S. minority and small business setasides would not be affected, nor \nwould procurements necessary for national security. Government \nconstruction contracts, with a $7 million threshold, and services will \nbe covered for the first time.\n  In addition the GATT implementation bill would extend the U.S. \nprocedure for responding to unfair Government procurement practices to \ncover failure to adequately enforce antibribery and corruption laws in \nthe awarding of Government contracts.\n  The agreement will not impede the use of new information management \nand other technologies to improve the efficiency of Government \nprocurement systems and is consistent with recently passed Government \nprocurement reform legislation.\n  Is this agreement everything we could have wanted? No, it is not. Is \nthere additional work to do? Yes, there is. Is this agreement a panacea \nfor our economic problems? No, it isn't. Can we afford to be complacent \nabout our productivity and competitiveness? No, we certainly cannot. \nHowever, on balance, I believe that this new GATT agreement makes a \nsignificant and positive contribution to furthering a freer and fairer \nsystem of world trade. I am convinced that it will be good for the U.S. \neconomy--for producers and consumers alike. And I am confident that in \nsuch a freer and fairer international trading environment, American \nindustry and American workers will prove very competitive.\n  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the GATT enabling \nlegislation. The economic benefits of this Agreement are, by now, \nfamiliar to everyone in this chamber. The GATT Agreement is projected \nby experts to: Increase U.S. national income by an additional $100-200 \nbillion a year, and increase global income by as much as $5 trillion by \n2005; reduce global tariffs by an average of one-third, producing a \nglobal tax cut of $750 billion over the next ten years, the largest in \nhistory; expand free trade rules to areas not previously covered by \nGATT, such as agriculture and services; and protect intellectual \nproperty rights through creation of the Agreement on Trade Related \nIntellectual Property Rights (TRIPs).\n  The result of these changes will be the creation of between 300,000 \nand 700,000 new American jobs and an additional $1,700 in income for a \nfamily of four by the year 2004.\n  Beyond the new opportunities GATT offers, its passage is vital to \nongoing American global leadership. The GATT signals our continued \ncommitment to free trade and competition, and to the conviction that \nconsumers--not governments--make the wisest economic decisions.\n  The Uruguay round is the seventh extension of the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade, and it represents the culmination of 8 years \nbegun during the Reagan Administration, continued throughout the Bush \nAdministration, and concluded by the Clinton Administration. The United \nStates was a founding member of the GATT in 1947, and we have been \nsteadfast proponents of economic development through the reduction and \nultimate elimination of trade barriers. The U.S. has been instrumental \nin reducing global tariffs from almost 60 percent at the conclusion of \nWorld War II to under 4 percent when the Uruguay round is fully \nimplemented.\n  This strategy has worked well for America and the world. In 1987 \nconstant dollars, U.S. Gross Domestic Product has quadrupled from $1.3 \nbillion to $4.3 billion since the creation of GATT. The increase in \ntrade during this same period represents a significant portion of this \ngrowth. Although we are no longer alone at the top, the United States \nremains the largest and most powerful economy in the world, and this \nagreement will help raise living standards in our country and around \nthe world.\n  Mr. President, individuals fare best when they are allowed to do what \nthey do best. Economists call this concept ``comparative advantage,'' \nand it applies to nations as well as individuals. Because American \nworkers are the most productive in the world, the GATT Agreement \npresents an unprecedented opportunity to utilize our advantages to \nexport more goods and services overseas. Since the United States \nalready has among the lowest tariffs in the world, the GATT's reduction \nof foreign tariff and non-tariff barriers can be expected to benefit \nAmerican exports.\n\n  I believe GATT will prove to be beneficial for Georgians. For \nexample, the forest products industry in Georgia is a $13.2 billion \nbusiness, the largest in the State. The GATT Agreement includes the \n``zero-for-zero'' agreement on wood and paper products. Paper products \nare already Georgia's leading export to Mexico and the second leading \nexport to the rest of the world. As the forest products industry \ncontinues moving South, I expect that its exports will be a critical \ncomponent in the region's continued economic growth.\n  Mr. President, Georgians are also proud of our poultry industry. Last \nyear, poultry income in Georgia reached $1.73 billion, exceeding, for \nthe first time, all other crop income combined. Poultry is one of the \nbest and least expensive protein sources in the world, and nobody \nproduces it more efficiently than Georgians. Under GATT, poultry \nexports are projected to increase 32 percent by 2005. The developing \ncountries of Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, and Africa are \nhungry, and we want to help feed them. The GATT will help those \neconomies grow, and will assure that as they do, their consumers have \nthe opportunity to buy Georgia poultry.\n  Mr. President, the textile and apparel industry is Georgia's largest \nmanufacturing sector and accounts for almost one-fifth of manufacturing \nemployment in the State. I understand the industry is divided on GATT, \nbut I would note that in Georgia, almost one-half of the industry is \ncomprised of carpet manufacturers and suppliers, which is already \nbenefiting from brisk overseas sales. According to the Department of \nCommerce, exports from the 307 ZIP code, which encompasses Georgia's \n``Carpet Crescent,'' grew 426 percent between 1987 and 1993, from \n$75.102 million to $395.37 million. So the carpet industry is clearly \nalready benefiting from international markets. As for the rest of the \ntextile industry, I note that the leadership of the American Textile \nManufacturers Institute has endorsed the Agreement, and is especially \npleased that the Breaux-Cardin rules-of-origin requirement was retained \nin the implementing legislation.\n  Georgia is also a leader in the production of industrial machinery, \nchemical products, transportation and electric equipment. These four \nindustries accounted for more than $1.27 billion in Georgia's 1993 \nexport sales in 1993, more than one-fifth of total exports. The same \nfour industries grew an average of 143.65 percent between 1987 and \n1993.\n  I have mentioned just a few Georgia industries by way of example, so \nlet me address generally for a moment the importance of exports to \nGeorgia. In 1993, Georgia shipped $6.05 billion worth of goods to the \nrest of the world. That's at 148.8 percent increase over 1987. Mr. \nPresident, jobs supported by merchandise exports pay above average \nwages (17 percent above average in 1990). The growth in these exports \nprovided new jobs for Georgians and an increasing standard of living. \nGATT promises more of the same.\n\n  Some of my constituents have said to me, ``How can we possibly \ncompete with or sell to a country with $1 an hour wages?'' That's a \nfair question, but it assumes that labor is the only component that \nmatters in trade. This is, of course, untrue. Transportation, energy, \neducation, and investment--in a word, productivity, all play a vital \nrole in manufacturing, and the United States offers the best total \npackage. That's why BMW and Mercedes Benz will soon begin manufacturing \nautomobiles in South Carolina and Alabama, and why YKK, Matsushita and \nother foreign manufacturers have made Georgia seventh in the nation in \ndirect foreign investment, with 10 new manufacturing plants.\n  As a practical matter, Mr. President, we have no choice but to trade \nwith the rest of the world. The United States represents four percent \nof the world's population and 22 percent of the world's economy. But \nthe United States, Western Europe and Japan are mature economies and \ntheir growth potential is limited. If we close the door to the fast-\ngrowing developing world, we are resigning ourselves to a declining \nstandard of living; and if we don't capitalize on opportunities in the \ndeveloping world, someone else will. But we cannot have it both ways. \nWe cannot demand that other countries open the door to the U.S. while \nwe shut the door on them.\n  Mr. President, a final word about the World Trade Organization (WTO). \nI know some of my constituents are concerned about the implications of \nthe WTO's Dispute Settlement Board on U.S. sovereignty. I have studied \nthis issue closely, and based on my review, I do not believe it will \ninfringe on our sovereignty. The WTO cannot change U.S. law; only \nCongress can. In any event, the ultimate recourse in any GATT dispute \nis for the United States is to withdraw from GATT. I would certainly \nsupport exercising that option if I though the GATT infringed upon our \nsovereignty. I believe this Agreement protects U.S. interests while \nincreasing economic opportunities at home and abroad.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the GATT \nimplementing legislation. This is not perfect legislation or a perfect \ntrade agreement. But we are not here today to vote on a perfect trade \nagreement. We are here to decide whether Wisconsin and the United \nStates will be part of the world economic market.\n  Both proponents and opponents of GATT are trying to answer that \nquestion using the same criteria. What vote will lead to more jobs, \nmore economic prosperity and a better standard of living for the most \nAmericans?\n  For the people in my home State of Wisconsin, GATT and entrance into \na more open world market is the answer. We can try to preserve our \ncurrent standard of living by shutting out the rest of the world--and \nthat might work to preserve a few jobs in a few industries for a short \nperiod of time. Or we can try to improve our future standard of living \nby using the GATT to enter new world markets--and that gives us an \nopportunity to create new jobs in many industries for the foreseeable \nfuture. Choosing GATT is choosing the chance for a richer, better \nfuture for our children.\n  The U.S. economy is increasingly dependant on the international \neconomy. In 1992, according to the Department of Commerce, over 7 \nmillion workers in the U.S. owed their jobs to merchandise exports and \nan additional 3.5 million U.S. workers owed their jobs to U.S. service \nexports. In 1993 in Wisconsin, exports totaled $5.8 billion, almost \ndouble the level of exports in 1987. The days are gone in which the \nrest of the world needed our business more than we needed theirs. Trade \nis responsible for millions of current U.S. jobs and thousands of \nWisconsin jobs. It has created millions of U.S. jobs and thousands of \nWisconsin jobs. And expanding trade will create millions more.\n  The reductions in tariffs and trade barriers will stimulate economic \ngrowth and enhance export opportunities for American business. One \nstudy by the Economic Strategy Institute concludes that the agreement \nwould increase annual U.S. income between $100 billion and $200 billion \nover ten years. It is also estimated that this agreement will generate \nfrom 300,000 to 700,000 new jobs by 2004. American consumers will \nbenefit from lower prices and increased competition, which will lead to \nhigher quality, competitively-priced goods and services. Wisconsin's \nleading manufactured exports include industrial machinery, scientific \nand measuring instruments, and electric and electronic equipment. These \nthree industries together accounted for nearly 60 percent of the \nstate's total exports in 1993. Under this agreement, tariffs on these \nproducts will be reduced by over 50 percent.\n  For all of these reasons, I believe moving toward free trade and U.S. \nparticipation in the world market is the best choice, and that is why I \nsupport GATT. But that does not mean I believe GATT is perfect. There \nare some provisions of this massive agreement with which I take issue.\n  First of all, passing GATT requires waiving the Budget Act--something \nI do not take lightly. The lower tariffs in GATT will lead to a loss of \ntariff revenue for the United States of $10 billion over the next five \nyears and $26.6 billion over the next ten years. When GATT was first \nreleased, I and several other Senators wrote to the President asking \nhim to develop implementing legislation that fully offset these revenue \nlosses. The Administration did subsequently develop a financing package \nthat is included in the implementing legislation before us. It reduces \nthe revenue loss to $1.7 billion in the first five years and $12 \nbillion over ten years.\n  I would have preferred a full offset; I believe that is the more \nresponsible course. But I also believe that GATT will generate new \neconomic activity that will offset the revenue losses many times over. \nIt is proper that we do not count such revenue in our budget figures \nbecause it is based on assumptions about economic growth that are not \n100 percent certain. However, it is also proper that we waive the \nbudget rules to pass legislation that almost certainly will lead to a \nhealthier economy and a stronger government balance sheet. As Senator \nDomenici pointed out earlier today, we allow our budget rules to be \nwaived by vote of the Senate exactly because there are some measures--\nlike GATT--that have positive economic and budgetary effects which are \nnot reflected by our current, conservative accounting.\n  Second, I have heard from some who are concerned about the effect \nthis agreement will have on the dairy industry, one of the largest \nindustries in my state. However, it must be noted that, in general, \nGATT is good for agriculture. U.S. farmers can expect to gain new \nexport markets for products from feed grains to meat products to fruits \nto vegetables.\n  However, it is no secret that dairy farmers are unhappy with this \nAgreement. They are correct that U.S. negotiators did not place a high \nenough priority on gaining new markets for U.S. dairy products. And the \nmixed signals sent from U.S. dairy representatives in Geneva during the \nGATT negotiations made it difficult for negotiators to set a clear \nobjective for dairy trade.\n  The question is, however, what do you do with that information? \nOppose the Agreement and all of its other benefits or attempt to bring \nabout appropriate changes in the GATT for dairy farmers. I have chosen \nthe latter course. I have worked with the Administration and our \ntrading partners to do everything possible to make this Agreement \nbetter for the dairy farmers of this nation.\n  One of the biggest concerns of dairy farmers about this GATT \nAgreement has been the large increases in cheddar cheese imports from \nNew Zealand and Australia. Since cheddar cheese acts as a commodity \ncheese in this nation, increased imports of cheddar cheese have a \ndirect effect on milk prices paid to U.S. farmers. And milk prices are \nalready too low.\n  To soften the blow to U.S. dairy farmers, several of my colleagues \nand I were able to work with Australia to achieve a mutually beneficial \nagreement to adjust the type of cheese entering U.S. markets from that \nnation. As a result of these efforts, Australia has agreed to swap half \nof their cheddar cheese allocation for an equal allocation of specialty \ncheeses, which do not directly effect milk prices.\n  Another priority for U.S. dairy trade has been access to the Canadian \nmarket. While Canada has agreed to remove their import quotas on dairy \nproducts imports, they have replaced them with high tariffs, in direct \nconflict with the NAFTA and U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Although \nthis matter is still unresolved, Ambassador Kantor has assured me that \nhe will continue negotiation with Canada on this matter, and bring \nformal NAFTA dispute action against Canada if necessary.\n  And finally, I have listened with concern to those who have argued \nthat the World Trade Organization established by this Agreement will \nlead to weakening of the environmental laws of the United States. \nClearly, that would be counter to the purpose of GATT, which is to \nfurther unite trading partners through reduced economic barriers. I \nview a general trend of increased environmental standards worldwide to \nbe an appropriate corollary to the increased economic trade envisioned \nby this GATT Agreement. As a nation's standard of living increases, so \nalso does that nation's ability to devote resources to environmental \ngoals.\n  Contrary to some accounts, the World Trade Organization has no \nsovereignty over U.S. environmental laws. The WTO does, however, have \nthe authority to declare U.S. environmental laws GATT illegal, but only \nif they are not scientifically based. If, as some suggest, the WTO \nconsistently rejects U.S. environmental laws as GATT illegal, the \nUnited States retains the full right to withdraw from that body. But \nfor the United States to reject this GATT Agreement, would be to \ndiscard our ability to be a force for environmental change worldwide. \nIt is my hope that the United States will be able to join with European \nnations in using the power of the WTO to persuade other nations to \nadopt more environmentally progressive laws.\n  Despite these reservations, I believe that the legislation before us \ntoday is exactly the type of legislation we should hope to pass in the \n104th Congress--bipartisan, practical, good for the nation as a whole. \nYes, it is full of compromises. Yes, I would have drafted some parts \ndifferently. But, overall, GATT moves Wisconsin this nation into the \nworld market, into opportunities for a better standard of living, into \na prosperous and healthy future. It does so because it is not a \npolitical document--it is a practical attempt to provide the most hope \nand opportunity for the most Americans. That is good legislation. And \nthat is legislation worthy of our support.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the General Agreement on \nTariffs and Trade. A year ago, there was extensive debate in Congress \nand the Nation over whether the United States should enter into the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, our two \nclosest neighbors to the North and South. Today, the Senate will vote \non whether to enact legislation implementing a much more far-reaching \neffort to reduce barriers to trade among more than a hundred nations \nthroughout the world.\n  As with NAFTA last year, GATT has provoked strong feelings on both \nsides of the issue, especially with respect to its impact on the \nworkforce. In Massachusetts, I held a hearing and heard from a number \nof witnesses who are deeply concerned that the long-term consequences \nof GATT will be further pain and dislocation for working men and women \nwho have already been hard hit by the massive structural changes that \nhave transformed our economy over the last two decades.\n  There is one fundamental principle we can all agree on. The success \nof our trade policies must be measured by the degree to which they \nimprove the living standards of the people and advance the well-being \nof our society.\n  It is clear that many families have yet to experience the sense of \nenhanced economic security that should come with an expanding economy. \nDespite significant progress in the last 2 years in making up the \nground lost to the recession, reducing unemployment, creating new jobs, \nholding inflation down and cutting the Federal deficit, there continues \nto be a pervasive sense of unease among large numbers of working \nfamilies.\n  Many of them have been affected by the dislocations accompanying this \nperiod of economic change--if not directly, then through the \nexperiences of relatives, neighbors, or friends. The prospect of \nexpanded trade and increased international competition in these \ndifficult times often means greater anxiety among these families for \ntheir own jobs and for their families' futures.\n  One answer to this increasing global competition is more investment \nin technology, infrastructure, and education and training. America must \nnot engage in a ``race to the bottom,'' where we are obliged to lower \nour living standards to those of Third World nations. Instead, we must \ncompete on productivity, and that means investment, public and private.\n  I hope that many of my colleagues will be mindful of these needs. It \nisn't enough just to expand trade. We must provide necessary \ninvestments, while keeping our fiscal house in order. We must do more \nto alleviate the fears that many working men and women now have, and \nthat have made passage of this agreement so controversial.\n  In recent years, we have been working hard in Massachusetts to \novercome the effects of the recession and to create new jobs and better \njobs for our workers. We have made substantial progress, especially in \nareas such as telecommunications equipment, software, biotechnology, \nconstruction, and other industries. Our primary goal is the retention \nand creation of good jobs and good wages.\n  In Massachusetts, we are fortunate to have a number of industrial \nsectors that will continue to grow and expand, as long as we continue \nto focus on their needs, and invest in them. We must provide an \neducated and skilled work-force, a quality living environment, and the \ninfrastructure necessary to keep our State economy strong. To do so, we \nmust maintain the competitive advantage that has made our State a place \nwhere we can create good jobs for our workers.\n  I have supported the administration's efforts to negotiate GATT, \nbecause I believe our economic strength depends on expanded trade. In \nMassachusetts alone, exports increased almost 50 percent during the \ndepth of the recent recession. While many industrial sectors across the \nState and country were downsizing, those that were able to take \nadvantage of export opportunities created 60,000 new jobs and more than \n$3 billion in new economic activity.\n  GATT will help many sectors of the economy to grow even more rapidly. \nIts broad provisions reducing tariff and nontariff barriers for large \nnumbers of products will open foreign markets at long last to countless \nU.S. enterprises. Barriers that have long denied U.S. access to markets \nin Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world will be removed.\n\n  The machine tool industry, which was founded in New England and has \nrecently begun to rebound, will have improved access to new world \nmarkets. Our medical equipment, computer, and telecommunications \nindustries will be better able to compete in international markets.\n  GATT also increases the protections for intellectual property and \nhelps to combat intellectual piracy, a significant issue for high-\ntechnology industries like computer software. More open access to \nforeign government procurement contracts will allow U.S. industries to \ncompete for new business across the globe.\n  Our financial services sector did not gain the export opportunities \nthat we had hoped for, but the foundation for future negotiations has \nbeen laid.\n  Overall, expanded world trade will help the economies of \nMassachusetts and America. But no one disputes that there will be \nlosers. The textile and apparel industry, for example, will be faced \nwith the phase out of the Multi-Fiber Agreement, which sets the quotas \nthat have allowed the industry to remain competitive over the years.\n  We should provide effective assistance to such industries, helping \nthem to use more productive technologies and have a well-trained work \nforce. We should take some of the benefits from expanded trade, and use \nthem to assist those industries like textiles that have already been \nhurt by global competition, and that will be harmed even more by GATT.\n  But the consequences of failing to pass GATT are much worse than the \ndamage that will be done by approving it. If Congress fails to pass \nthis agreement, it will weaken America's position in the world economy. \nIt will encourage other nations to continue with their own \nprotectionism and unfair trading practices that have blocked many \nAmerican industries from fair competition.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I wish that this agreement had higher \nstandards for labor and better environmental protections. But rejection \nof GATT now will not advance these other worthwhile goals. If GATT \nfails, the world trading system will be set back for years, if not \ndecades. In such a contentious atmosphere, it will be even more \ndifficult to make progress on the labor and environmental issues that \nwe care deeply about and that should be part of future trade \nnegotiations.\n  Additional concerns over GATT involve the World Trade Organization, \nU.S. sovereignty, and our relations with other nations. In fact, \nthough, we will be in at least as strong a position under the new \norganization as we were prior to GATT.\n  A more effective dispute resolution mechanism was one of America's \nprincipal negotiating objectives under GATT. Under current procedures, \nwhen the United States won favorable rulings against other nations' \nunfair trade practices--which was the case more often than not--we had \nno effective means of implementing those rulings.\n  Senator Dole and the administration have worked well together to \nimprove GATT on issues relating to the WTO. If the WTO truly threatens \nU.S. sovereignty, we can withdraw from the agreement, and Congress will \nnow have an enhanced role in facilitating that withdrawal. I do not \nanticipate such a scenario taking place, but the ability of the United \nStates to withdraw in these ways should reassure some of the critics.\n  For all of these reasons, and recognizing the agreement's flaws, I \nurge the Senate to support GATT. The real challenge we face will be to \nsee that GATT fulfills our hopes, not our fears. Above all, we must \nhelp the industries and workers hurt by this expansion of trade, and I \nintend to do all I can in the months and years ahead to see that this \nchallenge is fully met.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on history's \nmost ambitious world trade agreement. Since World War II, the world \neconomy has become increasingly interdependent and trade has played an \nincreasing role in political affairs. For the past seven years and \nthrough three administrations, two Republican and one Democratic, the \nU.S. has worked to expand free trade in the Uruguay round. Studies \nindicate that the U.S. will receive a boost of over $100 billion \nannually through expanded trade. I support the agreement, because it \nmandates not just free trade, but fair trade for U.S. goods.\n  Mr. President, this agreement has been expanded to include coverage \nfor a number of new areas such as the trade in services, agriculture \nand protection from piracy of intellectual property. This agreement \nwill also implement the largest tax cut in history. The across-the-\nboard reduction in tariff, subsidy, and quota levels will amount to a \n$744 billion tax cut worldwide. ``Tariff'' is a fancy name for ``tax'' \nand these taxes are applied to both consumers and U.S. exports. These \nadded costs put U.S. exports at a distinct disadvantage.\n  Since GATT's inception in 1948, eight trade rounds have been \ncompleted that have established rules of trade reducing tariff and non-\ntariff barriers. As a result, world trade has steadily expanded.\n  In fact, between 1965 and 1990 merchandise trade has increased by a \nwhopping 439 percent. Currently, the U.S. is the leading world \nexporter, with 11.6 percent of our Gross Domestic Product coming from \nexports. As this figure increases, so will higher paying export-related \njobs.\n  This agreement achieves four major objectives. First, foreign markets \nwill open to U.S. producers through the reduction in tariff and non-\ntariff barriers. I am especially pleased in this round we were able to \ncrack the protectionist foreign agriculture markets which to this point \nhave heavily subsidized their own agricultural interests.\n  Second, this agreement strengthens the procedures for dealing with \nunfair trade. The new dispute settlement procedures will ensure that \nnations engaged in unfair trade will be required to come to the table \nin good faith to resolve trade disputes. This will eliminate the delays \nand stalling tactics which foreign countries have used in blocking U.S. \nentry into their markets.\n  Mr. President, the third objective this agreement achieves presents \nthe best opportunity for the U.S. to expand trade. This allows for the \nestablishment of rules of trade in services and the protection of \nintellectual property.\n  This is the first multi-lateral and enforceable agreement to include \neither provision. This is a tremendous achievement for the United \nStates. In 1991, services accounted for 62 percent of U.S. GDP, \nemploying 57 percent of U.S. workers. Currently, the U.S. maintains a \n$55 billion surplus in this area.\n  With regard to intellectual property, U.S. corporations have lost \nbillions because there have been no trade protection against the piracy \nof intellectual property. In 1987, a survey by the International Trade \nCommission estimated that U.S. companies lose $23 billion annually due \nto piracy of intellectual property. With the U.S. the undeniable leader \nin intellectual property, such protection is critical to ensure future \ninnovation and prosperity.\n  A letter I received from the Software Publishing Association states \nthat this new trade protection will help American software producers \nretain nearly $7.5 billion annually. Mr. President, this figure \nrepresents an astounding 48 percent of the software market share.\n  Lastly, this agreement will reduce federal subsidies and instill some \ndiscipline in international agriculture trade. For too long, U.S. \nfarmers have fought a losing battle to gain access to European and \nAsian agriculture markets.\n  Prohibitive subsides and tariff barriers have stymied the growth of \nour highly productive agriculture industry. Without a doubt, exports \nare essential to continued market expansion. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture estimates that the Uruguay Round Agreement will increase \nexports by $5 to $14 billion over the next five years.\n  What is more important for future agricultural trade expansion is the \ndiscipline that the agreement applies to countries who might otherwise \nchoose to close markets and subsidize exports. This agreement has \nimportant consequences for our large trading partners that are \ncurrently outside of the GATT such as: China, Taiwan, and the nations \nof the former Soviet Union.\n  This agreement enables countries to use GATT rules to challenge \nunjustified health-related regulations that restrict trade, while \nprotecting every country's right to ensure food safety and animal and \nplant health through policies based on scientific evidence. I am \nconfident that U.S. laws will prevail and set a higher standard for our \ntrading partners to meet. That is why the American Farm Bureau and the \nKentucky Farm Bureau both proudly support GATT.\n  I have heard from a number of organizations who have attempted to \ndeflect the debate away from the importance of free and fair trade to \nother issues. Mr. President, we must not lose sight of what this \nagreement is about. It is about expanding trade and providing access to \nother markets that currently maintain barriers that deter the sale of \nU.S. products. This will ensure our own economy will grow and create \nnew, higher-paying jobs.\n  Mr. President, I am not aware of any respected analysis which \nestimates that this agreement would have an overall negative impact on \nemployment on the economy as a whole. Instead, GATT will reduce world \ntariff rates by 34 percent on average, and entirely eliminate tariffs \nin key exports such as pharmaceuticals, toys, medical equipment and \nheavy industrial machinery.\n  This agreement will cut tariffs world-wide by $744 billion, and the \ncuts borne by the U.S. represents only a small fraction of this total. \nIt is widely accepted by economists that a reduction in trade barriers \nwill stimulate trade.\n  The most recent and telling free trade success was the NAFTA \nagreement implemented at the beginning of this year. NAFTA has sparked \nthe creation of more than 100,000 new jobs this year alone, and \ncontributed to a 21 percent increase in trade with Mexico in the first \nnine months of the agreement. U.S. corporations are selling everything \nfrom apples to X-rays because of NAFTA.\n  NAFTA, though it has proven to be a stunning success, pales in \ncomparison to the GATT which includes over one hundred countries. The \nDepartment of Treasury estimates GATT will contribute to the creation \nof an estimated 500,000 new U.S. jobs and over $100 billion in \nincreased economic activity per year. This economic boost will more \nthan offset the revenue lost in the last five years of this agreement.\n  There are some who claim that this agreement will serve our \nsovereignty up to some higher world government. This is absolutely not \ntrue. The World Trade Organization is a framework for resolving trade \ndisputes. The decision issued by a dispute resolution panel is not \nself-enforcing and can't override U.S. domestic law. Only the U.S. \nCongress can change U.S. law. In fact. Section 102 of the Agreement \nstates that ``no provision of any of the Uruguay Round Agreement, nor \nthe application of any such provision to any person or circumstance, \nthat is inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have \neffect.'' As a Senator, I have sworn to uphold the Constitution and I \nam confident this agreement does not pose any threat to U.S. \nsovereignty.\n  Further, I am hardly alone in that view. The distinguished Judge \nRobert Bork, as well as the highly conservative Heritage Foundation, \nhave both concluded the same thing.\n  This agreement, however, will establish the most effective and \nbinding dispute settlement procedures to ensure compliance and fair \ntrade. These procedures give the U.S. a stronger hand in bringing \nunfair trading nations into arbitration and settlement in a timely \nfashion. More importantly, it eliminates the ability of nations to veto \ntheir penalty for unfair trade practices under the current GATT.\n  If, however, the gloom and doom scenarios of protectionists do come \ntrue, the U.S. has the opportunity to withdraw from this executive \nagreement and continue under the old regime.\n  As the leading free trade nation, the U.S. stands to benefit greatly \nfrom this dispute resolution framework. Instead of looking at the glass \nhalf empty, as many protectionist have, we can be confident that the \nU.S. will have a mechanism for opening various unfairly protected \nmarkets. If a nation is found guilty of unfair trading, the U.S. has \nevery opportunity to take unilateral action to even the playing field. \nObviously, losing a foothold in our market would be a significant \ndeterrent for any nation or industry.\n  Mr. President, I have wrestled with this decision for some time. I am \ndisappointed that President Clinton did not remain committed to the \npassage of this agreement after it was signed early this year. The \n``lame duck'' nature of this special session has fueled the mistrust of \nthe American people. Unfortunately, we are left with zero options. \nWithout the fast-track protection, which expires at the end of this \nyear, this agreement would be decorated like a christmas tree, with \nspecial interests each putting their ornaments on it until it collapses \nfrom the weight. This would harken back to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff bill \nthat led to the most proetectionist and failed trade regime the world \nhas ever seen.\n  Despite receiving the endorsement of Constitutional scholars, \nacademics, trade experts, consumer organizations, farm groups, \nemployees, business and state and local officials, we have had to fend \noff assaults from the opponents of free trade and avowed \nprotectionists. for their own reasons, the opponents have a strong \ndesire to continue under the old system of high tariffs and record U.S. \ntrade deficits.\n  Mr. President, I find it difficult to understand why the opponents of \nthis agreement want to continue to pit U.S. exporters against our \ntrading partners with one hand tied behind our back.\n  I too believe we need to reduce our trade deficit, but the only way \nthat can happen is to expand our markets and sell more abroad. I find \nit incredible that the GATT's opponents believe our trade deficit will \nbe reduced by the defeat of this bill.\n  For the long term benefit of the United States, we must focus on the \nexpansion and protection of our exports, which this agreement ensures. \nThis agreement will tear down longstanding trade barriers and create \nnew markets for U.S. goods. We must not forego this opportunity to \nexpand exports and create new jobs. I urge my colleagues to support a \nwinner, support GATT, and allow America to compete freely and fairly on \na more level playing field of trade.\n  With a new century only six years away, we must not turn the clock \nback now. A great future lies ahead for us, and GATT will help make us \nready for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the remainder of our time to the distinguished \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Madam President, Members of the Senate, the Senate will \nshortly vote on the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade. It is one of the most important votes of this Congress for \nthe future prosperity of our Nation.\n  This trade agreement, if approved, will bring enormous benefits to \nour economy, our businesses, our workers.\n  Expanding international trade has been the engine of American \nprosperity since the end of the Second World War. It has been the focus \nof all of our past international trade policies.\n  Immediately after the war, the United States financed the \nreconstruction of an international order based on stable, prosperous \ndemocracies because we saw that our Nation's security would be best \npreserved in such a world.\n  We succeeded to an unprecedented degree. The Marshall plan rebuilt \nEuropean industry and fired the engines of the so-called German \neconomic miracle.\n  In Japan, the introduction of democratic political institutions went \nhand in hand with the grant of favorable trade access for Japan and \nother devastated nations in the Pacific.\n  During that period, we undertook the defense of the free world in the \ninterests of Western security. While our trading partners rebuilt their \neconomies, we protected them against aggression.\n  But as our trading partners became our trading competitors, they \nbegan to protect not only their favored, relatively free access to our \nmarkets, but they began to protect their own markets against others, \nincluding ourselves.\n  We have not insisted with sufficient vigor that our trading \ncompetitors carry their own defense weight, but we will. We have asked \nthem to open their markets to our goods. The agreement now before us is \na huge step in that direction.\n  Immediately following the Second World War, the American economy \ndominated the world. We had little competition. American production, as \na percentage of the world's economic production, was 37 percent. The \ncrippled economies of postwar Europe and Japan were struggling to get \non their feet. Former colonies in Pacific Asia and South Asia were just \nbeginning the process of economic development.\n  In the intervening 40 years, our economic growth has been solid. So \nhas the growth of our trading partners and our competitors.\n  Former colonies in Asia are growing faster than are the mature \neconomies. The American economy has kept pace, but in such a changed \nworld America's share of a hugely enlarged global economy was bound to \nbe smaller relative to others, as it is.\n  Today, the output of the 260 million people of the United States is \nabout 22 percent of the combined output of the other 5.5 billion people \nin the world.\n  A lower relative share of world production means that we have to \ncompete both for developed and emerging markets throughout the world. \nWe cannot be satisfied any longer with simply selling American products \nin America. This agreement will give us the tools to compete on a more \nlevel playing field, to compete against competition, not against \nartificial trade barriers.\n  The economic miracle of the postwar world is that with the expansion \nof international trade, every participating nation's economy has grown. \nHuman well-being has reached more people at higher levels than ever \nbefore in history. The leading beneficiary of that trend has been the \nUnited States.\n  The future of our economy depends on our ability to respond to the \ndemands of the global marketplace. This agreement will define the \nAmerican role in the global economy and in world affairs well into the \n21st century.\n  With the passage of this agreement, the Senate will affirm the \nleadership role of the United States around the world. Rejection would \nsend a far different signal: That the United States fears the \nchallenges of the post-cold war global economy. Rejection of this \nagreement would be a signal of American weakness.\n  We should not turn our backs on opportunities in new and growing \nmarkets around the world. Our own economic security depends on our \nwillingness and our skill at adapting to a rapidly changing global \neconomy. American companies have adapted to the competitive \ninternational marketplace by increasing productivity through new \nmanufacturing techniques and by streamlining production. The American \nworker is the most productive worker in the world.\n  Let me repeat that for those who fear competition with other nations: \nThe American worker is the most productive worker in the world. But the \nprice of these productivity increases has often been the reduction of a \ncompany's work force.\n  Automation and improved computer technologies have made many jobs \nvanish as silicon chips now perform functions that once were performed \nby human beings.\n  It is no wonder that many working Americans fear the fallout of \neconomic change. They have a right to be wary, for too often in the \npast swift economic change has disrupted the lives of families and \nwhole communities, and too often, our Government has responded slowly, \nbegrudgingly, inadequately.\n  The government which wants to expand trade must recognize that it has \na reciprocal responsibility to the people most at risk from the effects \nof trade expansion.\n  Those who favor the trade agreement, as I do, must acknowledge and \naccept the responsibility to remember that there is more than one step \nin our progress toward a more prosperous nation and world.\n  The first step is opening markets and freeing trade.\n  But the second and equally important step is to make certain that our \npeople do not disproportionately pay the costs that are part of every \nsignificant economic change.\n  We must work together to prepare the U.S. economy for the challenges \nof the 21st century. Our workers must be educated and trained so the \nindustries of the future will invest in this country and create new \njobs here. We must reduce the burden that health care costs place on \nAmerican businesses, which reduce their global competitiveness.\n  Like every one of my colleagues, every single Member of this Senate, \nI have seen first hand the dislocations of families and communities \nthat occur when a production facility is moved offshore, or competition \nfrom lower wage countries gives our consumers a better bargain. The \ndisplaced workers should not be forced to pay the price of change.\n  But we must recognize also the benefits of change and harness them to \nour advantage. In my home State of Maine, companies and their workers \nhave greatly benefited from expanded global trade.\n  In 1993, Maine exported more than $1 billion of merchandise to \nforeign markets, almost 10 percent more than in the previous year. \nMaine's sales to foreign markets grew more than three times the rate of \nthe domestic economy.\n  Our economic future depends on expanding international trade though \nlower tariff and eliminating nontariff barriers. So does the economic \nfuture of every other State in the Nation.\n  The North American Free-Trade Agreement, passed only last November, \nhas already produced tangible economic benefits in Maine.\n  In the first quarter of 1994, Maine's exports to Mexico increased 141 \npercent over the previous first quarter. The agreement before us today \nwill have an even greater positive impact, a much greater positive \nimpact, on economic growth on Maine and the Nation than did the North \nAmerican Free-Trade Agreement.\n  For example, this agreement will eliminate tariffs on paper and paper \nproducts in European and Asian markets. The American paper industry has \nestimated that this tariff elimination alone will produce a $2 billion \nincrease every year in American exports of paper and paper products.\n  The agreement lowers tariffs now levied against other Maine product, \nincluding semiconductors, electronic components, wood and wood \nproducts, blueberries and leather products. When those tariffs are cut, \nMaine-produced goods will be less costly and more attractive to foreign \nbuyers, and Maine's exports will have a chance to grow. That is true \nfor the products of virtually every State in the Nation.\n  In addition to the tariff cuts, the agreement will establish new \nrules to help eliminate foreign import barriers based on unjustified or \nunreasonable local regulations. In the past, to cite one example, \nforeign countries have restricted imports of American potatoes from \nMaine and other States, and fish products through the use of unfair \nsanitary and phytosanitary standards.\n  Under this agreement such standards will have to be based on science. \nSince our regulations are now based on science and others are not, we \ncan only benefit from compelling other nations to adhere to the high \nstandards which we already observe. The agreement will not prevent the \nUnited States or any other nation from adopting more stringent \nstandards but it will curtail their use as tools of protectionism.\n  These are only a few of the benefits that this agreement will produce \nfor the State of Maine and the Nation.\n  Here in the debate and across the country opponents of this agreement \nhave attacked it because it will not immediately produce impeccable \nfairness in every aspect of every trade exchange among an international \ncommunity whose member nations vary enormously in wealth, resources, \nmanpower, and laws.\n  It has been attacked because the agreement itself does not eliminate \nchild labor practices in foreign nations. It has been attacked because \nthe United States currently has a balance of trade deficit, and the \nagreement cannot guarantee that the U.S. trade deficit will be \neliminated in the future.\n  Of course, the reality is that the United States could never reach a \nmultilateral agreement that would by itself solve all of these \nproblems. But this world's nations, with all their differences in \nwealth, resources and laws, are the only trading partners we have.\n  We do not trade with Mars. We do not trade with the Moon. We do not \ntrade with people and countries made in heaven. We trade with the \ncountries which exist on this Earth. And so we must negotiate with them \nas we must trade with them.\n  No agreement of this scope could be perfect. This one is not. It \nleaves open the potential of trade disputes in the future. That \npotential can never be eliminated. Foreign agriculture subsidies were \nnot completely eliminated under this agreement, although they are \nsubstantially reduced. The transition period for imposing the \nintellectual property rules on developing nations is disappointingly \ntoo long. And the concerns of the U.S. audio-visual industry were not \nproperly addressed in the services agreement.\n  But we should not measure this trade agreement against a perfect and \nunrealizable ideal. We must weigh it against the current world trading \nsystem, and the current rules. And by that comparison, this agreement \nis a very good deal for America, and a very great improvement on the \ncurrent system.\n  Mr. President, I want to address that aspect of the debate which has \ngenerated the most misinformation; that is, the role of the World Trade \nOrganization and its impact on the American sovereignty.\n  Let me make it clear and unmistakable. The Uruguay round agreement \nwill not undermine the U.S. sovereignty; will not undermine U.S. \nsovereignty. The power to make and change American law will remain \nwhere it is right now, right here with the U.S. Congress.\n  And section 102 of the implementing legislation plainly states, and I \nquote its exact words: ``No provision of any of the Uruguay round \nagreements, nor the application of any such provision to any person or \ncircumstance, that is inconsistent with any law of the United States \nshall have effect.''\n  No provision, nor its application, that is inconsistent with any law \nof the United States, shall have any effect.\n  That is a direct, unmistakable response to the allegations of a loss \nof sovereignty.\n  Neither the World Trade Organization nor any dispute settlement panel \nwill have any authority to enjoin the enforcement of any United States \nlaw or any State law, or to impose any monetary sanctions against the \nUnited States. The dispute settlement panel will have the power only to \nrecommend that a member nation bring its laws into conformity with its \ninternational obligations.\n  But that does not mean we must change our laws. If a dispute \nsettlement panel rules against us and says that a U.S. law is \ninconsistent with GATT, we may offer to the complaining country \ncompensation, or we may make another agreement.\n  The decision-making rules of the World Trade Organization are \nprotective of American interests. For over 30 years, the GATT has \noperated by consensus--in which any member nation can block action and \nexercise an effective veto. There has not been a GATT wide vote on any \ntrade policy issue since 1959.\n  Article Nine of the Uruguay round agreement specifically codifies \nthis past GATT practice of operating by consensus.\n  If World Trade Organization members attempt to change the Uruguay \nround agreement in the future, the rules provide that certain important \nprovisions, such as the most-favored-nation obligations, decisionmaking \nrules, and the amendment rule, can be changed only--I repeat--only--\nwhen all members of the World Trade Organization agree to the change. \nThat means that if any amendment is against American interests, we can \nblock it.\n  To allay concerns about the World Trade Organization, the President \nhas consulted with Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen, U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Kantor, and Senator Dole. They have reached agreement, \nan agreement which will create an exclusively American commission of \nfive retired judges who will review any adverse decision made by a \nWorld Trade Organization dispute settlement panel. This American \ncommission will determine if such a panel decision is outside the scope \nof the trade agreement or exceeds the panel's authority.\n  If the review commission makes three adverse determinations within 5 \nyears, Congress will have the authority to approve a joint resolution \nfor U.S. withdrawal from the World Trade Organization.\n  The legislation will provide another procedure to withdraw from the \nWorld Trade Organization. There is existing authority in the agreement \nthat allows any nation, including ours, to unilaterally withdraw from \nthe World Trade Organization after giving 6 months' notice. So let us \nput it to rest once and for all. The World Trade Organization will not \nundermine American sovereignty; it will enhance our economic interests.\n  On the budget issue--and that is the first vote we will have--we \nshould not be mistaken about the impact of this agreement. If it is \nimplemented, the agreement will lower, not increase, the Federal budget \ndeficit. The increased economic growth will generate more revenue for \nthe Treasury than it will lose from the tariff reductions.\n  The congressional budget rules are important, but we must now waive \nthose rules in this case because the agreement serves both the national \ninterests and promotes the goal of deficit reduction.\n  The potential dangers of this agreement have been much discussed and, \nin my respectful view, much exaggerated. Meantime, the potential \nbenefits are much more real and realistically based.\n  Over time this agreement will reduce average merchandise tariffs by \nmore than one-third. In the world's developed economies, average \ntariffs would decrease from 6.3 percent to 3.9 percent.\n  These lower tariffs will encourage economic growth in the United \nStates and around the world.\n  Economists estimate that when the agreement is fully implemented, the \nAmerican gross domestic product will increase between $100 billion and \n$200 billion every year. That will produce hundreds of thousands of new \njobs for American workers.\n  My fellow Senators, we have come to the end of a long and vigorous \ndebate. Eight years ago, negotiations on this agreement began. Three \nPresidents negotiated it. Their cumulative efforts reached a successful \nconclusion almost a year ago. The world's trading nations signed the \naccord on April 15 of this year, many months ago.\n  The administration and the Congress jointly drafted the implementing \nlegislation. It was introduced more than 2 months ago. The vote we are \nabout to cast, as we all know, was delayed for 2 months for even more \nhearings.\n  The Senate has fully, exhaustively, carefully, debated and considered \nthis issue. Almost every provision in the agreement and the \nimplementing legislation has been thoroughly examined.\n  On Tuesday, the House of Representatives gave it an overwhelming \nbipartisan endorsement by a vote of 288-146.\n  It is now the Senate's turn to act in the national interest. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote for this agreement. It is in the Nation's best \ninterest, and that must be our sole standard for voting on a measure of \nthis significance. Reasonable men and women in this Chamber can \ndisagree on how to define that interest. For myself, I say the Uruguay \nround trade agreement is good for America. Let us pass it now.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. PACKWOOD.

The Chair \nrequests that all Senators please be in order.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President the vote to approve this treaty was \noverwhelming and bipartisan. On the crucial motion to waive the Budget \nAct, 68 Senators voted in favor, 32 opposed. Of 46 Republican Senators \nvoting, 31 voted in favor, 15 against. That is 67 percent in favor. Of \nthe 54 Democratic Senators voting, 37 voted for, 17 against. That is 69 \npercent in favor; 67 percent of Republicans; 69 percent of Democrats, a \ntotal of 68 percent of the Senate voting in favor.\n  Many persons deserve credit for this result.\n  Mr. President, first I extend my congratulations to those who fought \na vigorous battle in opposition to this agreement here in the Senate on \nhigh principle and with powerful arguments, led by the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and \nall of those. We respectfully reached different conclusions on how to \ndefine the national interest, but we recognize and acknowledge that \nevery single Senator has voted in the national interest as he or she \nsees it.\n  I foremost congratulate the President, who provided crucial \nleadership on this important measure. He followed the path set by \nPresident Reagan and President Bush when they began and continued the \nnegotiations, and President Clinton brought them to a successful \nconclusion last year. He was greatly assisted by the powerful and very \neffective work of the U.S. Ambassador for Trade, Mickey Kantor, a name \nnot well known to most Americans but as a result of whose efforts \nAmericans for generations to come will lead better lives.\n  Here in the Senate, of course, great credit goes to the distinguished \nRepublican leader, Senator Dole, who took an active role in working to \nimprove what he saw as deficiencies in the agreement, and his work \nproduced a better result. And our distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, Senators Moynihan and Packwood who led \nthe debate with eloquence and fairness over these past 2 days. I thank \nthem for their work, and I thank all Senators who saw fit to support \nthe agreement, and I commend those who opposed it on principle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                      PIONEER PREFERENCE PROVISION\n\n\tMr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, for a variety of reasons, I have been very torn about my vote on this implementing legislation for Uruguay round agreement of GATT.\n\tI am in complete agreement, though, with the provision in this agreement that addresses pioneer preferences granted to innovators in personal communications systems technology by the FCC. Administration officials, FCC officials, and company officials came up with a deal that is fair, and that deal should hold regardless of whether this legislation passes. Those who decry this provision as ``elitist'' or worse simply do not understand the history and facts.\n\tIn 1992, the FCC awarded pioneer licenses to three PCS innovators. One of the companies is Omnipoint Communications, Inc., a small entrepreneurial company based in Colorado Springs. At that time, the FCC did not charge anything for any spectrum license. In August 1993, Congress enacted budget legislation requiring the FCC to auction off spectrum licenses. Initially, the FCC excluded the PCS pioneers from this requirement. But in August 1994, 2 years after naming the PCS pioneers, the FCC ruled that the pioneers including Omnipoint would have to pay for their licenses, up to 90 percent of average fees in other large markets.\n\tThe pioneers promptly sued, arguing that the FCC had no authority to retroactively impose such huge fees. Instead of fighting in court and risking complete failure, the FCC crafted an agreement with the House Committee on Energy and Commerce: PCS pioneers would pay fees at a rate of 85 percent of average fees for the 20 next largest markets.\n\tEven though this compromise will cost the PCS pioneers from $500 million to $1 billion in unanticipated fees, they accepted it rather than waste time and resources in court--assuming that this was a done deal and that they could get on with their development work. Now, however, some people are calling this a ``giveaway,'' and some want to revisit the issue next year and attempt to force the PCS companies to fork over even more dollars.\n\tIt seems to me that the PCS companies, awarded pioneer preferences and working constructively with Congress and the FCC, make this agreement in good faith, and it ought to stand. It would be very unfair to retroactively charge these companies more money. Already, the uncertainty over this issue has hurt Omnipoint's ability to attract investors.\n\tBy converting military technology to commercial applications, Omnipoint is now the manufacturer of the only American noncellular PCS radio frequency technology. If PCS is launched soon, Omnipoint is likely to become a leading manufacturer of PCS equipment. This will mean hundreds of jobs in my State. When coupled with spin-offs and export opportunities, it also will mean hundreds of jobs for Americans elsewhere in the country. If the deployment of PCS is delayed, many of these opportunities will be lost to foreign competitors.\n\tWhatever happens with this GATT legislation, I will continue to work to support Omnipoint's efforts and to protect jobs in Colorado.\n\tMr. MATHEWS. Mr. President, in the final hours of this Congress we have an opportunity to keep America on the course of economic growth and trade expansion that have been the hallmarks of the Clinton administration and the high point of bipartisan cooperation in this body. With a single vote, we have the chance to increase jobs and incomes for American families, open closed markets for American goods, and bring American consumers a broader variety of lower priced products. We have the chance to build upon the success of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and to establish the United States as an economy to contend with in a new world order. We should--and must--make these possibilities into realities by voting to affirm the Uruguay accord of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.\n\tMr. President, the prospects from an affirmative vote are overwhelming. Conservative estimates suggest that implementing GATT will create 300,000 to 700,000 American jobs over 10 years. Over that same period, we stand to increase our gross domestic product by upward of 3 percent, an amount equal to somewhere between $32 billion and $50 billion. That translates into an average pay raise of $1,700 a year for American families.\n\tBeyond this, strengthened trade rules under the Uruguay GATT will give American exporters the level playing field they have demanded and deserved for far too long. GATT will implement more effective mechanisms for resolving trade disputes, preserve our ability to prosecute unfair trade practices, augment our ability to combat foreign dumping, and enable us to take more effective action to assure that product standards do not bar imports.\n\tLittle wonder, Mr. President, that support for this agreement has come from businesses large and small, manufacturers and farmers, companies that have long been exporters and companies that long have wanted to be, companies with globally established products, and companies that desperately need recourse against infringements of intellectual property. These people know what is good for their business, and we must listen to them if we are to do what is good for the United States.\n\tI know that there will be winners and losers under this accord. But that is a fact of economic life which we need to face as a fact and deal with realistically. Their experience should teach us that there is no safe haven against change, and we are foolish to deny the spectrum of American business a world of opportunities in their name.\n\tI also find it significant that many of the loudest arguments of resistance to NAFTA have been retreaded for GATT. In the few slim months since we passed NAFTA, the evidence against those arguments has mounted. The disasters they predicted have not materialized. That giant sucking sound we were supposed to hear is nowhere to be heard.\n\tYou sure do not hear it in my native Tennessee. Tennessee sold more than $6 billion in exports last year. Our exports more than doubled between 1987 and 1993. Canada, Mexico, and Japan now are Tennessee's No. 1, 2, and 3 export customers. They purchased nearly $2.5 billion from Tennessee farms and factories in 1993--an increase of 175 percent in sales to those nations over 5 years.\n\tThe only thing that keeps Tennessee companies from selling more goods overseas and creating new jobs at home are foreign barriers to trade--the kind of barriers that GATT removes. Through substantially expanded and enforced trade rules, the Uruguay accord will be positive for Tennessee and for America's Sunbelt.\n\tLast year, Tennessee's top manufacturing sectors ranked by exports were chemical products, transportation equipment, and industrial machinery and computers. That jives with the Sun Belt as a whole, where leading exports are electrical and electronic components, chemical products, and transportation equipment. These are the very industries that will have continued export and jobs growth because tariffs will be reduced or eliminated by whopping percentages in Japan, South Korea, and the European Community.\n\tThat goes for American farmers and farm products, too. American farmers are the most efficient producers on the globe. But what keeps them from being the most financially fertile producers is the kind of foreign production subsidies, export subsidies, and import trade barriers that GATT will reduce--especially in Europe. U.S. agricultural exports stand to gain between $1.6 billion and $4.7 billion in the year 2000 and nearly $9 billion by 2005 as a result of this agreement.\n\tMr. President, we are just beginning to count the winners from this accord, and one of those winners will be our trade deficit. In 6 to 10 years after we pass the Uruguay accord, the Economic Strategy Institute projects an annual improvement of $13.5 billion and 25 billion in our trade deficit, including an increase of $3 billion in annual U.S. exports of services.\n\tAnother winner will be our budget deficit. We all know what we need to do in order to waive the budgetary point of order because of the $11.9 billion in lost revenues that GATT will claim. But is we do it, GATT soon will more than pay for itself by increased economic gains that offset tariff cuts.\n\tYet another winner is American ingenuity and innovation. The International Trade Commission has estimated that foreigners' piracy of U.S. copyrights costs American businesses between $43 billion and $61 billion every year and costs the American economy 750,000 jobs. The Uruguay accord resolves key problems in copyright protection. U.S. software producers, pharmaceutical companies, semiconductor manufacturers, chemical producers, publishers, and entertainment industries will be beneficiaries.\n\tJust as the benefits of action are great, so are the costs of inaction. Fast track authority expires at the end of this year. If we open this measure to amendment, a 6-month delay in implementing GATT could cost the United States $70 billion in lost production, 25,000 jobs, and $200 billion in the Nation's economic well-being. Vice President Gore is right when he says that delay of GATT will mean the death of GATT.\n\tWe must not let that happen. This accord is the culmination of American postwar trade policy, the continuation of efforts we have made with NAFTA and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperative, and the climax of hard efforts by three U.S. administrations. And beyond all these things, GATT is the future. Let us embrace all the possibilities that future brings--face the future without fear, confident that American workers and American businesses can compete and prosper. Let's vote this agreement into law.\n\tMr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the vote before the Senate on the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is more than a indication of how well a Republican Congress and Democrat administration can work together. I imagine that we will continue to have very sharp disagreements on a variety of issues.\n\tBut trade has always been a special case. There has been, since the end of the Second World War, a shared vision regarding our Nation's trade policy. The bipartisan consensus on the benefits of free trade has led to the successful conclusion of seven previous rounds of GATT and a corresponding high level of prosperity both in the United States abroad.\n\tFar from simply signaling the level of collegiality the American people can expect from the new Congress, today's vote will determine whether free trade has a place in both parties' vision for America's future. We will decide with this vote whether to take counsel from our fears or our aspirations; whether we yield to unfounded fears of competition or affirm our confidence in the ability of the American worker.\n\tThe agreement before us is historic in its scope. It builds on previous GATT rounds by cutting tariffs by over one-third and breaching areas formally beyond the reach of international trading rules. It seeks to make transparent the sort of barriers that have been used, in lieu of high tariffs, to keep American products out of foreign markets. Nations will have a greater burden to prove that regulations governing such matters as licensing, inspection procedures, and production methods are purely a matter of domestic politics and not intended to protect national industries.\n\tThe GATT contains the first multilateral agreement to open up trade in services, an increasingly important part of the American economy. The U.S. service sector will have greater market access in the areas of general business services, professional services, information and computer services, health services, and environmental services, among many other areas. Although our Nation remains the largest exporter in terms of goods, and is the world's greatest industrial power, exports in the area of services now add $180 billion to our economy annually. Creating additional opportunities for these businesses is no small accomplishment.\n\tAll together the GATT agreement will add $100 to $200 billion to the U.S. economy annually when fully implemented and 1.4 million new jobs over the next 10 years.\n\tIn the debate on GATT, we have heard the same old arguments from opponents about these numbers: ``They're cooked.'' ``We'll lose more jobs than we produce.'' ``Low wages in foreign countries make it impossible for American companies to compete.''\n\tDuring the NAFTA debate last year, Congress exhaustively considered and rejected these claims. There is no need to go over the counterarguments again. Let's just look at the facts. NAFTA has been in effect for a year. United States exports to Mexico are up 17 percent and growing. Increased trade with Mexico has already produced thousands of new U.S. jobs, and with our exports growing at the current rate, it will produce thousands more.\n\tThe gains from the GATT are goals that three successive administrations, Democrat and Republican, have sought to achieve. The Clinton administration deserves credit for bringing the negotiations to a close, but as was the case with NAFTA, it will take Republicans to put the agreement into law. Unfortunately, we will also put into law provisions in the implementing legislation that could have been more carefully crafted, or are simply unrelated to the GATT.\n\tMany in my State, and I know many across the Nation, continue to be concerned about U.S. sovereignty and the effect that our membership in the World Trade Organization will have on our right to decide our own laws and regulations. The implementing legislation states unequivocally that ``no provision of any of the Uruguay Round Agreements, or the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance, that is inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have effect.''\n\tThe implementing legislation, however, is not clear with regard to the course of action should the WTO demonstrate a pattern of unfair decisions against the United States.\n\tThis is where the Republican leader's initiative to establish a WTO Dispute Settlement Review Commission is important. As a nation that demands our trading partners establish fair trading practices, we should seek no unfair advantage abroad, nor should we seek to keep competitive products out of our markets. However, we should not be in a position where we are forced to comply with the decisions of the WTO which go beyond our commitments under the GATT, or that are reached on other than an objective basis.\n\tIf there is a demonstrated pattern of unfair decisions against the United States, Senator Dole's proposal establishes a mechanism whereby we can withdraw from the agreement--our right to set the terms of our contracts with foreign governments being the ultimate expression of national sovereignty.\n\tIn some provisions, the implementing legislation breaks with the continuity of purpose over three administrations by encompassing issues unrelated to the agreement.\n\tIn the case of patents, this tendency has created a perilous situation for our Nation's inventors--historically one of our greatest resources. The implementing legislation goes beyond any of the commitments made in the Uruguay round to seek changes the administration believes prudent in United States patent laws.\n\tSignatories agreed that patents should run for 20 years. This is a significant achievement for American companies which lose an estimated $15 to $17 billion a year to various forms of piracy. In drafting the implementing legislation, however, the administration has sought to codify a 20-year protection from the date of filing. Because some patents take as long as 10 years--and longer--to be approved, the legislation threatens to weaken U.S. protection of patents. U.S. patents are currently protected for a period of 17 years after they are issued.\n\tSenator Dole also sought to address this issue. He obtained assurances that the White House would not oppose changing the terms of the implementing legislation if Congress reviews the issue and decides to guarantee the current period of 17 years. Many inventors believe this is not quite enough. There is no guarantee either that Congress will decide to change the law next year or even whether they will review it. Despite the serious effort of the Republican leader, we would have been better off had the administration simply waited until next year to address the issue at all.\n\tThere are other areas of the implementing legislation where I believe the administration exceeded the terms of the agreement, or delved into completely unrelated areas, either for the sake of convenience or to garner support. In addition to patents, the implementing legislation contains unnecessary provisions relating to rules of origin on textiles, African economic development and workers' rights.\n\tIn an effort, apparently, to gain the votes of members from textile producing States, the administration changed the rules of origin on imported textiles and apparel to prevent our competitors from spreading the production process out among various countries. Because many textile producers find it costly to produce goods wholly in one country, the provision in the implementing legislation is sure to raise the cost of production and the prices of imports.\n\tAnother provision resembling the sort of deals the President thought necessary to gain congressional approval of NAFTA is the section regarding workers rights. The President is required under section 131 to ``seek the establishment * * * in the WTO of a working party to examine the relationship of internationally recognized worker rights'' to GATT obligations. One cannot help but speculate that this was included in part to appease those disappointed over the administration's failure to win fast-track authority for a new round of trade talks focused on workers' rights.\n\tProvisions such as these put traditional supporters of free trade in a very difficult position. Aware that there are many shortcomings in the legislation, we are forced to support it in order not to jeopardize the overwhelming benefits of free trade. Unless the implementing legislation is intolerably flawed, when it comes to a vote on a historic worldwide reduction in tariffs, we have to weigh the virtues of the agreement itself against our reservations about the implementing legislation.\n\tIn the future, I hope we can avoid loading implementing legislation with deals intended to pad the voting margin. Free trade can, and should, stand on its own. Although the legislation before us today is a far cry from the Christmas tree the NAFTA implementing bill became, the extraneous provisions it does contain take away from the cause of free trade. It is difficult to portray an affirmative vote for the agreement as a vindication of the principles of Adam Smith, when opponents can justly point to provisions in the implementing legislation with no connections to the agreement.\n\tThe revenue measures contained in the implementing legislation create similar complications for the agreement.\n\tIt is a simple matter of common sense that reducing tariffs and other barriers to American products increases exports; greater exports mean greater productivity; and greater productivity means more Federal revenues. In fact, it has been estimated that for every dollar lost because of lower tariff rates, the increased economic activity resulting from the GATT will create $3 in new revenues.\n\tDespite indications that the administration subscribes to this truism, the implementing legislation contains a score of revenue measures, at least one of which has opened the agreement to considerable criticism. It seems to me that if anticipated Federal revenues negate the need to offset a portion of the tariff losses resulting from the GATT, they should negate the need to offset any tariff losses.\n\tLike other unrelated provisions, the revenue measures undermine the case to be made for the agreement. Those of us who are perfectly comfortable advocating free trade find ourselves defending measures that have nothing at all to do with the GATT. The most visible of these extraneous issues has been the deal struck over pioneer preferences. It seems inappropriate that discussions on GATT, an agreement likely to result in an average increase in income of $1,700 per family, would focus on the issue of pioneer preferences. We should have the opportunity to debate of pioneer preferences. We should have the opportunity to debate the issue of pioneer preferences on its own merits. It should not be settled in a manner which jeopardizes the most comprehensive trade agreement in history.\n\tAll of the shortcomings of the implementing legislation aside, I will support passage of the Uruguay round of GATT. The benefits it offers American businesses, workers and consumers are simply too great to forego. That America's advocacy of free trade is critical to our continued prosperity and world leadership should be beyond dispute. It is my sincere hope that free trade will remain at the center of both parties' vision for America, and that we will demonstrate this commitment, as the other House did yesterday, by approving the GATT.\n\tMr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation to overhaul the GATT, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade by implementing the Uruguay round agreements. This legislation is the end of a long road that began in 1986--the result of thousands, quite possibly millions, of hours of negotiations with our trading partners. After 8 years of wrangling over the agreement, I am tempted to agree with the observation of Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore that GATT actually stands for the ``general agreement to talk and talk.'' Fortunately all of that talk led to something that will have concrete benefits for this country and for the world trading system as a whole.\n\tThe agreement reduces import duties with our major trading partners by an average of 40 percent. Since import duties into the United States are already quite low, one of the great benefits of this agreement for the United States is to bring down the tariff and non-tariff barriers that other countries have built, barriers that have made those markets tough for American exporters to enter. And 40 percent is just an average, in many cases, the drop in duties is much more dramatic. For instance, under the Round Agreements the duty on getting paper products into South Korea will go from 10.32 percent to 0 percent; the duty on aerospace items into Japan will go from nearly 5 percent to 0 and the duty on pharmaceuticals to the European Union will go from 5.89 percent to 0.\n\tReducing the cost of exporting U.S. products has particular importance for my home State of Connecticut. The dramatic rise in exports has been one of the few bright spots in my State's economy over the last decade. According to the Department of Commerce, Connecticut's exports totaled over $10 billion in 1993. Those exports translate into jobs and lots of them. Commerce's Hartford District Office says that a conservative estimate of the number of Connecticut jobs linked either directly or indirectly to exports is 176,800.\n\tSmaller exporters are also uniquely poised to benefit from the GATT since the agreement simplifies and standardizes customs procedures. The reduction in paperwork and red tape will let small exporters spend more time making sales to a wider range of customers and less time trying to meet the paperwork requirements of each individual country. This is particularly important in Connecticut where over 95 percent of our exporters have fewer than 500 employees.\n\tThe reduced tariffs under the Uruguay round agreements will also mean lower tariffs for American consumers. This cut in tariffs has been described as one of the largest tax cuts in history. the U.S. Treasury Department has conservatively estimated that the round will cut tariffs worldwide by $744 billion over the next 10 years. Since tariffs are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, consumers can expect to share in lower prices as a result of these tariff reductions.\n\n\tIn the area of intellectual property this agreement is historic; it creates international standards for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights for the first time. A July 18 letter from seven former U.S. Trade Representatives rightly notes that,\n\n       One of our greatest, strengths as a nation is our \n     creativity. Our software, pharmaceuticals, films, and sound \n     recordings are sold around the globe, and export revenues \n     from products that depend on the protection of intellectual \n     property totaled $20 billion in 1992.\n\n\tWhile I believe we should eventually go further in reducing trade losses due to piracy and counterfeiting, I am convinced that the agreement takes a sizable step forward in this area.\n\tAs anyone who has followed this issue knows, a tremendous amount of time and energy has gone into debating the merits and pitfalls of the World Trade Organization [WTO]. I understood and shared some of those concerns about the WTO. But I have now concluded that most of those concerns have been addressed. At present, GATT decisions are made in much the same way that Parent-Teacher Associations and Kiwanis Clubs across this country make their decisions-by consensus. The WTO explicitly continues this practice of consensus. Since the U.S. is the world's largest trader, it is clearly in everyone's best interest to get our consent before any big decisions are made.\n\tThere has been understandable anxiety expressed about the WTO's potential ability to overturn U.S. law. If the WTO had the power to overturn our laws, I would not support the legislation before us today. The decision to adopt, repeal or amend U.S. laws was ours under GATT and remains ours under the WTO. To be sure, the WTO offers more than lip service to GATT's dispute settlement procedures. This was done largely at the insistence of the United States since some of our trading partners had been taking advantage of our open market and taking advantage of us in their markets. As the Chamber of Commerce noted in testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\n       The Chamber has long been concerned with the inefficient \n     workings of both United States and multilateral dispute \n     settlement processes. Far too often, companies with \n     legitimate grievances against foreign trade practices have \n     had to wait years before their cases get resolved--by which \n     time those companies could very well end up out of business.\n\n\tA Chamber survey found that unfair trade cases that went to the GATT took 4.6 years on average to resolve. By streamlining that process, organizations like the Chamber believe the WTO dispute settlement, procedures are significant improvements over the status quo for America's businesses and workers.\n\tEven if a WTO dispute settlement panel finds that a country has not lived up to its Uruguay round commitments, it is up to the countries in dispute to decide how to resolve that dispute. One option that is not available is overturning another country's laws. A defending country might choose to make a change in its law or it may decide to offer some type of compensation to the aggrieved country or the defending country may choose to do nothing. In this case, the aggrieved country may decide to suspend a trade benefit or take retaliatory action, mindful of the fact that the consequences may be severe if they retaliate against a major trading partner. As Secretary Bentsen has observed:\n\n       The dispute settlement system is not only fair, it also \n     plays to our strengths. Due to our enormous domestic market, \n     the United States has far more trade leverage than any other \n     country in the world. The new dispute settlement regime is \n     tailor-made for us to use. Most other countries simply do not \n     have the economic clout to make retaliation against us a \n     credible option.\n\n\tI am grateful that because of concerns that have been raised about the WTO by Senator Dole and others the administration has developed a system which would allow the United States to leave the WTO if the organization consistently rules against the United States. This should bring a tremendous amount of comfort to those who are worried about the potential breadth and depth of the WTO's powers.\n\tAs a former State attorney general, I've also paid particular attention to what impact the World Trade Organization [WTO] would have on State and local laws. After being contacted by the National Association of Attorneys General [NAAG] I in turn asked Ambassador Kantor to respond to concerns that had been raised about how the WTO would impact State and local laws. A July 15 meeting between the U.S. Trade Representative and the NAAG resulted in a July 27 follow-up letter to Ambassador Kantor from the NAAG in which the NAAG expressed satisfaction with USTR's efforts to accommodate their concerns. The implementing package before us today ensures that State governments are alerted to any important developments affecting State laws, allow States and localities to formally participate in the defense of their laws, and makes clear that States may maintain health, safety and environmental standards that are higher than those of other States or the Federal Government. I commend USTR for acting to address the legitimate concerns that were raised by the States.\n\tThe last issue I would like to discuss is the budget waiver. Under Senate rules, we are charged with paying for tariff cuts for 10 years while the House is bound to paying for these for 5 years. Because of various constraints, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee came up with a 5-year package of tariff offsets. I am disappointed that we are not able to vote on a package that meets the 10-year test. However, I will not vote against the budget waiver and thereby prevent this important legislation from coming to the Senate floor. If there is interest in ensuring that the second 5 years of this agreement are paid for by passing a package of spending cuts in the next Congress I will support that effort. During the last Congress I joined with a bipartisan group of Senators in offering a package of $91 billion in spending cuts--elements of the package could pay the tariff cuts in the second 5 years of this agreement if need be.\n\tMr. President, I hope that this chamber will approve this implementing legislation. The agreement stands on its own merits. In addition, I think a strong vote to approve this implementing legislation is the right message to send about the Senate's ability to grow our economy and protect and create jobs for American workers in a bipartisan way. Begun under President Reagan, continued under President Bush and completed under President Clinton, the agreement is proof that administrations from both parties can work together in the best interests of the United States.\n\tMr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I hope that today is the day that our nation's economic reality finally replaces knee-jerk ideology and business as usual in this body. Because if it does not, the loud scream for change that we heard from voters three weeks ago will seem like a quiet autumn breeze when compared with the roar and crash of outrage that surely lies just ahead on the path that we are now headed.\n\tWe are here today to discuss the most important economic decision this body has faced in many decades--and the least painful opportunity that we are likely to face for many years to change our current ruinous economic course.\n\tThe cynicism of the American people is nowhere more justified than with the steady diet of broken promises and misleading information that they are fed concerning the international economic forces that now shape U.S. jobs, incomes, business profitability and government revenues.\n\tFor some time, successive Presidents, many of my Senate colleagues, respected academics and the media have talked exclusively about expanding U.S. exports while they have ignored the far larger growth in U.S. imports. They have spoken of only 40 percent of the trade story. If we took the same blind approach in our budget debates and talked only about the growth of federal revenue--ignoring federal spending and our enormous budget deficits--would we trick the taxpayers into thinking that government finance was in great shape and that more of the same would be a terrific idea? I doubt it.\n\tThe U.S. position in international trade has collapsed since the mid 1970s. Our 1994 merchandise trade deficit (net exports) could reach a world record $160 billion. While some claim that further world trade liberalization would yield a $1 trillion tax cut, the reality since the last (Tokyo) round of trade liberalization in 1979 has been a cumulative U.S. merchandise deficit of $1.2 trillion; well over $1 trillion in all goods and services; and almost $1 trillion in manufacturing alone.\n\tAlthough still very poorly understood by most Americans, and by many members of this body, global market forces and trade are no longer merely esoteric and glamorous marginal aspects of our economy. This year the U.S. will import $550 billion of foreign manufactured goods. That is almost half of total U.S. manufacturing Gross Domestic Product. We now have a net export deficit of over half a billion dollars each day just in manufacturing trade. We have enormous deficits in most high tech products of the future--including semiconductors. This has tremendous effects on every aspect of our economy.\n\tJust this week, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced our trade deficit is reducing real Gross Domestic Product by $120.8 billion per year. That figure is particularly important to today's discussion about the budget waiver. Chronic U.S. trade losses are a constant, enormous drain on federal revenues--amounting to a loss of perhaps $30 billion in fiscal 1994 alone. And yet many GATT proponents want to ignore the tidal wave of imports into the U.S.; ignore our trade deficits; and see only our exports. Wearing self-imposed blinders, they would vote to waive our hard-won budget agreements and insist that these chronic trade losses somehow, magicly, add to federal revenue.\n\tDoes our experience with NAFTA and trade with Mexico support the idea of expanding trade world-wide through a new GATT agreement? Let me say that there has been much hyperbole about US-Mexico trade. The U.S. does continue to have a trade surplus with Mexico and our exports are growing. But U.S. imports from Mexico are growing faster than exports. So the U.S. surplus fell by 72 percent from 1992 to 1993. Since NAFTA went into effect, our surplus has fallen another 51 percent.\n\tSince NAFTA, the U.S. deficit in electronics trade with Mexico has doubled to $1.4 billion in just the first half of 1994, compared with 1993. Despite the export hype from the auto industry, since NAFTA, the U.S. deficit with Mexico in autos and parts worsened in the first six months of 1994 to a deficit of $1.1 billion.\n\tAgain, concerning global trade, while some promise hundreds of thousands of new trade-related U.S. jobs, the reality is no net jobs in internationally traded industries for over twenty years; all of the 44 million net jobs created over the past 20 years have come in non-traded service sectors such as health care, local governments, retail sales and building maintenance. If the U.S. Commerce Department's estimate is correct--that each $1 billion in net exports equals 20,000 high wage jobs--this year's $160 billion deficit alone would eliminate over 3 million such jobs.\n\tIn our flexible labor market, however, the major effect of our chronic deficits is not always to terminate jobs, but to erode income as workers and businesses give up wages and profits to hold on to their jobs and markets. While some promise increased prosperity, the reality is that real U.S. income growth has slowed dramatically from more than 4 percent per year 30 years ago to less than 1 percent today.\n\tThis is a very important point, Mr. President, because it is often claimed that trade provides an enormous benefit to U.S. consumers. As I have indicated, some claim that this current GATT agreement would provide a $1 trillion tax cut. The reality, however, is that only those who are independently wealthy enjoy net benefits, because the purchasing power of workers and their families have been driven down sharply by trade for a generation.\n\tWhile some promise enhanced U.S. world leadership and status with further trade liberalization, the reality is that in order to pay for its massive and chronic trade deficits, the U.S. has plunged from being the world's leading creditor and banker by far to the world's biggest debtor by far. And the once strong U.S. dollar has collapsed in value; it bought 360 Japanese Yen in 1970, 260 in 1985, and less than 100 today.\n\tThis collapse in both wages and the purchasing power of the dollar is pricing more and more Americans out of foreign travel. In 1989, for the first time in the post-World War II period, the U.S. became a net host in world travel. Our services sector shows a trade surplus mostly because of the travel sector--foreign people come to the U.S., but our own citizens can no longer afford to travel abroad.\n\tThe end of the cold war and today's information technologies have given us the same sort of primitive market condition for the global economy that existed for many individual national economies 100 years ago. The current directive for GATT and the World Trade Organization is not some high-minded ``world government'' but a sort of world anti-government. Its mandate is not to seek prosperity for workers, adequate profits for business and a healthy environment for everyone. Instead, its mandate is to assure that nothing interferes with raw market forces, and the mandate will be carried out by a new, secretive world bureaucracy.\n\tI cannot stress enough how extremely naive and dangerous this is. We must not approve these agreements.\n\tThe real issue, of course, is how to cope with a fundamentally new, post-Cold War global economy in which our new information technologies have radically transformed the way national economies work. Until we face the fact that it costs a company $50,000 to $100,000 a year to hire a first-rate softwear engineer in the U.S., but $5,000 to $10,000, to hire the same talent in Bangalor, India or Moscow, we are not facing the real world. And the unhappy consequences of avoiding this real world are increasing every day.\n\tClearly, trade is vital in today's dynamic global economy. Yet this strategy now serves perversely to bring down our personal income, our levels of productivity, and standard of living, to lead our industries off-shore, to cost America millions of jobs, and, in general, to make this nation poorer.\n\tThe proposed Uruguay Round agreements are more of the same trade policies that are already bleeding this nation. They are the wrong kind of trade agreements and ought to be rejected. They ought not be rejected in a close vote, but decisively, because they are agreements that hurt America.\n\tMr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the GATT, or General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, is the regime under which we conduct international trade.\n\tHere in the Senate we now have before us a very lengthy and complicated document referred to as the Uruguay round agreement. This agreement, negotiated over several administrations, will change the GATT significantly, in both good and bad ways.\n\tI supported fast-track authority, and in general support free and fair trade.\n\tI have expressed opposition to the Uruguay round agreement based mainly on the establishment of the World Trade Organization. Also, as a fiscal conservative, I have been strongly opposed to waiving the budget agreement which would allow passage without covering the cost for the full first 10 years of implementation.\n\tIn an effort to get a broad perspective on what Idahoans were thinking about the Uruguay round agreement, I sent out a mailing to business, agriculture and local community leaders. The limited response was mixed, even within the business community.\n\tIn unsolicited mail and phone calls, the overwhelming majority have been opposed to the World Trade Organization specifically and the Uruguay round agreement in general.\n\tGATT is expected to be generally good for agriculture. However, the agreement has both good and bad components depending on the commodity. Unfortunately the agreement is not good for some Idaho commodities such as dairy, wheat, and sugar beets.\n\tThere has been a great deal of talk in the press about Senator Dole's efforts in an attempt to strike a compromise agreement on the WTO language. I commend Senator Dole for his efforts, but I am not satisfied with the results of negotiations with the White House.\n\tThe President was only willing to work on legislation dealing with this problem in the beginning of the next Congress. The administration expressed a willingness to support legislation next year to establish a WTO dispute Settlement Review Commission.\n\tThe Commission would consist of five Federal appellate judges, appointed by the President in consultation with the leadership of both houses and the chairman and ranking members of the Ways and Means, and Finance Committees.\n\tThe Commission would then review all the final WTO dispute settlement reports adverse to the United States to determine whether the panel exceeded its authority or acted outside the scope of the agreement.\n\tIn addition, Mr. President, should the Commission issue an affirmative determination a member from either the Senate or the House of Representatives could introduce a joint resolution for the President to have new dispute settlement rules negotiated, to address the problems identified by the Commission.\n\tThe agreement allows for withdrawal from the WTO if their are three affirmative determinations within a 5-year period. However, it requires an act of Congress and Presidential approval.\n   While the agreement is filled with good intentions, I am not confident that it provides the necessary safety-net to uphold U.S. sovereignty. The problem with this sort of arrangement is that the WTO dispute settlement panel may stay within the scope of authority in the agreement, but still pose a problem or threat to our sovereignty.\n\tIn other words, the problem lies within the parameters that have been set in the GATT agreement. Therefore, the issue of sovereignty remains unresolved.\n\tI have a number of concerns about a provision in the Uruguay round agreement which would establish a new international entity, referred to as the World Trade Organization [WTO].\n\tThe World Trade Organization is not a minor change to the structure of the GATT. It creates an entity that is, to me, more than an international organization. Rather, it is a regime with powers stronger than those of the United Nations.\n\tThere is a fundamental problem with the WTO. It was created as a supranational structure that would strengthen the enforcement of trade disputes under the jurisdiction of the GATT. There have been previous attempts to establish a supranational body to cover trade relations and dispute settlements.\n\n\tMr. President, after World War II, representatives from the United States and Great Britain designed a post-war economic system with three pillars: the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the International Trade Organization [ITO].\n\tThe ITO was intended to be the administrating body covering the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]. As I mentioned earlier, Mr. President, the U.S. Congress rejected the ITO as a threat to U.S. sovereignty.\n\tThe congress took that action despite warnings from the political insiders that failure to join would impede economic recovery. Our predecessors realized that the United States and our trading partners did not need a bureaucracy to free trade.\n\tThe fear of granting broad authority over our trade rules to a mostly foreign entity led to the repeated rejection by the Senate of ``The International Trade Organization'' between 1947 and 1950 and a similar body known as ``The Organization for Trade Cooperation'' in 1955.\n\tThe WTO must be dropped or dramatically reformed so that there is no question about our sovereignty as a nation, and the sovereignty of state governments.\n\tMr. President, when forming the United Nations, special care was taken to ensure that the United States would have both veto power and a permanent seat on the security council. However, it is apparent that no such effort has been made with regard to the WTO.\n\tIn the WTO, the United States could be outvoted by a small coalition of nations, regardless of the overall size of their populations, their geographic sizes, their contribution to world trade, their funding contribution to the WTO, or their commitment to fair trade and democracy.\n\tThe WTO would initially consist of a diverse coalition of 117 nations. Each member nation of the WTO, including the United States, would have one vote in resolving trade disputes under the auspices of the two agreements--GATT and GATS.\n\tThe World Trade Organization would vote on amendments and interpretation of GATT provisions.\n\tAgain, Mr. President, the United States would be only one in 117 votes. Therefore, we could easily be outvoted by third world countries in the WTO, as often happens in the United Nations. Another point of frustration is that we will be paying 20 percent of the WTO budget with a voice behind only one vote.\n\tUnder the GATT as it currently exists, the United States has veto power and can block a panel decision by denying the necessary consensus to adopt a panel decision.\n\tConsensus is also replaced in the WTO with the following guidelines: A two-thirds vote to amend the WTO; a three-fourths vote to impose an amendment on parties and to adopt an interpretation of WTO provisions. Under the interstate and foreign commerce clauses of the Constitution, States cannot discriminate against foreign businesses, including the application of State tax law.\n\tTherefore, under the GATT currently, the failure of a State to comply with these provisions results in a United States court action allowing the parties to receive fair and open redress of their complaints.\n\tThe dispute settlement mechanism included in the Uruguay round agreement, on the other hand, would require such matters involving State tax policy and foreign businesses to be brought before the WTO.\n\tIt is my understanding, Mr. President, that a WTO dispute settlement panel can meet in secret and need not consider U.S. constitutional standards, nor follow the constraints of U.S. jurisprudence. This is a serious concern that needs clarification.\n\tIt is also my understanding that no individual U.S. State government is guaranteed representation on a WTO dispute panel. And, the United States cannot reject a WTO dispute panel mandate without facing foreign retaliation and trade penalties enforced by the WTO.\n\tThis may be a ``worst case'' scenario, but if it is a scenario that could occur under the WTO, then that provision in the Uruguay round agreement must be changed.\n\n\tMr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss efforts to resolve the problems with the Uruguay round agreement and the WTO language.\n\tEarlier this year, Senator Thurmond offered an amendment which would have been a nonbinding resolution, stating the sense of the Senate that a joint Senate-administration commission should be convened to perform a 90 day blue ribbon panel report on whether the WTO should be considered as a treaty rather than an executive agreement.\n\tIt also requested further hearings both in Washington, DC, and in the field, so that the ramifications of the WTO could be fully examined and understood.\n\tMr. President, let me be clear, this amendment did not make the GATT Agreement ``DOA'' [dead on arrival]. It simply reflected the importance of the agreement and the need to understand fully the development of a new international organization prior to our country's acceptance.\n\tIn short, it would have provided the kind of real solution I was looking for to ensure U.S. sovereignty.\n\tIn addition to the amendment, I joined Senator Thurmond in sending a letter to Senator Dole requesting the following:\n  1. Mandate that the bill be fully funded.\n  2. Extend, for 1 year only, fast track authority, restricted solely to allow the introduction of new Uruguay round implementing language.\n  3. Include in the extension of fast track, requirements that the agreement establishing the WTO be considered as a treaty requiring a two-thirds approval in the Senate. The trade provisions of the Uruguay round would need only a simple majority in both Houses for passage.\n  4. Remove the special interest provisions such as the $2 billion discount of Federal licensing fees to three communications companies.\n\tThe intent of the letter was to allow ourselves the time necessary to resolve problems surrounding the WTO with a view to removing barriers from passage of the tariff reductions and other, positive components of the Uruguay round agreement. Unfortunately, Senator Dole was not able to accomplish these four goals in his discussions with the White House.\n\tBefore concluding, Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment to add that I will be voting against waiving the Budget Act. The bill violates the fiscal year 1994 budget resolution agreement and will be adding $31 billion to our budget deficit.\n\tAs a fiscal conservative and long-term supporter of the balanced budget amendment, I cannot support the circumvention of deficit reduction plans.\n\tMr. President, any potential loss of U.S. sovereignty is not worth risking. World trade has progressed well under the current GATT system that is voluntary and requires unanimous consent for decisions. International trade has grown dramatically since the beginning of the GATT in 1948--the value of world trade has increased from about $60 billion to more than $3.7 trillion. The volume of world trade has increased about sevenfold.\n\tTrade in Idaho has tripled from $752 million in 1987 to $1.9 billion last year. The increase for this year is anticipated to top $2 billion.\n\tI do not argue against the value of international trade. It is evident in the growth of Idaho's economy. However, I will argue that the WTO is not necessary for this trend to continue.\n\tAfter all, this growth has occurred under the current GATT rules, without the WTO. I urge my colleagues to vote against the budget waiver and against the GATT agreement.\n\tMr. SIMON. Mr. President, I have decided to vote for ratification of the Uruguay Round of GATT and the budget waiver necessary under Senate financing rules.\n\tIn some areas, such as worker rights and environmental protection, the agreement fell short of the high ideals that the United States has historically championed. These issues, in particular, concerned me as I considered this wide-ranging document. I now will look to the administration to pursue further multilateral agreements to achieve the same parity in these areas that the Uruguay round brings to goods and services.\n\tIn the end, however, the agreement is about trade, and about our ability to compete in the world. As a leading export State, Illinois is a strong competitor and will be one of the first to gain from this agreement in new jobs and economic growth in our agricultural, industrial and services trade. We will see similar benefits as a nation from the leadership we are showing through this agreement.\n\tThere will be costs, and I do not vote to waive our tough budget rules lightly. I am concerned that this not be taken as precedent for widespread use of dynamic scoring. But we must be practical and realize the economic benefits that will result in the long term from this agreement.\n\tThe Uruguay round takes a further step toward a truly level playing field for American products in the world. I do not see the WTO as a threat to our sovereignty but as the common forum for global trade issues. If we are to set our own destiny we must remain engaged with the economies of the world, leading not by the bullying force of protectionism and veto power but by the strength of our workforce.\n\tThe more open global marketplace of the Uruguay round will continue to place a premium on worker skills and productivity. I hope that the passage of the Uruguay round will refocus our efforts to improve our Nation's educational systems to ensure that our workers remain the most productive in the world.\n\tMr. GLENN. Mr. President, I will support the legislation to implement the Uruguay round GATT agreement and hope that the full Senate will pass this measure by a substantial and bipartisan majority.\n\tThe United States is the world's largest exporter; we have the most productive workforce; and we have recently regained the distinction of the world's most competitive economy. Exports have been critical to the rebound in our economy, accounting for one half of U.S. economic growth over the past 5 years. Further, as has been stated repeatedly, we are already the world's most open market. Hence, competitive goods produced in this country, and those who produce them, have much to gain from the market-opening, tariff-reducing provisions of the new GATT agreement.\n\tLike it or not, we are operating in a truly global economic environment from which we could not, and should not, withdraw. In 1965 exports accounted for approximately 5 percent of U.S. GDP; they have now risen to almost 12 percent. We cannot afford to ignore the substantial contribution of exports to our economic well being. I have often said that if we did not have GATT to set the parameters for trade among nations, we would have to invent it, or something close to it.\n\tI am not sure that this GATT is worthy of all the superlatives being attributed to it. However, it is a solid and substantial step forward toward the long standing U.S. goal of freer and fairer world trade--a goal we have pursued since the origin of GATT in the aftermath of World War II.\n\tMy State of Ohio has a substantial and growing stake in the export market. We are the sixth largest exporting State. Our exports have grown rapidly in the last several years, from $6.5 billion in 1987 to $19.4 billion last year. One of every seven to eight jobs in Ohio's manufacturing sector currently produces for the export market.\n\tIn this negotiating round, spanning three administrations, Republican and Democratic, the United States made substantial progress toward realization of most of our major objectives. The new GATT mandates a reduction of worldwide tariffs by about one-third. That's a worldwide total of nearly $750 billion of tariffs eliminated, of which the U.S. share is $32 billion.\n\tIn addition to the reduction of tariffs--traditional barriers to trade which earlier GATT agreements primarily focused on--the new GATT makes significant progress in addressing another important U.S. concern--non-tariff trade barriers. For example, the new agreement requires all GATT parties to give greater protection to intellectual property rights. Lax or nonexistent protection for such intellectual property rights has proved a very effective non-tariff barrier to research-and creativity-sensitive industries such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, software and recorded entertainment, costing U.S. companies billions of dollars a year.\n\n\tThe new GATT agreement more fully incorporates into the GATT system major new sectors of world trade not previously covered or not fully covered; for example services, textile products, and agriculture.\n\tIn agriculture, the new GATT agreement requires non-tariff trade barriers, like quotas, to be converted to tariffs and then reduced. Further reductions in tariffs on agricultural goods in the future will be made easier by the requirement to quantify these non-tariff barriers.\n\tThe reduction of agricultural trade barriers in this GATT agreement is expected to result in increased agricultural exports by $5 to $14 billion over the next 5 years. U.S. farmers are the most productive in the world, already producing substantially more than we can consume at home. Presently, exports take about one-third of U.S. agricultural production. For U.S. agriculture to prosper, it must aggressively pursue markets abroad. This GATT provides an important tool to support that effort.\n\tThe agreement brings all parties, developing and developed, into the GATT system, with all the obligations and responsibilities that membership entails. Previously, developing countries had been free to opt out of certain GATT obligations.\n\tMany critics of the new agreement have focused on the new World Trade Organization and its alleged ability to overturn U.S. laws. Let me reiterate, as clearly as I can, what has been repeatedly stated throughout the debate on this question--the Congress, and only the Congress, makes the laws of this country. A dispute resolution panel of the new WTO could rule that a U.S. law is contrary to our obligations under the GATT, but there is nothing self-enforcing about such a ruling. Any decision to amend that law to conform to GATT would have to be a U.S. initiative approved by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President.\n\tIn addition it has been suggested that somehow the provisions for decisionmaking and voting within the WTO create a tyranny of a majority who oppose U.S. interests. Let us examine the facts. The WTO agreement provides that the current GATT practice of decisionmaking by consensus will ordinarily be followed. This process of consensus decisionmaking is so well established within the current GATT that, it is my understanding there has never been a formal vote taken in GATT since the system was established after World War II. If consensus fails, then a matter may be decided by a majority of votes.\n\tHowever, major issues such as waivers of agreement obligations and interpretations of most agreements will require a super majority of three fourths. Amendments to agreements will require a two thirds majority, with those affecting basic rights and obligations of Members to take effect only for those Members that have accepted them. Further, amendments to certain cornerstone GATT obligations will take effect only if all WTO Members accept them.\n\tI do not expect that the WTO will become a vehicle for attacking U.S. trade and economic interests. Indeed, I fear a more reasonable prediction is that an international organization with over 100 members which operates by consensus will be greatly challenged to do anything at all. Nevertheless, if experience proves contrary to my expectation, the United States should not hesitate to exercise its right under the agreement to withdraw, with 6 months notice.\n\tAs chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, I would like to say a word about subtitle E, which makes necessary changes in U.S. law in order to implement agreements reached by the member nations of the GATT Government Procurement Code. The primary objective of the GATT Procurement Code is to ensure the establishment of Government procurement systems based on the principles of transparency, openness, and fairness.\n\tHighlights of the revised code include a threshold of $182,000 for waiver of buy national requirements for central Government purchases. U.S. minority and small business setasides would not be affected, nor would procurements necessary for national security. Government construction contracts, with a $7 million threshold, and services will be covered for the first time.\n\tIn addition the GATT implementation bill would extend the U.S. procedure for responding to unfair Government procurement practices to cover failure to adequately enforce antibribery and corruption laws in the awarding of Government contracts.\n\tThe agreement will not impede the use of new information management and other technologies to improve the efficiency of Government procurement systems and is consistent with recently passed Government procurement reform legislation.\n\tIs this agreement everything we could have wanted? No, it is not. Is there additional work to do? Yes, there is. Is this agreement a panacea for our economic problems? No, it isn't. Can we afford to be complacent about our productivity and competitiveness? No, we certainly cannot. However, on balance, I believe that this new GATT agreement makes a significant and positive contribution to furthering a freer and fairer system of world trade. I am convinced that it will be good for the U.S. economy--for producers and consumers alike. And I am confident that in such a freer and fairer international trading environment, American industry and American workers will prove very competitive.\n\tMr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the GATT enabling legislation. The economic benefits of this Agreement are, by now, familiar to everyone in this chamber. The GATT Agreement is projected by experts to: Increase U.S. national income by an additional $100-200 billion a year, and increase global income by as much as $5 trillion by 2005; reduce global tariffs by an average of one-third, producing a global tax cut of $750 billion over the next ten years, the largest in history; expand free trade rules to areas not previously covered by GATT, such as agriculture and services; and protect intellectual property rights through creation of the Agreement on Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs).\n\tThe result of these changes will be the creation of between 300,000 and 700,000 new American jobs and an additional $1,700 in income for a family of four by the year 2004.\n\tBeyond the new opportunities GATT offers, its passage is vital to ongoing American global leadership. The GATT signals our continued commitment to free trade and competition, and to the conviction that consumers--not governments--make the wisest economic decisions.\n\tThe Uruguay round is the seventh extension of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and it represents the culmination of 8 years begun during the Reagan Administration, continued throughout the Bush Administration, and concluded by the Clinton Administration. The United States was a founding member of the GATT in 1947, and we have been steadfast proponents of economic development through the reduction and ultimate elimination of trade barriers. The U.S. has been instrumental in reducing global tariffs from almost 60 percent at the conclusion of World War II to under 4 percent when the Uruguay round is fully implemented.\n\tThis strategy has worked well for America and the world. In 1987 constant dollars, U.S. Gross Domestic Product has quadrupled from $1.3 billion to $4.3 billion since the creation of GATT. The increase in trade during this same period represents a significant portion of this growth. Although we are no longer alone at the top, the United States remains the largest and most powerful economy in the world, and this agreement will help raise living standards in our country and around the world.\n\tMr. President, individuals fare best when they are allowed to do what they do best. Economists call this concept ``comparative advantage,'' and it applies to nations as well as individuals. Because American workers are the most productive in the world, the GATT Agreement presents an unprecedented opportunity to utilize our advantages to export more goods and services overseas. Since the United States already has among the lowest tariffs in the world, the GATT's reduction of foreign tariff and non-tariff barriers can be expected to benefit American exports.\n\n\tI believe GATT will prove to be beneficial for Georgians. For example, the forest products industry in Georgia is a $13.2 billion business, the largest in the State. The GATT Agreement includes the ``zero-for-zero'' agreement on wood and paper products. Paper products are already Georgia's leading export to Mexico and the second leading export to the rest of the world. As the forest products industry continues moving South, I expect that its exports will be a critical component in the region's continued economic growth.\n\tMr. President, Georgians are also proud of our poultry industry. Last year, poultry income in Georgia reached $1.73 billion, exceeding, for the first time, all other crop income combined. Poultry is one of the best and least expensive protein sources in the world, and nobody produces it more efficiently than Georgians. Under GATT, poultry exports are projected to increase 32 percent by 2005. The developing countries of Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, and Africa are hungry, and we want to help feed them. The GATT will help those economies grow, and will assure that as they do, their consumers have the opportunity to buy Georgia poultry.\n\tMr. President, the textile and apparel industry is Georgia's largest manufacturing sector and accounts for almost one-fifth of manufacturing employment in the State. I understand the industry is divided on GATT, but I would note that in Georgia, almost one-half of the industry is comprised of carpet manufacturers and suppliers, which is already benefiting from brisk overseas sales. According to the Department of Commerce, exports from the 307 ZIP code, which encompasses Georgia's ``Carpet Crescent,'' grew 426 percent between 1987 and 1993, from $75.102 million to $395.37 million. So the carpet industry is clearly already benefiting from international markets. As for the rest of the textile industry, I note that the leadership of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute has endorsed the Agreement, and is especially pleased that the Breaux-Cardin rules-of-origin requirement was retained in the implementing legislation.\n\tGeorgia is also a leader in the production of industrial machinery, chemical products, transportation and electric equipment. These four industries accounted for more than $1.27 billion in Georgia's 1993 export sales in 1993, more than one-fifth of total exports. The same four industries grew an average of 143.65 percent between 1987 and 1993.\n\tI have mentioned just a few Georgia industries by way of example, so let me address generally for a moment the importance of exports to Georgia. In 1993, Georgia shipped $6.05 billion worth of goods to the rest of the world. That's at 148.8 percent increase over 1987. Mr. President, jobs supported by merchandise exports pay above average wages (17 percent above average in 1990). The growth in these exports provided new jobs for Georgians and an increasing standard of living. GATT promises more of the same.\n\n\tSome of my constituents have said to me, ``How can we possibly compete with or sell to a country with $1 an hour wages?'' That's a fair question, but it assumes that labor is the only component that matters in trade. This is, of course, untrue. Transportation, energy, education, and investment--in a word, productivity, all play a vital role in manufacturing, and the United States offers the best total package. That's why BMW and Mercedes Benz will soon begin manufacturing automobiles in South Carolina and Alabama, and why YKK, Matsushita and other foreign manufacturers have made Georgia seventh in the nation in direct foreign investment, with 10 new manufacturing plants.\n\tAs a practical matter, Mr. President, we have no choice but to trade with the rest of the world. The United States represents four percent of the world's population and 22 percent of the world's economy. But the United States, Western Europe and Japan are mature economies and their growth potential is limited. If we close the door to the fast-growing developing world, we are resigning ourselves to a declining standard of living; and if we don't capitalize on opportunities in the developing world, someone else will. But we cannot have it both ways. We cannot demand that other countries open the door to the U.S. while we shut the door on them.\n\tMr. President, a final word about the World Trade Organization (WTO). I know some of my constituents are concerned about the implications of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Board on U.S. sovereignty. I have studied this issue closely, and based on my review, I do not believe it will infringe on our sovereignty. The WTO cannot change U.S. law; only Congress can. In any event, the ultimate recourse in any GATT dispute is for the United States is to withdraw from GATT. I would certainly support exercising that option if I though the GATT infringed upon our sovereignty. I believe this Agreement protects U.S. interests while increasing economic opportunities at home and abroad.\n\tMr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the GATT implementing legislation. This is not perfect legislation or a perfect trade agreement. But we are not here today to vote on a perfect trade agreement. We are here to decide whether Wisconsin and the United States will be part of the world economic market.\n\tBoth proponents and opponents of GATT are trying to answer that question using the same criteria. What vote will lead to more jobs, more economic prosperity and a better standard of living for the most Americans?\n\tFor the people in my home State of Wisconsin, GATT and entrance into a more open world market is the answer. We can try to preserve our current standard of living by shutting out the rest of the world--and that might work to preserve a few jobs in a few industries for a short period of time. Or we can try to improve our future standard of living by using the GATT to enter new world markets--and that gives us an opportunity to create new jobs in many industries for the foreseeable future. Choosing GATT is choosing the chance for a richer, better future for our children.\n\tThe U.S. economy is increasingly dependant on the international economy. In 1992, according to the Department of Commerce, over 7 million workers in the U.S. owed their jobs to merchandise exports and an additional 3.5 million U.S. workers owed their jobs to U.S. service exports. In 1993 in Wisconsin, exports totaled $5.8 billion, almost double the level of exports in 1987. The days are gone in which the rest of the world needed our business more than we needed theirs. Trade is responsible for millions of current U.S. jobs and thousands of Wisconsin jobs. It has created millions of U.S. jobs and thousands of Wisconsin jobs. And expanding trade will create millions more.\n\tThe reductions in tariffs and trade barriers will stimulate economic growth and enhance export opportunities for American business. One study by the Economic Strategy Institute concludes that the agreement would increase annual U.S. income between $100 billion and $200 billion over ten years. It is also estimated that this agreement will generate from 300,000 to 700,000 new jobs by 2004. American consumers will benefit from lower prices and increased competition, which will lead to higher quality, competitively-priced goods and services. Wisconsin's leading manufactured exports include industrial machinery, scientific and measuring instruments, and electric and electronic equipment. These three industries together accounted for nearly 60 percent of the state's total exports in 1993. Under this agreement, tariffs on these products will be reduced by over 50 percent.\n\tFor all of these reasons, I believe moving toward free trade and U.S. participation in the world market is the best choice, and that is why I support GATT. But that does not mean I believe GATT is perfect. There are some provisions of this massive agreement with which I take issue.\n\tFirst of all, passing GATT requires waiving the Budget Act--something I do not take lightly. The lower tariffs in GATT will lead to a loss of tariff revenue for the United States of $10 billion over the next five years and $26.6 billion over the next ten years. When GATT was first released, I and several other Senators wrote to the President asking him to develop implementing legislation that fully offset these revenue losses. The Administration did subsequently develop a financing package that is included in the implementing legislation before us. It reduces the revenue loss to $1.7 billion in the first five years and $12 billion over ten years.\n\tI would have preferred a full offset; I believe that is the more responsible course. But I also believe that GATT will generate new economic activity that will offset the revenue losses many times over. It is proper that we do not count such revenue in our budget figures because it is based on assumptions about economic growth that are not 100 percent certain. However, it is also proper that we waive the budget rules to pass legislation that almost certainly will lead to a healthier economy and a stronger government balance sheet. As Senator Domenici pointed out earlier today, we allow our budget rules to be waived by vote of the Senate exactly because there are some measures--like GATT--that have positive economic and budgetary effects which are not reflected by our current, conservative accounting.\n\tSecond, I have heard from some who are concerned about the effect this agreement will have on the dairy industry, one of the largest industries in my state. However, it must be noted that, in general, GATT is good for agriculture. U.S. farmers can expect to gain new export markets for products from feed grains to meat products to fruits to vegetables.\n\tHowever, it is no secret that dairy farmers are unhappy with this Agreement. They are correct that U.S. negotiators did not place a high enough priority on gaining new markets for U.S. dairy products. And the mixed signals sent from U.S. dairy representatives in Geneva during the GATT negotiations made it difficult for negotiators to set a clear objective for dairy trade.\n\tThe question is, however, what do you do with that information? Oppose the Agreement and all of its other benefits or attempt to bring about appropriate changes in the GATT for dairy farmers. I have chosen the latter course. I have worked with the Administration and our trading partners to do everything possible to make this Agreement better for the dairy farmers of this nation.\n\tOne of the biggest concerns of dairy farmers about this GATT Agreement has been the large increases in cheddar cheese imports from New Zealand and Australia. Since cheddar cheese acts as a commodity cheese in this nation, increased imports of cheddar cheese have a direct effect on milk prices paid to U.S. farmers. And milk prices are already too low.\n\tTo soften the blow to U.S. dairy farmers, several of my colleagues and I were able to work with Australia to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement to adjust the type of cheese entering U.S. markets from that nation. As a result of these efforts, Australia has agreed to swap half of their cheddar cheese allocation for an equal allocation of specialty cheeses, which do not directly effect milk prices.\n\tAnother priority for U.S. dairy trade has been access to the Canadian market. While Canada has agreed to remove their import quotas on dairy products imports, they have replaced them with high tariffs, in direct conflict with the NAFTA and U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Although this matter is still unresolved, Ambassador Kantor has assured me that he will continue negotiation with Canada on this matter, and bring formal NAFTA dispute action against Canada if necessary.\n\tAnd finally, I have listened with concern to those who have argued that the World Trade Organization established by this Agreement will lead to weakening of the environmental laws of the United States. Clearly, that would be counter to the purpose of GATT, which is to further unite trading partners through reduced economic barriers. I view a general trend of increased environmental standards worldwide to be an appropriate corollary to the increased economic trade envisioned by this GATT Agreement. As a nation's standard of living increases, so also does that nation's ability to devote resources to environmental goals.\n\tContrary to some accounts, the World Trade Organization has no sovereignty over U.S. environmental laws. The WTO does, however, have the authority to declare U.S. environmental laws GATT illegal, but only if they are not scientifically based. If, as some suggest, the WTO consistently rejects U.S. environmental laws as GATT illegal, the United States retains the full right to withdraw from that body. But for the United States to reject this GATT Agreement, would be to discard our ability to be a force for environmental change worldwide. It is my hope that the United States will be able to join with European nations in using the power of the WTO to persuade other nations to adopt more environmentally progressive laws.\n\tDespite these reservations, I believe that the legislation before us today is exactly the type of legislation we should hope to pass in the 104th Congress--bipartisan, practical, good for the nation as a whole. Yes, it is full of compromises. Yes, I would have drafted some parts differently. But, overall, GATT moves Wisconsin this nation into the world market, into opportunities for a better standard of living, into a prosperous and healthy future. It does so because it is not a political document--it is a practical attempt to provide the most hope and opportunity for the most Americans. That is good legislation. And that is legislation worthy of our support.\n\tMr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. A year ago, there was extensive debate in Congress and the Nation over whether the United States should enter into the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, our two closest neighbors to the North and South. Today, the Senate will vote on whether to enact legislation implementing a much more far-reaching effort to reduce barriers to trade among more than a hundred nations throughout the world.\n\tAs with NAFTA last year, GATT has provoked strong feelings on both sides of the issue, especially with respect to its impact on the workforce. In Massachusetts, I held a hearing and heard from a number of witnesses who are deeply concerned that the long-term consequences of GATT will be further pain and dislocation for working men and women who have already been hard hit by the massive structural changes that have transformed our economy over the last two decades.\n\tThere is one fundamental principle we can all agree on. The success of our trade policies must be measured by the degree to which they improve the living standards of the people and advance the well-being of our society.\n\tIt is clear that many families have yet to experience the sense of enhanced economic security that should come with an expanding economy. Despite significant progress in the last 2 years in making up the ground lost to the recession, reducing unemployment, creating new jobs, holding inflation down and cutting the Federal deficit, there continues to be a pervasive sense of unease among large numbers of working families.\n\tMany of them have been affected by the dislocations accompanying this period of economic change--if not directly, then through the experiences of relatives, neighbors, or friends. The prospect of expanded trade and increased international competition in these difficult times often means greater anxiety among these families for their own jobs and for their families' futures.\n\tOne answer to this increasing global competition is more investment in technology, infrastructure, and education and training. America must not engage in a ``race to the bottom,'' where we are obliged to lower our living standards to those of Third World nations. Instead, we must compete on productivity, and that means investment, public and private.\n\tI hope that many of my colleagues will be mindful of these needs. It isn't enough just to expand trade. We must provide necessary investments, while keeping our fiscal house in order. We must do more to alleviate the fears that many working men and women now have, and that have made passage of this agreement so controversial.\n\tIn recent years, we have been working hard in Massachusetts to overcome the effects of the recession and to create new jobs and better jobs for our workers. We have made substantial progress, especially in areas such as telecommunications equipment, software, biotechnology, construction, and other industries. Our primary goal is the retention and creation of good jobs and good wages.\n\tIn Massachusetts, we are fortunate to have a number of industrial sectors that will continue to grow and expand, as long as we continue to focus on their needs, and invest in them. We must provide an educated and skilled work-force, a quality living environment, and the infrastructure necessary to keep our State economy strong. To do so, we must maintain the competitive advantage that has made our State a place where we can create good jobs for our workers.\n\tI have supported the administration's efforts to negotiate GATT, because I believe our economic strength depends on expanded trade. In Massachusetts alone, exports increased almost 50 percent during the depth of the recent recession. While many industrial sectors across the State and country were downsizing, those that were able to take advantage of export opportunities created 60,000 new jobs and more than $3 billion in new economic activity.\n\tGATT will help many sectors of the economy to grow even more rapidly. Its broad provisions reducing tariff and nontariff barriers for large numbers of products will open foreign markets at long last to countless U.S. enterprises. Barriers that have long denied U.S. access to markets in Europe, Asia, and other parts of the world will be removed.\n\n\tThe machine tool industry, which was founded in New England and has recently begun to rebound, will have improved access to new world markets. Our medical equipment, computer, and telecommunications industries will be better able to compete in international markets.\n\tGATT also increases the protections for intellectual property and helps to combat intellectual piracy, a significant issue for high-technology industries like computer software. More open access to foreign government procurement contracts will allow U.S. industries to compete for new business across the globe.\n\tOur financial services sector did not gain the export opportunities that we had hoped for, but the foundation for future negotiations has been laid.\n\tOverall, expanded world trade will help the economies of Massachusetts and America. But no one disputes that there will be losers. The textile and apparel industry, for example, will be faced with the phase out of the Multi-Fiber Agreement, which sets the quotas that have allowed the industry to remain competitive over the years.\n\tWe should provide effective assistance to such industries, helping them to use more productive technologies and have a well-trained work force. We should take some of the benefits from expanded trade, and use them to assist those industries like textiles that have already been hurt by global competition, and that will be harmed even more by GATT.\n\tBut the consequences of failing to pass GATT are much worse than the damage that will be done by approving it. If Congress fails to pass this agreement, it will weaken America's position in the world economy. It will encourage other nations to continue with their own protectionism and unfair trading practices that have blocked many American industries from fair competition.\n\tLike many of my colleagues, I wish that this agreement had higher standards for labor and better environmental protections. But rejection of GATT now will not advance these other worthwhile goals. If GATT fails, the world trading system will be set back for years, if not decades. In such a contentious atmosphere, it will be even more difficult to make progress on the labor and environmental issues that we care deeply about and that should be part of future trade negotiations.\n\tAdditional concerns over GATT involve the World Trade Organization, U.S. sovereignty, and our relations with other nations. In fact, though, we will be in at least as strong a position under the new organization as we were prior to GATT.\n\tA more effective dispute resolution mechanism was one of America's principal negotiating objectives under GATT. Under current procedures, when the United States won favorable rulings against other nations' unfair trade practices--which was the case more often than not--we had no effective means of implementing those rulings.\n\tSenator Dole and the administration have worked well together to improve GATT on issues relating to the WTO. If the WTO truly threatens U.S. sovereignty, we can withdraw from the agreement, and Congress will now have an enhanced role in facilitating that withdrawal. I do not anticipate such a scenario taking place, but the ability of the United States to withdraw in these ways should reassure some of the critics.\n\tFor all of these reasons, and recognizing the agreement's flaws, I urge the Senate to support GATT. The real challenge we face will be to see that GATT fulfills our hopes, not our fears. Above all, we must help the industries and workers hurt by this expansion of trade, and I intend to do all I can in the months and years ahead to see that this challenge is fully met.\n\tMr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on history's most ambitious world trade agreement. Since World War II, the world economy has become increasingly interdependent and trade has played an increasing role in political affairs. For the past seven years and through three administrations, two Republican and one Democratic, the U.S. has worked to expand free trade in the Uruguay round. Studies indicate that the U.S. will receive a boost of over $100 billion annually through expanded trade. I support the agreement, because it mandates not just free trade, but fair trade for U.S. goods.\n\tMr. President, this agreement has been expanded to include coverage for a number of new areas such as the trade in services, agriculture and protection from piracy of intellectual property. This agreement will also implement the largest tax cut in history. The across-the-board reduction in tariff, subsidy, and quota levels will amount to a $744 billion tax cut worldwide. ``Tariff'' is a fancy name for ``tax'' and these taxes are applied to both consumers and U.S. exports. These added costs put U.S. exports at a distinct disadvantage.\n\tSince GATT's inception in 1948, eight trade rounds have been completed that have established rules of trade reducing tariff and non-tariff barriers. As a result, world trade has steadily expanded.\n\tIn fact, between 1965 and 1990 merchandise trade has increased by a whopping 439 percent. Currently, the U.S. is the leading world exporter, with 11.6 percent of our Gross Domestic Product coming from exports. As this figure increases, so will higher paying export-related jobs.\n\tThis agreement achieves four major objectives. First, foreign markets will open to U.S. producers through the reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers. I am especially pleased in this round we were able to crack the protectionist foreign agriculture markets which to this point have heavily subsidized their own agricultural interests.\n\tSecond, this agreement strengthens the procedures for dealing with unfair trade. The new dispute settlement procedures will ensure that nations engaged in unfair trade will be required to come to the table in good faith to resolve trade disputes. This will eliminate the delays and stalling tactics which foreign countries have used in blocking U.S. entry into their markets.\n\tMr. President, the third objective this agreement achieves presents the best opportunity for the U.S. to expand trade. This allows for the establishment of rules of trade in services and the protection of intellectual property.\n\tThis is the first multi-lateral and enforceable agreement to include either provision. This is a tremendous achievement for the United States. In 1991, services accounted for 62 percent of U.S. GDP, employing 57 percent of U.S. workers. Currently, the U.S. maintains a $55 billion surplus in this area.\n\tWith regard to intellectual property, U.S. corporations have lost billions because there have been no trade protection against the piracy of intellectual property. In 1987, a survey by the International Trade Commission estimated that U.S. companies lose $23 billion annually due to piracy of intellectual property. With the U.S. the undeniable leader in intellectual property, such protection is critical to ensure future innovation and prosperity.\n\tA letter I received from the Software Publishing Association states that this new trade protection will help American software producers retain nearly $7.5 billion annually. Mr. President, this figure represents an astounding 48 percent of the software market share.\n\tLastly, this agreement will reduce federal subsidies and instill some discipline in international agriculture trade. For too long, U.S. farmers have fought a losing battle to gain access to European and Asian agriculture markets.\n\tProhibitive subsides and tariff barriers have stymied the growth of our highly productive agriculture industry. Without a doubt, exports are essential to continued market expansion. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that the Uruguay Round Agreement will increase exports by $5 to $14 billion over the next five years.\n\tWhat is more important for future agricultural trade expansion is the discipline that the agreement applies to countries who might otherwise choose to close markets and subsidize exports. This agreement has important consequences for our large trading partners that are currently outside of the GATT such as: China, Taiwan, and the nations of the former Soviet Union.\n\tThis agreement enables countries to use GATT rules to challenge unjustified health-related regulations that restrict trade, while protecting every country's right to ensure food safety and animal and plant health through policies based on scientific evidence. I am confident that U.S. laws will prevail and set a higher standard for our trading partners to meet. That is why the American Farm Bureau and the Kentucky Farm Bureau both proudly support GATT.\n\tI have heard from a number of organizations who have attempted to deflect the debate away from the importance of free and fair trade to other issues. Mr. President, we must not lose sight of what this agreement is about. It is about expanding trade and providing access to other markets that currently maintain barriers that deter the sale of U.S. products. This will ensure our own economy will grow and create new, higher-paying jobs.\n\tMr. President, I am not aware of any respected analysis which estimates that this agreement would have an overall negative impact on employment on the economy as a whole. Instead, GATT will reduce world tariff rates by 34 percent on average, and entirely eliminate tariffs in key exports such as pharmaceuticals, toys, medical equipment and heavy industrial machinery.\n\tThis agreement will cut tariffs world-wide by $744 billion, and the cuts borne by the U.S. represents only a small fraction of this total. It is widely accepted by economists that a reduction in trade barriers will stimulate trade.\n\tThe most recent and telling free trade success was the NAFTA agreement implemented at the beginning of this year. NAFTA has sparked the creation of more than 100,000 new jobs this year alone, and contributed to a 21 percent increase in trade with Mexico in the first nine months of the agreement. U.S. corporations are selling everything from apples to X-rays because of NAFTA.\n\tNAFTA, though it has proven to be a stunning success, pales in comparison to the GATT which includes over one hundred countries. The Department of Treasury estimates GATT will contribute to the creation of an estimated 500,000 new U.S. jobs and over $100 billion in increased economic activity per year. This economic boost will more than offset the revenue lost in the last five years of this agreement.\n\tThere are some who claim that this agreement will serve our sovereignty up to some higher world government. This is absolutely not true. The World Trade Organization is a framework for resolving trade disputes. The decision issued by a dispute resolution panel is not self-enforcing and can't override U.S. domestic law. Only the U.S. Congress can change U.S. law. In fact. Section 102 of the Agreement states that ``no provision of any of the Uruguay Round Agreement, nor the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance, that is inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have effect.'' As a Senator, I have sworn to uphold the Constitution and I am confident this agreement does not pose any threat to U.S. sovereignty.\n\tFurther, I am hardly alone in that view. The distinguished Judge Robert Bork, as well as the highly conservative Heritage Foundation, have both concluded the same thing.\n\tThis agreement, however, will establish the most effective and binding dispute settlement procedures to ensure compliance and fair trade. These procedures give the U.S. a stronger hand in bringing unfair trading nations into arbitration and settlement in a timely fashion. More importantly, it eliminates the ability of nations to veto their penalty for unfair trade practices under the current GATT.\n\tIf, however, the gloom and doom scenarios of protectionists do come true, the U.S. has the opportunity to withdraw from this executive agreement and continue under the old regime.\n\tAs the leading free trade nation, the U.S. stands to benefit greatly from this dispute resolution framework. Instead of looking at the glass half empty, as many protectionist have, we can be confident that the U.S. will have a mechanism for opening various unfairly protected markets. If a nation is found guilty of unfair trading, the U.S. has every opportunity to take unilateral action to even the playing field. Obviously, losing a foothold in our market would be a significant deterrent for any nation or industry.\n\tMr. President, I have wrestled with this decision for some time. I am disappointed that President Clinton did not remain committed to the passage of this agreement after it was signed early this year. The ``lame duck'' nature of this special session has fueled the mistrust of the American people. Unfortunately, we are left with zero options. Without the fast-track protection, which expires at the end of this year, this agreement would be decorated like a christmas tree, with special interests each putting their ornaments on it until it collapses from the weight. This would harken back to the Smoot-Hawley Tariff bill that led to the most proetectionist and failed trade regime the world has ever seen.\n\tDespite receiving the endorsement of Constitutional scholars, academics, trade experts, consumer organizations, farm groups, employees, business and state and local officials, we have had to fend off assaults from the opponents of free trade and avowed protectionists. for their own reasons, the opponents have a strong desire to continue under the old system of high tariffs and record U.S. trade deficits.\n\tMr. President, I find it difficult to understand why the opponents of this agreement want to continue to pit U.S. exporters against our trading partners with one hand tied behind our back.\n\tI too believe we need to reduce our trade deficit, but the only way that can happen is to expand our markets and sell more abroad. I find it incredible that the GATT's opponents believe our trade deficit will be reduced by the defeat of this bill.\n\tFor the long term benefit of the United States, we must focus on the expansion and protection of our exports, which this agreement ensures. This agreement will tear down longstanding trade barriers and create new markets for U.S. goods. We must not forego this opportunity to expand exports and create new jobs. I urge my colleagues to support a winner, support GATT, and allow America to compete freely and fairly on a more level playing field of trade.\n\tWith a new century only six years away, we must not turn the clock back now. A great future lies ahead for us, and GATT will help make us ready for it.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the remainder of our time to the distinguished majority leader.\n\tMr. MITCHELL. Madam President, Members of the Senate, the Senate will shortly vote on the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It is one of the most important votes of this Congress for the future prosperity of our Nation.\n\tThis trade agreement, if approved, will bring enormous benefits to our economy, our businesses, our workers.\n\tExpanding international trade has been the engine of American prosperity since the end of the Second World War. It has been the focus of all of our past international trade policies.\n\tImmediately after the war, the United States financed the reconstruction of an international order based on stable, prosperous democracies because we saw that our Nation's security would be best preserved in such a world.\n\tWe succeeded to an unprecedented degree. The Marshall plan rebuilt European industry and fired the engines of the so-called German economic miracle.\n\tIn Japan, the introduction of democratic political institutions went hand in hand with the grant of favorable trade access for Japan and other devastated nations in the Pacific.\n\tDuring that period, we undertook the defense of the free world in the interests of Western security. While our trading partners rebuilt their economies, we protected them against aggression.\n\tBut as our trading partners became our trading competitors, they began to protect not only their favored, relatively free access to our markets, but they began to protect their own markets against others, including ourselves.\n\tWe have not insisted with sufficient vigor that our trading competitors carry their own defense weight, but we will. We have asked them to open their markets to our goods. The agreement now before us is a huge step in that direction.\n\tImmediately following the Second World War, the American economy dominated the world. We had little competition. American production, as a percentage of the world's economic production, was 37 percent. The crippled economies of postwar Europe and Japan were struggling to get on their feet. Former colonies in Pacific Asia and South Asia were just beginning the process of economic development.\n\tIn the intervening 40 years, our economic growth has been solid. So has the growth of our trading partners and our competitors.\n\tFormer colonies in Asia are growing faster than are the mature economies. The American economy has kept pace, but in such a changed world America's share of a hugely enlarged global economy was bound to be smaller relative to others, as it is.\n\tToday, the output of the 260 million people of the United States is about 22 percent of the combined output of the other 5.5 billion people in the world.\n\tA lower relative share of world production means that we have to compete both for developed and emerging markets throughout the world. We cannot be satisfied any longer with simply selling American products in America. This agreement will give us the tools to compete on a more level playing field, to compete against competition, not against artificial trade barriers.\n\tThe economic miracle of the postwar world is that with the expansion of international trade, every participating nation's economy has grown. Human well-being has reached more people at higher levels than ever before in history. The leading beneficiary of that trend has been the United States.\n\tThe future of our economy depends on our ability to respond to the demands of the global marketplace. This agreement will define the American role in the global economy and in world affairs well into the 21st century.\n\tWith the passage of this agreement, the Senate will affirm the leadership role of the United States around the world. Rejection would send a far different signal: That the United States fears the challenges of the post-cold war global economy. Rejection of this agreement would be a signal of American weakness.\n\tWe should not turn our backs on opportunities in new and growing markets around the world. Our own economic security depends on our willingness and our skill at adapting to a rapidly changing global economy. American companies have adapted to the competitive international marketplace by increasing productivity through new manufacturing techniques and by streamlining production. The American worker is the most productive worker in the world.\n\tLet me repeat that for those who fear competition with other nations: The American worker is the most productive worker in the world. But the price of these productivity increases has often been the reduction of a company's work force.\n\tAutomation and improved computer technologies have made many jobs vanish as silicon chips now perform functions that once were performed by human beings.\n\tIt is no wonder that many working Americans fear the fallout of economic change. They have a right to be wary, for too often in the past swift economic change has disrupted the lives of families and whole communities, and too often, our Government has responded slowly, begrudgingly, inadequately.\n\tThe government which wants to expand trade must recognize that it has a reciprocal responsibility to the people most at risk from the effects of trade expansion.\n\tThose who favor the trade agreement, as I do, must acknowledge and accept the responsibility to remember that there is more than one step in our progress toward a more prosperous nation and world.\n\tThe first step is opening markets and freeing trade.\n\tBut the second and equally important step is to make certain that our people do not disproportionately pay the costs that are part of every significant economic change.\n\tWe must work together to prepare the U.S. economy for the challenges of the 21st century. Our workers must be educated and trained so the industries of the future will invest in this country and create new jobs here. We must reduce the burden that health care costs place on American businesses, which reduce their global competitiveness.\n\tLike every one of my colleagues, every single Member of this Senate, I have seen first hand the dislocations of families and communities that occur when a production facility is moved offshore, or competition from lower wage countries gives our consumers a better bargain. The displaced workers should not be forced to pay the price of change.\n\tBut we must recognize also the benefits of change and harness them to our advantage. In my home State of Maine, companies and their workers have greatly benefited from expanded global trade.\n\tIn 1993, Maine exported more than $1 billion of merchandise to foreign markets, almost 10 percent more than in the previous year. Maine's sales to foreign markets grew more than three times the rate of the domestic economy.\n\tOur economic future depends on expanding international trade though lower tariff and eliminating nontariff barriers. So does the economic future of every other State in the Nation.\n\tThe North American Free-Trade Agreement, passed only last November, has already produced tangible economic benefits in Maine.\n\tIn the first quarter of 1994, Maine's exports to Mexico increased 141 percent over the previous first quarter. The agreement before us today will have an even greater positive impact, a much greater positive impact, on economic growth on Maine and the Nation than did the North American Free-Trade Agreement.\n\tFor example, this agreement will eliminate tariffs on paper and paper products in European and Asian markets. The American paper industry has estimated that this tariff elimination alone will produce a $2 billion increase every year in American exports of paper and paper products.\n\tThe agreement lowers tariffs now levied against other Maine product, including semiconductors, electronic components, wood and wood products, blueberries and leather products. When those tariffs are cut, Maine-produced goods will be less costly and more attractive to foreign buyers, and Maine's exports will have a chance to grow. That is true for the products of virtually every State in the Nation.\n\tIn addition to the tariff cuts, the agreement will establish new rules to help eliminate foreign import barriers based on unjustified or unreasonable local regulations. In the past, to cite one example, foreign countries have restricted imports of American potatoes from Maine and other States, and fish products through the use of unfair sanitary and phytosanitary standards.\n\tUnder this agreement such standards will have to be based on science. Since our regulations are now based on science and others are not, we can only benefit from compelling other nations to adhere to the high standards which we already observe. The agreement will not prevent the United States or any other nation from adopting more stringent standards but it will curtail their use as tools of protectionism.\n\tThese are only a few of the benefits that this agreement will produce for the State of Maine and the Nation.\n\tHere in the debate and across the country opponents of this agreement have attacked it because it will not immediately produce impeccable fairness in every aspect of every trade exchange among an international community whose member nations vary enormously in wealth, resources, manpower, and laws.\n\tIt has been attacked because the agreement itself does not eliminate child labor practices in foreign nations. It has been attacked because the United States currently has a balance of trade deficit, and the agreement cannot guarantee that the U.S. trade deficit will be eliminated in the future.\n\tOf course, the reality is that the United States could never reach a multilateral agreement that would by itself solve all of these problems. But this world's nations, with all their differences in wealth, resources and laws, are the only trading partners we have.\n\tWe do not trade with Mars. We do not trade with the Moon. We do not trade with people and countries made in heaven. We trade with the countries which exist on this Earth. And so we must negotiate with them as we must trade with them.\n\tNo agreement of this scope could be perfect. This one is not. It leaves open the potential of trade disputes in the future. That potential can never be eliminated. Foreign agriculture subsidies were not completely eliminated under this agreement, although they are substantially reduced. The transition period for imposing the intellectual property rules on developing nations is disappointingly too long. And the concerns of the U.S. audio-visual industry were not properly addressed in the services agreement.\n\tBut we should not measure this trade agreement against a perfect and unrealizable ideal. We must weigh it against the current world trading system, and the current rules. And by that comparison, this agreement is a very good deal for America, and a very great improvement on the current system.\n\tMr. President, I want to address that aspect of the debate which has generated the most misinformation; that is, the role of the World Trade Organization and its impact on the American sovereignty.\n\tLet me make it clear and unmistakable. The Uruguay round agreement will not undermine the U.S. sovereignty; will not undermine U.S. sovereignty. The power to make and change American law will remain where it is right now, right here with the U.S. Congress.\n\tAnd section 102 of the implementing legislation plainly states, and I quote its exact words: ``No provision of any of the Uruguay round agreements, nor the application of any such provision to any person or circumstance, that is inconsistent with any law of the United States shall have effect.''\n\tNo provision, nor its application, that is inconsistent with any law of the United States, shall have any effect.\n\tThat is a direct, unmistakable response to the allegations of a loss of sovereignty.\n\tNeither the World Trade Organization nor any dispute settlement panel will have any authority to enjoin the enforcement of any United States law or any State law, or to impose any monetary sanctions against the United States. The dispute settlement panel will have the power only to recommend that a member nation bring its laws into conformity with its international obligations.\n\tBut that does not mean we must change our laws. If a dispute settlement panel rules against us and says that a U.S. law is inconsistent with GATT, we may offer to the complaining country compensation, or we may make another agreement.\n\tThe decision-making rules of the World Trade Organization are protective of American interests. For over 30 years, the GATT has operated by consensus--in which any member nation can block action and exercise an effective veto. There has not been a GATT wide vote on any trade policy issue since 1959.\n\tArticle Nine of the Uruguay round agreement specifically codifies this past GATT practice of operating by consensus.\n\tIf World Trade Organization members attempt to change the Uruguay round agreement in the future, the rules provide that certain important provisions, such as the most-favored-nation obligations, decisionmaking rules, and the amendment rule, can be changed only--I repeat--only--when all members of the World Trade Organization agree to the change. That means that if any amendment is against American interests, we can block it.\n\tTo allay concerns about the World Trade Organization, the President has consulted with Secretary of the Treasury Bentsen, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, and Senator Dole. They have reached agreement, an agreement which will create an exclusively American commission of five retired judges who will review any adverse decision made by a World Trade Organization dispute settlement panel. This American commission will determine if such a panel decision is outside the scope of the trade agreement or exceeds the panel's authority.\n\tIf the review commission makes three adverse determinations within 5 years, Congress will have the authority to approve a joint resolution for U.S. withdrawal from the World Trade Organization.\n\tThe legislation will provide another procedure to withdraw from the World Trade Organization. There is existing authority in the agreement that allows any nation, including ours, to unilaterally withdraw from the World Trade Organization after giving 6 months' notice. So let us put it to rest once and for all. The World Trade Organization will not undermine American sovereignty; it will enhance our economic interests.\n\tOn the budget issue--and that is the first vote we will have--we should not be mistaken about the impact of this agreement. If it is implemented, the agreement will lower, not increase, the Federal budget deficit. The increased economic growth will generate more revenue for the Treasury than it will lose from the tariff reductions.\n\tThe congressional budget rules are important, but we must now waive those rules in this case because the agreement serves both the national interests and promotes the goal of deficit reduction.\n\tThe potential dangers of this agreement have been much discussed and, in my respectful view, much exaggerated. Meantime, the potential benefits are much more real and realistically based.\n\tOver time this agreement will reduce average merchandise tariffs by more than one-third. In the world's developed economies, average tariffs would decrease from 6.3 percent to 3.9 percent.\n\tThese lower tariffs will encourage economic growth in the United States and around the world.\n\tEconomists estimate that when the agreement is fully implemented, the American gross domestic product will increase between $100 billion and $200 billion every year. That will produce hundreds of thousands of new jobs for American workers.\n\tMy fellow Senators, we have come to the end of a long and vigorous debate. Eight years ago, negotiations on this agreement began. Three Presidents negotiated it. Their cumulative efforts reached a successful conclusion almost a year ago. The world's trading nations signed the accord on April 15 of this year, many months ago.\n\tThe administration and the Congress jointly drafted the implementing legislation. It was introduced more than 2 months ago. The vote we are about to cast, as we all know, was delayed for 2 months for even more hearings.\n\tThe Senate has fully, exhaustively, carefully, debated and considered this issue. Almost every provision in the agreement and the implementing legislation has been thoroughly examined.\n\tOn Tuesday, the House of Representatives gave it an overwhelming bipartisan endorsement by a vote of 288-146.\n\tIt is now the Senate's turn to act in the national interest. I urge my colleagues to vote for this agreement. It is in the Nation's best interest, and that must be our sole standard for voting on a measure of this significance. Reasonable men and women in this Chamber can disagree on how to define that interest. For myself, I say the Uruguay round trade agreement is good for America. Let us pass it now.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order.\n\tMr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time.\n\tMr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on the motion to waive titles 3 and 4 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, and section 23 of H. Con. Res. 218, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1995, for the consideration of H.R. 5110. A vote of three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn is required for the adoption of the motion.\n\tThe yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n\tMr. MITCHELL.

May we have order, Mr. President?\n\tMr. MITCHELL. May we have order?\n\tThe PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will be in order. The Chair requests that all Senators please be in order.\n\tThe majority leader.\n\tMr. MITCHELL. Mr. President the vote to approve this treaty was overwhelming and bipartisan. On the crucial motion to waive the Budget Act, 68 Senators voted in favor, 32 opposed. Of 46 Republican Senators voting, 31 voted in favor, 15 against. That is 67 percent in favor. Of the 54 Democratic Senators voting, 37 voted for, 17 against. That is 69 percent in favor; 67 percent of Republicans; 69 percent of Democrats, a total of 68 percent of the Senate voting in favor.\n\tMany persons deserve credit for this result.\n\tMr. President, first I extend my congratulations to those who fought a vigorous battle in opposition to this agreement here in the Senate on high principle and with powerful arguments, led by the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, the distinguished Presiding Officer, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and all of those. We respectfully reached different conclusions on how to define the national interest, but we recognize and acknowledge that every single Senator has voted in the national interest as he or she sees it.\n\tI foremost congratulate the President, who provided crucial leadership on this important measure. He followed the path set by President Reagan and President Bush when they began and continued the negotiations, and President Clinton brought them to a successful conclusion last year. He was greatly assisted by the powerful and very effective work of the U.S. Ambassador for Trade, Mickey Kantor, a name not well known to most Americans but as a result of whose efforts Americans for generations to come will lead better lives.\n\tHere in the Senate, of course, great credit goes to the distinguished Republican leader, Senator Dole, who took an active role in working to improve what he saw as deficiencies in the agreement, and his work produced a better result. And our distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, Senators Moynihan and Packwood who led the debate with eloquence and fairness over these past 2 days. I thank them for their work, and I thank all Senators who saw fit to support the agreement, and I commend those who opposed it on principle.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Ben Nighthorse Campbell", "Harlan Mathews", "John McCain", "Joseph I.

Mr. President, while I did not have the privilege of \nserving in this Chamber with Tom Kuchel of California, I admired his \nmany accomplishments and was saddened by his death on November 21.\n  Senator Kuchel entered this chamber in 1952, when then California \nGov. Earl Warren appointed him to take the place of Richard Nixon, who \nhad been elected Vice President of the United States. Prior to his \nappointment, Senator Kuchel had served as chairman of the California \nState Republican Party, a State assemblyman, a State senator, and State \ncontroller.\n  Throughout his 16 years in the Senate, Senator Kuchel served \nCalifornia and America with great distinction--serving for 10 years as \nRepublican whip, alongside the legendary Republican leader, Everett \nDirksen.\n  Senator Kuchel reached across party lines throughout his years in the \nSenate, serving with Democrat whip Hubert Humphrey as cofloor manager \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He also helped to write what became \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  I know I speak for all members of the Senate in sending our \ncondolences to Senator Kuchel's wife, Betty, and his entire family.\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, like all Members of the Senate, I was \nsaddened by the announcement that former President Ronald Reagan is \nsuffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.\n  And, like all Members of the Senate, I was also inspired by the \neloquence and courage of President Reagan's letter to the American \npeople. The words were typical Ronald Reagan. Honest. Open. Positive.\n  By going public with his diagnosis, President Reagan has also focused \nattention on the plight of the estimated 4 million Americans who are \nafflicted with Alzheimer's.\n  This tragic disease is now the fourth leading cause of death among \nAmerican adults. And because our population is aging, it is estimated \nthat 14 million Americans will have the disease by the year 2050.\n  In the past several years, Congress has moved to increase funding for \nAlzheimer's research and support programs for victims and their \nfamilies. It is my hope that the 104th Congress will also devote \ncareful attention to these programs.\n  Mr. President, I know I speak for the entire Senate when I say that \nour thoughts and prayers are with President Reagan as he begins what he \ndescribed as ``the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my \nlife.''\n  And our thoughts and prayers are also with Nancy Reagan, the \nremarkable woman who has played such an important role in his life, and \nwho served as First Lady with such grace and dignity.\n  I would also ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that President \nReagan's letter to the American public be printed in the Congressional \nRecord in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Transcript of Letter From President Ronald Reagan to the American \n                                 People\n\n       My Fellow Americans, I have recently been told that I am \n     one of the millions of American who will be afflicted with \n     Alzheimer's Disease.\n       Upon learning this news, Nancy & I had to decide whether as \n     private citizens we would keep this a private matter or \n     whether we would make this news known in a public way.\n       In the past Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my \n     cancer surgeries. We found through our open disclosures we \n     were able to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a \n     result many more people underwent testing. They were treated \n     in early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives.\n       So now, we feel it is important to share it with you. In \n     opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater \n     awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a \n     clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are \n     affected by it.\n       At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the \n     remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the \n     things I have always done. I will continue to share life's \n     journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy \n     the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and \n     supporters.\n       Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's Disease progresses, the \n     family often bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some \n     way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience.

Today is the final day of the 103d Congress \nand marks the end of Senator Mitchell's service after more than 14 \nyears of representing Maine in the U.S. Senate. From a quiet young \nlawyer in Waterville, ME, has come a great leader who has done his \ncountry and his State proud.\n  George Mitchell had big shoes to fill when he was appointed to \nSenator Muskie's seat 14 years ago. When he first came to the Senate, \nI, in the infinite wisdom I had as Maine's senior Senator, offered to \ntake him under my wing and show him the Senate ropes. In retrospect, \nthat offer was a little like Larry Bird offering to give instruction to \nMichael Jordan on how to improve his vertical leap.\n  Most of you know that we share much more than just the position of \nSenator from Maine. We both grew up in similar circumstances. with very \nsimilar backgrounds. Senator Mitchell is half Irish, and half Lebanese. \nI am half Irish and half Jewish. We both graduated from Bowdoin \nCollege. We both become lawyers before entering public service. And we \nwrote a book together that produced many headlines and only a few \nroyalties. But I must tell you it was a great experience for both of \nus.\n\n  Since his elevation to majority leader, like Michael Jordan, he \ncontinues, along with Bob Dole, to play well above the rim. There have \nbeen countless articles speculating on the reasons for his dramatic \nrise in the Senate. There is a Chinese proverb that says ``when \ndrinking the water, don't forget to remember those who dug the well.'' \nI think to really understand George Mitchell's success one needs to \nlook no further than the fact that he had Ed Muskie as his mentor. Ed \nprovided Senator Mitchell with the basic principles of public service \nwhich I think have guided him over the years. And I think it is no \nsurprise that the Senate majority leader demonstrates many of the \nattributes of Senator Muskie, who had an abundance of intelligence, \nintegrity, and independence. I believe Oscar Wilde must have had \nsomeone like George in mind when he said: ``I can stand brute force, \nbut brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about \nits use. It's hitting below the intellect.''\n  Senator Mitchell has always hit well above not only the belt but the \nintellect as well.\n  Mr. President, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote:\n\n       I have always thought that not place or power or popularity \n     makes the success that one desires, but the trembling hope \n     that one has come near to an ideal.

Mr. President, I rise today to comment on the fact \nthat the Federal Reserve once again has raised interest rates. In its \nnever-ending quest to appease the ``gods of Wall Street,'' the Federal \nReserve has raised interest rates--this time by three-fourths of a \npercentage point. The total Federal Reserve imposed increase in \ninterest rates for 1994 is 2\\1/2\\ percent. Two and one-half percent--\nthat makes the brokers and bond traders happy and puts more Americans \nout of work.\n  The Federal Reserve's stated goal is to slow economic growth in this \ncountry. Their objective: Approximately a 1 percent reduction in \ngrowth. The result? According to the Economic Policy Institute, this \nmeans a loss of over 1.3 million jobs.\n  First we need to look at who benefits from the Federal Reserve \npolicies. The simple answer is the wealthy. You will not find any \nmiddle-income Americans with large bond portfolios. The top 7 percent \nof households own 60 percent of the bonds. So these new higher rates \nare flowing to the wealthiest of Americans.\n  Who is being hurt by the Federal Reserve policies? Again, the answer \nis simple: Working Americans.\n  These new higher interest rates for credit cards, car loans, home \nloans disproportionately hit families with incomes under $50,000 \nannually. These are the Americans most heavily dependent upon borrowing \nand least likely to be able to absorb these increases. Even before this \nlatest increase was announced, home loans, interest rates for 30-year \nmortgages had jumped from 6.8 percent to 9.2 percent over the last \nyear.\n  The Federal Reserve seems to have forgotten that what drives this \neconomy is the middle Americans who spend their money and can use that \nbuying process, but not by higher interest rates. Unemployment is down, \nthe economy is booming, and inflation is down. There is no \njustification for this latest rise, in my judgment.\n  The middle Americans are the ones who buy the cars, homes, \ndishwashers, and other durable goods. They are the ones who keep our \nAmericans employed. The Federal Reserve needs to get in touch with \nworking Americans. They had better move fast before their Wall Street \nwealthy people find out that maybe the voters in this country want the \nmiddle Americans, the workers, to succeed in this economic growth, not \njust the wealthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                        INTEREST RATES--UP AGAIN\n\n\tMr. DeCONCINI.

It is simply entitled appeasement.\n  Precious time has been lost over the past 2\\1/2\\ years as diplomats \nhave shuttled to Belgrade and Pale coddling up to the very individuals \nresponsible for the carnage in Bosnia. Precious little time remains.\n  The international community, through its timidity, has allowed the \nsituation in Bosnia to deteriorate to its current low. Some have tried \nto pin blame on the Bosnians themselves for having tried to stand up in \nthe face of continued aggression. This is a sad and frightening \nendorsement of the principle that ``might makes right.''\n  The current crisis demands immediate and forceful action. Inaction at \nthis critical juncture will have grave consequences for the United \nNations, NATO and, most importantly at this point, for the people of \nBosnia and Herzegovina. Failure to act, and act with meaningful air \nstrikes, will effectively seal the fate of the Bosnians. Winston \nChurchill's phrase ``a small nation thrown to the wolves'' fits all too \nwell in the case of Bosnia.\n  The international community has failed to come to grips with the fact \nthatthe current military imbalance in the region precludes stability \nthere. The United Nations and NATO have been rendered effectively \nimpotent by the failure of the world's strongest alliance to stand up \nto a bunch of two-bit thugs. In the name of peacekeeping the United \nNations, and in particular the members of the Security Council, have \naccepted humiliation after humiliation.

Mr. President, Russian \nnationalists and the Russian military would take great delight in the \nweakening of the alliance. In the process NATO has been placed in an \nuntenable and embarrassing position.\n  One administration official is quoted as saying ``we are favoring \nNATO unity over what we have long believed the course in Bosnia ought \nto be.'' NATO unity? Unity to what end? What good is this unity if the \nvery principles upon which the world's greatest alliance was built are \nrendered meaningless?\n  Former British Defense Minister Sir John Nott on just last Saturday \naccused his own government of appeasing the Bosnian Serbs.

Mr. President, despite predictions by Republicans that \nenactment of the Clinton economic recovery package would result in \neconomic catastrophe, the opposite has proved to be the reality. \nRepublican doom and gloom predictions that the plan would be \ninflationary, kill jobs, stall the economic recovery and end up \nincreasing the deficit were dead wrong. The sky did not fall. In fact, \nthe economic storm clouds have disappeared and the sun is out. The \ndeficit is shrinking, the economy is growing, business is expanding and \njobs are being created. Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, said that the economy is in the strongest shape in two \ndecades, and that the deficit reduction plan passed last August had \ncontributed to this stronger economy. As you know, this plan was passed \nwith NO Republican support. So let's give the President some credit. \nBill Clinton was right; the Republicans were wrong. The Democrats in \nthe House and Senate who supported the plan were right; the opponents \nwere wrong.\n  Senator Phil Gramm of Texas purveyed the gloom and doom message to \nthe Senate.\n\n       I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill \n     the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, \n     the deficit four years from today will be higher than it is \n     today and not lower . . . when all is said and done, people \n     will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, \n     Government will spend more money, and the American people \n     will be worse off.\n\n  Contrary to Senator Gramm's wishful thinking, the deficit is coming \ndown, interest rates and inflation are low; business investment was up \n18 percent in 1993 (the fastest pace since 1972); consumer confidence \nis up; and unemployment is down.\n  Senator Grassley asserted: ``I really do not think it takes a rocket \nscientist to know this bill will cost jobs.''\n  In the Clinton Administration's first year, the economy created 1.7 \nmillion private sector jobs--70 percent more in one year than had been \ncreated in the previous four years.\n  Majority Leader Dole told us ``President Clinton knows . . . I know, \nand the American people know that the plan does not tackle the deficit \nhead on.''\n  After a 12 year unstoppable increase, the deficit is now projected to \ndecline three years in a row, the first time since Harry Truman was in \nthe White House.\n  Kudos for the Clinton plan's results has come from some unlikely \nplaces. In testimony before the House Budget Committee at the end of \nJune 1994, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, stated, \nin part: ``The outlook for the U.S. economy is as bright as it has been \nin decades. Economic activity has strengthened, unemployment is down, \nand price trends are subdued.'' And in January 1994, he proclaimed:\n\n       To President Clinton's credit, early last year he rejected \n     an either/or construction for U.S. growth versus deficit \n     reduction. Clinton's blueprint for economic revival had as \n     its centerpiece a multi-year program of deficit reduction, \n     but it promised higher growth in the short run. A move to \n     restrain deficit spending, he wagered, would both lower \n     U.S. long-term rates and energize U.S. interest sensitive \n     sectors. Lower deficits, lower long-term rates and higher \n     real growth were the overall promise. With the data now \n     rolling in for December 1993, it seems clear that \n     President Clinton delivered on all three counts over the \n     second half of the year.\n\n  Let's take a look at the specifics of what has taken place since the \nelection of President Clinton. The mid-session review of the budget, \nwhich was released by the Office of Management and Budget in mid-July, \ndemonstrates that the President's economic package continues to be a \nremarkable success.\n\n\n                              the deficit\n\n  The 1955 deficit is now projected to be 40 percent lower that when \nPresident Clinton took office in January 1993.\n  While policy changes in the deficit reduction package accounted for \napproximately $500 billion in deficit reduction, improvements in the \neconomy have helped to raise overall deficit reduction predictions over \nfive years to nearly $700 billion.\n\n\n                             spending cuts\n\n  The historic deficit reduction was achieved by making very tough \nchoices about spending cuts. Half of the President's package, or $255 \nbillion, was devoted to cutting federal programs. The following deserve \nto be mentioned: A reduction of 272,000 in the federal workforce, \nbringing it down to its lowest level since the Kennedy Administration; \ncuts in 300 different programs two years in a row; reductions in nearly \nevery entitlement area including Medicare, Medicaid and Farm subsidy \nprograms.\n  Perhaps the most effective measure of the success of the President's \neconomic plan is how it has affected both individual Americans and \nAmerican businesses. By any objective standard, the plan has proven to \nbe a resounding success for both these groups. More Americans are \nworking; more Americans are confident about their future, and more \nbusinesses are optimistic about the economic outlook.\n\n\n                                  jobs\n\n  Since President Clinton took office in January 1993, the job \nsituation has dramatically improved, giving hope to millions of \nAmericans.\n  Since January 1993, the economy has created 3.1 million private \nsector jobs--almost two million more private sector jobs than in the \nprevious four years combined.\n  The economy has created more than 1.237 million total jobs in the \nfirst five months of this year, 96 percent of which have been in the \nprivate sector. The bottom line is that this Administration has created \nnearly two million more private sector jobs than the last \nAdministration in one-third the time.\n\n  After serious declines in manufacturing jobs over the past few years, \nthey were up in six of the past eight months, an increase of 56,000.\n  Construction employment, one important measure of the health of the \neconomy, has increased for eleven straight months.\n  The current job growth rate puts the economy well ahead of schedule \nto meet the President's goal of 8 million new jobs in four years.\n  One of the most impressive statistics of all is that more than 60 \npercent of the new jobs created since 1993 were professional, \nmanagerial or technical jobs which paid 45 percent above the average \nwage.\n  Finally, unemployment is down from 7.7 percent in January 1993 to 6.0 \npercent in May, 1994. There are names and faces associated with this \ndramatic decline in unemployment. Many individuals now have jobs; they \nhave hope for the future; their families feel the security that comes \nwith full time employment.\n  The success of the economic plan has had an equally impressive impact \non the business sector. Fortune magazine found that CEOs of both large \nand small companies are more optimistic about the future than they have \nbeen in nearly a decade. And the most recent Business Week/Harris \nExecutive Poll demonstrates broad-based, growing optimism among \nbusiness executives around the country, 90 percent of whom have a \npositive outlook about the country's economic future, and 44 percent of \nwhom believe the gross domestic product will increase more in the next \n12 months than it did over the last year. Of the executives polled, 94 \npercent reported making a profit in 1993, and over 80 percent say they \nexpect increased profits in 1994. And the good news continues, with \nmore than 40 percent indicating their intention to hire new employees. \nDunn & Bradstreet confirms the optimism within the business sector. It \nreported that ``In 1993, the United States posted the greatest number \nof yearly business incorporations since Dunn & Bradstreet began \nreporting this data in 1946.'' In addition to increased business \nconfidence, business investment in equipment in 1993 was at its highest \nlevel in 20 years; and in 1994, it is at its highest level relative to \nGDP in the postwar period. Equally important, consumer confidence is up \nas well--up over 50 percent since enactment of the Clinton economic \nplan last summer.\n  Finally, I cannot let this moment pass without again pointing out, as \nI did when I cast my vote last August, that all the rhetoric about the \nplan simply being a tax bill on middle income Americans is simply \nthat--rhetoric. The taxes contained in the plan, a fact confirmed by \nH&R Block, fell on only the wealthiest 1.2 percent of Americans. And \naccording to Citizens for Tax Justice, 81 percent of those taxes will \ncome from Americans with incomes in excess of $200,000. In reality, \nmiddle class Americans were exempt from the tax, and low income \nAmericans, through the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, \nreceived a tax cut. This is not fiction; this is fact. In Arizona, 26.9 \npercent or 255,800 families received a tax cut. This is not fiction; \nthis is fact.\n  I supported the Clinton economic package because I felt it was the \nright thing to do. I believe this President deserved to have an \nopportunity to implement his plan for the economic future of America. \nThere is no doubt in my mind that I made the right decision. The report \ncard is in. The President gets an A in economics. In fact, he should \nget an A plus because the plan has been successful beyond any of our \nexpectations. And any objective observer would have to reach the same \nconclusion.\n  Although the recent election did not lead to the same conclusion. \nThat is the political reality. But leadership means first doing what \nyou think is right and then taking that issue to the people and \nleading. I think the President must and will take the issue of reduced \ndeficit and continue again to ask the Congress to reduce the deficit \nagain. He must and I believe will lead. It's the right thing to do.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, sometimes we have people decide to leave \nthe Senate, for whatever personal reasons, and go back home, and we \nhate very much to see them go. That is the case with several of our \ncolleagues, Senator DeConcini, Senator Riegle, and others, who are \nleaving here, whom we have worked long and hard with through the years.\n  At other times the voters at home and our judgment here may differ on \nwho should be sent back to the Senate. And that makes it particularly \ndifficult sometimes, because we make valued friendships here in the \nSenate. We work closely with people. We know their work up close and \nfirsthand.\n  When the voters, for whatever reason--tides or political winds or \nwhatever--see things differently than we do here and someone is not \nreturned to office, it is particularly difficult to accept that \njudgment, though that is exactly what we must do.\n  Such a difficult time for many of us here, for me in particular, came \nwhen the people of Tennessee saw fit not to return my seatmate here, \nJim Sasser, to the U.S. Senate.\n  Jim and I have been seatmates here for, I guess, maybe 10 years, \nsitting side by side; you get to know someone pretty well over that \nlengthy period of time, as well as working with him in committee.\n  Jim came from Tennessee, of course, was at Vanderbilt, spent 6 years \nin the Marine Corps Reserve--which I do not hold against him as far as \npart of his career pattern goes--and has done an outstanding job here \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  I know him from long work on the Governmental Affairs Committee where \nwe served together, where he was in particular there cutting waste in \nGovernment, and supported such things as the Chief Financial Officer \nAct, the Inspectors General Act, procurement change, and so on.\n  When Jim had his opportunity to take over the Budget Committee, I \nthink he was not quite sure what he wanted to do on that, but take it \nover he did. He did such an outstanding job with it, that his presence \nand his leadership on that committee will truly be sorely missed in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  We remember some of those times in the Budget Committee when we had \nwhat was called the ``dueling budgets'' back and forth. Everybody had a \nbudget they were submitting, and it was up to Jim to try to reconcile \nthese things. We sent through reconciliation here a year ago last \nsummer, which we will remember as one of the giant steps taken in \ncontrol of our fiscal policy, I think, since I have been in the Senate, \nand I have been here just 2 years longer than Jim. I have been here 20 \nyears, just finishing that up, and Jim was elected in 1976.\n  This was really a giant step, and it is a major step forward to help \nthe administration and the policies that have been established that \nliterally have reduced the budget deficit over the last years from \nabout $300 billion down to around a little above $250 billion this \nyear; down to $167 billion or $168 billion estimated, I believe it is, \nnext year. The first time in 3 years in a row we had a decline in the \nbudget deficit 3 years in row I believe since the days of Harry Truman. \nMuch of the credit for that goes to Jim Sasser and the work he did on \nthat committee.\n  He has been on Appropriation, Military Construction, Banking, and I \nmentioned Governmental Affairs.

We have become close friends here.\n  Jim ran in 1976 as a believer in the United States and its people. \nOne of his slogans repeated over and over again out of that campaign \nwhen he first ran and came to the Senate was he wanted a Government \nthat reflects our decency, a Government that reflects our decency as a \npeople.\n  I know Jim as just such a decent person himself, as an example of \nwhat hardworking Senators should be, decent, honest hard working.

Mr. President, I want to follow the remarks of my \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator Glenn, in reflecting on the enormous \ncontribution that Jim Sasser has made here in the United States Senate. \nThose of us who had the rare privilege to come here as Senators and see \nthe country in terms of two individuals coming from each of the 50 \nStates we have a chance to learn a lot about America and the regions of \nAmerica, and we have the chance, the good fortune, the rare good \nfortune to meet some truly outstanding individuals.\n  And to my mind one of those people is Jim Sasser from Tennessee. The \nqualities of leadership that the country needs, every single one of \nthose qualities that I count the highest I have seen in Jim Sasser--\ncourage, wisdom, tireless effort, caring about the public, the whole \npublic, not just part of it but the whole public, caring about the \ninstitution, making sure it works, skillfully serving as budget \nchairman. And I have been able to serve on that committee with Jim for \nmany years. It is one of the toughest duty stations in this place. The \nbudget process is complex. It is time consuming. Everybody has a \ndifferent idea how to do it. The administration in power submits a \nbudget that has to be altered, and it takes hundreds, literally \nthousands of hours of effort to plow through it and to sort it out and \nto get it right, and it takes really an amazing individual in terms of \nscope of talent to be able to handle that kind of an assignment\n  We have had a lot of budget chairmen here in the Senate who have done \nvery valuable work but none who has had to function under as difficult \na set of circumstances as Chairman Jim Sasser. He got the assignment \nwhen it was as tough as it has ever been, when the Federal budget \ndeficits were out of control. There was a lot of mistaken economic and \nfinancial policy that had been set loose in the country. Deficits were \nskyrocketing. And he was given the challenge to lead that committee and \nlead the Senate and help lead the country through those problems, to \nestablish a new budget discipline, to get it into place, and to make \nsure that it would work.\n  And what has been happening since that time is the Federal budget \ndeficits have been coming down. Now, they have not been coming down \nbecause the economy has been shut down. We have brought them down at \nthe same time the economy has been put on a growth track and \nunemployment has been dropping, the number of jobs in the country has \nbeen increasing, and we are getting some of the best economic \nperformance we have had in many, many years. Not perfect; there are \nsome problems. But we are making substantial progress and things are a \nlot better than they were. And Jim Sasser has been a principal \narchitect of the economic and budget plans that has made that possible.\n  Now, there is no glamor in that job. The Budget Committee \nchairmanship is probably the chairmanship that people here would least \nhope would fall on them, because it is so demanding and because even an \noutstanding performance is not going to be appreciated because there \nare no simple or perfect answers. But Jim has done an amazing job in \nthat respect. And he has done it in a way in which I think he has \nlooked after the interests of his home State and his home region, and \nlooked after the broad national interests. That is a tremendous \naccomplishment.\n  I have had the good fortune to have him serve with me on the Senate \nBanking Committee. I have served the last 6 years as chairman of that \ncommittee. We have had a lot of demanding and difficult problems to \nsolve there. We have been able to work through them and get them solved \nwith help from colleagues on both sides of the aisle. But no one was \nmore valuable to me in that effort in terms of carrying my chairmanship \nresponsibilities there than my friend, Jim Sasser.\n  I think the thing that probably is the most important about Jim, \nthough, is just the kind of human being he is. You really only have to \nlook at his family to understand who Jim Sasser is, his mother and \nfather. His father's role in public service years back before Jim, sort \nof setting a model and path that Jim has followed with such \ndistinction; his wife Mary, their two lovely children.\n  Balancing the requirements of having an exceptional family life and \nan exceptional professional life is very difficult to do and not \neveryone can do it. Jim Sasser has done it, and he has done it in a way \noftentimes that makes it look easy when it is about the most difficult \nthing, particularly with respect to the mechanics of the budget \nprocess, of anything here that we have to do.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, as well, he has blazed \ntrails off in many directions where his responsibilities have been in \nthat area.\n  We do not have many Jim Sassers in the Senate, and that is \nunfortunate because we need more and we need as many as we can get.\n  I think those of us who had the special privilege to know Jim quite \nintimately understand his special qualities because he is not a self-\npromoter. He is not a person who is up tooting his own horn. There is a \nlot of that that goes on around here, and I do not say that I am immune \nfrom it from time to time myself.\n  But I think Jim is probably, if you were to do a ratio of quality of \neffort and accomplishment to personal horn blowing, he would have the \nbest ratio in the place in terms of modesty, on the one hand, and \naccomplishment, on the other. That cannot be said about very many \npeople. It can be said about Jim.\n  I feel very privileged to have had this seat on the Senate floor next \nto my friend from Tennessee. There is no seat here I would rather have \nhad than sitting beside him.\n  I just want to close by saying--we are emotional people, at least I \nam--I remember years ago when my father, who was a local political \nelected official and was mayor of my hometown, the city of Flint, was \ndefeated in a race for reelection. He should not have been defeated \nbecause he was the best man in the race and had a remarkable record of \nachievement, but he lost anyway, because elections can go that way. I \nthink that is what happened here. I do not say that disrespectfully to \nanybody else, but I say it knowing the qualities of Jim Sasser. And I \nknow something of the pain that comes with those kinds of losses within \na family. Well, that was my father's loss. I think I felt it maybe even \nmore strongly than he did.\n  So I say to Jim, and I say to his family and to his supporters and \nfriends and staff, his excellent staff, that you have every right to \nfeel as proud as anybody can feel for their service here in the U.S. \nSenate, in this case for 18 long, hard, tough years. It has been a \nterrific piece of work, and it has lifted all the rest of us. It has \nset a standard that the rest of us have many times tried to ratchet \nourselves up to in terms of making sure that we were hitting the same \nkind of high-quality standard and high-effort standard that Jim had in \nhis work.\n  He is a terrific human being. He is a terrific husband and father. He \nhas been an outstanding United States Senator. He will be greatly \nmissed within this institution and by his friends who love him.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am deeply honored to be here tonight and \nto follow my friend, Senator Riegle, who will be sorely missed. I spent \nquite a few moments on this floor the day that he decided he would not \nseek reelection, saying that the people who work for a living, who work \nwith their hands, who are not privileged, are going to miss Don Riegle. \nI reiterate that today, and I wish him every wish.\n  You can tell from the emotion in his voice that he is very torn. It \nwas his decision to leave here voluntarily. Some of the rest of us do \nnot have that privilege.\n  By the way, I have lost an election in my life. It is a very \ndifficult thing. But, you know, when you lose an election, there are a \nlot of reasons. In the case of my friend, Jim Sasser, it had nothing to \ndo with him. It was a much greater force that was at work. I want him \nto understand that and to know that.\n  I want to take a little different tack. I want to thank the people of \nTennessee for sending us this man for 18 years. For me, it was a gift.\n  When I came here--I have only been here 2 years--I wanted to get on \nhis committee, his Budget Committee. I had served over in the House for \n10 years. I had spent 6 years on the Budget Committee and I watched Jim \nSasser work, and this was someone I wanted to work with. I wanted to \nhelp.\n  I have to say, he was very tough. He wanted to make sure that I had \nthe stuff, that I was going to be able to make the tough votes, because \nit is not easy on that committee. He really made sure before he \nsupported me that I would be able to cast those votes, that I had what \nit took, that I would be there when maybe I had to cast a vote that was \nnot popular. And, of course, I respected him all the more for making me \npass this test.\n  When I got on the committee, I really became a student of Jim Sasser. \nIn many ways, he has been a teacher here in the U.S. Senate, a teacher \non the economy, a teacher on many, many issues; a teacher on how to be \na good Senator, how to be brave and courageous and true to yourself, \nbut yet understand the art of compromise that it takes to make things \nhappen here.\n  If you think it is easy to get a budget resolution through this \nplace, then you simply have not watched the U.S. Senate. And this man \ndid it over and over and over again. Why? Because he is so respected \nand so trusted.\n  So I say to the people of Tennessee, we in politics have to accept \nwhat happens at election time. For some of us, this was a painful \nelection; for others, it was a joyous election.\n  I can tell you, when I watched what happened in Pennsylvania, and my \nfriend Harris Wofford lost a very close race, we lost a voice of reason \nand sanity and common sense and compassion.\n  And when I look to Tennessee, I lost my chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and the people of this country lost more than they really \nwill ever understand.\n  So I am a very fortunate person that I was able to serve with Jim \nSasser for 2 years on his Budget Committee, on the Banking Committee. \nWe have become very good friends. I will consider him forever to be a \nmentor, and if he is willing to be an adviser to me, I would consider \nmyself very fortunate.\n  I think it is important to note that many of us here wanted him to be \nour leader. I do not think that should go unsaid. There are very few \npeople--very few people, indeed--that win the trust of their colleagues \nthe way this man has done. And it is because of his decency and his \nintegrity and his caring and, yes, his toughness.\n  The other day, the people of Tennessee suffered a terrible natural \ndisaster. It was a hurricane, I think. I quickly thought, how lucky \nthey are to have Jim Sasser out there fixing it, making sure the \nFederal Government responded. And I caught myself and I said, ``But he \nis only going to be here for a few more days.''\n  And so I understand the people of Tennessee, am I right, have never \nreally sent back a Senator more than three terms? Is that correct, \nSenator Sasser? Once they did? They had a second time to do it in \nhistory, and they chose to go for change. They will decide if they made \nthe right decision.\n  But I can just say as someone who really for the first year watched \nwhat went on here and watched who the leaders were and watched who the \nconsistent people were and watched who the compassionate people were, \nand watched for the people who really cared about the people who may \nnot be able to afford to put on a pin-stripe suit and fly down here and \nmake their case, I watched for who those people were here. And one of \nthose people was my chairman, Jim Sasser.\n  I hope when he gets over the pain of this that he will sit back and \nsmile at what he has been able to do for this Nation. Senator Riegle \ntouched on it. Senator Glenn touched on it. We had an economy in this \ncountry that was falling apart. We had a budget deficit that was going \nthrough the roof. We had a President who went to Japan for a trip and \ntried to tell the Japanese to lower their interest rates, and he got \nsick in Japan, and that image became the symbol of our economic \nweakness.\n  But with this new President and Jim Sasser serving on the Budget \nCommittee, we are getting our economic house in order. And I say to my \nfriend, how many people in America could ever know that they played \nsuch a role? I say, I do not know of anybody else, personally. It is \nextraordinary and it was hard. My image of Jim Sasser I will always \nhave: In this Chamber, with his charts and his pointer and his sense of \nknowing exactly what had to be said to make the point.\n  There are so many other things I could say about what Jim Sasser did \nfor Tennessee's environment, the Smoky Mountains, all the things he did \nfor people who will never meet him and never know what he did.\n  I will close and say to my friend, having lost an election myself, \nyour life is definitely not over. It just takes a different twist and a \ndifferent turn. There are so many ways that the voice of Jim Sasser \nmust be heard, and I am completely confident--completely confident--\nthat it will continue to be heard.\n  He knows that I feel very strongly about the kind of person he is, \nand I will never, never forget his friendship, his help, and the many \nwonderful times that we spent together in the U.S. Senate.\n  To his family, I say you are lucky to get to see him a little more \nthese days. And to his constituents in Tennessee, thank you for sending \nhim back to us for 18 years. You made a gift to this Nation and this \nNation will ever be grateful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MATHEWS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Campbell).

The people in the Nation are \nbetter today because of what Jim Sasser has done.\n  If you look at the history of our State, you will find that Tennessee \nhas a tradition of sending men and women of distinction to the Congress \nand to Washington to play their important role of setting the course of \naction for our Nation. If we look back, we see that our State has \nfurnished three Presidents: Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Andrew \nJohnson, all men of distinction who came from Tennessee to DC and left \nthere imprimatur on this Nation.\n  We have furnished the Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, and more \nrecently such leaders as Estes Kefauver and Howard Baker and Albert \nGore, Sr., and Jr. And Albert Gore, Jr., sits in the White House as \nVice President today, and because of that, I was privileged to be \nappointed to serve in his place and I have served with Jim for 2 years.\n  So I am sure it was no surprise to anyone here that a person of Jim \nSasser's ability and distinction and compassion was elected from our \nState to serve this Nation.\n  Jim came from a family of modest means, like many of us who are here. \nAs was said by someone a couple of years ago, he was not born with \neither a silver spoon or a silver foot in his mouth. He was born with a \nheart as big as this Nation, and he has tried to share that heart in \nmaking life easier for Tennesseans, to be sure, but to make life easier \nfor the people of this Nation by having the foresight through the \nBudget Committee and through the Banking Committee, and others, to \nstand firm on those actions that he felt were needed in order to make \nlife better for America.\n  Jim, I say to you on behalf of Tennesseans, what happened is as \nunexplainable as the flood last year that devastated the midsection of \nour country. You led with distinction, and the love that we Tennesseans \nhave for you remains today. Because of you, as everyone here has \nmentioned, this is a better Nation, ours is a better State, and we want \nyou to know that we look forward to your being a moving force in \nTennessee government and Tennessee politics, and we will be there when \nyou need us. We will be there to help in any way that we can.\n  On behalf of the people of Tennessee, thanks for the good job that \nyou have done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about my colleague \nfrom Tennessee, Jim Sasser. I just cannot tell you how saddened I am \nabout the decision of November 8 in Tennessee. Tomorrow, our caucus is \ngoing to have a vote on leadership. I am a candidate in that race. I do \nnot know this evening what the outcome of that will be. It is a close \nrace. But I would not be a candidate had Jim Sasser been reelected from \nTennessee. I say with all due respect to my opponent, and I am sure he \nwill appreciate this in the contest tomorrow, that had Jim Sasser been \nreelected, he would be the new minority leader of the U.S. Senate, in \nmy view.\n  I say this not just because I was a supporter of his, but because of \nmy deep appreciation for the vision that Jim Sasser brought to the U.S. \nSenate. I was the most junior member of his Budget Committee for a \nnumber of years and watched a remarkable, remarkable performance by one \nUnited States Senator. Time after time, he marshalled the votes and \nbrought together people of totally different persuasions and opinions \non one of the most difficult jobs that any Member of this body has. \nThat is to fashion a budget in the environments that we have been \nliving in. And he did it successfully, on six different occasions, in \naddition to three reconciliation bills. These victories came under the \ntightest and most difficult circumstances--even in a Republican \nadministration under George Bush, when he fashioned one of the most \ndifficult budget compromises in modern history.\n  So, let me just add to the words of my colleagues, Don Riegle and \nJohn Glenn, Barbara Boxer and Harlan Mathews and many others who have \nspoken about Jim Sasser's contribution to the Senate, his contribution \nto his State, and his contribution to the country.\n  Let me also say that while people may look at this body through some \nobjective lens, those of us who serve together here develop strong and \ndeep friendships. I have developed one of those friendships with Jim \nSasser.\n  I listened to Don Riegle only a few moments ago talk about his \nfather, a person who had been involved in the politics of Michigan. And \nI know of Jim Sasser's experience through his father. I had a similar \nexperience with my father. We are second-generation Democrats, second-\ngeneration members of families that believed deeply in public service.\n  From his earliest days of involvement as a driver with Estes Kefauver \nto his work putting together a new party in 1973 in Tennessee, Jim \nSasser has demonstrated over and over and over again his deep, deep \npatriotism for this country; his deep, deep love for the values that \nAmerica holds dear.\n  So, in these waning hours of the 103d Congress, I wanted to join my \ncolleagues in saying to Jim that you will be missed dearly by this \nMember. I would have enjoyed nothing more--nothing more than to have \nworked with the minority leader, Jim Sasser, in trying to put together \nthe creative alternatives that we are going to have to fashion in this \ncoming Congress. I would have enjoyed working with him as he shepherded \na Democratic Party in the Senate, as he had done in his State, to the \nideals and values and principles that have been the pillars of his own \nlife in public service.\n  So, Jim, to you tonight, and to Mary and your children, I say God \nbless and Godspeed, but know as well that you have a lifelong friend in \nyour colleague from Connecticut.

I learned a lot from Don, and so much of it was beyond the process.\n\tBut more important, I think, was the need to feel something really deeply and fight for it, stand up for it, even on the most contentious issue where he served a minority view: tenacious and deliberate--good guy.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Frank R.

Mr. President, Jim Sasser has greatly distinguished himself \nduring his 18 years of service in the Senate as one of the hardest \nworking, most intelligent and most dedicated and effective Senator with \nwhom I have had the privilege of serving in my now 36 years in the \nSenate.\n  Senator Sasser assumed the chairmanship of the Budget Committee in \n1989, the same year that I became chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee. Over the past 6 years, we have worked together on a number \nof important budgetary and appropriations matters. And it has been \ntruly a joy--a joy that I shall remember as long as I serve in this \nbody and as long as the Lord God gives me life.\n  We both represented the Senate at the budget summit in 1990. Although \nlater disowned by President Bush because it was politically unpopular, \nthat summit resulted in a number of important improvements to the \nBudget Act. Among those improvements were the institution of binding \ncaps, enforceable through a sequester on discretionary spending, along \nwith provisions to hold appropriations harmless for miscalculations and \neconomic and technical forecasts.\n  The agreement also created the pay-as-you-go requirements on \nentitlement spending. I think that Jim Sasser was the key Senator at \nthat budget summit. He worked tirelessly to protect the prerogatives of \nCongress in budgetary matters, while at the same time cutting the \nbudget deficit by an estimated $450 to $500 billion.\n  Jim Sasser also serves on the Appropriations Committee, where he has \nbeen the very able chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee \nfor a number of years. As the subcommittee chairman, Senator Sasser ran \na very tight ship. He--unlike some of the other subcommittee chairmen--\noften recommended cuts in the military construction budget, below what \nthe President requested. Yet, he was always careful to ensure that the \nvital needs of the military were met and that they were kept.\n  More than this, Jim Sasser has been a very pleasant man with whom to \nwork, a man who has a way of putting other people at ease in his \npresence. He is my friend; he has been my friend, and he will always be \nmy friend.\n  He has served this Nation and the State of Tennessee with great \nintegrity and distinction throughout his service in the Senate.\n  Darius the Great was sitting at dinner with others in his court and \nhe was presented with a pomegranate. He was asked what he would like to \nhave if he could indeed have a wish fulfilled, and he turned to his \nbrother Artabanes and said, ``If I could have as many Megabazes, as \nmany Megabazes''--Megabazes was the name of one of his foremost \ngenerals--``If I could have as many Megabazes as there are seeds in \nthat pomegranate I would be pleased more than if I could be ruler of \nall Greece.''\n  So, Mr. President, I have that feeling about Jim Sasser. If I could \nhave had as many effective and loyal and dedicated friends and \ncolleagues as was Jim Sasser, then I would have enjoyed my service on \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee as its chairman even more than it \nwas my pleasure to enjoy.\n  Jim Sasser, perhaps more than any other person that I know of, \nembodies the word of the official slogan of the State of Tennessee. \n``Tennessee--America At Its Best.'' Jim Sasser is Tennessee and Jim \nSasser is America at its best.\n  It is not enough to say in your heart that you like a man for his \nways. It is not enough that we fill our minds with songs of silent \npraise. Nor is it enough that we honor a man as our confidence upward \nmounts. It is going right up to the man himself and telling him so that \ncounts.\n  Then when a man does a deed that you really admire do not leave a \nkind word unsaid for fear to do so might make him vain or cause him to \nlose his head but reach out your hand and tell him well done and see \nhow his gratitude swells. It is not the flowers we throw on the graves. \nIt is the word to the living that tells.\n  My wife Erma joins me in the expression of these sentiments, and I \nmust say that here was a man who really had the markings of not only a \ngood Senator but a great Senator.\n  Any individual who can bring that Budget Committee together and \ndevelop a consensus and bring tough controversial well-crafted measures \nout of that committee had to have ability. He must have had a more than \nordinary portion of patience. And I personally, as one who was a \nmajority leader upon two different occasions, want to express my \ngratitude to Jim Sasser for the service that he rendered as chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. I will express my gratitude to him for \nthe service he rendered there and as the former minority leader in this \nbody together with service as majority leader, as I have already \nmentioned, it was my experience always when I wanted to call other \nSenators together, when I called other Senators together to get a \nfeeling of what the situation was with respect to the body and in what \ndirection we should prepare to move as we looked ahead, how we could \nbest craft the program of our party, Jim Sasser was one of those whom I \nalways called to sit in on those deliberations.\n  I have seen men and women come and I have seen men and women go, but \nI am truly sad to see Jim Sasser say farewell as a Member of the body.\n\n     The roses red upon my neighbor's vine\n     Are owned by him, but they are also mine.\n     His was the cost, and his the labor, too.\n     But mine as well as his the joy,\n     their loveliness to view.\n     They bloom for me and are for me as fair\n     As for the man who gives them all his care.\n     Thus I am rich, because a good man grew\n     A rose-clad vine for all his neighbors view.\n     I know from this that others plant for me,\n     And what they own, my joy may also be.\n     So why be selfish, when so much that's fine\n     Is grown for me, upon my Tennessee neighbor's vine.\n\n  I thank God for the privilege of working with Jim Sasser, and I am \ngrateful for the opportunity to say this publicly. I am sorry it is \nunder such circumstances, but we all know that life has its ups and \ndowns, its defeats and its victories, and we accept them as they come, \nalways looking upwards, not backyards and believing that the future may \npresent the opportunities still to serve, especially to one who is so \ncapable in service to his country and to his State.\n  Mr. SASSER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. SASSER. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues and friends \nfor those touching and generous words.\n  I must say that I feel a bit like Tom Sawyer peeping out from behind \nthe church balcony listening to his own funeral eulogy.\n  I am looking forward to the next chapter of my life with the same \nenergy, exuberance and expectations that I brought to Washington 18 \nyears ago.\n  Today I look back with no bitterness, with no remorse and with no \nregrets.\n  The memories I will take with me from the Senate will be warm ones.\n  I have had 18 wonderful years in this great institution doing what I \nknew best, doing what I loved best, and doing it with passion and \ndevotion.\n  Not many men and women have been so fortunate.\n  It has been my greatest reward and my greatest honor to represent the \npeople of Tennessee.\n  I did my very best to ease their burdens and to nourish their dreams.\n  Abraham Lincoln once remarked:\n\n       I want it said of me by those who know me best that I \n     always plucked a thistle and planted a flower where I thought \n     a flower would grow.\n\n  I would hope that my Senate career will be recollected and \ncharacterized in such a warm and caring light.\n  Mr. President, our Nation seems to be in the midst of a very \ntroubling season, a day and age often punctuated by high anxiety, a \ntime when cynicism whittles away at our time-honored institutions of \ndemocracy.\n  But I depart this great institution with only the highest esteem for \nit and for the men and women who serve our Nation, men and women who \ngive so unselfishly of themselves, men and women who bring the hopes, \ndreams, and fears of the American people to be played out on this \nstage, men and women who still hear and give shape to the thundering \npromise of America.\n  I have been privileged to serve with them.\n  Finally, Mr. President I want to take a moment to thank my wonderful \nwife, Mary, and my children, Gray and Elizabeth, for everything they \nhave done, for the enormous sacrifices they made for me. They have been \nthe center of my life and they always will be.\n  I want to thank my staff for their tireless work and for the loyalty \nthey have shown me. It has been my honor to serve with these dedicated, \nfine individuals.\n  Mr. President, the hour approaches. And even though time often seems \nto stand still in the Senate, it's time for me to say to all of my \nfriends and colleagues, ``Thank you, Godspeed and Goodbye.''\n  Mr. President, may I just say to my distinguished friend from West \nVirginia how much I appreciate the remarks that he has made this \nevening and say that the distinguished President pro tempore over many \nyears has taught me many things, including an enormous respect for this \ninstitution. And I leave here feeling very reassured that our friend \nfrom West Virginia will be here to instill in other new Senators as \nthey come the sense of tradition of the U.S. Senate and its place in \nour system of Government.\n  I thank the distinguished President pro tempore for his remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader, Mr. Mitchell, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the \nwords of the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate about \nour friend and colleague, Jim Sasser. And while I know that I cannot \nmatch his eloquence, I can match his affection for Senator Sasser and \nhis regret at the fact that Senator Sasser will be leaving the Senate.\n  I thank the distinguished President pro tempore for his truly \neloquent and obviously heartfelt words about someone who he and I and \nmany other Senators share a great affection and immense respect.\n  I first had the pleasure of meeting Jim Sasser a quarter a century \nago when we were both active in political campaigns in our respective \nStates.\n  I have had the pleasure of calling him a friend over those many \nyears. When I entered the Senate, he was already here and because of \nour earlier friendship, he welcomed me, made me feel at home, greatly \nassisted me, as he has so many others who followed.\n  I do not think any Member of the Senate has a tougher job than the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. I think every Senator recognizes \nthat.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, one of the most fortuitous moments of my life \noccurred when, 14 years ago, after having been appointed to the Senate \nand then in the election of 1980, having seen the Senate revert from \nDemocratic to Republican control, I was summarily kicked off the Budget \nCommittee after only 5 months of service there. At the time, my \nfeelings were hurt. But I shortly thereafter was able to gain \nappointment to the Finance Committee, where I served since then. In my \nmind, that is the best trade since the Yankees got Babe Ruth from the \nRed Sox for a couple of minor leaguers many years ago.\n  I saw firsthand, in my limited time on the Budget Committee and in my \nprior experience with Senator Muskie, who was the first chairman of \nthat committee, and since then, especially as majority leader, the \nextremely difficult and demanding, indeed, the punishing task of \nserving as chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  Everyone here has one or more tough tasks. And I think it is fair to \nsay Senator Byrd, as the distinguished former leader, and myself \nserving in this position, being majority leader is no piece of cake. \nBut there is nothing here that compares to serving as chairman of the \nBudget Committee. It is the toughest job there is.\n  No one has ever done it with greater skill, tact, patience and, most \nimportantly, success than has Jim Sasser. He has led the way \ncourageously, at great political risk and cost to himself, to economic \npolicies which have benefited the people of this Nation. As a direct \nresult of what Jim Sasser has done, unemployment in America is today \nmuch lower than it has been at any time for several years, the Federal \nbudget deficit next year will go down for the third year in a row, the \nfirst time that has happened in 50 years, economic growth is rising and \nthe economy is growing, nearly 5 million jobs have been created in the \npast 21 months. All of that directly resulting, at least in part, from \nthe actions taken by the Congress shaped and guided by Senator Sasser.\n  We are going to miss him very much, not just in personal terms, which \nwill be large enough, but in terms of his service to the Senate and to \nthe country. And I know, because I regard Jim Sasser as a very close \nand dear friend, that he will be sorely missed.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Sasser for all he has done. It has \nbeen a real pleasure to serve with him and now to leave the Senate with \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SASSER\n\n\tMr. BYRD.

The majority leader, Mr. Mitchell, is recognized.\n\tMr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I listened with great interest to the words of the distinguished President pro tempore of the Senate about our friend and colleague, Jim Sasser. And while I know that I cannot match his eloquence, I can match his affection for Senator Sasser and his regret at the fact that Senator Sasser will be leaving the Senate.\n\tI thank the distinguished President pro tempore for his truly eloquent and obviously heartfelt words about someone who he and I and many other Senators share a great affection and immense respect.\n\tI first had the pleasure of meeting Jim Sasser a quarter a century ago when we were both active in political campaigns in our respective States.\n\tI have had the pleasure of calling him a friend over those many years. When I entered the Senate, he was already here and because of our earlier friendship, he welcomed me, made me feel at home, greatly assisted me, as he has so many others who followed.\n\tI do not think any Member of the Senate has a tougher job than the chairman of the Budget Committee. I think every Senator recognizes that.\n\tIndeed, Mr. President, one of the most fortuitous moments of my life occurred when, 14 years ago, after having been appointed to the Senate and then in the election of 1980, having seen the Senate revert from Democratic to Republican control, I was summarily kicked off the Budget Committee after only 5 months of service there. At the time, my feelings were hurt. But I shortly thereafter was able to gain appointment to the Finance Committee, where I served since then. In my mind, that is the best trade since the Yankees got Babe Ruth from the Red Sox for a couple of minor leaguers many years ago.\n\tI saw firsthand, in my limited time on the Budget Committee and in my prior experience with Senator Muskie, who was the first chairman of that committee, and since then, especially as majority leader, the extremely difficult and demanding, indeed, the punishing task of serving as chairman of the Budget Committee.\n\tEveryone here has one or more tough tasks. And I think it is fair to say Senator Byrd, as the distinguished former leader, and myself serving in this position, being majority leader is no piece of cake. But there is nothing here that compares to serving as chairman of the Budget Committee. It is the toughest job there is.\n\tNo one has ever done it with greater skill, tact, patience and, most importantly, success than has Jim Sasser. He has led the way courageously, at great political risk and cost to himself, to economic policies which have benefited the people of this Nation. As a direct result of what Jim Sasser has done, unemployment in America is today much lower than it has been at any time for several years, the Federal budget deficit next year will go down for the third year in a row, the first time that has happened in 50 years, economic growth is rising and the economy is growing, nearly 5 million jobs have been created in the past 21 months. All of that directly resulting, at least in part, from the actions taken by the Congress shaped and guided by Senator Sasser.\n\tWe are going to miss him very much, not just in personal terms, which will be large enough, but in terms of his service to the Senate and to the country. And I know, because I regard Jim Sasser as a very close and dear friend, that he will be sorely missed.\n\tMr. President, I thank Senator Sasser for all he has done. It has been a real pleasure to serve with him and now to leave the Senate with him.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Robert C. Byrd", "Jim Sasser", "George J.

Thank you, George Mitchell and Jim Sasser and my other \ncolleagues. Thank you most of all for your leadership, but also for \nyour warm words.\n  I am almost but not quite happy to be on the distinguished roll of \nthose who are departing, the top of which is George Mitchell who gave \nsuch great leadership in this body.\n  As I say my last words from this desk, I want to tell my colleagues \nwhat an honor and what an opportunity it has been to serve here. The \nties of friendship with so many on both sides of the aisle are \nimportant to me and are going to be lasting.\n  One of the memorable moments for me came when I was asked in my first \nyear to do the annual reading of George Washington's Farewell Address. \nLittle did I think then that I would be making my own so soon.\n  But my thoughts tonight are most of all on how lucky I have been, how \nvery lucky, first, to have been appointed by Governor Robert Casey and \nthen to have been elected by the people of Pennsylvania to fill the \nunexpired term of Senator John Heinz.\n  When I first addressed this body, I said I had vowed to do everything \nin my power to make something good come out of the tragedy of the loss \nof a good Senator, a great Senator like John Heinz. So, I am lucky to \nhave had the chance to help shape and shepherd the National Service \nbill, the Civilian Community Corps, the new CCC bill, the school-to-\nwork opportunity bill, the college reform bill, and to have had the \nchance to work and to fight on so many fronts in this body, some of \nwhich bore fruit, and in all of which, all of these matters it was \nbipartisan cooperation that worked; and in my case, with the help of a \nwonderful staff.\n  Luck ran out for me and for the American people when we failed to \nfind common ground for a health reform bill that would assure all \nAmericans of the kind of choice of private health insurance that \nMembers of Congress and millions of Federal employees and their \nfamilies enjoy.\n  That simple test for health reform that what has been good for \nMembers of Congress is an example of what must be assured for the \nAmerican people, I have often put to this body and to the people of \nPennsylvania. I will continue to use that test as I follow from the \noutside what you do inside this Chamber in these next years. I hope to \nbe able to do something more than to follow. I hope to help from the \noutside to see that we find the ways and means to assure all Americans \ndo have the right to a choice of affordable health care and it becomes \na reality for all Americans.\n  Now, the past is said to be prologue. And I am going to go a little \nfurther back in the past than George Mitchell just did, about my \nactivities. I want to note that this half a term in the Senate has been \nthe high point of more than half a century of involvement with the \nSenate--most of it as a private citizen.\n  The other day, when I was asked to carve my name inside this desk, I \ndiscovered the names of the Senators who preceded me. At the top of the \nlist were the names of Copeland and Wagner, of New York. It made me \nremember that when I was 11 or 12 years old, in a brief Republican \nperiod, I conducted a letter-writing campaign to the Senate against the \ncourt packing plan of Franklin Roosevelt. I have in my scrapbook \nletters from a number of the Senators who sent back responses, and two \nI vividly remember were Royal Copeland, of New York, and Robert Wagner, \nof New York.\n  Let me go back just a little further, elaborating on this. This is my \nunknown long life with the Senate. In 1940 and 1941, I was an \ninterventionist who wanted to fight against Hitler and I actively \nlobbied the Senate in favor of Roosevelt's lend-lease plan.\n  At age 17, in the summer of 1943, just before joining the Army Air \nCorps, I spent many days around the halls of the Senate, seeing \nSenators and asking their support for the B-2-H-2 bill, the Ball-\nBurton-Hatch-Hill bill, a bipartisan bill to promise that the Senate \nwould not go isolationist after the war but would join a world \norganization to keep the peace.\n  Then, in 1947, on the way back from Europe on a converted troop ship, \nwith hundreds of students who had gone to Europe for the summer, \nClaire, my spouse of 46 years--not quite, then--and I organized a \npetition on shipboard to support the Marshall plan. I came down to the \nSenate to deliver it before going back to college.\n  In the 1950's I spent a good deal of time lobbying, unpaid, for the \nfirst Civil Rights Act since reconstruction. After we got that in 1957, \na lot of us kept at it until we won the Comprehensive Civil Rights Acts \nof 1964 and 1965. And in the 1960's, too, there was the effort that \ntook seeing every Senator in the U.S. Senate--Sargeant Schriver did, \nand Bill Moyers, and I was at their side often--to get the first Peace \nCorps bill passed. Before long, some of us, including Jay Rockefeller \nand Paul Simon, and later joined by Peace Corps volunteer Chris Dodd, \nwho spoke earlier, started the campaign for national service to bring \nthe idea of the Peace Corps home to this country. The first victory \nthere was the Volunteers in Service to America bill, VISTA.\n  So if past is prologue, and it often seems to be, all this suggests \nthat you may see more of me--not as a Senator, but once again as a \ncitizen who will do his best to help the Senate do its duty.\n  On election night I said something, but it was cut off on television \nso not many would have known that I said it. But on election night, \nafter thanking so many people--I had about half the voters of \nPennsylvania minus 80-some thousand to thank--I said: To all things \nthere is a season, turning to some good old words.\n  There is a time to win and a time to lose; a time to plant and a time \nto reap. And, above all, I think in this country today, where we know \nthere is a time to tear down, the time has come for us, together, to \nbuild.\n  Thank you.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndramatically successful wetlands conservation program and the architect \nof that program, our majority leader, Senator Mitchell.\n  Last month, the New York Times reported that after decades of \ndecline, waterfowl populations are on the rebound in North America. The \nspring of 1994 is reported to be the most successful breeding season \nfor ducks since the 1950's. According to this article the population of \nbreeding ducks among the 10 most common species jumped to an estimated \n32.5 million in 1994. This represents an increase of 24 percent above \nlast year and 5 percent above the long-term average.\n  The Times article cites the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, \nauthored by Senator Mitchell in 1988, as one of the major factors \naccounting for the resurgence of waterfowl populations. In drafting \nthis legislation, Senator Mitchell looked beyond State, regional, and \neven national boundaries and recognized that only a comprehensive, \ninternational conservation effort would stem the decline in migratory \nbird populations.\n  The North American Wetlands Conservation Act is a model for public/\nprivate sector cooperation and innovation. The act encourages \npartnerships among public agencies and private interests to conserve \nwetlands ecosystems for migratory birds and other fish and wildlife in \nthe United States, Canada, and Mexico. One of the major purposes of the \nact is to help accomplish the goals of the North American Wetlands \nWaterfowl Management Plan--which sets out specific continentwide \nconservation measures. Thus far 342 public and private partner or \npartner groups have contributed to over 317 wetlands conservation \nprojects across North America.\n  Under Senator Mitchell's leadership, the North American wetlands \nprogram has made substantial progress, despite the severe budgetary \nconstraints of recent years. In just the 5 years since the act was \npassed, over 860,000 acres of critical wetlands habitats have been \nprotected, restored, or enhanced pursuant to the act.\n  This has been possible because the North American program requires \nthat Federal contributions be matched by private funding. As a result, \n$76 million in U.S. Federal moneys has been matched by $154 million in \nnon-Federal funding. In this cost-effective program, Federal dollars \nhave been used to leverage non-Federal contributions by more than a 2-\nto-1 margin. In addition, the involvement of the States and private \nconservation groups have lowered the cost of restoring and enhancing \nwetlands and spurred innovation.\n  Senator Mitchell has also played an active role in building support \nfor the North American program and ensuring it receives adequate \nresources to achieve its potential. He has helped enlist the support of \nother Senators, including Senators Stevens, Nickles, and Byrd, whose \nsupport has been critical to the North American program's continued \nsuccess. In recognition of this impressive record, I was pleased to \ncosponsor, along with Senator Mitchell, a bill to reauthorize the North \nAmerican Act, which the Congress approved last month.\n  The North American Wetlands Conservation Act is a landmark law, which \nhas already made a major contribution to the conservation of this \nNation's wildlife. It will benefit the natural resources of this \ncontinent and will be an enduring legacy of the environmental \nleadership of Senator Mitchell. The success of the Wetlands \nConservation Act is proof that one Senator--George Mitchell in this \ncase--can be an extraordinary force for good.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed, as \nfollows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 11, 1994]\n\n                 Prairie Ducks Return in Record Numbers\n\n                        (By William K. Stevens)\n\n       Few birds are more avidly sought after by nature fanciers \n     and hunters alike than the ducks, and a lot of people have \n     been distressed to watch the sharp decline of wild duck \n     populations over the last decade.\n       Now, though, the biggest flocks in years are forming up on \n     marshes across the mid-North American continent for their \n     annual migration south. The once-dwindling numbers of \n     mallards and widgeons, pintails and teal, redheads and \n     canvasbacks, gadwalls, shovelers and scaups have suddenly and \n     spectacularly rebounded, according to the United States Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, raising hopes for a long-term recovery.\n       The population of breeding ducks this year was double the \n     average of the last four decades in the ``prairie pothole'' \n     region of the Dakotas and Montana, the heart of the \n     midcontinental ``duck factory'' where most of North America's \n     ducklings are fledged--vivid evidence of how profoundly the \n     restoration of lost habitat can affect wild creatures.\n       Under Federal legislation passed nearly a decade ago, \n     millions of acres of farmland in the prairie pothole region \n     have been converted to grassland reserves where ducks can \n     nest in safety from predators. At the same time, hundreds of \n     thousands of acres of prairie potholes and other wetlands \n     that attract and feed ducks have been restored. And two wet \n     years in a row, after a decade-long dry spell, doubled the \n     number of ponds and puddles in much of the pothole region \n     during last spring's breeding season.\n       Together these three factors made the spring of 1994 the \n     most successful breeding season for ducks since the 1950's \n     and 1970's in the midcontinental United States and southern \n     Canada.\n       The success confirms the operating premise of the North \n     American Waterfowl Management Plan, a program in the United \n     States, Canada and Mexico to rebuild waterfowl populations \n     over the long term, said a member of the program, Michael W. \n     Tome. ``When you put good habitat and water conditions \n     together at the same time, you're going to produce ducks,'' \n     said Dr. Tome, a Fish and Wildlife Service specialist in \n     migratory birds.\n       But the permanence of the duck recovery is in doubt. The \n     Conservation Reserve Program created by the Farm Security Act \n     of 1985, the main purpose of which is to combat erosion on \n     fallow land, rescued more than 10 million acres of farmland \n     in the prairie pothole region. As it happens, the land is \n     prime duck nesting habitat. But wildlife experts and \n     conservationsts are worried that Congress may not renew the \n     program when it expires next year. They are also concerned \n     that farmers may not sign up for a new program.\n       While ``it's good to hear'' about this year's resurgence of \n     ducks, ``it would be a mistake to say we've turned some \n     permanent corner,'' said Dr. Joseph S. Larson, a wetlands \n     biologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.\n       Still, conservationists see this year's convergence of \n     positive factors as a chance for further progress. It is \n     ``probably the best opportunity to produce waterfowl on a \n     broad-scale basis we've had since the 1950's,'' said Jeff \n     Nelson, chief biologist for Ducks Unlimited, a private \n     conservation organization and leader in conserving duck \n     habitat. ``The reason is, we haven't had this extensive an \n     area of grass with this kind of water since those days.''\n       While wet and dry climatic cycles cause natural \n     fluctuations in duck populations, few ducks will be hatched \n     even in the wettest of years if there is insufficient nesting \n     habitat. ``Water attracts ducks to the landscape, but water \n     doesn't make ducks,'' said Ron Reynolds, a wildlife biologist \n     who heads the Fish and Wildlife Service's habitat and \n     population study team based in Bismarck, N.D.\n       Different species of ducks make different use of ponds and \n     wetlands. There are dabbing ducks and diving ducks, Dabbling \n     ducks, also known as puddle ducks, feed in shallow water, \n     dipping their heads just below the surface to eat plants, \n     insects and small fish. They build their nests on uplands \n     near the water. Mallards, pintails, teal, gadwalls, widgeons \n     and shovelers are dabblers. Divining ducks like the redhead \n     and canvasback, on the other hand, plunge into deep water to \n     feed on the bottom and make their nests on floating mats of \n     vegetation.\n       The dabbling ducks took a double hit when the wetlands were \n     drained and their nesting areas converted to farmland. The \n     loss, combined with a prolonged midcontinental dry spell, \n     sent breeding populations into a tailspin. The number of \n     Northern pintails shrank by nearly two-thirds; that of blue-\n     winged teal, widgeons and mallards dropped by nearly a third \n     each, and the population of readheads by nearly a quarter. By \n     the 1990's, North American ducks seemed in serious trouble. \n     Most of the decline took place in the midcontinent, the very \n     heart of duck country. The climate was more favorable and the \n     habitat more stable on the eastern and western ends of the \n     continent. But far fewer ducks breed there.\n       ``The reason ducks have declined is low nesting success,'' \n     said Mr. Reynolds. Diving ducks had fewer wetlands for their \n     floating nests and the dabblers, confined to shrunken patches \n     of grassland, could not conceal their eggs and young from \n     foxes, crows and many other predators.\n       Governments have joined forces with private organizations \n     like Ducks Unlimited and the Nature Conservancy to restore \n     wetlands in the prairie pothole region, an especially \n     important development for diving ducks. But the Conservation \n     Reserve Program has brought the biggest habitat dividends by \n     far. The program paid farmers to protect formerly cultivated \n     land that lay fallow, often because of fallen crop prices.\n       Although the main purpose of the program was to prevent \n     soil erosion, it turned out that as the grasslands grew back, \n     an abundance of thick cover was created for ducks, as well as \n     other birds like meadowlarks, black terns, bobolinks and \n     sandpipers. Along with the grasslands and birds there \n     returned a variety of wildflowers, small mammals and \n     invertebrates.\n       The grasslands also tipped a balance between two of the \n     duck's main predators in the victims' favor. Foxes, which \n     hunt a small area intensively and are the greater threat to \n     ducks, gave way to coyotes that hunt a larger range and \n     plunder fewer nests. ``When we see coyotes on the landscope, \n     we see that as being good news,'' said Mr. Reynolds.\n       At the same time, the biological enrichment that followed \n     the regrowth of grasslands has been good for creatures like \n     meadow voles and white-footed deer mice, offering predators a \n     broader menu: ``They don't have to key in on just duck \n     eggs,'' he said.\n       The other good news for the ducks was heavy precipitation \n     in 1993 and early 1994. Though the historic floods they \n     caused wreaked havoc with the upper Mississippi basin, the \n     summer rains of 1993 also filled many dry potholes and other \n     wetlands. A snowy winter in 1993-94 further increased the \n     number of spring ponds in prairie Canada and the north-\n     central United Stats to six million, according to the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service--47 percent more than a year before and \n     a third more than the long-term average of 1955 through 1994. \n     In Montana and the western Dakotas, the heart of the duck-\n     producting region, the number of ponds was double the long-\n     term average.\n       From this confluence of factors, more ducks congregated \n     this year on the midcontinent breeding grounds than in many \n     years. In a standard survey area encompassing the northern \n     midcontinent and Alaska, the population of breeding ducks \n     among the 10 most abundant species jumped to an estimated \n     32.5 million in 1994, up 24 percent from last year and 5 \n     percent above the long-term average. The increase was mostly \n     accounted for by Montana and the Dakotas, where the \n     population roughly doubled between last year and this, and \n     nearby southern Saskatchewan, where it grew by 64 percent.\n       Just as important, the hatching rate of ducks also went up \n     this year. In the case of mallards, the most abundant and \n     familiar species, about 30 percent of the eggs hatched, \n     compared with 10 or 12 percent before the Conservation \n     Reserve Program's benefits took hold, said Mr. Reynolds. \n     ``Mallards need a nesting success of about 15 percent to \n     maintain their population,'' he said.\n       The Fish and Wildlife Service predicts that when the \n     mallards that hatched last spring join their parents on this \n     fall's migration to wintering grounds in the southern United \n     States and the tropics, 12 million in all, 36 percent more \n     than in 1993, will make the trip. Over all, the fall \n     migration flight from the standard survey area is expected to \n     total 71 million, 20 percent more than in 1993.\n       In fact, said Dr. Tome, this year's 32.5 million breeding \n     ducks in the standard survey area approaches the North \n     American Waterfowl Management plan's long-term recovery \n     target of 36 million for that area--roughly the average count \n     of the 1970's, when at one point it exceeded 40 million for a \n     record. For the entire continent, the recovery target is a \n     breeding population of 62 million by the year 2000, with a \n     fall migration flight of 100 million. No continentwide survey \n     of the present population has been made.\n       The immediate concern, said Mr. Nelson of Ducks Unlimited, \n     ``is that we get them up to where they were in the 1970's \n     before the next dry spell.''\n       For now, anyway, pothole and pond resonate once more with \n     predawn sounds that evoke images of abundance in the mind's \n     eye. Aldo Leopold, the naturalist and conservationist, put it \n     this way in his book ``A Sand County Almanac'': ``When you \n     hear a mallard being audibly enthusiastic about his soup, you \n     are free to picture a score guzzling among the duckweeds. \n     When one widgeon squeals, you may postulate a squadron \n     without fear of visual contradiction.''\n       It will be almost like old times this October as squadron \n     after squadron, species after species rises and, in Leopold's \n     phrase, heads toward the equator ``on quivering wings, \n     ripping the firmament neatly into halves.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n            ON THE NORTH AMERICAN WETLANDS CONSERVATION ACT\n\n\tMr. CHAFEE.

Aldo Leopold, the naturalist and conservationist, put it \n     this way in his book ``A Sand County Almanac'': ``When you \n     hear a mallard being audibly enthusiastic about his soup, you \n     are free to picture a score guzzling among the duckweeds. \n     When one widgeon squeals, you may postulate a squadron \n     without fear of visual contradiction.''\n       It will be almost like old times this October as squadron \n     after squadron, species after species rises and, in Leopold's \n     phrase, heads toward the equator ``on quivering wings, \n     ripping the firmament neatly into halves.''\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["John H.

The course which this legislation followed points \nup how damaging it can be for Congress to procrastinate and stumble \nabout in passing legislation necessary to keep our Federal departments \nand agencies operating.\n  Last July, the Senate passed its version of H.R. 4603, a bill making \nappropriations for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and related agencies. Senate amendments to the bill included \na provision extending for the Securities and Exchange Commission a \nself-financing, higher rate of fee for registering securities. The \nSenate Appropriations Committee forewarned in its report, ``If the \nHouse version of H.R. 4603 stands, the SEC will be forced to shut down \nand cease operations on October 1, 1994.''\n  Nevertheless, because of a jurisdictional dispute between committees \nin the House, the Senate amendment extending the higher rate of fees \nwas deleted in conference. Hence, it became necessary for the House \nfinally to take up and pass a special measure (H.R. 5060) extending the \nhigher rate of registration fees for fiscal year 1995. The bill was not \nreceived in the Senate until September 27.\n\n  Members of Congress had been forewarned by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee report of what might occur if funding for the Securities and \nExchange Commission were not provided by October 1, 1994. Further, \nArthur Levitt, the capable and highly regarded Chairman of the \nCommission, stated in very clear terms what some of the consequences \nwould be if funding were delayed beyond September 30. Nevertheless, the \nprior and continued delays resulted in the Senate not passing H.R. 5060 \nuntil October 8.\n  I am informed, Mr. President, the following resulted from failure to \npass this legislation prior to October 1:\n  From October 1 through October 9--date of enactment--fees paid by \nfilers to register securities offerings were reduced from one twenty-\nninth to one-fiftieth of 1 percent of the offering amount, resulting in \na loss of revenue to the Government of over $20 million.\n  The Commission was forced to cancel 6 mutual fund inspections, 30 \nbroker-dealer examinations, 77 sessions of investigative testimony, and \n18 trips to pursue enforcement investigations.\n\n  Executive and administrative staff also spent hundreds of hours \ntrying to resolve the agency's budget crisis and preparing the agency's \nslowdown and possible shutdown.\n  The staff prepared for a furlough of at least 3 days per week \nbeginning mid-November and for severe reductions in overhead expenses: \ntelephone, travel, mail, enforcement support, automated data services, \nand supplies.\n  Mr. President, this is a glaring example of how the Government should \nnot operate.

In Theresa, he has hired a brilliant, loyal Vermonter who will help make that commitment happen.\n\tTheresa began working in my office almost 10 years ago, answering phones in my front office. From there, she has risen to become one of the most senior and respected staff members on Capitol Hill. Her knowledge of health care issues is unsurpassed. Her ability to work with everyone, whether they are the largest corporations in our society, or those Americans with the greatest needs but the quietest voices, is one of her greatest strengths.\n\tTheresa is one of my closest advisers. She is also a close friend. A native of Barre who grew up in Burlington, Theresa has served our Nation with distinction. Her parents, Roy and Concetta Alberghini, should be proud of their daughter. The people of Vermont are lucky that one of their native daughters is coming home.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Patrick J.

Mr. President, earlier this year, I had the honor to give \nthe commencement address to the class of 1994 of the Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center.\n  The address was given on a beautiful spring day on the main campus of \nGeorgetown University in Washington. It was a most meaningful day for \nmy wife and myself because 30 years before, I had graduated from \nGeorgetown with a law degree but was unable to attend the graduation \nbecause I had returned to Vermont to begin my clerkship in preparation \nfor admission to the Vermont Bar.\n  Both my wife Marcelle and I talked later about how Georgetown had \nfinally given me the graduation I had waited 30 years for, and the \ngratitude felt for that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a text of my remarks at \nGeorgetown be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Humanity and Service Are Formative Principles for a Successful Legal \n                                 Career\n\n       It was 30 years ago that I had the opportunity to sit where \n     you are today. I had been inspired by the knowledge that was \n     gained at this magnificent law school and I was confident of \n     my sharply honed reasoning skills. After all, I had survived \n     the unmerciful pounding of my law professors, these olympian \n     Gods of this institution, and I was surrounded by friends \n     that were going to last me a lifetime. And my generation had \n     been inspired by another young president. He had called on \n     the privileged, which included a lot of us, to serve the \n     underprivileged. He lifted us all in the cause of civil \n     rights. He encouraged us to dedicate ourselves to democratic \n     principles. It was Camelot and it was a brief shining moment \n     in our history. So I remember these years at Georgetown.\n       But in the many years since, the thing I remember most was \n     standing with my wife on a cold November day in my last year \n     of law school--standing on Pennsylvania Avenue with a half a \n     million people so silent you could literally hear the lights \n     click as they changed on the stoplights, and standing near \n     where the law school was at that time we heard the drums as \n     the cortege left the White House bringing the body of John \n     Kennedy up Pennsylvania Avenue. Any one of us who were there \n     will never forget that day, and we knew the future wasn't as \n     structured or predictable as an idealistic young law student \n     had imagined.\n       When I graduated from Georgetown Law School I didn't have \n     the chance to sit here and listen to a graduation speaker. I \n     missed my own commencement exercises. I had to rush home to \n     Vermont, start work, start a clerkship. Marcelle and I packed \n     up our worldly possessions in a rented car, bundled up our \n     infant son, and we held tight to the family fortune of $150. \n     We had Marcelle's final paycheck as a nurse from a local \n     hospital as we headed back to an uncertain future. But in the \n     intervening years I have been fortunate to serve in ways that \n     I really enjoyed: as a lawyer, as a prosecutor, as a United \n     States Senator. And the people of Vermont have been very kind \n     to me. They overlooked the fact that I am a Democrat and the \n     only one they have ever elected. They don't expect me to \n     agree with them all the time, but they expect me to show \n     character and strong and thoughtful representation and \n     integrity, which are the things you have learned if you have \n     really understood what was taught here.\n       These qualities are the greatest assets of a lawyer: to use \n     good judgment and integrity in representing a client. \n     Judgment and integrity are all that separates good lawyers \n     from a mere wordsmith and don't ever forget that because \n     Georgetown has given you the tools of your trade. Learn \n     how to use them. Of course you will read cases, of course \n     you will study the law, of course you will use honest \n     effort, but judgment rests on far more. Good lawyers \n     remain students all their lives because they refine their \n     skills through experience, both inside and outside of the \n     courtroom and law office. Remember what Walter Scott said, \n     ``a lawyer without history or literature is a mechanic, a \n     mere working mason. If he posseses some knowledge of these \n     he may venture to call himself an architect.'' So enjoy \n     the experience of living and teaching others to live. \n     Place a priority on the spiritual life you give your \n     family and then protect that closeness and that privacy \n     with as much zeal as you bring to the courtroom or the \n     negotiating table. The law is going to consume your \n     professional life, but don't let it overwhelm it. Take \n     time for music and literature, tend your gardens however \n     they might be, share with friends and take pleasure in \n     your family, just as your parents or spouses or sons or \n     daughters and family take great pride in you. Take time to \n     take pride in others after this day. You can be a good \n     lawyer and still be a good person. It's possible. It is!\n       Take advantage of the opportunities your education has \n     given you. Take advantage of being happy. You are entering an \n     honorable profession, believe it or not. It's too easily \n     belittled, it's too often reviled for its apparent fixation \n     on money, whether in people or principle. Look at Judge \n     McDonald, look what she has done in serving not only as a \n     federal judge but as a professor and now stepping into the \n     maelstrom of what will be some of the most difficult \n     questions after the tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n       You know the image of the miserable lawyer is shared by too \n     many who are miserable in what they do in their work. They're \n     trying to figure out how they bill 30 hours a day as some do, \n     how to collect fees, how to generate new cases, and they fail \n     to find a way to work on matters they care about. I was \n     fortunate. I found serving in government important and \n     satisfying. I loved being a trial attorney. I thoroughly \n     enjoyed being a prosecutor--incidentally the best job one \n     might have--and then went to the second best job in the \n     United States Senate. And there I have had an interest in \n     health care and the health of children. I have been active on \n     our federal nutrition programs and have written most of them \n     as they now exist, to expand the WIC program for poor \n     pregnant women and their infants and children. We are the \n     wealthiest, most powerful nation on eath. Nobody in this \n     audience goes hungry except by choice. But let me tell you, \n     you can walk five minutes from here and see people who don't \n     have that choice. Work as lawyers and Americans to get rid of \n     hunger in this country.\n       I go to work with scores of professionals, Republicans and \n     Democrats, on Capitol Hill every day. There are young lawyers \n     and older lawyers who work hard to make this nation a better \n     place. So when you leave law school, remember, don't buy into \n     an endless rat race that is made all the more depressing by \n     its apparent meaninglessness. There are other options. \n     Find a way to be happy in your professional life or you \n     have failed the magnificent opportunity you have been \n     given. Think about why you came here.\n       In January of last year another Georgetown graduate took \n     the Presidential oath of office and called upon your \n     generation to serve in the renewal of America in its defining \n     moment and the life of this nation. Now, change is upon us. \n     When I vote on Judge Stephen Breyer's nomination I will--in a \n     short 20 years--have voted on all nine members of the Supreme \n     Court. Think of that change. Think of the change coming for \n     you. Most of you are going to live most of your lives in the \n     next century and that is where our needs are, to balance \n     health care system with privacy requirements, to find out how \n     you can maintain your own privacy, to weigh law enforcement \n     desires for wiretap authority in the age of digital switching \n     with Fourth Amendment rights, consider how intellectual \n     property rights and privacy and security concerns are going \n     to be accommodated along an information superhighway.\n       All these things will involve you as lawyers. But think \n     what it means to you always as an individual if we can put \n     all the information about you in your whole life on a credit \n     card, to be read by a computer. Think about whether you want \n     to give up that privacy. Think of whether your interest is \n     the environment or equal justice or promoting access to those \n     isolated in urban and rural communities and respond to the \n     challenge of what the President has called a ``season of \n     service'' to act on your idealism.\n       The practice of law is not about clever arguments or \n     stirring up lawsuits, but about good men and women resolving \n     disputes, by creating opportunities affecting other people's \n     lives for the better. That is what you can do: seek to \n     maintain faith with our history as we journey to the future.\n       Think of what you have been handed, think of what your \n     responsibilities are. But don't forget you are a person \n     before you are a lawyer. And you have to be true to yourself \n     in that regard. Don't ever forget it. Don't let the rat race \n     get away with you. Keep the promise that you made to yourself \n     when you came here.\n       And let me give a word of thanks. Thirty years ago I had to \n     miss my graduation at Georgetown. Today you gave me the \n     graduation I thought I'd never have and I will always be \n     grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                    GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER\n\n\tMr. LEAHY.

Learn \n     how to use them. Of course you will read cases, of course \n     you will study the law, of course you will use honest \n     effort, but judgment rests on far more. Good lawyers \n     remain students all their lives because they refine their \n     skills through experience, both inside and outside of the \n     courtroom and law office. Remember what Walter Scott said, \n     ``a lawyer without history or literature is a mechanic, a \n     mere working mason. If he posseses some knowledge of these \n     he may venture to call himself an architect.'' So enjoy \n     the experience of living and teaching others to live. \n     Place a priority on the spiritual life you give your \n     family and then protect that closeness and that privacy \n     with as much zeal as you bring to the courtroom or the \n     negotiating table. The law is going to consume your \n     professional life, but don't let it overwhelm it. Take \n     time for music and literature, tend your gardens however \n     they might be, share with friends and take pleasure in \n     your family, just as your parents or spouses or sons or \n     daughters and family take great pride in you. Take time to \n     take pride in others after this day. You can be a good \n     lawyer and still be a good person. It's possible. It is!\n       Take advantage of the opportunities your education has \n     given you. Take advantage of being happy. You are entering an \n     honorable profession, believe it or not. It's too easily \n     belittled, it's too often reviled for its apparent fixation \n     on money, whether in people or principle. Look at Judge \n     McDonald, look what she has done in serving not only as a \n     federal judge but as a professor and now stepping into the \n     maelstrom of what will be some of the most difficult \n     questions after the tragedy of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n       You know the image of the miserable lawyer is shared by too \n     many who are miserable in what they do in their work. They're \n     trying to figure out how they bill 30 hours a day as some do, \n     how to collect fees, how to generate new cases, and they fail \n     to find a way to work on matters they care about. I was \n     fortunate. I found serving in government important and \n     satisfying. I loved being a trial attorney. I thoroughly \n     enjoyed being a prosecutor--incidentally the best job one \n     might have--and then went to the second best job in the \n     United States Senate. And there I have had an interest in \n     health care and the health of children. I have been active on \n     our federal nutrition programs and have written most of them \n     as they now exist, to expand the WIC program for poor \n     pregnant women and their infants and children. We are the \n     wealthiest, most powerful nation on eath. Nobody in this \n     audience goes hungry except by choice. But let me tell you, \n     you can walk five minutes from here and see people who don't \n     have that choice. Work as lawyers and Americans to get rid of \n     hunger in this country.\n       I go to work with scores of professionals, Republicans and \n     Democrats, on Capitol Hill every day. There are young lawyers \n     and older lawyers who work hard to make this nation a better \n     place. So when you leave law school, remember, don't buy into \n     an endless rat race that is made all the more depressing by \n     its apparent meaninglessness. There are other options. \n     Find a way to be happy in your professional life or you \n     have failed the magnificent opportunity you have been \n     given. Think about why you came here.\n       In January of last year another Georgetown graduate took \n     the Presidential oath of office and called upon your \n     generation to serve in the renewal of America in its defining \n     moment and the life of this nation. Now, change is upon us. \n     When I vote on Judge Stephen Breyer's nomination I will--in a \n     short 20 years--have voted on all nine members of the Supreme \n     Court. Think of that change. Think of the change coming for \n     you. Most of you are going to live most of your lives in the \n     next century and that is where our needs are, to balance \n     health care system with privacy requirements, to find out how \n     you can maintain your own privacy, to weigh law enforcement \n     desires for wiretap authority in the age of digital switching \n     with Fourth Amendment rights, consider how intellectual \n     property rights and privacy and security concerns are going \n     to be accommodated along an information superhighway.\n       All these things will involve you as lawyers. But think \n     what it means to you always as an individual if we can put \n     all the information about you in your whole life on a credit \n     card, to be read by a computer. Think about whether you want \n     to give up that privacy. Think of whether your interest is \n     the environment or equal justice or promoting access to those \n     isolated in urban and rural communities and respond to the \n     challenge of what the President has called a ``season of \n     service'' to act on your idealism.\n       The practice of law is not about clever arguments or \n     stirring up lawsuits, but about good men and women resolving \n     disputes, by creating opportunities affecting other people's \n     lives for the better. That is what you can do: seek to \n     maintain faith with our history as we journey to the future.\n       Think of what you have been handed, think of what your \n     responsibilities are. But don't forget you are a person \n     before you are a lawyer. And you have to be true to yourself \n     in that regard. Don't ever forget it. Don't let the rat race \n     get away with you. Keep the promise that you made to yourself \n     when you came here.\n       And let me give a word of thanks. Thirty years ago I had to \n     miss my graduation at Georgetown. Today you gave me the \n     graduation I thought I'd never have and I will always be \n     grateful.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Patrick J.

Mr. President, earlier this year, the Washington Post \nwrote an article about one of the most extraordinary people in \nWashington.\n  John D. Podesta is an assistant to the President and is also White \nHouse staff secretary.\n  John Podesta is also a very special friend, a valued adviser, and an \nadmired public servant. John has worked with me as a key political \nadviser and with me and the U.S. Senate in capacities ranging from \nlegal counsel to chief of staff. In every capacity, he has set the \nstandard of excellence.\n  I have benefited greatly from his friendship and advice. Our country \nis benefited every day by his service to America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article from the \nWashington Post profiling John Podesta be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 5, 1994]\n\n     When Cleaning Up Is the Worst Job: A Whitewater Success Story\n\n                         (By David Von Drehle)\n\n       John Podesta has been questioned before a federal grant \n     jury, he has been obliged to correct the president of the \n     United States--veeerry carefully--he has been assigned to \n     explain the First Lady's commodities trading, and then to \n     change his explanation.\n       And he is a Whitewater success story.\n       This has been life among the ruins of the Clinton \n     administration's early Whitewater damage control. Podesta's \n     job is to clean up the mess that was made the first time \n     around. But so extensive was the mess that the cleaning man \n     got dirty.\n       A lot of insiders say Podesta has the worst job in \n     Washington. They're not talking about his official role. \n     Officially, he is White House staff secretary--one of those \n     gray but powerful jobs. (The staff secretary controls the \n     paper going to and from the president, and is best known as \n     the guy with the arm that reaches into famous scenes, like \n     the Israeli-PLO peace accord signing, to put a historic \n     document on the president's desk.)\n       What folks call the worst job in Washington is Podesta's \n     unofficial duty: White House cleanup chief. When bombs go off \n     in the nation's capital, most people assume the classic \n     Washington position--duck your head and cover your posterior. \n     Podesta shoulders a shovel and trudges into the rubble.\n       Ever since subpoenas began arriving at the White House, and \n     the administration began to understand that finger-wagging \n     and wounded pleas would not solve the crisis, Podesta has \n     been trying to pull together documents, recreate long-lost \n     wheelings and dealings, and generally patch up the image of a \n     dissembling White House. Slowly, with frequent setbacks, he \n     may be making some progress.\n       The most obvious sign came late last month, when Hillary \n     Rodman Clinton called a news conference and fielded \n     Whitewater questions for an hour and a quarter. As she spoke, \n     Podesta--an intense, slight man with sharp features and a \n     quick laugh--watched happily from the edge of the room. Much \n     of the senior White House staff was caught flat-footed by the \n     news conference; Podesta helped in the First Lady's \n     preparation.\n       Along came the deputy White House counsel Joel Klein and \n     Clinton family lawyer David Kendall, Podesta fields scores of \n     telephone calls each day from reporters. Instead of scolding \n     them, he generally tries to answer their questions. He has \n     collected and released hundreds of pages of documents: old \n     tax returns, commodities trading records. Whitewater \n     corporate tax documents.\n       ``There's been a distinct change of approach since John's \n     taken on this job,'' said one senior administration official. \n     ``Since John has gotten in, you've seen a fairly aggressive \n     presentation of facts and documents, and a tightly \n     coordinated effort.''\n       Colleagues at the White House give Podesta high marks for \n     pooling the Whitewater frenzy in a few offices--giving the \n     rest of the staff a chance to tackle other tasks. As Podesta \n     says: ``People are back to business, and I'm absorbing most \n     of the arrows.''\n       One veteran Democrat knowledgeable of the inner workings at \n     the White House, called Podesta's appearance as Whitewater \n     troubleshooter ``the most hopeful sign in a long time'' that \n     the administration might calm the tempest. Why? ``He's strong \n     as a political organizer, strong as a lawyer. He knows \n     Congress, and he can talk to the press. He has the probity. \n     And he understands a lawyer's job is simple: to solve your \n     client's problem.''\n       Podesta's strategy is simple. Get the facts and make them \n     your weapon. An example of the Podesta style came recently: \n     He and Kendall were plowing through Hillary Clinton's \n     investment records, and they discovered a profit on which the \n     Clintons failed to pay taxes in their 1980 return. Fact was, \n     the statue of limitations was long past; moreover, an \n     Internal Revenue Service auditor had approved the Clintons' \n     1980 return. Legally, they were on solid ground.\n       But Podesta hustled to 'fess up. Painful as it was, it was \n     better than having some newspaper reporter discover the \n     unpaid tax. An old foul-up is better than a fresh expose.\n       Former White House counsel Bernard W. Nussbaum probably \n     would not have handled it this way. When he was dealing with \n     Whitewater, Nussbaum--an accomplished Wall Street lawyer--\n     preferred the classic Wall Street approach: Lock the files, \n     hunkerdown, occasionally flip your enemies a middle-finger \n     salute.\n       New York's ways are not Washington's ways. Here, we bury \n     people in paper and make nice by phone. ``You've got a lot of \n     people who can sit down and tell you the law,'' said Sen. \n     Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Podesta's boss for a number of \n     years. ``But they don't have a sense of the political \n     ramifications.''\n       Podesta learned by doing, coming up through Democratic \n     Party ranks on the heels of his older brother, Tony, a \n     longtime political strategist. In state and national \n     campaigns spanning a generation--from Eugene McCarthy's \n     presidential bid in 1968 to the Clinton victory in 1992--\n     Podesta, 45, learned the art of the sound bite, the care and \n     feeding of the press, the importance of answering fire with \n     fire (without wounding friends.)\n       As Leahy's top aide on the Judiciary Committee, and later \n     chief counsel to the Senate Agriculture Committee, Podesta \n     also mastered the fine print of government. Over time, he \n     became the rare Washington figure who can match the nerds \n     detail-for-detail on, say, intellectual property law in the \n     digital age and hatch strategy with the backroom politicos. \n     ``John's both a rigorous lawyer and good pol and they don't \n     usually go together,'' said Leslie Dach, who worked with \n     Podesta on Michael S. Dukakis's ill-fated 1988 presidential \n     campaign. ``He can memorize bank records and also know how \n     they'll play in Peoria.''\n       The lousy jobs began coming his way almost a year ago: The \n     first mess was the travel office. Seven employees of the \n     White House travel office had been fired, and the press was \n     full of charges of cronyism, money-grubbing, manipulation \n     of the FBI. Normally, the White House counsel's office \n     would handle it, but Nussbaum's staff was involved. Enter \n     Podesta.\n       With his deputy, Todd Stern, Podesta went from office to \n     office around the White House asking people how they managed \n     to screw up so badly. Then he published his findings. He \n     linked important people--like Vince Foster, presidential \n     adviser George Stephanopoulos, even the First Lady hereself--\n     to the debacle. Annoy your colleagues, embarrass your boss \n     ... the worst job in town.\n       Except: Podesta pulled it off. His come-clean strategy \n     deflated the issue. ``It ended the story,'' Stephanopoulos \n     said.\n       Podesta then was called in to preserve the nomination of \n     Joycelyn Elders to be surgeon general, when it seemed like \n     Elders might talk herself out of the job. Then he shepherded \n     William Gould's nomination to head the National Labor \n     Relations Board through a pack of grumbling conservative \n     senators. Next, he persuaded the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee that resort owner M. Larry Lawrence had \n     qualifications to be an ambassador beyond writing fat checks \n     to the president's party.\n       Then came Whitewater.\n       Podesta has made mistakes, including one doozy. When he \n     announced the tax error, he produced supporting documents, \n     which undermined an earlier description of one Clinton \n     commodities trading account. A reporter asked if the new \n     material made the old version ``inoperative.'' And Podesta \n     confirmed: ``That is inoperative.''\n       ``I can't believe you repeated it!'' a colleague said to \n     him after the briefing. Only then did the scope of the error \n     sink in: ``Inoperative'' is a Watergate word. He had echoed \n     the quote of a Nixon aide. ``And the blood drained out of my \n     face,'' Podesta recalled.\n       But in a White House where gaffes often turn into gaping \n     wounds, Podesta minimized the damage. Since uttering the \n     fateful word, Podesta has jumped on any reporter who has \n     tried to use ``inoperative'' to stand for anything beyond the \n     specific details of a single ancient commodities account. For \n     example, he fired off a better chiding a Washington Post \n     columnist: ``I have to publicly eat my mistakes. I hope you \n     acknowledge yours.''\n       Podesta denies he has the worst job in Washington. ``I \n     actually like defending the president and the First Lady and \n     the administration,'' he said. But Whitewater is dramatically \n     more complex than his earlier crises: The stakes are higher, \n     more people are watching, the questions are more complicated, \n     the documentation is more sketchy.\n       Sometimes, Podesta says, when he ventures into the First \n     Lady's office with the latest question about her finances, \n     Mrs. Clinton slaps her hand to her forehead and, exasperated, \n     says, ``I just can't remember any more!'' (Or words to that \n     effect) Podesta allows that he doesn't know all the answers--\n     and so each quiet Whitewater day feels like the slow climb to \n     the top of a roller coaster.\n       ``I'm trying to get the truth as best I can,'' he said \n     recently. ``And I believe in the truth of our position. We're \n     trying to get information out quickly, to avoid the \n     appearance of stonewalling. As we gather more information, we \n     correct our mistakes.\n       ``I expect we'll take some more hits before it is over,'' \n     he said, ``but I believe we are going to get through it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                              JOHN PODESTA\n\n\tMr. LEAHY.

He has \n     collected and released hundreds of pages of documents: old \n     tax returns, commodities trading records. Whitewater \n     corporate tax documents.\n       ``There's been a distinct change of approach since John's \n     taken on this job,'' said one senior administration official. \n     ``Since John has gotten in, you've seen a fairly aggressive \n     presentation of facts and documents, and a tightly \n     coordinated effort.''\n       Colleagues at the White House give Podesta high marks for \n     pooling the Whitewater frenzy in a few offices--giving the \n     rest of the staff a chance to tackle other tasks. As Podesta \n     says: ``People are back to business, and I'm absorbing most \n     of the arrows.''\n       One veteran Democrat knowledgeable of the inner workings at \n     the White House, called Podesta's appearance as Whitewater \n     troubleshooter ``the most hopeful sign in a long time'' that \n     the administration might calm the tempest. Why? ``He's strong \n     as a political organizer, strong as a lawyer. He knows \n     Congress, and he can talk to the press. He has the probity. \n     And he understands a lawyer's job is simple: to solve your \n     client's problem.''\n       Podesta's strategy is simple. Get the facts and make them \n     your weapon. An example of the Podesta style came recently: \n     He and Kendall were plowing through Hillary Clinton's \n     investment records, and they discovered a profit on which the \n     Clintons failed to pay taxes in their 1980 return. Fact was, \n     the statue of limitations was long past; moreover, an \n     Internal Revenue Service auditor had approved the Clintons' \n     1980 return. Legally, they were on solid ground.\n       But Podesta hustled to 'fess up. Painful as it was, it was \n     better than having some newspaper reporter discover the \n     unpaid tax. An old foul-up is better than a fresh expose.\n       Former White House counsel Bernard W. Nussbaum probably \n     would not have handled it this way. When he was dealing with \n     Whitewater, Nussbaum--an accomplished Wall Street lawyer--\n     preferred the classic Wall Street approach: Lock the files, \n     hunkerdown, occasionally flip your enemies a middle-finger \n     salute.\n       New York's ways are not Washington's ways. Here, we bury \n     people in paper and make nice by phone. ``You've got a lot of \n     people who can sit down and tell you the law,'' said Sen. \n     Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), Podesta's boss for a number of \n     years. ``But they don't have a sense of the political \n     ramifications.''\n       Podesta learned by doing, coming up through Democratic \n     Party ranks on the heels of his older brother, Tony, a \n     longtime political strategist. In state and national \n     campaigns spanning a generation--from Eugene McCarthy's \n     presidential bid in 1968 to the Clinton victory in 1992--\n     Podesta, 45, learned the art of the sound bite, the care and \n     feeding of the press, the importance of answering fire with \n     fire (without wounding friends.)\n       As Leahy's top aide on the Judiciary Committee, and later \n     chief counsel to the Senate Agriculture Committee, Podesta \n     also mastered the fine print of government. Over time, he \n     became the rare Washington figure who can match the nerds \n     detail-for-detail on, say, intellectual property law in the \n     digital age and hatch strategy with the backroom politicos. \n     ``John's both a rigorous lawyer and good pol and they don't \n     usually go together,'' said Leslie Dach, who worked with \n     Podesta on Michael S. Dukakis's ill-fated 1988 presidential \n     campaign. ``He can memorize bank records and also know how \n     they'll play in Peoria.''\n       The lousy jobs began coming his way almost a year ago: The \n     first mess was the travel office. Seven employees of the \n     White House travel office had been fired, and the press was \n     full of charges of cronyism, money-grubbing, manipulation \n     of the FBI. Normally, the White House counsel's office \n     would handle it, but Nussbaum's staff was involved. Enter \n     Podesta.\n       With his deputy, Todd Stern, Podesta went from office to \n     office around the White House asking people how they managed \n     to screw up so badly. Then he published his findings. He \n     linked important people--like Vince Foster, presidential \n     adviser George Stephanopoulos, even the First Lady hereself--\n     to the debacle. Annoy your colleagues, embarrass your boss \n     ... the worst job in town.\n       Except: Podesta pulled it off. His come-clean strategy \n     deflated the issue. ``It ended the story,'' Stephanopoulos \n     said.\n       Podesta then was called in to preserve the nomination of \n     Joycelyn Elders to be surgeon general, when it seemed like \n     Elders might talk herself out of the job. Then he shepherded \n     William Gould's nomination to head the National Labor \n     Relations Board through a pack of grumbling conservative \n     senators. Next, he persuaded the Senate Foreign Relations \n     Committee that resort owner M. Larry Lawrence had \n     qualifications to be an ambassador beyond writing fat checks \n     to the president's party.\n       Then came Whitewater.\n       Podesta has made mistakes, including one doozy. When he \n     announced the tax error, he produced supporting documents, \n     which undermined an earlier description of one Clinton \n     commodities trading account. A reporter asked if the new \n     material made the old version ``inoperative.'' And Podesta \n     confirmed: ``That is inoperative.''\n       ``I can't believe you repeated it!'' a colleague said to \n     him after the briefing. Only then did the scope of the error \n     sink in: ``Inoperative'' is a Watergate word. He had echoed \n     the quote of a Nixon aide. ``And the blood drained out of my \n     face,'' Podesta recalled.\n       But in a White House where gaffes often turn into gaping \n     wounds, Podesta minimized the damage. Since uttering the \n     fateful word, Podesta has jumped on any reporter who has \n     tried to use ``inoperative'' to stand for anything beyond the \n     specific details of a single ancient commodities account. For \n     example, he fired off a better chiding a Washington Post \n     columnist: ``I have to publicly eat my mistakes. I hope you \n     acknowledge yours.''\n       Podesta denies he has the worst job in Washington. ``I \n     actually like defending the president and the First Lady and \n     the administration,'' he said. But Whitewater is dramatically \n     more complex than his earlier crises: The stakes are higher, \n     more people are watching, the questions are more complicated, \n     the documentation is more sketchy.\n       Sometimes, Podesta says, when he ventures into the First \n     Lady's office with the latest question about her finances, \n     Mrs. Clinton slaps her hand to her forehead and, exasperated, \n     says, ``I just can't remember any more!'' (Or words to that \n     effect) Podesta allows that he doesn't know all the answers--\n     and so each quiet Whitewater day feels like the slow climb to \n     the top of a roller coaster.\n       ``I'm trying to get the truth as best I can,'' he said \n     recently. ``And I believe in the truth of our position. We're \n     trying to get information out quickly, to avoid the \n     appearance of stonewalling. As we gather more information, we \n     correct our mistakes.\n       ``I expect we'll take some more hits before it is over,'' \n     he said, ``but I believe we are going to get through it.''\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Patrick J.

Mr. President, with deep feelings, I want to pay \ntribute to a colleague, Harris Wofford, who now embarks on the next \nchapter of a life that could already be called a masterpiece.\n  Claude Pepper, a fixture here in Washington for two generations whom \nI had the privilege of working with, used to say, ``If more politicians \nin this country were thinking about the next generation instead of the \nnext election, it might be better for the United States and the \nworld.''\n  Perhaps Senator Wofford's election results prove that he was in that \nspecial breed. Harris Wofford, my good friend from Pennsylvania, has \nbeen an effective, dignified leader, working for the future, since the \nday he walked into this Chamber in 1991.\n  Many of us recall that it was a tragic loss, the death of Senator \nHeinz, which first brought Harris here. That is something he himself \nnever lost sight of, and he carried himself with the care and courtesy \nand seriousness of one who knew that his position shouldered an extra, \nintangible responsibility. His earnest, straightforward approach to the \nSenate, which eschewed distraction and hyperbole, was rooted in a sense \nof duty not just to his fellow Pennsylvanians but to his predecessor.\n  No one here should be surprised by the hard work and seriousness that \ndrove Senator Wofford. But we should have expected nothing less from \nhim. This is the man who influenced Martin Luther King with his own \nwritings on nonviolence in India. Who persuaded President Kennedy to \ntelephone Coretta Scott King in October 1960 after Dr. King had been \njailed in rural Georgia, putting the national spotlight on the case and \nprotecting Dr. King when his life was in danger. And who helped \nestablish the Peace Corps.\n  So it is little wonder that Senator Wofford spent his time here as a \ndriven, focused Member with a sense of mission that did not include \nself-promotion.\n  With all that he had done--with all the lives he touched and \nbettered--Senator Wofford could have stayed in academia at Bryn Mawr, \nor could have continued on in private life. Instead, he took on greater \nchallenges in public service. Because the same fire that drove him to \nwork for Civil Rights and to help send some of America's best and \nbrightest young people across the globe to make a difference never \nebbed or faded.\n  I have been fortunate enough to work with him on one of the issues \nthat he cared deepest for: health care reform. As a candidate in 1991, \nhe seemed out-gunned by a higher profile opponent. But Harris Wofford \nknew there was one fear, one worry running through every single working \nhousehold in America--the fear that a serious health care need could \nvery well drag a family into bankruptcy.\n  In West Virginia, health care concerns have long been one of our most \nimportant issues. But it was Harris' election in 1991, a referendum on \njust how precarious and confusing and ultimately undependable health \ncare really was in America, that woke up much of the Nation to this \nvery real problem. He took that problem as his top priority in the \nSenate. If Pennsylvania sent him to Capitol Hill because he understood \ntheir health care worries, then he was going to do everything in his \npower to allay those fears.\n  We all know that health care reform fell short in the 103d Congress. \nBut the issue moved from the subject of academic symposia and economic \nmodeling into the national conversation. Topics like managed care, \nalliances, and shared responsibility made their way into discussions in \nfactory cafeterias and around dinner tables and in just about every \noffice, business, and household in America. Television, newspapers, and \nmagazines put more and more of their time and resources into looking at \nthe American health care system--what worked, what did not, what we \nneed, and what we have.\n  Harris Wofford was one of the first leaders to really hear how \nfrightened this Nation was about health care. And when he started to \nwork on it, the people of Pennsylvania responded. So Congress took its \ncue--from his startling election and from the anger and fear of the \nelectorate.\n  We did not get the job done for a variety of reasons--distractions, \ndelays, and a $100 million media blitz ran out the congressional clock \nbefore we could really get to work. All that arguing and posturing was \nthe Senate's legislative engine revving loudly while stuck squarely in \nneutral. But health care reform is firmly entrenched at the top of our \npolitical agenda and serious reform came farther than ever before in \nCongress. Senator Wofford supplied much of the fuel which fired that \nmovement. His candidacy, his election, and his service in the Senate \nwere a release for the built up pressures parents and children, \nworkers, and employers were all feeling about health care in America.\n  I do not want to weigh the terms of his leaving the Senate, because \nthat is unimportant. I will miss him as a friend and as a colleague of \nuncommon patience, respect, and thoroughness. America will miss him as \na champion for health care reform and for seeing the charge of the \nSenate as being active and concerned and compassionate.\n  And the challenge Senator Wofford brought here in 1991--to fix the \nAmerican health care system--still confronts us. I have every hope that \nthe 104th Congress will understand that we have not done anything to \nrelieve the health care worries of our people and that the problems \nstill continue. When we answer this call, it will be in large part due \nto Senator Wofford's work here and to the constant reminder he served \nas while in the Senate.\n  Harris Wofford never wore his office as a title. He believed being a \nSenator meant carrying very real, very serious responsibilities--a \ntrust to be earned and to be maintained.\n  Most people with Harris Wofford's record and years of contributing \nwould close the book with a chapter of tremendous service in the U.S. \nSenate. Somehow, I would guess that this will not be his instinct. I \nlook forward to where the next pages in the life and career of this \ngreat patriot and human being will take him. I will miss his smile, his \nwisdom, and the fruits of his labor in the Senate. He and his talented, \ndedicated staff have earned infinite respect and thanks from the State \nand Nation they served so well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                   TO OUTGOING SENATOR HARRIS WOFFORD\n\n\tMr. ROCKEFELLER.

So Congress took its cue--from his startling election and from the anger and fear of the electorate.\n\tWe did not get the job done for a variety of reasons--distractions, delays, and a $100 million media blitz ran out the congressional clock before we could really get to work. All that arguing and posturing was the Senate's legislative engine revving loudly while stuck squarely in neutral. But health care reform is firmly entrenched at the top of our political agenda and serious reform came farther than ever before in Congress. Senator Wofford supplied much of the fuel which fired that movement. His candidacy, his election, and his service in the Senate were a release for the built up pressures parents and children, workers, and employers were all feeling about health care in America.\n\tI do not want to weigh the terms of his leaving the Senate, because that is unimportant. I will miss him as a friend and as a colleague of uncommon patience, respect, and thoroughness. America will miss him as a champion for health care reform and for seeing the charge of the Senate as being active and concerned and compassionate.\n\tAnd the challenge Senator Wofford brought here in 1991--to fix the American health care system--still confronts us. I have every hope that the 104th Congress will understand that we have not done anything to relieve the health care worries of our people and that the problems still continue. When we answer this call, it will be in large part due to Senator Wofford's work here and to the constant reminder he served as while in the Senate.\n\tHarris Wofford never wore his office as a title. He believed being a Senator meant carrying very real, very serious responsibilities--a trust to be earned and to be maintained.\n\tMost people with Harris Wofford's record and years of contributing would close the book with a chapter of tremendous service in the U.S. Senate. Somehow, I would guess that this will not be his instinct. I look forward to where the next pages in the life and career of this great patriot and human being will take him. I will miss his smile, his wisdom, and the fruits of his labor in the Senate. He and his talented, dedicated staff have earned infinite respect and thanks from the State and Nation they served so well.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["John D.

Mr. President, I am saddened to report that early \nTuesday morning, the Senate lost a vibrant and enthusiastic young staff \nmember, Ashley Hammond, to cancer at the age of 23. She served as a \nstaff assistant for the Republican Policy Committee, of which I am \nchairman.\n  Ashley Hammond was a talented, exuberant, and delightful young woman. \nShe faced her cancer with courage and strength. Throughout her ordeal, \nshe always maintained a positive outlook and encouraged others by her \ncheerfulness and caring attitude. The cancer which took her life never \ndid take away those attributes of character for which she will be \nremembered.\n  My family and I extend our condolences to Ashley's family. I know \nthat I also speak for the Policy Committee staff, the staff of my \nSenate office, and many others within the congressional community. We \nmiss Ashley, and we pray that her family will be comforted and \nstrengthened.\n  Ashley joined the Policy Committee staff in the fall of 1993. I was \neager to hire her because she had interned in my Senate office in the \nsummer of 1991 and had distinguished herself in that capacity. When she \ncompleted her bachelor's degree, I was pleased that she agreed to \nrejoin my Senate staff. Shortly after beginning her job in the Policy \nCommittee Office, she learned that she had cancer.\n  Ashley fought her personal battle with courage and perseverance. Most \nof the staff for many months did not know she had cancer: She just \nwanted to continue on with her normal life and do her job. Even after \nthe repeated bouts with chemotherapy took away her beautiful shoulder-\nlength brown hair, Ashley maintained her composure and her sense of \nhumor. She was the first person any visitor to the Policy Committee \nwould see, acting as our hostess with her warm smile beneath her newly \nacquired baseball cap. If she was embarrassed by her appearance, no one \ncould ever tell. She continued to come into work, even on days when her \ncondition was so weak that the office manager would be forced to send \nher home. She loved working as much as her fellow staffers loved having \nher there.\n  Ashley earned a degree in English from Sweet Briar College in the \nspring of 1993. While at Sweet Briar, she was very active on the campus \nand within the community. She chaired the College Republicans and was \nan officer of the junior class. She also was a member of the lacrosse \nteam and the diving team. She was honored by being chosen to \nparticipate in leadership development programs and interned with the \nOffice of Community Planning and Development in Lynchburg, VA. She \nlater was a volunteer at a children's cancer clinic. Little did she \nknow that her selfless service at that clinic would be recalled as she, \ntoo, would have her own battle with cancer.\n\n  Ashley's high school years were equally busy and productive. She was \ngraduated in 1989 from Casady Episcopal Day School in Oklahoma City \nwhere she participated in numerous school and civic activities. \nSomewhere between soccer and French Club and yearbook and field hockey \nand cheerleading and civic work she found time to volunteer at the \nCanterbury Nursing Home and to help with the Harvest II Food Drive. In \nan expression of her faith, she was also a member of the Fellowship of \nChristian Athletes.\n  During her junior high and high school years she was a counselor at \nKamp Kristley, an Oklahoma City day camp for children ages 3-12. During \nhigh school and college years she worked at Allied Drilling Fluids of \nOklahoma City.\n  We have lost a friend, a coworker, and an outstanding young woman. We \nhave also lost a talented broadcast journalist because Ashley had \nplanned to work on the Hill for a few years, and then return to school, \nget a degree in communications, and become a political reporter for \nCNN. She would have been terrific.\n  We all will deeply miss her and, at the same time, we are grateful \nfor having known this warm and very special person.

Mr. President, I regret to report that an esteemed former \nprofessional staff member of the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nformer Milrae Jensen, died on September 20.\n  Milrae Jensen was on our committee staff from 1956 until her \nretirement in 1973. For the first 2 years she was a valued assistant to \nDr. Carl Marcy, the longtime staff director of the committee.\n  Starting in 1958 she held a newly created position with \nresponsibility for relations with other parliamentary bodies. In this \ncapacity she arranged meetings of congressional delegations with \ninternational organizations, and with their counterparts in other \ncountries. She was also responsible for arranging the Senate reception \nof distinguished foreign visitors.\n  In 1967, Dr. Marcy nominated her for the Federal Woman's Award, \nstating ``She handles Senate relations with other parliamentary bodies \nthe world over and does a magnificent job--an assertion that no less \nthan two-thirds of the Senate would endorse.''

Mr. President, I would like to call the attention of the \nSenate to a very thoughtful article written recently by the new U.S. \nattorney for Rhode Island, Sheldon Whitehouse.\n  Mr. Whitehouse, who was my choice for the post of U.S. attorney, has \na distinguished record of public service, having served as executive \ncounsel and director of policy to the Governor of Rhode Island before \nbeing named director of the State's department of business regulation \nin 1992.\n  A graduate of Yale and the University of Virginia Law School, he \nclerked for a State appeals court judge in West Virginia before \nreturning to Rhode Island to practice law in 1983. Two years later, he \njoined the civil division of the Rhode Island attorney general's \noffice, specializing in utility regulation.\n  It was against this background that Mr. Whitehouse reflected on the \ncurrent plight of government and the democratic process, in an article \nentitled ``Learning to Live with Democracy'' which was published in the \nProvidence Journal of October 15, 1994.\n  His article is a plea for citizen involvement as an antidote to the \ncurrent mood of disenchantment with electoral government. The mood is \nnothing new, Mr. Whitehouse reminds us. It results from the inevitable \ntension between the promise and actual performance of democracy, which \nnow is accentuated by the superficiality of the electronic age. \nAmericans must ``learn to become discerning consumers of information \nabout government,'' he says, and must ``avoid the easy lure of \ncynicism.''\n  Mr. Whitehouse has given us much food for thought and I commend his \narticle to the attention of the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe article entitled ``Learning to Live with Democracy'' be reprinted \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    Learning To Live With Democracy\n\n                        (By Sheldon Whitehouse)\n\n       ``There is a compelling need for a revaluation of our \n     public attitudes toward political life. The national attitude \n     that politics is somehow a degrading occupation for which no \n     man of intelligence or ambition should aspire is becoming too \n     deeply ingrained in our national thinking.''\n       Robert F. Kennedy opened a speech with that very sentence \n     on the day I turned four years old.\n       Now my own daughter has passed her fourth year. In the \n     intervening generation, the view that political life is \n     degrading has become more widespread. A recent survey by the \n     Volcker Commission on Public Service showed that only 3 \n     percent of college honor society students ranked the federal \n     government as their ``most preferred employer.'' State \n     government rated less than 2 percent, and local government \n     less than 1 percent.\n       What is the trouble with democracy that keeps this problem \n     so current across the generations?\n       To say that it is the degraded nature of politicians is too \n     easy. There is a natural tension built into democracy that \n     may explain it better: On the one hand, we need to believe in \n     our democracy in order for it to work; on the other hand, the \n     way it works makes it sometimes hard to believe in. The \n     opposing forces creating this tension have been described in \n     the words of two of democracy's heroes: Ben Franklin and \n     Winston Churchill.\n       Benjamin Franklin warned that we must have a good opinion \n     of our government if it is to serve us well (note: not vice \n     versa). He said: ``Much of the strength and efficacy of any \n     government, in procuring and securing happiness to the \n     people, depends on opinion, on the general opinion of the \n     goodness of that government as well as of the wisdom and \n     integrity of its governors.''\n       At the end of World War II, Winston Churchill rose to speak \n     in Parliament. Churchill was the political embodiment of the \n     wartime courage of his small nation. Under the circumstances, \n     he could be excused for exaggerated praise of democratic \n     government. Instead, Churchill said, ``Democracy is the worst \n     form of government, except all those other forms that have \n     been tried from time to time.''\n       The tension exists because Ben Franklin and Winston \n     Churchill were both right. In a nutshell, that's the trouble \n     with democracy: How do we, the people, keep a ``good \n     opinion'' of this ``worst form of government''? Democracy is \n     never going to be easy; and we shouldn't expect it to be \n     easy. The ancient Greeks had one name for those who \n     participated in their democratic process and another name for \n     those who did not. Those who were involved were called \n     civites. From this ancient word comes a host of modern terms: \n     civil, civilization, civic, city, citizen, civilized. Those \n     who were not involved were called idiotes. Perhaps the Greeks \n     were giving us a hint.\n       Indeed, Pericles said of democratic Athenians that they \n     ``regard the man who takes no part in public affairs, not as \n     one who minds his own business, but as good for nothing.''\n       Not only is democracy not easy, it's getting harder. We are \n     now on the edge of a third major revolution in U.S. \n     democracy, and these revolutions increase our obligations as \n     citizens.\n       The first was our ideological revolution denying the divine \n     right of kings to govern, and establishing self-governance by \n     the people. We often refer to the war of 1775-83 as the \n     Revolution, but the real revolution was the emergence of this \n     idea.\n       In the second, quieter, revolution, the benign and \n     idealistic paternalism expected by the Founding Fathers was \n     overwhelmed by vigorous local political representation. This \n     second revolution is represented in U.S. history by the \n     election of President Andrew Jackson. The recent passing of \n     Tip O'Neill perhaps marks the end of that ``all politics is \n     local politics'' era.\n       Before these two revolutions, political life for the \n     average citizen was very simple: You obeyed the king and paid \n     your taxes. The first revolution made life more difficult: It \n     gave us the obligation to select our own government from a \n     small meritoracy of educated, property-owning white men. The \n     second revolution required us to seek among a broader \n     candidate pool the white male who best represented our local \n     community's interests, and required us to decide for \n     ourselves what those local interests would be.\n       In the modern age, elected officials are of every race and \n     both sexes; local issues compete with national, \n     international, economic, ideological and factional issues for \n     our attention. It is a great achievement that our political \n     mainstream is becoming broader and more diverse, but it makes \n     our job as citizens harder than ever.\n       The difficulties compound as government and politics try to \n     find their way in the electronic information age. Look at \n     what is happening to politics and government already, as we \n     enter this third revolution. Devotion to image and appearance \n     has replaced loyalty to party and constituency. The old-\n     fashioned ward heeler is out; the opposition research \n     consultant is in. Hundreds of single-issue special interests \n     besiege the political process, each ready, willing and able \n     to deploy vast arsenals of dollars and disinformation on the \n     electronic superhighway at the first whiff of threat.\n       Political aspirants themselves are willing to attack the \n     institutions they seek to join, to gain an advantage in \n     getting there. And of course there now seem to be no holds \n     barred between candidates in political contests. Our sources \n     of information about government and politics--the media, \n     opposition research consultants and spin doctors--are all \n     richly rewarded by concentrating on the superficial and the \n     scandalous. All of these changes make the information we \n     receive more negative, more divisive and more simplistic.\n       How could we possibly keep a ``good opinion'' of this mess? \n     First, we need to get smart. We must learn to be discerning \n     consumers of information about government.\n       We should no more rely on the information these sources \n     feed us than we should rely on McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts \n     for our food. A junk food diet of information creates a \n     public that is more likely to know what the yacht ``Monkey \n     Business'' is than what the national debt is. (I looked it \n     up: Roughly $4 trillion.) We've gotten a lot smarter about \n     our food diets, and we're healthier as a result. Now we need \n     to get smart about our information diet. We need to encourage \n     legitimate efforts to expose and address real problems, and \n     reject media scandal-mongering, interest group propaganda and \n     partisan political posturing; we need to separate the real \n     food from the junk food.\n       We also need to avoid the lure of easy cynicism. The harder \n     the task of being a citizen becomes, and the more we are \n     required to think for ourselves, the more seductive is this \n     lure. Cynicism about government hurts us. It hurts us in two \n     practical respects. First, it is an excuse for us an \n     individuals to draw the limit on our obligations as citizens \n     to participate in our own democracy. It is an excuse to \n     become idiotes rather than civites. Second, as Ben Franklin \n     pointed out, cynicism about government actually weakens \n     government's ability to do the things we need government to \n     do.\n       This is not to say that we should ignore misdeeds in \n     government. We must root out misdeeds and corruption with a \n     vengeance.\n       But we must also recognize that cynicism about government \n     has its own price.\n       And we need to understand the problems we find in \n     government to be a call to action, rather than an excuse to \n     condemn. There comes a point when the accumulation of \n     contempt for government, like a run on a bank, threatens the \n     viability of the institution itself.\n       It is time to restore our faith in our beliefs and our \n     principles, and it is time to be prepared as citizens to act \n     on that faith. The most precious thing we as a country have \n     to provide to ourselves, to future generations, and to the \n     world, is our democracy. Franklin Delano Roosevelt said, \n     ``Our constitutional system has proved itself the most \n     superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has \n     produced.'' It has provided unparalleled civil liberties and \n     economic freedoms to our people, it has survived a bitter \n     civil war and emerged strengthened; and it has sheltered and \n     sustained for more than two centuries the growth of an ever \n     fairer and more prosperous society.\n       The battle is a long way from over, but our democracy \n     remains the model for freedom-loving people around the world.\n       We all want to restore our faith in our government; to do \n     so we need to solve the riddle of keeping a ``good opinion'' \n     of our ``worst form of government.''\n       The question is, how do we do it?\n       The answer is the one that Greeks hinted at when they \n     called the group civites and the other idiotes. It is self-\n     evident in the phrase ``participatory democracy.'' It is \n     contained in the central phrase of Abraham Lincoln's \n     description of our government as ``of the people, by the \n     people, and for the people.''\n       The answer is to get involved. Inform yourself. Don't be \n     discouraged. Get involved in government yourself. (Don't be \n     afraid to start small. Your local school committee or town \n     council probably makes a bigger difference in your family's \n     life than the U.S. Supreme Court.)\n       The way to a good opinion of this worst form of government \n     is to restore our belief in its principles.\n       The simple way to restore our belief in its principles is \n     to participate in it and participate in it and participate in \n     it, until we respect those who participate in it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n               SHELDON WHITEHOUSE'S THOUGHTS ON DEMOCRACY\n\n\tMr. PELL.

Claiborne Pell,\n     Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: In 1982, the United States made a \n     decision that it would not become a party to the United \n     Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea because of its \n     concerns about the deep seabed mining provisions, contained \n     in Part XI of the Convention. The Convention is due to enter \n     into force on November 16, 1994, now that the requisite \n     number of other states (60) have ratified it. However, \n     consultations were recently concluded which resulted in an \n     Agreement to correct what the United States has long viewed \n     as the Convention's flawed deep seabed mining provisions. The \n     United States now intends to sign the Agreement at the United \n     Nations on July 29, 1994. Accordingly, the Convention as \n     modified will be transmitted to the Senate for its advice and \n     consent at the end of the 103rd Congress.\n       The Department of Defense fully supports U.S. signature of \n     the Agreement, and ratification of the Convention as modified \n     by the Agreement. In the Administration's view, the new \n     Agreement satisfactorily resolves the issues that the U.S. \n     Government and ocean mining interests raised in the early \n     1980's during deliberations over whether the United States \n     should sign the Law of the Sea Convention. The new Agreement \n     meets these objections by correcting the serious \n     institutional and free market deficiencies in the original \n     Convention. We have received indications from other \n     industrialized nations that, with adoption of the new \n     Agreement, they will soon accede to the modified Convention.\n       The Convention establishes a universal regime for \n     governance of the oceans which is needed to safeguard U.S. \n     security and economic interests, as well as to defuse those \n     situations in which competing uses of the oceans are likely \n     to result in conflict. In addition to strongly supporting our \n     interests in freedom of navigation, the Convention provides \n     an effective framework for serious efforts to address land \n     and sea-based sources of pollution and overfishing. Moreover, \n     the Agreement provides us with an opportunity to participate \n     with other industrialized nations in a widely accepted \n     international order to regulate and safeguard the many \n     diverse activities, interests, and resources in the world's \n     oceans. Historically, this nation's security has depended \n     upon the ability to conduct military operations over, under, \n     and on the oceans. The best guarantee that this free and \n     unfettered access to the high seas will continue in the years \n     ahead is for the U.S. to become a party to the Convention, as \n     modified by the Agreement, at the earliest possible time.\n       In the coming months, we anticipate heightened public \n     debate of the merits of the Law of the Sea Convention. To put \n     that debate into perspective, you will find enclosed a paper \n     which briefly outlines the history of the original \n     Convention, the steps leading to the formalization of the \n     Part XI Agreement, and the nation's vital national security \n     and other interests in becoming bound by the modified \n     Convention.\n       To send a strong signal that the United States is committed \n     to an ocean regulatory regime that is guided by the rule of \n     law, General Shalikashvili and I urge your support in \n     securing early advice and consent of the United Nations \n     Convention on the Law of the Sea and implementing Agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J.

Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a speech recently delivered by Ambassador George F. Kennan \non the occasion of his receipt of the first George F. Kennan Award for \nDistinguished Public Service.\n  Ambassador Kennan, a self-described man of this century--and I would \nadd, one of the century's most visionary statesmen--offers some \nperspectives on the 100 years. I was particularly struck by the fact \nthat Ambassador Kennan, who defined the overriding theme of the cold \nwar period--containment--does not believe a central policy thrust is \ndefinable at this time. He says: ``What we need is not any single \npolicy. That would be quite impossible at this point. What we need is a \nvariety of policies.''\n  I would like to extend my congratulations to Ambassador Kennan, for \nwhom I have the highest regard, for his speech and for his award. \nWithout objection, I would ask that the full text of Ambassador \nKennan's speech be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n Address of Ambassador George F. Kennan on the Occasion of His Receipt \n  of the First George F. Kennan Award for Distinguished Public Service\n\n                     Waldorf-Astoria, New York City\n\n                            October 17, 1994\n\n       Ambassador George F. Kennan: Mr. Flynn, Doctor Schwab, \n     ladies and gentlemen: I think you will all know without my \n     laboring the point how deeply I appreciate this honor. I feel \n     very inadequate to know how to acknowledge it. It would be \n     difficult for anyone, I think, to respond to the honor itself \n     and to the lovely things that have just been said. If the \n     task of this committee is, as I have always assumed it to be, \n     to promote sound and constructive thinking about the problems \n     of American foreign policy, then the conferring of this award \n     enables me to think that my own efforts of these past years \n     have been at least supplementary to those of the committee, \n     and that in itself gives me deep satisfaction and \n     encouragement.\n       When Dr. Schwab first spoke to me last spring about the \n     possibility of such an occasion, I told him that honored as I \n     would be, of course, by the award, I could not, for reasons \n     of age and health, contemplate giving an address. This \n     remains, for better or for worse, the situation, but I have \n     been told recently that there were expectations in one \n     quarter or another that I would say something about my view \n     of what should constitute the general thrust of American \n     foreign policy in this post cold war era, and this I will try \n     do do, although necessarily very briefly.\n       I must say, before I begin my remarks, that this is a very \n     intimidating group of people I have before me. I see a great \n     many people who know a lot more than I do about the things \n     I'll be talking about, and I feel a certain hesitation in \n     saying anything at all about our policy of the present day. I \n     am, after all, a man of this past century, and what we are \n     getting into now is the century that is about to dawn on us. \n     At times I thought I knew something about the century that \n     will soon pass; but I'm sure that I do not know nor can I \n     foresee a great deal about the century that is coming. \n     Nevertheless, I will say a few words.\n       If the suggestion is that I outline a central thrust of \n     American foreign policy to replace that which preoccupied us \n     during the period of the cold war, then I can say only that \n     this is a very difficult thing for me to respond to. I don't \n     think there is any central thrust of policy possible at this \n     time. It is a varied, very confused, very unbalanced, and \n     uncertain world that we face. What we need is not any single \n     policy. That would be quite impossible at this point. What we \n     need is a variety of policies. But perhaps there is one \n     unifying factor that could bring these things together, and \n     that is the question of motivation, of purpose, and what we \n     conceive ourselves to be doing. This question, I think, can \n     take two forms: One is a very natural traditional and \n     unavoidable concern for our military and political security \n     and for the security of our closest allies. The other is the \n     hope, endemic, I think, to all generations of Americans, that \n     we, as a great democratic people, will be able to play a \n     useful and effective role in promoting peace, stability, and \n     humane government in other parts of the world.\n       In the years since communism broke down, our military \n     security, providentially, has not been seriously threatened. \n     That is true for most though not all of our allies. So \n     perhaps it was only natural that we should have concentrated \n     a large part of our attention on and invested a large part of \n     our efforts in being helpful to others in troubled situations \n     involving, for the most part, countries other than those in \n     the advanced areas of Europe and the Far East. I have in \n     mind, of course, such places as Korea, Iraq, the Balkans, the \n     Near East, Somalia, and now Haiti.\n       I have few criticisms to make of the way in which we have \n     handled these situations. I have only admiration and pride \n     for the way in which our armed forces have conducted \n     themselves in performing the tasks to which they have been \n     assigned, tasks that, in many instances, were quite the \n     limits of their traditional training. I think that they have \n     been models of what military people can do in difficult \n     circumstances.\n       With the exception of Somalia and the still unfinished \n     intervention in Haiti, I do not see that our government had \n     any choice but to respond to those situations in the way that \n     it did. And, finally, after all the political wrangling and \n     jousting and mutual denunciations about foreign policy that \n     have gone on here at home, I consider that both \n     administrations, that of Mr. Bush and that of Mr. Clinton, \n     have handled these various situations diplomatically in a \n     reasonably sound and creditable manner. I hope that when \n     these involvements have been liquidated in a way that is \n     consistent with the preservation of the honor and dignity of \n     this country (and, in this instance, that is going to be, I \n     am afraid, a very long time), we will not be in too much of a \n     hurry to replace those involvements with others.\n       All that being said, I still have some anxieties to voice \n     about various ventures. But, first, I must say (and some of \n     you may find this hard to believe) that I have anxieties \n     about the highly dangerous and urgent problems, social, \n     political, and economic, that we have right here in our own \n     country. They are problems that the media have found it hard \n     to recognize and that the politicians have found it hard to \n     admit but I hope that these problems will soon become the \n     subject of national debate, that they will receive the \n     attention and the discussion that they deserve, and for this \n     it is desirable that we be not too distracted with the \n     involvements and problems beyond our borders.\n       Second, we have our relations with the other great powers, \n     and we must not permit our preoccupations with the less \n     developed world to distract us from doing justice to the \n     importance of those relations. We have before us in this \n     respect a situation, a providential situation, I think, \n     namely, that for the first time in modern history--the first \n     time that I can think of--there is a group of major powers to \n     which we belong whose relations are not marked by any great \n     and serious conflicts, by no conflicts, at least, that cannot \n     be alleviated by patience, understanding, negotiation, and \n     compromise. We have every reason to appreciate this \n     situation, to cherish it, and to do all in our power to \n     perpetuate it, remembering that good relations with great \n     powers, like those with small ones, require constant \n     attention and nurturing not only in crises but at all times. \n     Here too we must be careful not to take our relations with \n     great powers for granted, not to allow ourselves to be too \n     heavily distracted by involvements in other parts of the \n     world.\n       There is one other thing that I would like to mention about \n     the various involvements that we have been concentrating on \n     in the last two or three years. That is a very difficult one \n     for me to talk about, for it's one on which one can be easily \n     misunderstood: We have had a tendency to focus most of our \n     efforts (or, it seems to me, a great many of them) on \n     attempting to ensure democracy and human rights in other \n     parts of the world. Though this ideal does credit to our own \n     life and to our own aspirations and is one with which no one \n     can argue, I must say that I don't think that all of the \n     world is going to become democratic in our time no matter \n     what we do. And I'm always a little afraid, a little \n     disturbed, when I hear Americans talking to others about \n     democracy and human rights because I always hear an undertone \n     of self-congratulation, which I don't like. I don't like \n     speaking down to people. In many instances the problems of \n     other countries have been as severe as ours. And while we can \n     tell them or can show them by example the way that we feel \n     about these things, I think we should be very careful about \n     telling them how to behave. One of the things that bothers me \n     is that we have had a tendency to cast so many of these \n     involvements in terms of our own struggle for democracy and \n     human rights and done this in instances in which what we \n     really should have been talking about (but which, for some \n     curious reason, Americans never like to talk about) is simply \n     our own national interest.\n       Not least among the problems that we have to handle in our \n     relations with the major powers and some of the others as \n     well is the continuing widespread development, cultivation, \n     and proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of \n     mass destruction. That is not merely a regional problem; \n     it is a global one that involves a little less than the \n     whole future of humanity and its stake in the future of \n     civilization. I have never forgotten Robert Oppenheimer's \n     reply when Ed Murrow asked him in a television interview \n     whether humanity could survive a major nuclear war. ``I \n     don't know, I don't know,'' Oppenheimer replied. ``But it \n     would take the greatest act of faith to believe that what \n     might survive it would be human.'' That remark, if \n     anything, remains as true today as it was when Oppenheimer \n     made it, for the control of this form of weaponry now \n     rests in a larger number of hands. I believe that we, as \n     the first country to have developed those weapons and the \n     only one to use them against another population, and a \n     largely helpless one at that, have a great and special \n     responsibility and even a duty to take the lead in \n     bringing those weapons under eventual control either \n     through international organs or in having them eliminated \n     from national arsenals.\n       Meeting this responsibility will require us to persuade \n     others and to impose no small measure of restraint and \n     scrutiny on our own words and actions. I welcome and commend \n     the measures that we, the Russians, and others have \n     undertaken recently. They are encouraging developments but \n     are far from sufficient to meet the need. I greatly hope that \n     we will now take a new look at this entire problem and will \n     give to it the attention that it warrants. This is the least \n     we can do for our children and our grandchildren.\n       There you have it: a voice from the century that is now \n     passing to the inhabitants of the one about to begin. As \n     always, when an older person tries to talk to younger people \n     (and, believe me, practically everyone in this hall is \n     younger than I), much of what he or she says is boring, for \n     older people have a tendency to repeat themselves and talk \n     about things seemingly removed from the interests and \n     thoughts of their listeners. But it has been known to happen, \n     here and there, that a small portion of what an oldster has \n     had to say had relevance for the future as well as for the \n     past. In this instance I leave that for you to judge. I \n     cannot. I thank you for your attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                         GEORGE KENNAN'S WISDOM\n\n\tMr. PELL. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues a speech recently delivered by Ambassador George F. Kennan on the occasion of his receipt of the first George F. Kennan Award for Distinguished Public Service.\n\tAmbassador Kennan, a self-described man of this century--and I would add, one of the century's most visionary statesmen--offers some perspectives on the 100 years. I was particularly struck by the fact that Ambassador Kennan, who defined the overriding theme of the cold war period--containment--does not believe a central policy thrust is definable at this time. He says: ``What we need is not any single policy. That would be quite impossible at this point. What we need is a variety of policies.''\n\tI would like to extend my congratulations to Ambassador Kennan, for whom I have the highest regard, for his speech and for his award. Without objection, I would ask that the full text of Ambassador Kennan's speech be printed in the Record at this point.\n\tThere being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\tAddress of Ambassador George F. Kennan on the Occasion of His Receipt \n  of the First George F. Kennan Award for Distinguished Public Service\n\n                     Waldorf-Astoria, New York City\n\n                            October 17, 1994\n\n       Ambassador George F. Kennan: Mr. Flynn, Doctor Schwab, \n     ladies and gentlemen: I think you will all know without my \n     laboring the point how deeply I appreciate this honor. I feel \n     very inadequate to know how to acknowledge it. It would be \n     difficult for anyone, I think, to respond to the honor itself \n     and to the lovely things that have just been said.

Today's announcement, together with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown's upcoming trip to Belfast for a British-sponsored trade conference are concrete signs of the administration's commitment.\n\tThose of us who have served with George Mitchell know that he is the perfect candidate for the position of special adviser. He has a close working relationship with the President and the Secretary of State; he is well-respected by his colleagues in the Congress, who of course, are important partners in the administration's efforts to encourage the peace effort; he is known and trusted by the leaders of Ireland, Britain, and the various actors in Northern Ireland.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Claiborne Pell"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

CLIFFORD FULFORD\n\n  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge R. Clifford Fulford, \na strong force in Alabama politics for two decades, passed away on \nOctober 29, 1994. He has been a Federal bankruptcy judge in Birmingham \nsince 1985. He will probably best be remembered for his role in keeping \nthe Alabama Democratic Party from being taken over by the Dixicrats in \n1948 and for keeping it in touch with the national during a turbulent \ntime in the State's history. he was one of those rare individuals who \ngot into politics to do the right thing, regardless of what might be \npopular at the moment.\n  Clifford Fulford served as president of the student body at the \nUniversity of Alabama, from which he graduated in 1940. He received his \nlaw degree there in 1942. He served in the Navy during both World War \nII and the Korean war. After serving with the Office of Price \nStabilization as an enforcement officer, he entered private law \npractice in Birmingham. He served as assistant U.S. attorney in \nBirmingham in 1953.

CLIFFORD FULFORD\n\n\tMr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge R. Clifford Fulford, a strong force in Alabama politics for two decades, passed away on October 29, 1994. He has been a Federal bankruptcy judge in Birmingham since 1985. He will probably best be remembered for his role in keeping the Alabama Democratic Party from being taken over by the Dixicrats in 1948 and for keeping it in touch with the national during a turbulent time in the State's history. he was one of those rare individuals who got into politics to do the right thing, regardless of what might be popular at the moment.\n\tClifford Fulford served as president of the student body at the University of Alabama, from which he graduated in 1940. He received his law degree there in 1942. He served in the Navy during both World War II and the Korean war. After serving with the Office of Price Stabilization as an enforcement officer, he entered private law practice in Birmingham. He served as assistant U.S. attorney in Birmingham in 1953. During the 1960's and 1970's, he served as attorney and treasurer of the Alabama Democratic Executive Committee. Over the years, Judge Fulford proved himself to be an honest and successful politician and an outstanding lawyer and judge.\n\tI extend my sincerest condolences to Judge Fulford's wife Toula and their entire family in the wake of their tremendous loss.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Howell Heflin"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record some \nreflections on the changing role of the United Nations. Many of us \nrecognize that the U.N. must change. It must change in response to the \nradical geopolitical transformations of the past five years that began \nwith the unraveling of the Soviet communist empire and led to the \nlargest creation of new states since the period of decolonization \nfollowing World War II. It must change in response to the demands \nplaced upon it by these new nations striving for stable independence. \nAnd it must change in response to the conflicts that continue to arise \nthroughout the developing world. Indeed, the role played by the United \nNations in liberating Kuwait from Iraqi occupation was a pivotal point \nin the history of the United Nations.\n  There has been much debate about the role the United Nations will \nplay in the future. Regrettably, there still exists in this debate \nvague notions about ideals, ideals that, however benign, detract from \nthe realistic thinking necessary to keep the U.N.'s participation in \nworld events relevant.\n  Recently the distinguished Ambassador Joseph Verner Reed has the \noccasion to present the commencement address to the graduating class of \nSouthern Utah University in Cedar City, Utah. Ambassador Reed, who \nserves as Under Secretary General of the United Nations and Special \nRepresentative of the Secretary General for Public Affairs, shared some \nvery realistic thinking about the future of the United Nations with the \nstudents and faculty of this respected institution.\n  The ambassador recognized that ``there is irony in the present moment \nbecause for all the shortcomings of the Cold War period there was a \nstability and a sense of international coordination in those years that \ntoday we are lacking.''\n  ``We live in an inescapably and absolutely interconnected world,'' \nthe ambassador said. ``What affects one society will come to affect \nothers. Environmental degradation, trade, migration, violations of \nhuman rights, a concern for democracy--unite and affect us all. These \nissues know no national borders.''\n  He is correct to say that the U.N. ``is asked to carry out the \nmultiple and difficult demands of peace-keeping, peace-making, peace-\nbuilding and post-conflict development and security...(and) it is not \nsurprising that the United Nations has faced difficulty in carrying out \nsuch ambitious, complex tasks.'' As the Ambassador reminds us: ``The \nUnited Nations has entered complex crises * * * because the Security \nCouncil and member states have asked it to do so.\n\n  While we will continue to debate the role the U.N. must play in many \nof these issues, I am heartened to note that the distinguished \nambassador recognizes that there is no question that states are the \nrepositories of authority and international legitimacy. I also agree \nwith the ambassador when he says: ``But that authority and legitimacy \nis today called upon to answer international concerns and shared global \nproblems.''\n  As the ambassador told the class of 1994 of Southern Utah University: \n``It is not idealism to support the United Nations. It is realism. With \nall its merits and all its defects, the United Nations represents our \njoint experience as citizens of this planet. Our task is to improve the \norganization, to consolidate international commitment to its necessary \npurpose, and to make this a peaceful and nurturing world for the \npeoples the United Nations represents.''\n  Ambassador Reed shared his realism with the graduates from my state \nwhen he told them: ``The United Nations cannot carry out such tasks \nalone. The organization reflects the support, political and financial, \nthat it receives from the member states, including the United States of \nAmerica, founder-member of the United Nations, host country, permanent \nmember of the Security Council and its largest contributor. Without \nsuch support the United Nations cannot act, cannot grow, cannot improve \nits capabilities. There has been a tendency to ask the organization to \ntake on task after task, without significantly increasing its \nresources. The United Nations is not perfect, but it is obviously a \nmistake to criticize it for stumbling while at the same time demanding \nthat it run on one leg.''\n  The ambassador's comments and observations, regardless of one's point \nof view on the United Nations, contribute greatly to our reassessment \nof the role this country should play at the United Nations. As a result \nof this debate, I hope that we will more concretely determine what \nfunctions the United Nations can best perform in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                  CHANGING ROLE OF THE UNITED NATIONS\n\n\tMr. HATCH.

Mr. President, for 18 years, Senator Sasser has done \nthe heavy lifting, the hard, painstaking, nuts-and-bolts work of this \nbody. Concentrating on the details of programs and policies, he has \nserved as Chairman of the Budget Committee, as Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Military Construction of the Appropriations Committee, \non the Banking and Governmental Affairs Committees, and on the \nDemocratic Working Groups on Central America and on Drug and Substance \nAbuse. Jim Sasser worked quietly and without fanfare to make government \nwork, to make it more efficient, less costly and more responsive to the \nneeds of the nation and its citizens.\n  For instance, he established a GAO Fraud Hotline which enabled people \nto report fraudulent and wasteful government practices. Thousands of \ncitizens called in tips, and million of taxpayer dollars were saved as \na consequence. The Pentagon procurement scandal first came to light on \nthe Fraud Hotline.\n  On Appropriations he did his homework, traveling to uncomfortable and \neven dangerous parts of the world to see how American military dollars \nwere being spent. He went to Thailand to see how Cambodian refugees \nwere being treated, he checked out the Contras in Nicaragua, the Afghan \nwar and the Persian Gulf. He inspected the USS Stark after it was hit \nby Iraqi missiles. Only after seeing the situations for himself did he \nmake up his mind about the policies the United States should follow. \nThis is what distinguishes Senator Sasser as a legislator, that he \nlearns the facts, makes up his own mind and trusts his judgment.\n  My colleague from Tennessee is one of those members who has brought \nto the Senate the qualities of common sense and rationality all too \noften missing from the heated discourse in this body. That has been \nmanifest in our close association as members of the Appropriations \nCommittee and especially in his work in the thankless but critical role \nas a member and as Chairman of the Committee on the Budget.\n  It is fair to say that the latter has been a forum for considerable \npartisan posturing since its creation some 20 years ago. And it is \ncertainly true that the role and contribution of that committee has \nbeen maligned and underappreciated by the press and even members of \nthis body. The Senator from Tennessee has always been a voice of cool \nreason in the Budget Committee, and I truly believe that years from now \npeople will look back on the role that Senator Sasser played in the \nbudget summit of 1990 as one of the critical components in finally \nawakening the administration and the Congress to the need to take \nDraconian steps to curb runaway budget deficits.\n  But if there is one thing in particular that Senator Sasser's \ncolleagues will miss, it is his sense of humor and his fine sense of \nirony about the Congress and its cast of characters. No one in my years \nhere has taken his job more seriously or has worked more diligently for \nthe people who sent him here. But no Senator has possessed more of a \ngift for laughing at himself and at the foibles of those who would \nconfuse the seriousness of public service with the fatuousness of self-\nimportance. Many of the seemingly endless late-night Senate sessions \nhave been enlivened and enriched by the wit and endless repertoire of \npolitical stories and anecdotes of the Senator from Tennessee.\n  One of those stories which the Senator often tells is about the \ncandidate in Tennessee who would finish every stump speech with the \ndeclaration, ``Them's my views, and if you don't like 'em, I'll change \n'em.'' It can be said here of the Senator from Tennessee that, in fact, \nhe brought a set of views and convictions to his work in this body that \ngreatly enriched the public product, not only for the people of \nTennessee, but for all the people of this country. If those views \nchanged at all, it was owing to common sense and evolving \ncircumstances, not because Jim Sasser legislated with a finger in the \nwind. He spent eighteen years in this body doing only what he thought \nwas right for a State he loves deeply. For that, he will be long \nremembered and greatly missed by those of us who were honored to call \nhim a colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR SASSER\n\n\tMr. JOHNSTON.

It can be said here of the Senator from Tennessee that, in fact, he brought a set of views and convictions to his work in this body that greatly enriched the public product, not only for the people of Tennessee, but for all the people of this country. If those views changed at all, it was owing to common sense and evolving circumstances, not because Jim Sasser legislated with a finger in the wind. He spent eighteen years in this body doing only what he thought was right for a State he loves deeply. For that, he will be long remembered and greatly missed by those of us who were honored to call him a colleague.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["J.

Mr. President, soon the 103d Congress will be history. \nThe end of the 103d Congress also will mean the end of the historic and \ndistinguished career of Senator George Mitchell as the majority leader \nof this body. Mr. President, today, I want to pay tribute to a man that \nevery Member of this body holds in the highest regard.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Mitchell was mentioned as a candidate for \ncommissioner of baseball. He was asked about dealing with the egos of \nthe 28 baseball owners. His reply, that the commissioner's job would be \na 72-percent reduction from his role as Senate majority leader, has now \nbecome famous. But I think his reply also illustrates Senator \nMitchell's approach to what is surely one of the most difficult jobs in \nWashington. There are 100 Members of the U.S. Senate. We come from 50 \ndifferent States. We are members of different political parties, and we \nrepresent a wide variety of personalities, views, and political \nphilosophies. Yet, we are able to work together. Our successes over the \nyears are in no small part due to the fairness, perseverance, integrity \nand the good humor of Senate Majority Leader Mitchell. I know that many \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--even while they might \nhave disagreed with him on various issues--respect Senator Mitchell's \nability to deal with them fairly. Senator Alan Simpson, the minority \nwhip, recently said of Senator Mitchell: ``Not once, ever did he do \nanything he said he would not do. He wouldn't cut a corner.'' All of us \nwho have served with Senator Mitchell would agree with that assessment.\n  It has been my great pleasure to serve with the distinguished \nmajority leader. Like many of my colleagues, I have admired his \nintelligence, his patience, and his steady leadership. As majority \nleader, he guided legislation through this body with great skill. As a \nSenator representing the citizens of Maine, he worked diligently on \nbehalf of his constituents, just as he worked for the well-being of \nAmericans throughout the Nation.\n  We all know George Mitchell could have left this body earlier this \nyear and taken his place on the Nation's highest court. There is little \ndoubt he would have served in that capacity with great distinction, and \ncontinued to make a significant difference in the history of our \ncountry. But he chose not to take that opportunity. Instead, he decided \nto remain in the Senate and to attempt to reform our national health \ncare system. Mr. President, he made that decision because of his deep \nand sincere dedication to accomplishing a goal he felt was in the best \ninterests of our Nation. He put the national interest above his \npersonal interest.\n  While we were not able to pass legislation reforming our Nation's \nhealth care system this year, it was certainly not due to a lack of \ncommitment or determination on the part of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Maine. Senator Mitchell put his personal convictions ahead of \npersonal gain, and demonstrated to every other public servant the true \nmeaning of public service.\n  In that spirit of public service, Senator Mitchell has established a \nscholarship fund with the remainder of his campaign fund and the \ndonations of many, many generous people from across the country. That \nfund will help needy and deserving students receive a higher education. \nAt the fundraising dinner for the scholarship bearing the majority \nleader's name, George Mitchell said: ``Public service must be and is \nits own reward, for it does not guarantee wealth, popularity, or \nrespect.'' I know many of us share those sentiments.\n  While he may be correct that serving in the Senate does not guarantee \nthose things, Senator Mitchell has earned the respect and admiration of \nhis colleagues. He will leave this Chamber with a wealth of memories of \nlegislative battles--he has won some impressive victories, and suffered \nsome disappointing defeats. But above it all, he has earned the respect \nof everyone who has had the privilege of working with him. Although he \nmay be retiring from the Senate, I know that will not mean the end of \nhis desire to serve his country.\n  Indeed, just today President Bill Clinton announced that George \nMitchell has agreed to serve as a special U.S. adviser for economic \ninitiatives in Ireland. As that troubled area moves toward ending \ndecades of violence and confrontation, efforts to ensure economic \nstability and growth will be an essential part of helping Northern \nIreland achieve peace and prosperity. The President said he needed \nsomeone of ``great talent, great stature and great wisdom'' for the job \nas special economic adviser to Northern Ireland. Mr. President, I think \nall of us who have served with Senator Mitchell agree the President has \nfound the right man. All of us in this Chamber have been fortunate to \nserve with him in the Senate, and his steady and distinguished presence \nwill be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MITCHELL\n\n\tMr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the senior \nSenator from Michigan, Senator Don Riegle, as he prepares to retire \nfrom this body. During my eight years of service in the Senate, I have \nhad the opportunity to serve with Senator Riegle on both the Budget and \nFinance Committees and have enjoyed the chance to work with him on a \nwide range of issues--particularly fair trade and health care reform.\n  Senator Riegle has spent eighteen years in the Senate fighting for \nthe working families of Michigan while protecting and expanding job \nopportunities and economic growth for our nation. His expertise in \neconomic and financial policy issues and his voice on trade issues, \nindustrial policy and U.S. competitiveness will be greatly missed.\n  Senator Riegle has made it a priority in the Senate to ensure that \nAmerican workers and businesses are competing in an open and free \nenvironment. He and I agree that free trade agreements are often not \nfree or fair trade but negotiated trade that pits one American business \ninterest against another while giving our global competitors an unfair \nadvantage. As a result he has been an effective advocate of a tough \ntrade policy. He has worked to end trade barriers that shut out \nAmerican exports and to halt unfair dumping by foreign manufacturers.\n  Senator Riegle has long warned of the need to address the health care \ncrisis in this country and has worked for a new system that would \ndecrease the number of uninsured and contain the increasing costs of \nhealth care. During the historic health care debate this past year, \nSenator Riegle met with me and other members of the Finance Committee, \nboth Republicans and Democrats, to seek out common ground and areas of \nagreement. He served as a calm voice of reason during the long hours of \noften contentious debate. Although we were not able to reach agreement, \nin the end, I am confident that any health care reform enacted in the \nfuture will bear the mark of Don Riegle's hard work.\n  While serving the people of Michigan in the Senate, Senator Riegle \nhas also served his nation as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee \nfor the past 5 years. During that time his committee has overhauled the \nbanking industry, increased accountability for financial institutions, \nincreased protection for consumers and expanded home ownership \nopportunities for low- and middle-income Americans.\n  I have been constantly impressed with Senator Riegle's ability to \nwrite and pass legislation in an efficient, fair and effective manner. \nI have always found him accommodating and helpful with questions or \nconcerns I have had with legislation that fell under the Banking \nCommittee's jurisdiction. His highly praised role as a fair and \nunbiased chairman during this summer's Whitewater hearings \nserve as evidence of his substantial leadership abilities.\n  Not content to focus on economic issues, Senator Riegle has fought \nhardest to protect the children and senior citizens of our country. He \nis largely responsible for providing immunizations for uninsured \nchildren and has supported increased funding for expanded day care \nfacilities for latchkey kids. He is well-known for his continual \nefforts to make good on the government's promises to the eldest members \nof our society.\n  Mr. President, Don Riegle has served with distinction for eighteen \nyears in the Senate and before that, ten in the House of \nRepresentatives. The people of Michigan, the country and his colleagues \nhere in the Senate will greatly miss him, and I wish him and his family \ngood fortune in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                ON THE RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DON RIEGLE\n\n\tMr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, it has been more than 20 years since \nDennis DeConcini made his first bid for public office in Arizona and \nwas elected Pima County attorney. Just 4 years later in 1976, he was \nelected to the U.S. Senate. Now, after 18 years, Senator DeConcini has \ndecided to retire from this body. Mr. President, today I want to \ncomment on our colleague's distinguished career in the Senate. His \nretirement will be a loss for the Senate.\n  When he was a freshman Senator, the Wall Street Journal described him \nas the most likely member of that class to succeed in the Senate. He \nhas lived up to those high expectations. As a chairman of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence and a member the Appropriations and Judiciary \nCommittees, he has served Arizona and this Nation with dedication. \nSenator DeConcini and I have shared the view that reducing the Federal \ndeficit must be our top priority even if it means we have to make \ndifficult choices on reducing Federal spending. On the wall in Senator \nDeConcini's office there is a short poem that reads: ``Politics is like \na rose, it has beauty and thorny issues.'' As Members of the Senate, we \noften face difficult choices on thorny issues. Senator DeConcini was \nalways able to meet that challenge and make those choices.\n  He was the sponsor of a constitutional amendment to require a \nbalanced budget. Senator DeConcini also was a founder and cochairman of \nthe Senate Grace Commission Caucus, a bipartisan group of Senators \ndedicated to looking for ways to eliminate waste in the Federal \nGovernment. On many occasions, I have worked with Senator DeConcini on \nthe floor of this Chamber to help reduce wasteful Federal spending. He \nhas shown courage in supporting the budget package we passed in 1993 \nthat proved Congress could deal with the thorny issue of reducing \nFederal spending and making a serious attempt to reduce the Federal \ndeficit.\n  Senator DeConcini has taken tough stands on other issues. As an \nexample, he cosponsored with Senator Dianne Feinstein the assault \nweapons ban that eventually became part of the comprehensive anticrime \nbill. Against all opponents Senator DeConcini stood his ground. Like \nmany of us, he knew these weapons were used by criminals and drug \ndealers to kill--often to kill innocent bystanders and police. In the \nend, the assault weapons ban became the law of the land, thanks in no \nsmall part to Senator DeConcini's courage and perseverance.\n  While has career in the Senate has been one of fighting for what he \nbelieved was right, it has also been a career of accomplishment and \ncompassion. One area where Senator DeConcini has been a consistent \nleader is in the effort to help children. He played a major role in \npassing legislation to provide quality, affordable child care for \nfamilies and children. He has been a leader in efforts to reduce child \nabuse and to increase funding for programs to improve the nutrition and \nhealth of pregnant low-income women, infants, and preschool children.\n  On a wide variety of issues, Senator DeConcini has been at the \nforefront. He sponsored legislation to promote increased cooperation \nbetween Mexico and our country to stop the flow of illegal drugs and to \npromote trade and commerce along our southwest border with Mexico. He \nis the principal author of the most comprehensive antidrug legislation \nin history, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. He founded the Western \nCoalition Work Group made up of western Senators working together on \nclean air issues. I personally have worked with him on legislation to \nprotect our Nation's air and water quality and to strengthen the \nhistoric clean water legislation. Mr. President, Senator DeConcini's \ncareer in the Senate has touched a wide variety of issues of national \nimportance. His leadership and experience will be greatly missed by \nthose of us who have had the pleasure of serving with him in the \nSenate.

Several major reconciliation bills were enacted on his watch, and he has earned our thanks and appreciation for guiding that legislation skillfully through the Senate.\n\tI was proud to have worked closely with my friend from Tennessee on legislation reforming the procurement practices in the Department of Defense and on legislation to get our allies to pay more for the defense we provide them.\n\tThe Senator from Tennessee also established a national toll-free fraud hotline, which he intended to be used to report fraud and waste in the Federal Government. Mr. President, that hotline has been used by thousands of people reporting wasteful Government practices, and has helped save taxpayers millions of dollars.\n\tJim Sasser's innovative ideas for cutting unnecessary spending, and his steadfast devotion to sound fiscal policies have made a significant and lasting difference in this country. Without the leadership of Senator Sasser, many important reforms may have never come to pass.\n\tJim Sasser has also served the needs of his State extremely well. He fought to create jobs for Tennessee and bring economic opportunity to the nation as a whole, and has been a leader in the fight for many other programs important to his State.\n\tHe has always kept the needs of Tennessee in the forefront of his thinking--his constituents can be proud of the job he has performed.\n\tIt is with great sadness that we say farewell to the Senator from Tennessee. He will be missed in this Chamber, and I wish him the very best as he returns to private life.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Kent Conrad"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today to \nsalute Senator Harlan Mathews of Tennessee. As you know, Mr. President, \nwhen our former colleague Senator Albert Gore, Jr., of Tennessee was \nelected Vice President of the United States, Harlan Mathews was \nappointed to fill his unexpired term.\n  When he came to this body, Harlan Mathews listed three major goals \nfor his service in the Senate--working to balance the Federal budget, \nreducing the deficit and reforming our Nation's health care system. \nThose concerns were shared by many of us. Before coming to the Senate \nhe served as Tennessee Commissioner of Finance for 10 years, the \nlongest tenure of any commissioner in his State's history. In 1974 he \nwas elected State treasurer of Tennessee and his 13 years in that \noffice again were the longest of any treasurer in Tennessee history. \nWhen he came to Washington, Harlan Mathews brought with him a clear \nunderstanding of the need for fiscally responsible government.\n  A fiscal conservative, he demonstrated his commitment to his personal \nbeliefs by cosponsoring legislation calling for a balanced Federal \nbudget and supporting efforts to reduce the Federal deficit.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today to salute Senator Harlan Mathews of Tennessee. As you know, Mr. President, when our former colleague Senator Albert Gore, Jr., of Tennessee was elected Vice President of the United States, Harlan Mathews was appointed to fill his unexpired term.\n\tWhen he came to this body, Harlan Mathews listed three major goals for his service in the Senate--working to balance the Federal budget, reducing the deficit and reforming our Nation's health care system. Those concerns were shared by many of us. Before coming to the Senate he served as Tennessee Commissioner of Finance for 10 years, the longest tenure of any commissioner in his State's history. In 1974 he was elected State treasurer of Tennessee and his 13 years in that office again were the longest of any treasurer in Tennessee history. When he came to Washington, Harlan Mathews brought with him a clear understanding of the need for fiscally responsible government.\n\tA fiscal conservative, he demonstrated his commitment to his personal beliefs by cosponsoring legislation calling for a balanced Federal budget and supporting efforts to reduce the Federal deficit. He can point with pride to the fact that during his service in the Senate, we passed by far the most sweeping budget deficit reduction plan in decades. During his tenure as a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, he supported efforts to strengthen U.S. trade policy. Senator Mathews felt strongly that our Nation's economic future was linked directly to improving our Nation's trade performance. In line with that view, he sponsored legislation to emphasize the importance of trade relations between the United States and the Asia Pacific nations in an expanding global market.\n\tAs a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Mathews was a strong voice for Tennessee on issues ranging from coal production to research and development at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and preservation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. He cosponsored legislation to strengthen the Department of Energy's ability to work with industry and educational groups to share research and technological advances. Senator Mathews also has been a team player. He has repeatedly assumed responsibility for presiding over the Senate to relieve other Senators from that obligation. His many courtesies and kindnesses to his fellow Senators will long be remembered in this body.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Kent Conrad"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the retirement of \none of this Chamber's most dedicated Members, Senator David Durenberger \nof Minnesota. In 1988, Senator Durenberger became the first Minnesota \nRepublican elected to three terms in the U.S. Senate. Now, Mr. \nPresident, Senator Durenberger has decided to retire from this body \nafter 16 years of dedicated service to the Senate and to the Nation. \nSince I came to the Senate 8 years ago my respect for my colleague from \nMinnesota has grown with each opportunity of working with him on \nmatters of common concern. My homestate of North Dakota and his \nhomestate of Minnesota share a common border. And although we are of \ndifferent political parties, we often have worked together in a spirit \nof bipartisan cooperation on issues of common interest to the Upper \nMidwest and to the nation as a whole.\n  Senator Durenberger once said: ``We need to measure government by \noutcomes--not how much government spends.'' I share that view. He also \nsaid one of the problems in Washington is that too often \naccomplishments are framed by how much money we spend or how much we \nsave rather than what is most important--``what we produce for the \nAmerican people.'' Again, I share those sentiments. Time after time \nSenator Durenberger has cast votes to restrain Federal spending even \nwhen they were sometimes not politically popular. It is that spirit of \npolitical courage, rather than political expediency that has \ncharacterized his years in the Senate.\n  But I think the historic health care reform debate of 1994 may be \nconsidered the fitting culmination to the career of my colleague from \nMinnesota. As a member of the Jackson Hole Group, chairman of the \nSenate Health Subcommittee from 1981 to 1986 and as a member of the \nSenate Finance Committee, he has for years been a leader in the effort \nto enact health care reform. The term managed competition is now a \nhousehold word, but it wasn't when Senator Durenberger began his effort \nto promote managed care in the early 1970s. In 1993, he cosponsored \nwith Senator John Breaux of Louisiana the Managed Competition Act, \nwhich was based on the experience of Minnesota on the health care \nissue.\n  This spirit of bipartisanship has been a hallmark of Senator \nDurenberger's service in this Chamber. He has been called an architect \nof compromise. he was one of a group of seven Senate conferees who \nhammered out a realistic compromise to end a 10-year impasse over the \nClean Air Act. I have worked with him in a spirit of cooperation on \nthat legislation and other major environmental laws, including the \nSuperfund Act, the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. In \n1993, he was a leader in the effort that secured the bipartisan \ncompromise allowing passage of a campaign finance reform bill in the \nSenate. I believe the record of Senator Durenberger in working to \nachieve bipartisan consensus on crucial issues is what the people of \nthis Nation want from their elected officials.\n  Earlier, I mentioned his years of work to achieve reform of our \nNation's troubled health care system. Those efforts continued this \nyear. As you know, Mr. President, Senator Durenberger and I joined \nseveral other Senators to form what came to be called the mainstream \ncoalition. This was a bipartisan group of Senators who worked to come \nup with a compromise health care plan that would not create a huge new \nbureaucracy, but would instead rely on our existing private system to \nexpand access to health care for millions of Americans.\n  We spent countless days and nights working together to try to reach a \ncompromise. As the debate continued, the mainstream coalition's numbers \ngrew as other Members of this body joined us in the effort at \nbipartisan accomplishment. It is unfortunate that in the end time ran \nout and we were unable to see our mainstream plan enacted into law. But \nthat in no way diminishes the work of Senator Durenberger and other \nMembers of our group. Although Senator Durenberger now will return to \nprivate life, he can take satisfaction in the fact that he fought the \ngood fight for health care reform and for the people of our Nation. It \nis my hope one day he can look back and see the plan he worked on so \nmany hours in his final months in the Senate become the basis for the \neventual reform of our country's health care system.\n  Mr. President, I wish Senator Durenberger well as he returns to \nprivate life. I also hope those of us who remain will remember his \nlegacy of compromise and bipartisanship as we take on the new issues \nthat will confront us in the next session of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n              THE RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DAVID DURENBERGER\n\n\tMr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, before the 103d Congress finishes its \nbusiness, I would like to comment on one of the important bills passed \nby this body, but one that has not, in my judgment, received sufficient \nattention. I am referring to the Satellite Home Viewer Act, S. 2406, \nwhich passed both Houses of Congress in early October and which has \nalready been signed into law by President Clinton.\n  I was pleased to be a cosponsor of that legislation along with my \ngood friend Senator DeConcini, Senator Leahy, Senator Thurmond, and \nmany others. Its principal provision was an extension of the satellite \ncompulsory license, section 119 of the Copyright Act. That provision \nwas scheduled to expire at the end of this year. It will now expire at \nthe end of 1999. The importance of this provision lies in the fact that \nit ensures uninterrupted reception of basic television service to many \nAmericans who depend on the satellite dish for their television \nreception. This means most, of course, to our many rural citizens. I \nknow for example that in my home State of Utah there are at least \n28,000 satellite dishowners who cannot receive television signals in \nthe normal over-the-air manner that most of us enjoy. For them, \nextension of the satellite compulsory license was necessary at the \ntime, if they were to continue to receive such programming at an \naffordable price.\n  I must at this point, Mr. President, note that I have long been an \nopponent of compulsory licensing as a general proposition. And so it \nwas with some reluctance that I came to cosponsor S. 2406. Instead, I \nhave always believed that our free market system and our copyright laws \nare strong enough, and flexible enough, to permit our television and \ncable industries to clear copyrights without the need for Government \nregulation.\n  There was, to be sure, a point in time--some 20 years ago--when the \ncable industry did in fact need the Government assistance which the \ncable and satellite compulsory licenses provide. But that time has \nclearly passed. Neither the satellite license nor the cable compulsory \nlicense--section 111 of the Copyright Act--was ever intended to \nsubsidize successful companies in perpetuity. However, it became clear \nas we approached the end of the satellite license's first 5-year \nexperiment that all parties involved in the home delivery of satellite \nsignals needed an acceptable transition to the marketplace, and the \nfinal text of S. 2406 provides just such a transition.\n  I therefore commend my colleagues on the Patent Subcommittee for \nsupporting the extension of the satellite compulsory license through \n1999. It is my hope that this bill will promote a transition to the \nmarketplace by insuring that Government established compulsory license \nrates will reflect the fair market value of the programming on all \nstations, as specified in the text of the bill.\n  The decision to seek a compulsory license fee based on ``fair market \nvalue'' under S. 2406 was the result of many compromises, which is the \nway that most legislation, particularly in the copyright field, is \ncrafted. And, as is often the case with legislative compromises, not \nall parties are entirely satisfied with the outcome. But I am confident \nthat the legislative language contained in the final text of S. 2406 \nmakes sufficiently clear the intent of the legislators who voted on it \nthat the arbitration panel which must carry out the mandate of S. 2406 \nwill have no need for recourse to the remarks of Senators such as \nmyself when they set about the business of determining the fair market \nrates required under the law.\n  One salutary benefit of the compulsory license is its ability to \nminimize the problem of excessive transaction costs. But the license is \nfairly criticized for failing to mandate rates that clearly represent \nthe true market value of the programming. I hope that the new \narbitration panels established under S. 2406 will develop the practice \nof encouraging true negotiation among the parties and that this will \nultimately lead to a time when the license itself is no longer \nnecessary. In establishing market rates, the arbitration panels must \nweigh all relevant information supplied by the parties. Although \nroyalty rates paid by cable operators will certainly be considered, \ntheir significance will no doubt be affected by the fact that cable \ncharges to subscribers are regulated by the FCC whereas satellite \ncarriers are not subject to rate regulation.\n  In summary, Mr. President, I would simply restate my desire that \nlicense fees which reasonably reflect the true worth of programming be \nrecognized as the ultimate goal of our legislative efforts in this \narea. That is the only fair way that we can honor America's creative \ncommunity and protect their valuable, hard-earned copyrights. It may be \nthat the inflexibility written into the cable compulsory license will \nprevent us from reaching that goal under our current legislative \nframework. If so, I will not hesitate to suggest again, as Senator \nDeConcini and I did in the 102d Congress, that it may be time for a \ncomplete overhaul of all compulsory licenses under the Copyright Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                 THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER ACT OF 1994\n\n\tMr. HATCH.

Mr. President, this year, we commemorated the 50th \nanniversary of the Normandy Invasion, which set into motion the \nliberation of an anguished Europe. D-Day was a monumental undertaking \nand a stunning achievement. However, Mr. President, during the very \nsame year, the war in Europe was the backdrop of another event--far \nless historically noted but historic nonetheless--and I would like to \nbring it to the attention of the members of this body.\n  On February 22, 1944, Army Air Corps Second Lieutenant Wah Kau Kong \nflew his fourteenth and last mission. From his position as wingman to \nthe squadron commander, Kong sighted a Messerschmidt 109. He attacked, \nstreaking in from above, a deadly torrent spewing from the machine guns \nof his P-51 Mustang. His aim true, Kong's tracers ripped into the \nGerman's wing tanks, the exploding fuel rending the craft's airframe.\n  Kong pulled swiftly out of his dive to avoid a collision and \nthrottled past the burning plane. As the Mustang shot in front of the \nMesserschmidt, incredibly, a lethal fusillade issued from the flying \ninferno. Bullets coursed through the P-51's wings, igniting the fuel \nwithin, and Kong's fighter erupted in a mass of searing flame. It \nplummeted into the forest below, slicing through a tree before plowing \ninto the ground.\n  Wah Kau Kong, the first Chinese-American fighter pilot in United \nStates history had valiantly given his life in battle to the cause of \nliberty.\n  Born twenty-five years earlier in the quiet Honolulu neighborhood of \nPalama, Wah Kau Kong grew up an exceedingly bright young man with an \nabiding, sardonic wit. He went on to the University of Hawaii and \ngraduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry, with honors. Possessed \nof great athletic aptitude as well, Kong was a skilled competitor in \nswimming, basketball and track and field.\n  He also undertook another endeavor. Wah Kau scraped together enough \nmoney to take up flying lessons. It was the whetting of what would be a \nlifelong thirst for the freedom of flight.\n  As a chemist working toward his master's degree when the U.S. entered \nWorld War II in 1941, Kong found himself in great demand, particularly \nby the Federal Government. However, not having been called to active \nduty, when so many others had, gnawed at Wah Kau. He decided to join \nthe fighting and enlisted in the Army Air Corps in early 1942, \nrecording the highest national score in his entrance examination. \nCombined with his commissioned officer status through ROTC \nparticipation in school and his flying experience, it meant immediate \nacceptance into the aviation cadet training program.\n\n  By the end of the year, Kong had completed the primary elements of \nflight school. Then began the greater rigors, and often-harsh \ntreatment, of advanced training. The threat of failure was a constant \ncompanion, and a number of his comrades ``washed out.'' In May of 1943, \nthough, Wah Kau Kong got his wings.\n  Now, in the final stages of combat preparation, he moved from the old \ntraining planes to a powerful P-39 Airacobra. Skillful, intelligent and \ngutsy (with the keen reflexes to match his daring), Kong emulated the \nBritish tactic of ``rhubarb,'' where trains and other ground targets \nwould be attacked from levels as low as 20 feet. Not surprisingly, he \nwas an adept practitioner. Unfortunately, he was grounded for it when \ntwo other pilots were badly injured when they crashed while attempting \nto do same.\n  Writing to his family, Kong said, ``Flying around here is getting \nsissified . . . just because of an accident or two. If they keep this \nup, there will be no difference between us and bomber pilots * * * \nHowever in the future I'll cut it out and not try to out-do others too \nmuch.''\n  Finally, in October of 1943, Kong was sent to England and assigned to \nthe 353rd Fighter Squadron of the 354th Fighter Group.\n  The conditions were totally miserable--cold and muddy, with barely-\nedible food and primitive facilities.\n  His P-51B Mustang was utterly wonderful--new and powerful, with the \nability to escort bombers at high altitude all the way to Germany and \nback.\n  While others christened their craft with the names of girlfriends or \nmothers, exhortations of bravado and the like, it was all far too \nprosaic for Wah Kau. With typical, unabashedly irreverent flare, he had \nemblazoned on the cowling of his Mustang: ``Chinaman's Chance'' and \n``No Tickee-No Washee.''\n  Weeks passed before Kong was able to see any action, and he was \nchamping at the bit. During an interview with an Army public relations \nofficer, Wah Kau thought to spice up his reputation in a more unique \nway, having yet to score any victories in the air. ``Well,'' he said, \n``you could announce that Kong is without question the handsomest \nChinese fighter pilot in the ETO.'' When it was pointed out that he was \nthe only Chinese pilot in the ETO, he replied, ``Well, we could drop \nthe ETO and eliminate the Chinese. There's a story, the handsomest \npilot.''\n  Finally, on February 11, 1944, he garnered his first air conquest, \nand what a moment it was! The feat even caught the attention of Time \nmagazine, which reported:\n\n                           Kong gets a German\n\n       The frustrated Nazi was at 27,000 feet, madly popping his \n     Fokke-Wulf's guns at U.S. bombers well out of his range.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to George \nMitchell, our majority leader, on his retirement from the United States \nSenate and to wish him well on the challenges which await him in the \nfuture.\n  When the 104th Congress convenes next January, the Senate will elect \na new Majority Leader. We can and will do that, but we will not be able \nto replace George Mitchell. He will leave a tremendous void in this \ninstitution. It will be less wise, less savvy and less compassionate. \nWe will also miss his calm demeanor, his carefully thought out \narguments, his great passion when he is fighting for the rights of \nordinary people, and his judicious temperament. George Mitchell \ncombined great skill in analyzing both legislation and the temperament \nof this body at any given moment.\n  In the 22 years I have had the honor of serving in the Senate, I can \nrecall no Senator that I hold in higher regard than George Mitchell. We \nhave served together since 1980 when he was appointed to serve the \nremainder of Ed Muskie's term. I consider myself privileged to have \nbeen able to work closely with George Mitchell on many occasions, \nincluding our work on the Iran-Contra Committee.\n  Those of us who have had the responsibility as committee chairmen in \nmoving in moving a bill on the Senate floor appreciate Senator \nMitchell's unique talents perhaps more than others. The two to three \nweeks that it sometimes takes to complete debate on our Armed Services \nauthorization bill have given me a close vantage point to see the kind \nof extreme stress and pressure that our Majority Leader has endured in \nour behalf. From both sides of the aisle, we call on him for special \nconsideration in the schedule, in accommodating our amendments, in \nenduring or breaking filibusters, and on and on.\n  Through all of this, George Mitchell has maintained his warmth and \ncourtesy and kindness.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to George Mitchell, our majority leader, on his retirement from the United States Senate and to wish him well on the challenges which await him in the future.\n\tWhen the 104th Congress convenes next January, the Senate will elect a new Majority Leader. We can and will do that, but we will not be able to replace George Mitchell. He will leave a tremendous void in this institution. It will be less wise, less savvy and less compassionate. We will also miss his calm demeanor, his carefully thought out arguments, his great passion when he is fighting for the rights of ordinary people, and his judicious temperament. George Mitchell combined great skill in analyzing both legislation and the temperament of this body at any given moment.\n\tIn the 22 years I have had the honor of serving in the Senate, I can recall no Senator that I hold in higher regard than George Mitchell. We have served together since 1980 when he was appointed to serve the remainder of Ed Muskie's term. I consider myself privileged to have been able to work closely with George Mitchell on many occasions, including our work on the Iran-Contra Committee.\n\tThose of us who have had the responsibility as committee chairmen in moving in moving a bill on the Senate floor appreciate Senator Mitchell's unique talents perhaps more than others. The two to three weeks that it sometimes takes to complete debate on our Armed Services authorization bill have given me a close vantage point to see the kind of extreme stress and pressure that our Majority Leader has endured in our behalf. From both sides of the aisle, we call on him for special consideration in the schedule, in accommodating our amendments, in enduring or breaking filibusters, and on and on.\n\tThrough all of this, George Mitchell has maintained his warmth and courtesy and kindness. His dignity and sense of fairness have enhanced this institution at a time when that contribution was particularly important to the Senate and to the country.\n\tGeorge Mitchell is a man of many talents. He served with distinction in the United States Army in its counter-intelligence branch. He later worked in the Department of Justice.

Mr. President, we have entered a crucial moment in Middle \nEast diplomacy. In the past several weeks, Islamic extremists from the \nHamas and Islamic Jihad organizations have carried out a number of \nbloody and violent acts that threaten to unravel the peace agreement \nbetween Israel and the PLO. The extremists have succeeded in polarizing \nthe Palestinian population to the point where Yasir Arafat's power and \ninfluence are in serious doubt.

The two \ncountries recently announced the establishment of formal diplomatic \nrelations and are expected to exchange Ambassadors before the end of \nthe year.

The \nnoble thoughts and sentiments that were expressed in the Israel-PLO \nDeclaration of Principles, were, after all, only paper and ink. The \ntrue test of peace comes now, and success will require hard work, \nsteady concentration, and immense patience on all sides. Even though it \nseems clear that the parties in the region want to move forward, they \nare entering a period when they must follow through on promises made, \nand when they must make some very tough choices so additional \nagreements can be reached.\n  A number of difficult issues need to be resolved in the coming year \nif a comprehensive peace is to remain a possibility. These include \nestablishing mechanisms to prevent the spread of Palestinian violence \nand terror against Israel, to shore up the Palestinian economy, and to \npromote an acceptable compromise between Israel and Syria on the Golan \nHeights.

Mr. President, all of us were surprised when we learned \nlast March about Senator Mitchell's decision to retire at the end of \nthis session of Congress. But that was then and this is now. And now we \nknow why he did it. George has always been able to see farther ahead \nthan the rest of us.\n  But seriously, George Mitchell has been an outstanding majority \nleader for the past 6 years and an outstanding Senator for the people \nof Maine since 1980.\n  He began his political career in the office of another outstanding \nSenator from Maine, Ed Muskie. Even before coming to the Senate, George \nhad already served his State and his country with great distinction, \nfirst as the State Democratic Party Chair, then as the U.S. attorney \nfor Maine, and then as a Federal judge.\n  When Ed Muskie left the Senate to become Secretary of State in the \nCarter administration in 1980, George Mitchell was appointed to fill \nthe Senate vacancy. He won a dramatic victory to a full term in 1982, \nand that's when the true Mitchell legend began. Six months before that \nelection, he trailed his opponent by more than 30 points. But he \nperformed as brilliantly on the campaign trail as he has in so many \nother endeavors. With the wit, intelligence, charm, determination, and \npatience that all of us know so well, he won that race by more than 20 \npoints. And in the years since then, it can well be said just as Maine \nwent for George Mitchell, so did the Senate and so did the nation.\n  When Democrats regained control of the Senate in 1986, it was George \nMitchell who led us to that victory as chairman of the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee. Two years later, he was chosen to be our \nmajority leader--and what a brilliant job he has done ever since.\n  George will be missed by every member of this body. Attending to the \nneeds and schedules of 99 other Senators is probably one of the most \ndifficult and thankless jobs in the American political system. But he \ndid it superbly, treating requests from all members of the Senate \nequally, and with the fairness and wisdom that have always been his \nhallmark as leader.\n  But he also set an ambitious and positive agenda for this body, and \nhe never stopped pushing for its completion. The Clean Air Act. The \nMinimum Wage. The Americans With Disabilities Act. The 1991 Civil \nRights Act. The Family and Medical Leave Act. The Crime Bill. The Goals \n2000 and Direct Loan Bills. The dramatic victory for President \nClinton's budget. None of these measures would have passed without the \nenergy, intelligence, and tireless commitment of George Mitchell.\n  I especially commend Senator Mitchell for his effective role in \nhealth reform. His leadership has been indispensable in bringing this \nissue to the center of the national agenda. In the last Congress, \nSenator Mitchell decided to make health reform a Democratic leadership \nissue. He worked hard to unite our party around the HealthAmerica bill, \nand his efforts were essential in raising the Nation's consciousness on \nhealth reform and laying the groundwork for President Clinton's \nsuccessful use of the issue of the issue in the 1992 campaign.\n  In this Congress, Senator Mitchell knew that the gap between campaign \nrhetoric and actual legislation would be large, and that the goal would \nbe difficult to achieve. But he made the decision early that this cause \nwas of the highest importance to the American people and deserved the \nhighest priority for action by Congress.\n  Last summer, Senator Mitchell led a skillful effort to write a bill \nthat could command the support of most Democrats. In the fall, he \nworked just as hard to try to achieve a compromise with the bipartisan \nmainstream group that could command the support of the full Senate.\n  Senator Mitchell passed up a nomination to the Supreme Court in order \nto continue the battle for health reform. Had he been nominated, he \ncertainly would have been confirmed. It is a measure of his dedication \nand patriotism that he made the choice he did. While his efforts were \nunsuccessful in this Congress, the progress we made under his \nleadership has brought us closer than ever to the goal. For this, and \nfor so many other causes that he selflessly and tenaciously supported \nduring his years in the Senate, the American people owe him a profound \ndebt of gratitude.\n  While he worked hard on these and other national priorities, his \nfirst priority was always the people of Maine. Whether creating jobs \nthrough Navy contracts for the Bath Iron Works, enacting legislation to \nhelp rural Maine communities find doctors and nurses, fighting to keep \nthe Brunswick Naval Air Station and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard open, or \nworking to protect Maine's magnificent environment and natural \nresources, the needs of the people of Maine were always George \nMitchell's highest concern.\n  Of course, he always made time to help his colleagues as much as \npossible--so much so in fact that John erry and I often thought of \nGeorge Mitchell as Massachusetts' third Senator. I have no doubt that \nmany other Senators felt the same way about him. He's been their \nSenator too--he's that able, and that fair.\n  But whether we think of him as a great colleague, a great leader or a \ngreat friend, we know that we will miss him, just as the people of \nMaine will miss him. We honor him for his years of outstanding service \nand for his commitment to his constituents, to this institution and to \nthe Nation. We hope very much that he will soon be back in public \nservice.

For this, and for so many other causes that he selflessly and tenaciously supported during his years in the Senate, the American people owe him a profound debt of gratitude.\n\tWhile he worked hard on these and other national priorities, his first priority was always the people of Maine. Whether creating jobs through Navy contracts for the Bath Iron Works, enacting legislation to help rural Maine communities find doctors and nurses, fighting to keep the Brunswick Naval Air Station and Portsmouth Naval Shipyard open, or working to protect Maine's magnificent environment and natural resources, the needs of the people of Maine were always George Mitchell's highest concern.\n\tOf course, he always made time to help his colleagues as much as possible--so much so in fact that John erry and I often thought of George Mitchell as Massachusetts' third Senator. I have no doubt that many other Senators felt the same way about him. He's been their Senator too--he's that able, and that fair.\n\tBut whether we think of him as a great colleague, a great leader or a great friend, we know that we will miss him, just as the people of Maine will miss him. We honor him for his years of outstanding service and for his commitment to his constituents, to this institution and to the Nation. We hope very much that he will soon be back in public service. The Nation needs him.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Edward M.

Mr. President, it is an honor to join in the tributes to \nour outstanding colleague from Pennsylvania, Harris Wofford. His Senate \nyears, like his entire career, have been extraordinary.\n  I suspect it all began as a young man, when Harris went to India to \nstudy the career of Mohandas Gandhi. In Many ways, Harris exemplified \nthat ideal--the ideal of the Philosopher-activist. There could have \nbeen no more appropriate joining of student and subject, because Harris \nWofford--in the Senate for the past 3\\1/2\\ years and throughout a \nlifetime of public service--has been an American version of that ideal.\n  All of us who know Harris recognize his outstanding qualities, \nespecially his unflinching commitment to doing what is right. He knows \nthe details of policy issues as well as the broader social and \nhistorical context from which they emerge. He is able to reach across \npartisan and ideological lines to bring about far-reaching agreements \nthat are compromises on details and tactics, but that are never \ncompromises of basic principles. He is a Senator I have been proud to \nwork with in the labor and Human Resources Committee and on the floor \nof the Senate on so many issues to improve the quality of life for \nhard-working men and women across this country.\n  Harris served in the Army Air Corps during the Second World War.\n  He went from the Army to the University of Chicago, to India, to a \nkibbutz in Israel, and to Howard University Law School. After he \ngraduated from law school, he enlisted in one of the great moral \nstruggles of our time here in the United States, the fight for civil \nrights for American of all races. Harris was an adviser to Martin \nLuther King from the time of the Montgomery bus boycott onward. He \nhelped draft the first Civil Rights Act in 1966 and was counsel to the \nU.S Commission on Civil Rights under Rev. Theodore Hesburgh.\n  Harris' work in civil rights had a special significance for the \nKennedy family. He was a key aide to Senator John Kennedy in his 1960 \ncampaign, and he was a special assistant to President Kennedy with \nresponsibility for chairing the sub-cabinet group on civil rights. He \nalso worked with Sargent Shriver on the creation of the Peace Corps, \nand was its associate director.\n  After leaving the Peace Corps in 1966, Harris served as the president \nof two colleges, as well as practicing law. He entered public service \nagain in 1987 as secretary of labor and industry for the State of \nPennsylvania.\n  Harris was appointed to the Senate in 1991. He won re-election in his \nown right later that year in a dramatic victory over Dick Thornburgh. \nHarris' election sent a shock wave through Washington, because it \nshowed that universal health care was an issue that mattered deeply to \nthe people of Pennsylvania and to the people of this country. Harris \ncrystallized the issue in two simple sentences: ``Under the \nConstitution, those accused of a crime have the right to a lawyer. It \nshould be just as fundamental that when a person is sick they should \nhave the right to see a doctor.''\n  Just as securing the right to equal justice under the law for \nAfrican-Americans was a basic test for the Nation in the 1960's, \nsecuring the fundamental right to health care for all Americans is a \nbasic measure of our national character in the 1990's. Harris Wofford \nhad the vision to understand both of the imperatives, and the \ncommitment and courage and skill to help others to understand the need \nfor action.\n  I have worked most closely with Harris on the causes that engaged us \non the Labor Committee over these past 3 years--the struggle for \nuniversal health care, for community service, for an effective school-\nto-work educational program to improve job opportunities for the young, \nand for many other important issues. Harris' contributions to our work \ncannot be over estimated.\n  Community service was a cause Harris brought with him from his days \nat the Peace Corps, and even more from his life experience and his \nvision of citizenship. He was a strong and effective voice for passage \non that landmark legislation in 1993. On the school-to-work \nlegislation, the programs he created in Pennsylvania provided an \nimportant model for our committee's efforts, and he helped immeasurably \nin shaping the legislation and moving it to final passage.\n  On health reform and universal health care--the cause with which his \nSenate career has been most identified--he worked to bridge bipartisan \ndifferences by cutting bureaucracy and streamlining the program. He was \nthe principal author of the provisions in the bill protecting privacy \nand creating administrative simplification. He authored important \nprovisions protecting retirees, and he worked to include a program \ngiving senior citizens and others a chance to participate in a \nvoluntary program providing insurance against high nursing home costs \nat a reasonable price.\n  But more than any specific provision, it was Harris' constant and \nunremitting effort to push the committee and the Senate toward reform \nthat was his unique contribution. And until the very end of the debate \nin the full Senate, he worked with his usual optimism, extraordinary \nspirit, and deep commitment to find some way of enacting at least a \ndown payment on reform this year. We did not reach the goal line this \nyear, but surely no one moved the ball farther toward that goal than \nHarris Wofford.\n  When the framers of the Constitution conceived the idea of a U.S. \nSenate, they had in mind the notion of an assembly of wise statesmen, \nphilosophers who would take the long view of the Nation's needs and an \nexpansive vision of its interests. Harris Wofford has been the kind of \nSenator the founding fathers would have liked the most. I am proud to \nhave had the opportunity to serve with him, and I am confident that the \nNation will have future opportunities to call on his unique talent for \npublic service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                             HARRIS WOFFORD\n\n\tMr. KENNEDY.

We did not reach the goal line this year, but surely no one moved the ball farther toward that goal than Harris Wofford.\n\tWhen the framers of the Constitution conceived the idea of a U.S. Senate, they had in mind the notion of an assembly of wise statesmen, philosophers who would take the long view of the Nation's needs and an expansive vision of its interests. Harris Wofford has been the kind of Senator the founding fathers would have liked the most. I am proud to have had the opportunity to serve with him, and I am confident that the Nation will have future opportunities to call on his unique talent for public service.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Edward M.

We worked closely \ntogether on the COBRA extension of coverage legislation in 1986.

We also worked together in 1986 to modify the formula for \ncalculating the Medicare hospital deductible which unfairly burdened \nour senior citizens.\n  Since Dave joined the Labor and Human Resources Committee in 1989, \nour work together has extended far beyond health. Senator Durenberger \nplayed a vital role in the passage of last year's national community \nservice legislation, which is giving thousands of Americans the \nopportunity to serve their communities and receive educational aid in \nreturn.

He helped develop a new \nFederal agenda that moved away from support for categorical, fragmented \nprograms and toward greater support for locally-developed school \nreform.\n  On Goals 2000, he was an unwavering supporter of the legislation \nitself and of the cloture vote that became necessary for the bill to \npass.

Mr. President, several of my Senate colleagues will be \nretiring with me at the end of this Congress. Some of them, like \nSenators Sasser, Danforth, Wallop, and DeConcini, were elected in 1976 \njust as I was. Others, like Senators Boren, Mitchell, Mathews, Wofford, \nand Durenberger, arrived in later elections. But we all arrived in the \nSenate with a common goal; to help improve the lives of our \nconstituents, and the Nation as a whole. Although we may have had \ndiffering views on how to accomplish our goal, each of us has \nendeavored to do our best for our constituents and our country.\n  I have been very fortunate to work closely with some of these \nSenators over the past years, and I would like to congratulate them on \ntheir important public service.\n  Howard Metzenbaum has had a great impact on my life, and the lives of \nmany of us here. It is an understatement to say that he is both a great \nSenator and a great human being. He has brought special qualities to \nthe Senator--he is a man of conscience with the courage and skill \nneeded to act upon his conscience. Every debate was elevated by \nHoward's participation, and his fearlessness in confronting tough \nissues is the stuff of political legend. Nobody works harder or \naccomplishes more than he does, and this institution will be diminished \nby the lack of his presence. I have been honored to have worked \nshoulder to shoulder with Howard on countless issues that matter to the \nworking people of our states, and I am especially privileged to be his \nfriend.\n  When Howard announced his retirement, he paid tribute to his wife, \nShirley. Howard has had the good fortune to have a loving wife and \npartner, and a family situation from which great children and \ngrandchildren have come. I know that he's looking forward to spending \nmore time with Shirley and their family, but I'm glad to know that as \nthe head of the Consumer Federation of America Howard Metzenbaum will \nstill be on the political front lines, fighting for the interests of \nworking Americans.\n  The end of this Congress will also mark the departure of our majority \nleader, George Mitchell. I have rarely seen such exceptional talent and \ngrace in a person as one sees in George Mitchell. He has one of the \ntoughest jobs in Government, even tougher than the President's at \ntimes, and he has helped elevate the Senate with his dignity, \nbrilliance, and fierce determination. In every way, George Mitchell has \nbeen the model of what a majority leader should be. Had fate been \ndifferent, he might well have served as President. He would have had my \nvote.\n  I have also worked with him in Finance Committee on an issue of great \nimportance to all Americans--health care reform. George Mitchell worked \ntirelessly over many years with every Senator who genuinely wanted to \nforge a meaningful compromise on this issue. In the past 2 years, the \nmajority leader endeavored to find a workable middle ground and, \nalthough we were finally blocked from passing health reform \nlegislation, he continued to work on this issue until the very last \ndays of session.\n  A couple of months ago, most of our colleagues attended a dinner for \nGeorge Mitchell during which he gave a most moving speech, reflecting \non his years of service and the pivotal moments of his life. It is the \nkind of speech that can change a young person's life, and so I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nStatement of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, October 5, 1994\n\n       I'm grateful to President Clinton, to my colleagues from \n     the Congress, and to all of you for your support for this \n     scholarship fund. This is as important to me as anything I've \n     done since I entered public service.\n       Before I entered the Senate, I had the privilege of serving \n     as a Federal judge. In that position, I had great power. The \n     one I most enjoyed exercising was when I presided over what \n     are called naturalization ceremonies. They're citizenship \n     ceremonies. A group of people gathered before me in a federal \n     courtroom. They'd come from every part of the world. They'd \n     gone through the required procedures. Now in the final act, I \n     administered to them the oath of allegiance to the United \n     States. And then I made them Americans.\n       It was always emotional for me because my mother was an \n     immigrant, my father the orphan son of immigrants. They had \n     no education and they lived hard lives. But because of their \n     efforts, and more importantly, because of the openness of \n     American society, I, their son, am today the Majority Leader \n     of the United States Senate.\n       After every ceremony I spoke personally with each of the \n     new Americans. I asked where they came from, how they came, \n     why they came. Their stories were as different as their \n     countries of origin, but all were infused with a tangible and \n     inspiring love for this, the country of their choice. The \n     answers of the new Americans to my question of why they came \n     were different. But a common theme ran through them. It was \n     best expressed by a young Asian man who replied, in slow, \n     broken English: ``I came because here in America everyone has \n     a chance.'' A young man who'd been an American for five \n     minutes summed up the meaning of America in a single \n     sentence. Here, everyone has a chance.\n       But in the twenty-first century, and the third century of \n     American history, everyone will not have a chance to succeed \n     unless they first have a chance to learn. The competition \n     will be fierce and unforgiving. Those who lack knowledge and \n     skill will not succeed. I consider myself to be especially \n     fortunate. I had a chance. I got an education.\n       My mother spent her entire working life on the night shift \n     in textile mills. She was a woman of strength and substance, \n     the most influential person in my life. My father was a \n     laborer and a janitor. Like many in their generation, they \n     devoted their lives to providing for their children the \n     education they never had. They had a profound, perhaps even \n     exaggerated sense of the value of formal education. Although \n     they died without property of prominence, my parents had rich \n     and fulfilling lives by their standards--and mine.\n       I experienced early in life the value of learning. In my \n     junior year at high school, I met an English teacher named \n     Elvira Whitten. I was fifteen years ago, naive, totally \n     lacking in self awareness or self-confidence. I had never \n     read a book, other than what was required to move from one \n     grade in school to the next. She was elderly, intelligent and \n     kind.\n       One day she asked me to come back to class after school. I \n     did, not knowing what to expect. She talked for a few \n     minutes, then she asked me what and how much I read. I told \n     her. She picked a book up off her desk and handed it to me, \n     and said she thought I would find it interesting.\n       She made it clear I didn't have to read it, but she asked \n     if I would, for her, and, if I did, to come back and tell her \n     what I thought of it. I agreed to read the book because I \n     respected her and knew that it would please her. That night, \n     I got into bed, opened the book and began reading.\n       It was ``The Moon is Down,'' a short novel by John \n     Steinbeck about a wartime military occupation--presumably the \n     Nazi occupation of Norway. I stayed up most of the night \n     reading it, and could hardly wait to tell Mrs. Whitten about \n     it. She smiled, handed me another book and said, ``I thought \n     you'd like it. Here's another one you might like.''\n       It went that way for a few months, and then she gently \n     suggested that I start picking out my own books. I did so, \n     and felt the first stirring of self-worth. It was my exposure \n     to the world of books, to the excitement of knowledge, and it \n     was my first step to adulthood.\n       I've often wondered what would have become of me if I had \n     not met Mrs. Whitten, or if she had not taken an interest in \n     me. I will always regret that before her death I never went \n     back to tell her what a difference she made in my life. This \n     is my way of doing so, and through her, all of the other \n     teachers who hold the wondrous power to open young minds and \n     inspire young lives.\n       Earlier this year, when I announced that I would not seek \n     reelection, I received hundreds of requests from groups who \n     wanted to honor me in some way. I asked that all such offers \n     be concentrated into this one effort. The money raised \n     tonight will be combined with the remainder of my campaign \n     fund to set up a scholarship foundation to help needy and \n     deserving students get a college education.\n       Nothing is more important to success in American life than \n     a good education. I believe that, because of my own \n     experience and because of what I expect to be the rising \n     demands of the next century.\n       I once needed help and got it. Now, fate has provided me \n     the opportunity to help others. I'm grateful for that \n     opportunity. And I'm grateful to you for helping to make it \n     possible. I've been proud to serve the people of Maine in the \n     United States Senate. It's a great honor, the greatest of my \n     life. But when the 104th Congress convenes in January, I will \n     not be there to take the oath of office as a United States \n     Senator.\n       My decision not to seek reelection was based solely on my \n     personal concept of public service. I will miss the Senate. I \n     will miss my colleagues. Most of all, I will miss public \n     service.\n       I've been in the private sector and then in the public \n     sector, and I'm now returning to the private sector. I take \n     nothing away from private life when I say that nothing can \n     ever give the deep and meaningful satisfaction that comes \n     from public service. Public service gives work a value and \n     meaning greater than mere personal ambition and private \n     goals.\n       Public service must be and is its own reward, for it does \n     not guarantee wealth, popularity, or respect. It's often \n     frustrating. But when you do something that will change the \n     lives of people for the better, then it's worth all the \n     frustrations. We are the most fortunate people ever to have \n     lived, to be Americans, citizens of the most free, the most \n     open, the most just society in human history. Ours is \n     virtually the only government in history dedicated to opening \n     doors, not closing them.\n       In America today, I believe anyone can go as far and reach \n     as high as work, talent, and education allow. We can't \n     equalize effort or talent and we shouldn't. But we can \n     provide equal opportunity--the promise to everyone of a fair \n     chance to succeed. It's because of the promise of America \n     that I was able to become the Majority Leader of the United \n     States Senate.\n       Whatever new problems arise, whatever unforeseeable \n     challenges come, if we can keep that promise alive for our \n     children and theirs, America will lose her way. For me, \n     that's the purpose of public service, its inspiration and \n     finally, its reward.\n       Thank you for your support, your trust, and your \n     friendship.\n\n  Mr. Riegle. Mr. President, Jim Sasser and I came to the U.S. Senate \ntogether in the 1976 election. We've served together on Budget \nCommittee for many years now, and we have been most fortunate to have \nhim as the chairman of that committee. He was masterful and tireless in \nhandling the many complex aspects of the budget process. His important \naccomplishments will leave a lasting mark on our country.\n  Jim Sasser and I have worked closely together, we have relied upon \neach other's counsel and advice, and I deeply admire and respect him--\nand feel very privileged to have been his seat mate on the Senate \nfloor.\n  On the Budget Committee, Jim has led our country to greater economic \nstability and a dramatically declining deficit--without draconian cuts \nto vital human programs. He fought to keep the budget firewalls down \nand to make fair and reasonable program cuts where necessary. Jim \nSasser has led the charge for policies of economic expansion, job \ngrowth and increased economic investment. He has represented the people \nof Tennessee with integrity, and he has served his country with \nstrength and honor.\n  Jim has also managed to do something that is all too rare around \nhere--he's successfully combined the roles of husband, father, and \nSenator. Jim's wife, Mary, has been with him for 32 years and she and \ntheir two children, Gray and Elizabeth, deserve great credit in putting \nup with the often harsh demands of public life.\n  Senator David Boren is another colleague who is leaving the Senate, \nin fact he has just resigned his seat so that a new Oklahoma Senator \ncould be sworn in. David announced many months ago that he had been \nasked to become the next president of the University of Oklahoma. With \nhis exceptional talent, the University and its students will be very \nfortunate indeed.\n  David Boren began his public service career in the Oklahoma House of \nRepresentatives in 1966. He was the youngest sitting Governor when he \nwas elected in 1974, and he served in that office until 1979 when he \nwon his first Senate election.\n  As a member of Agriculture Committee, David has pushed policies that \nhave positively affected farmers in my State of Michigan and across the \ncountry. The Farm Credit Act of 1987 stabilized the Farm Credit System \nand saved thousands of borrowers from bankruptcy. He has also taken a \nlead role in pushing for improved export programs which will increase \nour farm products' markets overseas. As David has now embarked on his \nnew life as president of the University of Oklahoma, I wish him and his \nwife, Molly, happiness and success.\n  The 104th Congress will also mark the departure of my good friend \nSenator Dennis DeConcini, who has been in public service for over 22 \nyears. His first successful Arizona campaign was for Pima County \nattorney in 1972, a position in which Dennis distinguished himself as a \ntough prosecutor, especially on drug crimes.\n  Four years later, he and I were both elected to our first terms as \nU.S. Senators. In the years since then, Dennis has continued \nchampioning drug enforcement issues on the Judiciary Committee and as \nchair of the Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as being active \non the Appropriations Committee, Veterans' Affairs Committee, and the \nSelect Committee on Indian Affairs. He has served the people of Arizona \nwith distinction, and has continued the tradition of public service \nestablished by his parents, Evo and Ora.\n\n  Dennis is a man of heart and conscience, who cares deeply about the \npublic interest and our country's future. He has been devoted to his \nwork as a Senator and he has accomplished much that is good and that \nwill be enduring. He will be missed by the Senate--and missed by me.\n  Another Senator who has dedicated his life to public service is \nHarris Wofford of Pennsylvania. Few people have led a life as touched \nby history as Harris Wofford. He was a key aide to John F. Kennedy in \nhis 1960 presidential campaign, and effectively forged the bond between \nSenator Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King that was a key event in the \nclosing days of that historic election. Harris went on to become \nSpecial Assistant to President Kennedy and helped found the Peace \nCorps, an organization in which he later became Associate Director and \nSpecial Representative to Africa.\n  Harris was an advisor to Dr. Martin Luther King from the time of the \nMontgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, was chairman of President Kennedy's \nSub-Cabinet Group on Civil Rights, and has been a tireless advocate for \ncivil rights and liberties in our country for the past 40 years.\n  Harris Wofford has also been a leader in voicing the concerns and \nneeds of working men and women in our country, served admirably as \nPennsylvania's Secretary of Labor and Industry, and continued to \nactively champion those issues here in Congress. The U.S. Senate has \nbenefited greatly from Harris Wofford's great decency and effective \nservice, as have the people of Pennsylvania. We need more people like \nHarris Wofford at all levels of public service. I wish Harris, his wife \nClare, and their family all the best in the years to come--I have no \ndoubt that they will continue their active lives of public service.\n  Finally, I would like to say a few words about my good friend and \nable colleague Senator Harlan Mathews. Harlan has served the State of \nTennessee, in various roles, for the past 44 years. In the 1950s, he \nwas a staffer for Governor Browning, became a budget advisor to \nGovernor Clement, and went on to become Commissioner of Finance. Harlan \nheld that post through Governor Ellington's administration and, after a \ndecade, became the longest-serving Finance Commissioner in Tennessee \nhistory.\n  He went on to be elected as Tennessee State Treasurer in 1974 and, \nagain, he went on to hold that position for a record 13 years. Harlan \nwas serving as Deputy to Governor McWherter when he was asked to serve \nthe remaining 2 years of Vice-President Gore's Senate term.\n  Here in the Senate his has always been a voice of reason and clear \nthinking. His insight has shaped our actions here and I, like others, \nhave come to greatly value his counsel. I shall miss his company. As he \nhas in the past 40 years, Harlan represented the people of Tennessee \nwith integrity and dedication, and I send to him and to Patsy our best \nwishes for their future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                     ON THE RETIREMENT OF SENATORS\n\n\tMr. RIEGLE. Mr. President, several of my Senate colleagues will be retiring with me at the end of this Congress. Some of them, like Senators Sasser, Danforth, Wallop, and DeConcini, were elected in 1976 just as I was. Others, like Senators Boren, Mitchell, Mathews, Wofford, and Durenberger, arrived in later elections. But we all arrived in the Senate with a common goal; to help improve the lives of our constituents, and the Nation as a whole. Although we may have had differing views on how to accomplish our goal, each of us has endeavored to do our best for our constituents and our country.\n\tI have been very fortunate to work closely with some of these Senators over the past years, and I would like to congratulate them on their important public service.\n\tHoward Metzenbaum has had a great impact on my life, and the lives of many of us here. It is an understatement to say that he is both a great Senator and a great human being. He has brought special qualities to the Senator--he is a man of conscience with the courage and skill needed to act upon his conscience. Every debate was elevated by Howard's participation, and his fearlessness in confronting tough issues is the stuff of political legend. Nobody works harder or accomplishes more than he does, and this institution will be diminished by the lack of his presence. I have been honored to have worked shoulder to shoulder with Howard on countless issues that matter to the working people of our states, and I am especially privileged to be his friend.\n\tWhen Howard announced his retirement, he paid tribute to his wife, Shirley. Howard has had the good fortune to have a loving wife and partner, and a family situation from which great children and grandchildren have come. I know that he's looking forward to spending more time with Shirley and their family, but I'm glad to know that as the head of the Consumer Federation of America Howard Metzenbaum will still be on the political front lines, fighting for the interests of working Americans.\n\tThe end of this Congress will also mark the departure of our majority leader, George Mitchell. I have rarely seen such exceptional talent and grace in a person as one sees in George Mitchell. He has one of the toughest jobs in Government, even tougher than the President's at times, and he has helped elevate the Senate with his dignity, brilliance, and fierce determination. In every way, George Mitchell has been the model of what a majority leader should be. Had fate been different, he might well have served as President. He would have had my vote.\n\tI have also worked with him in Finance Committee on an issue of great importance to all Americans--health care reform. George Mitchell worked tirelessly over many years with every Senator who genuinely wanted to forge a meaningful compromise on this issue. In the past 2 years, the majority leader endeavored to find a workable middle ground and, although we were finally blocked from passing health reform legislation, he continued to work on this issue until the very last days of session.\n\tA couple of months ago, most of our colleagues attended a dinner for George Mitchell during which he gave a most moving speech, reflecting on his years of service and the pivotal moments of his life. It is the kind of speech that can change a young person's life, and so I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\nStatement of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, October 5, 1994\n\n       I'm grateful to President Clinton, to my colleagues from \n     the Congress, and to all of you for your support for this \n     scholarship fund. This is as important to me as anything I've \n     done since I entered public service.\n       Before I entered the Senate, I had the privilege of serving \n     as a Federal judge. In that position, I had great power. The \n     one I most enjoyed exercising was when I presided over what \n     are called naturalization ceremonies. They're citizenship \n     ceremonies. A group of people gathered before me in a federal \n     courtroom. They'd come from every part of the world. They'd \n     gone through the required procedures. Now in the final act, I \n     administered to them the oath of allegiance to the United \n     States. And then I made them Americans.\n       It was always emotional for me because my mother was an \n     immigrant, my father the orphan son of immigrants. They had \n     no education and they lived hard lives. But because of their \n     efforts, and more importantly, because of the openness of \n     American society, I, their son, am today the Majority Leader \n     of the United States Senate.\n       After every ceremony I spoke personally with each of the \n     new Americans. I asked where they came from, how they came, \n     why they came. Their stories were as different as their \n     countries of origin, but all were infused with a tangible and \n     inspiring love for this, the country of their choice. The \n     answers of the new Americans to my question of why they came \n     were different. But a common theme ran through them. It was \n     best expressed by a young Asian man who replied, in slow, \n     broken English: ``I came because here in America everyone has \n     a chance.'' A young man who'd been an American for five \n     minutes summed up the meaning of America in a single \n     sentence. Here, everyone has a chance.\n       But in the twenty-first century, and the third century of \n     American history, everyone will not have a chance to succeed \n     unless they first have a chance to learn. The competition \n     will be fierce and unforgiving. Those who lack knowledge and \n     skill will not succeed. I consider myself to be especially \n     fortunate. I had a chance. I got an education.\n       My mother spent her entire working life on the night shift \n     in textile mills. She was a woman of strength and substance, \n     the most influential person in my life. My father was a \n     laborer and a janitor. Like many in their generation, they \n     devoted their lives to providing for their children the \n     education they never had. They had a profound, perhaps even \n     exaggerated sense of the value of formal education. Although \n     they died without property of prominence, my parents had rich \n     and fulfilling lives by their standards--and mine.\n       I experienced early in life the value of learning. In my \n     junior year at high school, I met an English teacher named \n     Elvira Whitten. I was fifteen years ago, naive, totally \n     lacking in self awareness or self-confidence. I had never \n     read a book, other than what was required to move from one \n     grade in school to the next. She was elderly, intelligent and \n     kind.\n       One day she asked me to come back to class after school. I \n     did, not knowing what to expect. She talked for a few \n     minutes, then she asked me what and how much I read. I told \n     her. She picked a book up off her desk and handed it to me, \n     and said she thought I would find it interesting.\n       She made it clear I didn't have to read it, but she asked \n     if I would, for her, and, if I did, to come back and tell her \n     what I thought of it. I agreed to read the book because I \n     respected her and knew that it would please her. That night, \n     I got into bed, opened the book and began reading.\n       It was ``The Moon is Down,'' a short novel by John \n     Steinbeck about a wartime military occupation--presumably the \n     Nazi occupation of Norway. I stayed up most of the night \n     reading it, and could hardly wait to tell Mrs. Whitten about \n     it. She smiled, handed me another book and said, ``I thought \n     you'd like it. Here's another one you might like.''\n       It went that way for a few months, and then she gently \n     suggested that I start picking out my own books. I did so, \n     and felt the first stirring of self-worth. It was my exposure \n     to the world of books, to the excitement of knowledge, and it \n     was my first step to adulthood.\n       I've often wondered what would have become of me if I had \n     not met Mrs. Whitten, or if she had not taken an interest in \n     me. I will always regret that before her death I never went \n     back to tell her what a difference she made in my life. This \n     is my way of doing so, and through her, all of the other \n     teachers who hold the wondrous power to open young minds and \n     inspire young lives.\n       Earlier this year, when I announced that I would not seek \n     reelection, I received hundreds of requests from groups who \n     wanted to honor me in some way. I asked that all such offers \n     be concentrated into this one effort. The money raised \n     tonight will be combined with the remainder of my campaign \n     fund to set up a scholarship foundation to help needy and \n     deserving students get a college education.\n       Nothing is more important to success in American life than \n     a good education. I believe that, because of my own \n     experience and because of what I expect to be the rising \n     demands of the next century.\n       I once needed help and got it. Now, fate has provided me \n     the opportunity to help others. I'm grateful for that \n     opportunity. And I'm grateful to you for helping to make it \n     possible. I've been proud to serve the people of Maine in the \n     United States Senate. It's a great honor, the greatest of my \n     life. But when the 104th Congress convenes in January, I will \n     not be there to take the oath of office as a United States \n     Senator.\n       My decision not to seek reelection was based solely on my \n     personal concept of public service. I will miss the Senate. I \n     will miss my colleagues. Most of all, I will miss public \n     service.\n       I've been in the private sector and then in the public \n     sector, and I'm now returning to the private sector.

For me, \n     that's the purpose of public service, its inspiration and \n     finally, its reward.\n       Thank you for your support, your trust, and your \n     friendship.\n\n\tMr. Riegle.

Jim's wife, Mary, has been with him for 32 years and she and their two children, Gray and Elizabeth, deserve great credit in putting up with the often harsh demands of public life.\n\tSenator David Boren is another colleague who is leaving the Senate, in fact he has just resigned his seat so that a new Oklahoma Senator could be sworn in. David announced many months ago that he had been asked to become the next president of the University of Oklahoma. With his exceptional talent, the University and its students will be very fortunate indeed.\n\tDavid Boren began his public service career in the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1966.

Mr. President, 18 years ago, and again 12, and again 6 \nyears ago, the people of Wyoming sent me to Washington to reaffirm \ntheir vision of America--to protect the America they know and love \nagainst all enemies foreign and domestic. In each of my campaigns, I \nmade no bones about who those enemies were, and what we should do about \nthem. Today, as I choose to end my years in the Senate, I am delighted \nthat our main foreign enemies have collapsed, happy to have been among \nthe staunchest opponents of communism and the Soviet Union, and \nthrilled to have played a major part in leaving our country a splendid \nnew weapon against new enemies who might arise. But I regret that the \ndomestic enemies against whom I campaigned--big government and the \nculture of statism--are a greater threat than ever to the American way \nof life. The only encouraging sign on this front is that illusions \nabout the benevolence of government have well-nigh vanished among \nordinary Americans. Perhaps politicians will get the message.\n  Far be it from me to claim credit on behalf of conservatives for the \nfall of communism. I thank God alone for the fact that the bloody \nhammer and sickle was hauled down the Kremlin's flagpole on Christmas \nDay 1991. And I recognize that the Communist system, corrupt in every \nway, would still be aiming missiles at us except for the total, comical \nincompetence of Mikhail Gorbachev. It is both presumptuous and futile \nto speculate what effect, if any, foreigners had on the minds of the \nSoviet officials who made decisions that inadvertently destroyed the \nSoviet Union. Their intramural discussions at the time contained \nnothing either about the hardness or the softness of American policy. \nNor for that matter are they about economics. The evidence points to \nGorbachev, his friends, and his antagonists being motivated by the \npettiest politics. Moreover, living in the house that Stalin built, \nthey had lost the will to rule by mass murder, as Stalin had.\n  But we can be precisely certain of what Americans were trying to do \nwith regard to the Soviet Union. There can be no doubt about some of \nus. I told anyone who would listen, every chance I got, that the Soviet \nUnion and its empire were our mortal enemy, that we ought to do \neverything in our power to throw it on the scrap heap of history, and \nthat we ought to prepare to fight, survive, and win a war against it. \nPresident Reagan felt this passion but there is little doubt how \nridiculed this point of view was in high places. Just look up the \ncountless declarations of the Secretaries of State about how brilliant \nGorbachev was, and how dedicated we should be to a United States-Soviet \npartnership. Or look up theirs and the prestige press' disdain for the \nview that communism was something to be destroyed, not compromised \nwith. These same sophisticates opposed providing the key weapons to the \nAfghans who defeated the Soviet invasion of their country. As chairman \nof the Budget Subcommittee of the Intelligence Committee, I doubled the \nbudget for our Afghan operations every time it came before me, and put \nin provisions for Stinger missiles. I also fought these same officials \nto put weapons into the hands of the Nicaraguan Contras who defeated a \nSoviet-Cuban takeover of their country that could have put Mexico onto \na path far worse than the excellent one that it is now treading. When \nthese officials, never mind liberal Senators, put their faith in arms \ncontrol and in the Soviet Union's observance of treaties, I preferred \nto trust in American defensive weapons. The Soviet Foreign Minister \nacknowledged that the American officials and Senators felt no \ninclination to apologize to those whom they had maligned for being \nright. But that was not surprising. A press that had joined them in \nmaligning us was not about to insist upon contrition.\n  Most of all I am proud of the role I played between 1978 and 1983 in \nstarting many of the Defense Department programs that would later be \nlabeled SDI. Let me emphasize the difference: The programs I helped to \nstart did not aim at research. Nor did they aim at abstract, grand \nschemes: They aimed to produce actual, individual weapons and sensors \nto kill missiles that could kill Americans. Then President Reagan put \nthe SDI Program into the hands of people who, sad to say, wanted to use \nit for every imaginable purpose--except to build real weapons. And so, \nin the name of SDI, hucksters spent billions of dollars for never-never \nprojects, while arms controllers handicapped real weapons programs \ndiluting, delaying, and usually dooming them.\n  But, I am happy to say, one anti-missile program managed to survive \nSDI better than might have been expected. This is the chemical-power \nspace based laser, the very weapon that first raised interest in \nserious missile defense 15 years ago. No program was so maligned as \nthis. Everybody from Edward Teller to Sidney Drell said this laser \nweapon couldn't be built, and--paradoxically--said it would be \ndangerous to try to build it. None was so politically incorrect. But in \na nutshell, by adhering to the guidelines I laid out for it 15 years \nago, this program has produced all the pieces of a weapon that could \ndestroy any missile ever built or designed within 2 seconds, at \ndistances greater than 3,000 miles. If this country and this Congress \nwant protection against the missiles that Saddam Husseim, Kim Jong-Il, \nor anybody else might send against us or our allies, they have only to \nsay so, and this defensive weapon can be put together. It is there. \nNow.\n\n  Sure, the arms controllers in the U.S. Government made certain that \nno program would produce any component of a weapon. But the good guys \ncan play with definitions as well as the bad guys--and sometimes the \ngood guys win. The Space-Based Laser Program was broken up into any \nnumber of pieces. But the people running the pieces remembered: Don't \nbuild laboratory devices. Build only things that can be mass-produced. \nIf you must scale down a piece of equipment, do it by using a fraction \nof other parts you would use in the real McCoy. Thus the laser you can \nsee at the TRW facility at San Juan Capistrano, CA develops about 2 \nmegawatts of power. But it has only one-third of the pieces that an 8-\nmegawatt missile killing device would have. And what is there is laid \nout in a frame designed from the outset to accept the remainder of \nother pieces. So it is with the rest of the weapon.\n  The credit goes to the marvelous American engineers who did it. I \nhope that the incoming Congress takes the opportunity to spend some of \nthe money that the American people mistakenly believe is spent on our \nmutual protection to buy this device, which could save millions of \nAmerican lives. If this happens, I will be glad I had something to do \nwith making it possible.\n  But why continue to worry about foreign enemies now that communism is \ngone? In short, because as Charles de Gaulle used to say, ``The future \nlasts a long time.'' During the past half century we have been involved \nin only two major wars, and the parts of the world that are most \nimportant to us have been relatively peaceful because the United States \nof America has been militarily strong. But in recent years, under \nPresidents of both parties, we have been living under the assumption \nthat history has ended. Nothing could be further from the truth. No \nassumption could be more dangerous. American military power--and \nnothing but American military power--has kept a Pax Americana over \nEurope and the Northern Pacific Rim. Now that American power is \nwithdrawing, we see NATO humiliated on its doorstep, and Japan and \nSouth Korea cowering before North Korea's budding nuclear arsenal. We \nrisk losing the world that our grandfathers won for us in World War II, \nand we risk the birth of a world disorder that may require a lot more \nfrom our children than the post-war world has required of us.\n  Our country needs better defense policy. Reversing the shrinkage and \nde-nuclearization of our Armed Forces, as well as providing a serious \nanti-missile defense, would be good places to begin. More important, we \nneed a more serious national discussion of foreign and defense policy. \nI am leaving the Senate, but will take part in that discussion.\n  The people of Wyoming first sent me to Washington in 1976 in part \nbecause I articulated their frustration with Federal occupational \nsafety and health regulations. Who could be against health and safety \non the job? Who could be against clean air and water? Certainly not the \ngood people of Wyoming. Certainly not me. Our beef--if you will pardon \nthe expression--is with a government that uses these and other lofty \npurposes as a means of exercising arbitrary bureaucratic power. \nGovernment at all levels taxes, spends, and regulates roughly twice as \nmuch as when I grew up. It touches every aspect of our lives, and harms \njust about everything it touches. It will fine you for not wearing a \nseatbelt, but will not protect your life from criminals. It will \ndeliver contraceptives to your children, but cannot deliver the mail. \nIt prohibits a Jewish community in New York from having a school \ndistrict--who knows what politically incorrect things their kids might \nlearn from reading the bible--and it forces the culture of abortion on \nthe whole country. In the name of racial equality, the Government \nforces us to discriminate on the basis of race. Once upon a time, our \nGovernment was a bulwark against domestic enemies. Now big Government \nhas become our chief domestic enemy.\n  In 1980 the American people voted for the Republic Party, hoping that \nthe Republicans would shrink the Government and make it switch sides in \nthe great cultural conflict that is raging among us. But the \nRepublicans put on their tuxes and spent their time trying to make the \nsystem work. And so taxes rose, regulations multiplied, officials \nbecame more arrogant, courts took over more of other people's powers, \nand society continued to become less recognizably American. In 1992 the \nAmerican people threw out a Republican President who, obviously was on \nthe side of the Government rather than of the people. Now the \nelectorate has put its hopes in a Republican Congress, but the American \npeople have made clear that they do not trust Republicans very far. \nAlmost three out of five Americans say they would like to see a new \npolitical party--and most of those who say so usually vote Republican. \nTo me, this means that the Republican Party has one more chance to be \non the side of the America's people and against their Government. If it \nmuffs this chance, it will be abandoned--deservedly so. The electorate \nasked republican politicians to do something very unnatural to any \npolitician--yield back power. Restore the people's dominion over turf \nyou have now occupied from democratic plantation managers.\n\n  What should the Republican Party do? Nothing less than to pursue a \nvision of America radically opposed to that of contemporary \nsophisticates--the America our Founding Fathers established, our \nfathers fought for, and the America we grew up in. Our Founders--\nWashington, Jefferson, Lincoln--set this country on the path to \ngreatness by making sure that our Government would be small and frugal, \nthat it would be on the side of the virtues necessary to preserve the \nsystem. Lincoln, for example, argued that accepting slavery as an \nalternative source of labor would undermine respect for all labor, and \nthat it would foster the habit of living off one another. Lincoln \ntaught that fear of God, respect for human life, freedom and property, \nwould allow generations of Americans who had no blood ties to the \nFounders to become ``flesh of the flesh and blood of the blood'' with \nthem. The Government established by the Founders did not make us moral. \nBut it took pains to be on the right side of the great moral questions.\n  This country was peaceful and secure not because the streets were \npatrolled by Government agents, but because citizens enforced high \nstandards of civil behavior, because citizens were armed and protected \ntheir own property, and because local police were highly responsive to \nthe demands of local citizens. The police knew the difference between \nthe decent citizens whom they served, and the deviants against whom \nthey worked.\n  This country was wealthy not because of its natural resources--the \nIndians had lived in violent semi-starvation--or because Government \ngave us this or that, nor because Government forced wages up nor \nbecause it granted privileges to favorite companies. Americans created \nmore wealth than the world had ever known because Government in America \ntaxed less, regulated less, and gave fewer privileges than any other \ngovernment in history.\n  This country became a world power not because there are so many of \nus--the Chinese are six times as numerous--or because we are so rich--\nthe European Union has a bigger economy--or because we have so many \nweapons--Russia has more. Our numbers, our wealth, and our weapons \nbecame military power because the American people are more patriotic, \nand more apt to think that we have a duty to do what is right and \nreasonable than any other people in the world. And we became powerful \nbecause until recently our leaders honored the American people's \nreligion and manliness, and because they themselves served in the Armed \nForces.\n  With each passing year, however, our America resembles less and less \nwhat the Founders left us and looks more and more like the countries \nour immigrant forefathers tried to get away from. This is happening in \nlarge part because the people who are running this country want it to \nhappen and have used the enormous powers of the U.S. Government to make \nit happen.\n  But Why? It is all too plain that the people who are running this \ncountry deeply dislike the America of the Founders. If the people who \nrun our Government, our universities, our media, the entertainment \nindustry, the arts, and the so forth had their way, you and I would be \nplaced in re-education camps--financed by us, of course--to learn new \nways.\n  What do the elites of this country have against us? They think our \npatriotism is unsophisticated at best, and chauvinistic at worst. They \nthought our opposition to communism was dangerous and anti-progressive. \nThe current generation of American leaders thought that we were on the \nwrong side in the Vietnam war. Two-thirds of our Congressmen have never \nserved in the Armed Fores. Military service is the rare exception in \nthe families of those who have the most to say about putting Americans \nin harm's way. Many in power say that America is nothing special, and \nthat our troops ought to do the bidding of the United Nations. \nMoreover, our patriotism exalts qualities that they abhor: manliness, \nrighteousness, the capacity to use force.\n  Often as not American political elites dislike the American people's \nprosperity. It is the stated policy of the U.S. Government that the \nAmerican people consume too much of the world's energy and natural \nresources, that our appetite for automobiles, for meat and comfortable \nhouses, is a drag on the planet and contributes to poverty in the Third \nWorld. So, those who run this country want to tax us to support the \nUnited Nations, and they want us to make cars and industry more \nexpensive. They think that America suffers from public poverty amidst \nprivate luxury, so they want to tax more and to regulate more, to shift \npower and wealth to people like themselves. Whether the excuse is \nenvironmentalism, or poverty, or crime, the recipe is always the same: \nTake money away from independent working Americans and give it to the \nfavorites of the governing class. It transfers only power--not \nsolutions, only dependency, not liberty.\n  Of course, this is a recipe for economic decline. I would remind the \nSenate that nowhere in the writings of the Founding Fathers is there \nanything about managing the economy. Our Founders wanted to promote \nprosperity. So they set about ensuring that Government would be small, \nfrugal, impartial, and moral. We became a wealth country because \nGovernment, in Jefferson's words, would not ``take from the mouth of \nlabor the bread it had earned.'' If we abandon the Founders' mores, no \neconomic policy can keep us out of the poorhouse.\n  Our leaders dislike our tradition of self-government. They equate \nlocal control of crime with brutality and racism. Local zoning is \nracism. Local control of schools is racist. We are all racists--except \nthey. The have turned laws that prohibit racial discrimination into \nmandates for racial preferences in everything from school admissions to \ncongressional districting, to hiring and firing and promotions, and \ncontracting, and insurance, and lending. A whole industry has grown up \nto administer this American form of apartheid. If you want your town or \nbusiness to stay out of trouble nowadays, you need highly paid and \nwell-connected human relations specialists. Within the U.S. Government, \nin schools and businesses, there are mandatory counseling sessions--not \nunlike under communism.\n  Of course this sows racial hatred amongst us. It emboldens young \nblacks to demand menacingly, and creates new classes of victims among \nyoung whites, Hispanics, Asians and politically unconnected people in \ngeneral. But in the end, this has nothing to do with race, and \neverything to do with leftist politics. The people who run these \nprograms are white men, who are not about to give up their own \nprivileges to anybody. In the name of racial justice, and at the price \nof racial harmony, they are increasing their own power to privilege \ntheir friends at the expense of everyone else, and to diminish \ncompetition for themselves.\n  The people who run this country don't care about public safety, \nhaving made it very difficult for States and localities to police \nthemselves, having left ordinary citizens with no choice but to protect \nthemselves as best they can. They are now trying to take our guns away. \nIn fact they blame us and our guns for crime. This is so wrong that it \ncannot be an honest mistake. The don't want safety for us. The want to \nstrike at our culture.\n  The people who run this country don't care that our children are \nbeing diseducated or that schools are becoming factories of ignorance \nand decay. Every proposal regarding education that has come out of the \nestablishment has called for more money. Over the past 30 years we have \ntripled the amount of money that we pay to the public schools per \npupil, in real terms. And guess what? Not only has educational \nperformance dropped everywhere, but it dropped worst where we spent \nmost. The places where kids are not being hurt too badly, where test \nscores are highest, are out in the sticks--in places like Utah, Iowa, \nand Wyoming, where the establishment has not yet been able fully to \nimplement its model of big, bureaucratically controlled districts that \ngive out condoms, banish prayer, teach self-esteem, and bash all \nAmerican history prior to the 1960's, maybe we hicks aren't so stupid \nafter all. But the establishment continues to want money, tries to grab \nmore control, and keeps looking down on us.\n  Above all, the people who run this country have deep contempt and \nenmity for the culture on which it rests. What must be the moral \npriorities of those who run the Democratic National Committee, who \ndeclared that the Christian pro-family movement is the most serious \nthreat to America today? What vision of America must be in their minds \nthat they are frightened by the prospect of more moms, dads, and \nchildren going to church? Clearly their's is a vision very different \nfrom George Washington's and Abe Lincoln's. And are Republican leaders \nso different? The tell us we are zealots if we talk about social issues \nand about the role of religion in public life. I say, what else is \nworth talking about? They say: concentrate on the economy. But \nprosperity comes from the morality and sense of responsibility of the \npopulation, as well as from small government. It comes from the \nculture, not from recipes dreamed up in Government offices or think \ntanks.\n  So how do we safeguard, how do we promote the culture that made us \nprosperous? Do we do it by celebrating people who terminate their \nresponsibility to the child they have conceived by killing him or her \nand at the same time use Medicaid to provide fertility medicines? Do we \nsay, as Stephen Douglas said about slavery, that we ``don't care'' one \nway or the other? I think Lincoln would warn us against expecting that \nany sort of prosperity, never mind decency, could be built on such \nviews of responsibility and human life. Again, can education turn out \ncompetent workers, never mind decent citizens, if it continues to \nstress condoms over continence and relativism over religion? And again, \nare we going to be healthy economically--never mind in other ways--if \nour establishment keeps on talking and spending as if alternative \nfamilies and alternative lifestyles were on the same moral plane as \nmom, dad and the kids? Not a chance.\n\n  The sum of all this is that our Government is run by people who are \nusing the powers vested in them by the Constitution, and the powers \nthat come from spending $1.5 trillion per year of our money to undo \nwhat remains of the culture, the habits, the freedoms that made this \ncountry unique. There is a struggle about what kind of country we will \nbe. Government and its allies in the media, education, and big business \nare on the wrong side.\n  It is all too easy to list the ways in which the U.S. Government is \nproviding incentives to break up families, to put generations and races \nat war with one another, to devalue honest work, to dumb-down and \ncoarsen children, for bureaucrats to seek their own interest, for \nbusinesses to court regulators, to seek protection, and the public be \ndamned. It is also easy enough, as well as satisfying, to discuss \nremedies for all these phenomena.\n  We can and should end welfare--not ``as we know it.'' Just end it, \nperiod. Charity for those who deserve it is something with a long and \nhonorable history. But the short history of welfare tells us that as a \nFederal program it does no good, only harm.\n  We can and should eliminate Social Security. Just as certainly people \nwho are already retired or about to retire should get every penny \nalready promised. But just imagine if every penny deducted from us \nhenceforth went into individual retirement accounts. We could all look \nforward to a lot more money, and the Government would have a lot less \nto spend from day to day.\n  For the monsters of Medicare and Medicaid we can and should \nsubstitute individual medical savings accounts, backed up by vouchers.\n  We can be rid of the ponderous educational establishment by giving \nparents vouchers for whatever amount any level of government taxes them \nto educate their children.\n  We can be rid of the most noxious parts of the university world by \ncutting all direct aid to higher education and substituting tuition \nscholarships to individual students which they must repay. Where this \nscheme has been tried, students deserted rotten professors in droves.\n  We can stop our tax system's pressure against families by increasing \ndeductions for children. Perhaps those moms who want to will be able to \nraise their own children again.\n  We can be rid of the terrible bureaucracy of the IRS, and of all the \ndistortive inequities of the system just by instituting a flat tax.\n  We can restore self-government by reducing the power of the Federal \ncourts to review the acts of State courts and the enactments of State \nlegislatures.\n  The objective of these and many other provisions would be to shrink \nGovernment and to stop it from doing further harm.\n  The good news is that all these things are double. Sure, the American \npeople are sick enough of big government and have learned to distrust \nthe establishment so much that a reform program of this kind stands a \nchance. The bad news is that no set of legislation or even \nconstitutional amendments is going to sweep away the entrenched \ninterests and bad habits built up over a generation. Our moral fiber \nhas been damaged. We are no longer quite the virtuous people for whom \nthe Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, the people who fought at \nGettysburg and at Omaha Beach. That is why to set us back on the \nFounders' path we need moral leadership. By this I mean that we must \nunderstand every change we make above all as a means of restoring the \ncharacter that made Americans unique.\n  We want to cut taxes not primarily because doing so will put more \nmoney in our pockets, but principally because it will put the means of \nfreedom in our hands. We want to cut the Government's power to grant \nprivilege not primarily because privilege is economically inefficient, \nbut because we don't want to be a nation of favor-seekers. We want to \nkeep and bear our guns not because we want to shoot somebody, but \nbecause we have an irreducible right to take care of ourselves. Moral \nleadership, today as in 1789, does not mean that the President of the \nUnited States forces anyone to go to church or synagogue. But it does \nmean that by word and deed he leads the country in giving unto God the \nthings that are God's. Today according to the current Supreme Court, \nAbraham Lincoln's proclamation of Thanksgiving Day would be \nunconstitutional. I say that Lincoln knew better, and that recent \nSupreme Court decisions on religion are unconstitutional.\n\n  It is impossible to lay out all the instances in which political \nleaders can exercise moral leadership precisely because every act of \nGovernment influences our habits in some way. Let us not forget that \nthe Greek philosophers taught that we are the sum of our habits, and \nthat the Greek word for habits is ``Ethics.'' If we want to live like \nAmericans, we had better shun the ethics of the people who are tearing \ndown this country, and strive for the ethics of those who built it.\n  Let me conclude by noting that I have not mentioned the name \n``Clinton,'' and that I mentioned both the Republican and Democratic \nParties as part of the problem. America faces a choice between two \nradically opposed views of itself and of the good life. On one side is \nthe view you and I grew up with, the view of the Founders, the way of \nlife of most families in this country. On the other is the view you can \nread in the pages of Time magazine, the New York Times, and the \nPrestige Press. This is the view that animates the U.S. Government. The \ngreat question of our time is whether Government will continue to work \nagainst the original American way of life, or will switch and support \nit as it once did. The only possible way of enabling Government to make \nthis switch, I think, is to cut it down to a small fraction of its \ncurrent size. Now, this is an issue that transcends parties. It is an \nissue that, most likely, will cause a realignment of Parties, or even \nthe death of one or both of our current parties and the birth of a new \none. The more secular we have become the more we pray to Government for \nthat which we once prayed to God. Nothing happens anymore. Everything \nis caused and is therefore to someone's credit or blame. This is \nnonsense and is unsustainable policy. Decency yields no more credit \nthan indecency. How can we sustain families on this notion?\n  All of that is not so important. The only important thing is that the \nAmerican people and the American way of life be defended against their \nenemies, and that they be defended worthily.\n  In all my public life, nothing has cheered and sustained me as much \nas the constantly recurring evidence of the good sense and virtue of \nthe American people. And nothing has angered and dispirited me more \nthan politicians' and other so called elites' disdain for the average \nAmerican.\n  I recall that during the first half of the Vietnam war, the wise men \nof foreign policy, from McGeorge Bundy to George Ball, were belittling \nthe American people's demand, echoed by Barry Goldwater, that we win \nthe war or get out. No, they said. This insistence on victory is \nsimplistic, unsophisticated, outdated, and lacking in maturity. In our \nmodern age, victory is impossible but involvement is inevitable. \nKnowledgeable professionals, namely themselves, were going to adjust \nthe conflict to a mutually acceptable solution, if only the children of \nlesser Americans--not their own--would continue to get themselves shot. \nThen in the second half of the war, as well as after the war, these \nsame people told us that our militarism had pushed us in, that we had \ngotten the lesson we deserved, but that now we, the American people, \nhad become incapable of supporting a meaningful foreign policy, namely \none led by them. This was Henry Kissinger's constant theme in the \n1970's. Remember the tones of Spenglerian gloom with which he justified \nrenouncing the United States' right to protect itself against ballistic \nmissiles? The weakness of the American people made him do it. By the \nsame token, during the 1980s, from Strobe Talbott in Time magazine as \nwell as from Harvard and Stanford, we heard how dangerously stupid the \nAmerican people were to harken to Ronald Reagan's call to defend this \ncountry and to relegate the Soviet Union to the dustbin of history. The \nelites knew better--or thought they did. Now the same people decry as \nneo-isolationism the elites' call to send the children of average \nAmericans--surely not their own--to so-called peace-keeping and nation-\nbuilding missions. Meanwhile they strip this country's military while \ntheir bungling diplomacy stores up future troubles. And they wonder why \nthe American people think foreign policy is a mess?\n  Well, the American people lack neither wisdom nor the capacity for \ngenerous sacrifice. The same year the people of Wyoming sent me to \nWashington, the country also elected Jimmy Carter. Carter had \ncampaigned for ``A government as good as its people.'' He had seemed to \nreject the establishment's prescriptions for America's managed decline, \nmost eloquently expressed by Henry Kissinger. Sadly, he brought in a \nwing of the establishment that was even further out of sympathy with \nAmerica. Almost the same can be said of the American people's choice of \nBill Clinton my point is this: the American people always vote for the \nPresidential candidate who seems to embody the old American virtues, \nthe traditional, common sense view of America in the world. More often \nthan not, alas, politicians have not been worthy of the people's trust. \nThey have drawn on the well of the American people's generous \npatriotism, but have done nothing to refill it. Thank God that well is \ndeep.\n\n  Today it is fashionable among Republican as well as Democratic elites \nto ascribe the ills of big government to the American people's \nsupposedly insatiable appetite for government checks and privileges, \ncombined with their miserly unwillingness to pay for them. According to \nwhat one can hear from practically every talking head in the mainstream \nmedia, pork and corruption are demand-side problems. The politicians \nand their bureaucratic allies are innocent, just following orders.\n  This is nonsense. The social programs that have done so much harm to \nthis country have been sold to the American people with false \npretenses. Sometimes the very names of the programs are Orwellian \nreversals of reality--none more so than ``aid to families with \ndependent children.'' Who would have voted for Social Security if it \nhad been presented as what it is, a chain letter, a ponzi scheme, that \nspends the workers money the moment it comes in, and that cannot return \nit unless each generation is taxed more heavily than the previous one? \nWho would have voted for Medicare if it had been made clear that this \nwould bureaucratize and render much more expensive all health care in \nAmerica? And who the heck voted for the Supreme Court decisions that \nended America's tradition of local self-government, and made \npornography, abortion, and vagrancy into basic rights while pushing \nreligion out of public life? Who ever voted to institute a system of \nracial classification in this country? Certainly not the American \npeople. All of these things are anathema to the average American.\n  But now comes the crucial questions: How long can any people, no \nmatter how virtuous, remain uncorrupted when governed by laws and \nelites that tend to corrupt? This week's New York Times carries an \naccount of widespread tax evasion in Germany. In Germany? That most \norder-loving of countries? Buy why? Simply because it seems that tax \nburden has grown so great that the people think it unreasonable. There \nis no doubt that our own laws and administration, fiscal and otherwise, \nhave become so burdensome and unreasonable that our own tradition of \nlaw-abiding is fading.\n  There is no doubt that entitlements and privileges corrupt those who \ngive and those who receive them, whether they are rich or poor. This \nlist of threats to the American people's virtue is long. No one can say \nhow long the character and habits bequeathed to us by the Founding \nFathers will last and whether they will vanquish the threats or be \novercome by them.\n  The size our continent, its fabulous wealth, its indescribable \nbeauty, the ships, tanks, and airplanes in our arsenal, are no treasure \ncompared to the moral character of the American people. I pray to God \nthat he will graciously help us preserve and improve it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                             FINAL ADDRESS\n\n\tMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, 18 years ago, and again 12, and again 6 years ago, the people of Wyoming sent me to Washington to reaffirm their vision of America--to protect the America they know and love against all enemies foreign and domestic. In each of my campaigns, I made no bones about who those enemies were, and what we should do about them. Today, as I choose to end my years in the Senate, I am delighted that our main foreign enemies have collapsed, happy to have been among the staunchest opponents of communism and the Soviet Union, and thrilled to have played a major part in leaving our country a splendid new weapon against new enemies who might arise. But I regret that the domestic enemies against whom I campaigned--big government and the culture of statism--are a greater threat than ever to the American way of life. The only encouraging sign on this front is that illusions about the benevolence of government have well-nigh vanished among ordinary Americans. Perhaps politicians will get the message.\n\tFar be it from me to claim credit on behalf of conservatives for the fall of communism. I thank God alone for the fact that the bloody hammer and sickle was hauled down the Kremlin's flagpole on Christmas Day 1991. And I recognize that the Communist system, corrupt in every way, would still be aiming missiles at us except for the total, comical incompetence of Mikhail Gorbachev. It is both presumptuous and futile to speculate what effect, if any, foreigners had on the minds of the Soviet officials who made decisions that inadvertently destroyed the Soviet Union. Their intramural discussions at the time contained nothing either about the hardness or the softness of American policy. Nor for that matter are they about economics. The evidence points to Gorbachev, his friends, and his antagonists being motivated by the pettiest politics. Moreover, living in the house that Stalin built, they had lost the will to rule by mass murder, as Stalin had.\n\tBut we can be precisely certain of what Americans were trying to do with regard to the Soviet Union. There can be no doubt about some of us. I told anyone who would listen, every chance I got, that the Soviet Union and its empire were our mortal enemy, that we ought to do everything in our power to throw it on the scrap heap of history, and that we ought to prepare to fight, survive, and win a war against it. President Reagan felt this passion but there is little doubt how ridiculed this point of view was in high places. Just look up the countless declarations of the Secretaries of State about how brilliant Gorbachev was, and how dedicated we should be to a United States-Soviet partnership. Or look up theirs and the prestige press' disdain for the view that communism was something to be destroyed, not compromised with. These same sophisticates opposed providing the key weapons to the Afghans who defeated the Soviet invasion of their country. As chairman of the Budget Subcommittee of the Intelligence Committee, I doubled the budget for our Afghan operations every time it came before me, and put in provisions for Stinger missiles. I also fought these same officials to put weapons into the hands of the Nicaraguan Contras who defeated a Soviet-Cuban takeover of their country that could have put Mexico onto a path far worse than the excellent one that it is now treading. When these officials, never mind liberal Senators, put their faith in arms control and in the Soviet Union's observance of treaties, I preferred to trust in American defensive weapons. The Soviet Foreign Minister acknowledged that the American officials and Senators felt no inclination to apologize to those whom they had maligned for being right. But that was not surprising. A press that had joined them in maligning us was not about to insist upon contrition.\n\tMost of all I am proud of the role I played between 1978 and 1983 in starting many of the Defense Department programs that would later be labeled SDI. Let me emphasize the difference: The programs I helped to start did not aim at research. Nor did they aim at abstract, grand schemes: They aimed to produce actual, individual weapons and sensors to kill missiles that could kill Americans. Then President Reagan put the SDI Program into the hands of people who, sad to say, wanted to use it for every imaginable purpose--except to build real weapons. And so, in the name of SDI, hucksters spent billions of dollars for never-never projects, while arms controllers handicapped real weapons programs diluting, delaying, and usually dooming them.\n\tBut, I am happy to say, one anti-missile program managed to survive SDI better than might have been expected. This is the chemical-power space based laser, the very weapon that first raised interest in serious missile defense 15 years ago. No program was so maligned as this. Everybody from Edward Teller to Sidney Drell said this laser weapon couldn't be built, and--paradoxically--said it would be dangerous to try to build it. None was so politically incorrect. But in a nutshell, by adhering to the guidelines I laid out for it 15 years ago, this program has produced all the pieces of a weapon that could destroy any missile ever built or designed within 2 seconds, at distances greater than 3,000 miles. If this country and this Congress want protection against the missiles that Saddam Husseim, Kim Jong-Il, or anybody else might send against us or our allies, they have only to say so, and this defensive weapon can be put together. It is there. Now.\n\n\tSure, the arms controllers in the U.S. Government made certain that no program would produce any component of a weapon. But the good guys can play with definitions as well as the bad guys--and sometimes the good guys win. The Space-Based Laser Program was broken up into any number of pieces. But the people running the pieces remembered: Don't build laboratory devices. Build only things that can be mass-produced. If you must scale down a piece of equipment, do it by using a fraction of other parts you would use in the real McCoy. Thus the laser you can see at the TRW facility at San Juan Capistrano, CA develops about 2 megawatts of power. But it has only one-third of the pieces that an 8-megawatt missile killing device would have. And what is there is laid out in a frame designed from the outset to accept the remainder of other pieces. So it is with the rest of the weapon.\n\tThe credit goes to the marvelous American engineers who did it. I hope that the incoming Congress takes the opportunity to spend some of the money that the American people mistakenly believe is spent on our mutual protection to buy this device, which could save millions of American lives. If this happens, I will be glad I had something to do with making it possible.\n\tBut why continue to worry about foreign enemies now that communism is gone? In short, because as Charles de Gaulle used to say, ``The future lasts a long time.'' During the past half century we have been involved in only two major wars, and the parts of the world that are most important to us have been relatively peaceful because the United States of America has been militarily strong. But in recent years, under Presidents of both parties, we have been living under the assumption that history has ended. Nothing could be further from the truth. No assumption could be more dangerous. American military power--and nothing but American military power--has kept a Pax Americana over Europe and the Northern Pacific Rim. Now that American power is withdrawing, we see NATO humiliated on its doorstep, and Japan and South Korea cowering before North Korea's budding nuclear arsenal. We risk losing the world that our grandfathers won for us in World War II, and we risk the birth of a world disorder that may require a lot more from our children than the post-war world has required of us.\n\tOur country needs better defense policy. Reversing the shrinkage and de-nuclearization of our Armed Forces, as well as providing a serious anti-missile defense, would be good places to begin. More important, we need a more serious national discussion of foreign and defense policy. I am leaving the Senate, but will take part in that discussion.\n\tThe people of Wyoming first sent me to Washington in 1976 in part because I articulated their frustration with Federal occupational safety and health regulations. Who could be against health and safety on the job? Who could be against clean air and water? Certainly not the good people of Wyoming. Certainly not me. Our beef--if you will pardon the expression--is with a government that uses these and other lofty purposes as a means of exercising arbitrary bureaucratic power. Government at all levels taxes, spends, and regulates roughly twice as much as when I grew up. It touches every aspect of our lives, and harms just about everything it touches. It will fine you for not wearing a seatbelt, but will not protect your life from criminals. It will deliver contraceptives to your children, but cannot deliver the mail. It prohibits a Jewish community in New York from having a school district--who knows what politically incorrect things their kids might learn from reading the bible--and it forces the culture of abortion on the whole country. In the name of racial equality, the Government forces us to discriminate on the basis of race. Once upon a time, our Government was a bulwark against domestic enemies. Now big Government has become our chief domestic enemy.\n\tIn 1980 the American people voted for the Republic Party, hoping that the Republicans would shrink the Government and make it switch sides in the great cultural conflict that is raging among us. But the Republicans put on their tuxes and spent their time trying to make the system work. And so taxes rose, regulations multiplied, officials became more arrogant, courts took over more of other people's powers, and society continued to become less recognizably American. In 1992 the American people threw out a Republican President who, obviously was on the side of the Government rather than of the people. Now the electorate has put its hopes in a Republican Congress, but the American people have made clear that they do not trust Republicans very far. Almost three out of five Americans say they would like to see a new political party--and most of those who say so usually vote Republican. To me, this means that the Republican Party has one more chance to be on the side of the America's people and against their Government. If it muffs this chance, it will be abandoned--deservedly so. The electorate asked republican politicians to do something very unnatural to any politician--yield back power. Restore the people's dominion over turf you have now occupied from democratic plantation managers.\n\n\tWhat should the Republican Party do? Nothing less than to pursue a vision of America radically opposed to that of contemporary sophisticates--the America our Founding Fathers established, our fathers fought for, and the America we grew up in. Our Founders--Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln--set this country on the path to greatness by making sure that our Government would be small and frugal, that it would be on the side of the virtues necessary to preserve the system. Lincoln, for example, argued that accepting slavery as an alternative source of labor would undermine respect for all labor, and that it would foster the habit of living off one another. Lincoln taught that fear of God, respect for human life, freedom and property, would allow generations of Americans who had no blood ties to the Founders to become ``flesh of the flesh and blood of the blood'' with them. The Government established by the Founders did not make us moral. But it took pains to be on the right side of the great moral questions.\n\tThis country was peaceful and secure not because the streets were patrolled by Government agents, but because citizens enforced high standards of civil behavior, because citizens were armed and protected their own property, and because local police were highly responsive to the demands of local citizens. The police knew the difference between the decent citizens whom they served, and the deviants against whom they worked.\n\tThis country was wealthy not because of its natural resources--the Indians had lived in violent semi-starvation--or because Government gave us this or that, nor because Government forced wages up nor because it granted privileges to favorite companies. Americans created more wealth than the world had ever known because Government in America taxed less, regulated less, and gave fewer privileges than any other government in history.\n\tThis country became a world power not because there are so many of us--the Chinese are six times as numerous--or because we are so rich--the European Union has a bigger economy--or because we have so many weapons--Russia has more. Our numbers, our wealth, and our weapons became military power because the American people are more patriotic, and more apt to think that we have a duty to do what is right and reasonable than any other people in the world. And we became powerful because until recently our leaders honored the American people's religion and manliness, and because they themselves served in the Armed Forces.\n\tWith each passing year, however, our America resembles less and less what the Founders left us and looks more and more like the countries our immigrant forefathers tried to get away from. This is happening in large part because the people who are running this country want it to happen and have used the enormous powers of the U.S. Government to make it happen.\n\tBut Why? It is all too plain that the people who are running this country deeply dislike the America of the Founders. If the people who run our Government, our universities, our media, the entertainment industry, the arts, and the so forth had their way, you and I would be placed in re-education camps--financed by us, of course--to learn new ways.\n\tWhat do the elites of this country have against us? They think our patriotism is unsophisticated at best, and chauvinistic at worst. They thought our opposition to communism was dangerous and anti-progressive. The current generation of American leaders thought that we were on the wrong side in the Vietnam war. Two-thirds of our Congressmen have never served in the Armed Fores. Military service is the rare exception in the families of those who have the most to say about putting Americans in harm's way. Many in power say that America is nothing special, and that our troops ought to do the bidding of the United Nations. Moreover, our patriotism exalts qualities that they abhor: manliness, righteousness, the capacity to use force.\n\tOften as not American political elites dislike the American people's prosperity. It is the stated policy of the U.S. Government that the American people consume too much of the world's energy and natural resources, that our appetite for automobiles, for meat and comfortable houses, is a drag on the planet and contributes to poverty in the Third World. So, those who run this country want to tax us to support the United Nations, and they want us to make cars and industry more expensive. They think that America suffers from public poverty amidst private luxury, so they want to tax more and to regulate more, to shift power and wealth to people like themselves. Whether the excuse is environmentalism, or poverty, or crime, the recipe is always the same: Take money away from independent working Americans and give it to the favorites of the governing class. It transfers only power--not solutions, only dependency, not liberty.\n\tOf course, this is a recipe for economic decline. I would remind the Senate that nowhere in the writings of the Founding Fathers is there anything about managing the economy. Our Founders wanted to promote prosperity. So they set about ensuring that Government would be small, frugal, impartial, and moral. We became a wealth country because Government, in Jefferson's words, would not ``take from the mouth of labor the bread it had earned.'' If we abandon the Founders' mores, no economic policy can keep us out of the poorhouse.\n\tOur leaders dislike our tradition of self-government. They equate local control of crime with brutality and racism. Local zoning is racism. Local control of schools is racist. We are all racists--except they. The have turned laws that prohibit racial discrimination into mandates for racial preferences in everything from school admissions to congressional districting, to hiring and firing and promotions, and contracting, and insurance, and lending. A whole industry has grown up to administer this American form of apartheid. If you want your town or business to stay out of trouble nowadays, you need highly paid and well-connected human relations specialists. Within the U.S. Government, in schools and businesses, there are mandatory counseling sessions--not unlike under communism.\n\tOf course this sows racial hatred amongst us. It emboldens young blacks to demand menacingly, and creates new classes of victims among young whites, Hispanics, Asians and politically unconnected people in general. But in the end, this has nothing to do with race, and everything to do with leftist politics. The people who run these programs are white men, who are not about to give up their own privileges to anybody. In the name of racial justice, and at the price of racial harmony, they are increasing their own power to privilege their friends at the expense of everyone else, and to diminish competition for themselves.\n\tThe people who run this country don't care about public safety, having made it very difficult for States and localities to police themselves, having left ordinary citizens with no choice but to protect themselves as best they can. They are now trying to take our guns away. In fact they blame us and our guns for crime. This is so wrong that it cannot be an honest mistake. The don't want safety for us. The want to strike at our culture.\n\tThe people who run this country don't care that our children are being diseducated or that schools are becoming factories of ignorance and decay. Every proposal regarding education that has come out of the establishment has called for more money. Over the past 30 years we have tripled the amount of money that we pay to the public schools per pupil, in real terms. And guess what? Not only has educational performance dropped everywhere, but it dropped worst where we spent most. The places where kids are not being hurt too badly, where test scores are highest, are out in the sticks--in places like Utah, Iowa, and Wyoming, where the establishment has not yet been able fully to implement its model of big, bureaucratically controlled districts that give out condoms, banish prayer, teach self-esteem, and bash all American history prior to the 1960's, maybe we hicks aren't so stupid after all. But the establishment continues to want money, tries to grab more control, and keeps looking down on us.\n\tAbove all, the people who run this country have deep contempt and enmity for the culture on which it rests. What must be the moral priorities of those who run the Democratic National Committee, who declared that the Christian pro-family movement is the most serious threat to America today? What vision of America must be in their minds that they are frightened by the prospect of more moms, dads, and children going to church? Clearly their's is a vision very different from George Washington's and Abe Lincoln's. And are Republican leaders so different? The tell us we are zealots if we talk about social issues and about the role of religion in public life. I say, what else is worth talking about? They say: concentrate on the economy. But prosperity comes from the morality and sense of responsibility of the population, as well as from small government. It comes from the culture, not from recipes dreamed up in Government offices or think tanks.\n\tSo how do we safeguard, how do we promote the culture that made us prosperous? Do we do it by celebrating people who terminate their responsibility to the child they have conceived by killing him or her and at the same time use Medicaid to provide fertility medicines? Do we say, as Stephen Douglas said about slavery, that we ``don't care'' one way or the other? I think Lincoln would warn us against expecting that any sort of prosperity, never mind decency, could be built on such views of responsibility and human life. Again, can education turn out competent workers, never mind decent citizens, if it continues to stress condoms over continence and relativism over religion? And again, are we going to be healthy economically--never mind in other ways--if our establishment keeps on talking and spending as if alternative families and alternative lifestyles were on the same moral plane as mom, dad and the kids? Not a chance.\n\n\tThe sum of all this is that our Government is run by people who are using the powers vested in them by the Constitution, and the powers that come from spending $1.5 trillion per year of our money to undo what remains of the culture, the habits, the freedoms that made this country unique. There is a struggle about what kind of country we will be. Government and its allies in the media, education, and big business are on the wrong side.\n\tIt is all too easy to list the ways in which the U.S. Government is providing incentives to break up families, to put generations and races at war with one another, to devalue honest work, to dumb-down and coarsen children, for bureaucrats to seek their own interest, for businesses to court regulators, to seek protection, and the public be damned. It is also easy enough, as well as satisfying, to discuss remedies for all these phenomena.\n\tWe can and should end welfare--not ``as we know it.'' Just end it, period. Charity for those who deserve it is something with a long and honorable history. But the short history of welfare tells us that as a Federal program it does no good, only harm.\n\tWe can and should eliminate Social Security. Just as certainly people who are already retired or about to retire should get every penny already promised. But just imagine if every penny deducted from us henceforth went into individual retirement accounts. We could all look forward to a lot more money, and the Government would have a lot less to spend from day to day.\n\tFor the monsters of Medicare and Medicaid we can and should substitute individual medical savings accounts, backed up by vouchers.\n\tWe can be rid of the ponderous educational establishment by giving parents vouchers for whatever amount any level of government taxes them to educate their children.\n\tWe can be rid of the most noxious parts of the university world by cutting all direct aid to higher education and substituting tuition scholarships to individual students which they must repay. Where this scheme has been tried, students deserted rotten professors in droves.\n\tWe can stop our tax system's pressure against families by increasing deductions for children. Perhaps those moms who want to will be able to raise their own children again.\n\tWe can be rid of the terrible bureaucracy of the IRS, and of all the distortive inequities of the system just by instituting a flat tax.\n\tWe can restore self-government by reducing the power of the Federal courts to review the acts of State courts and the enactments of State legislatures.\n\tThe objective of these and many other provisions would be to shrink Government and to stop it from doing further harm.\n\tThe good news is that all these things are double. Sure, the American people are sick enough of big government and have learned to distrust the establishment so much that a reform program of this kind stands a chance. The bad news is that no set of legislation or even constitutional amendments is going to sweep away the entrenched interests and bad habits built up over a generation. Our moral fiber has been damaged. We are no longer quite the virtuous people for whom the Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution, the people who fought at Gettysburg and at Omaha Beach. That is why to set us back on the Founders' path we need moral leadership. By this I mean that we must understand every change we make above all as a means of restoring the character that made Americans unique.\n\tWe want to cut taxes not primarily because doing so will put more money in our pockets, but principally because it will put the means of freedom in our hands. We want to cut the Government's power to grant privilege not primarily because privilege is economically inefficient, but because we don't want to be a nation of favor-seekers. We want to keep and bear our guns not because we want to shoot somebody, but because we have an irreducible right to take care of ourselves. Moral leadership, today as in 1789, does not mean that the President of the United States forces anyone to go to church or synagogue. But it does mean that by word and deed he leads the country in giving unto God the things that are God's. Today according to the current Supreme Court, Abraham Lincoln's proclamation of Thanksgiving Day would be unconstitutional. I say that Lincoln knew better, and that recent Supreme Court decisions on religion are unconstitutional.\n\n\tIt is impossible to lay out all the instances in which political leaders can exercise moral leadership precisely because every act of Government influences our habits in some way. Let us not forget that the Greek philosophers taught that we are the sum of our habits, and that the Greek word for habits is ``Ethics.'' If we want to live like Americans, we had better shun the ethics of the people who are tearing down this country, and strive for the ethics of those who built it.\n\tLet me conclude by noting that I have not mentioned the name ``Clinton,'' and that I mentioned both the Republican and Democratic Parties as part of the problem. America faces a choice between two radically opposed views of itself and of the good life. On one side is the view you and I grew up with, the view of the Founders, the way of life of most families in this country. On the other is the view you can read in the pages of Time magazine, the New York Times, and the Prestige Press. This is the view that animates the U.S. Government. The great question of our time is whether Government will continue to work against the original American way of life, or will switch and support it as it once did. The only possible way of enabling Government to make this switch, I think, is to cut it down to a small fraction of its current size. Now, this is an issue that transcends parties. It is an issue that, most likely, will cause a realignment of Parties, or even the death of one or both of our current parties and the birth of a new one. The more secular we have become the more we pray to Government for that which we once prayed to God. Nothing happens anymore. Everything is caused and is therefore to someone's credit or blame. This is nonsense and is unsustainable policy. Decency yields no more credit than indecency. How can we sustain families on this notion?\n\tAll of that is not so important. The only important thing is that the American people and the American way of life be defended against their enemies, and that they be defended worthily.\n\tIn all my public life, nothing has cheered and sustained me as much as the constantly recurring evidence of the good sense and virtue of the American people. And nothing has angered and dispirited me more than politicians' and other so called elites' disdain for the average American.\n\tI recall that during the first half of the Vietnam war, the wise men of foreign policy, from McGeorge Bundy to George Ball, were belittling the American people's demand, echoed by Barry Goldwater, that we win the war or get out. No, they said. This insistence on victory is simplistic, unsophisticated, outdated, and lacking in maturity. In our modern age, victory is impossible but involvement is inevitable. Knowledgeable professionals, namely themselves, were going to adjust the conflict to a mutually acceptable solution, if only the children of lesser Americans--not their own--would continue to get themselves shot. Then in the second half of the war, as well as after the war, these same people told us that our militarism had pushed us in, that we had gotten the lesson we deserved, but that now we, the American people, had become incapable of supporting a meaningful foreign policy, namely one led by them. This was Henry Kissinger's constant theme in the 1970's. Remember the tones of Spenglerian gloom with which he justified renouncing the United States' right to protect itself against ballistic missiles? The weakness of the American people made him do it. By the same token, during the 1980s, from Strobe Talbott in Time magazine as well as from Harvard and Stanford, we heard how dangerously stupid the American people were to harken to Ronald Reagan's call to defend this country and to relegate the Soviet Union to the dustbin of history. The elites knew better--or thought they did. Now the same people decry as neo-isolationism the elites' call to send the children of average Americans--surely not their own--to so-called peace-keeping and nation-building missions. Meanwhile they strip this country's military while their bungling diplomacy stores up future troubles. And they wonder why the American people think foreign policy is a mess?\n\tWell, the American people lack neither wisdom nor the capacity for generous sacrifice. The same year the people of Wyoming sent me to Washington, the country also elected Jimmy Carter. Carter had campaigned for ``A government as good as its people.'' He had seemed to reject the establishment's prescriptions for America's managed decline, most eloquently expressed by Henry Kissinger. Sadly, he brought in a wing of the establishment that was even further out of sympathy with America. Almost the same can be said of the American people's choice of Bill Clinton my point is this: the American people always vote for the Presidential candidate who seems to embody the old American virtues, the traditional, common sense view of America in the world. More often than not, alas, politicians have not been worthy of the people's trust. They have drawn on the well of the American people's generous patriotism, but have done nothing to refill it. Thank God that well is deep.\n\n\tToday it is fashionable among Republican as well as Democratic elites to ascribe the ills of big government to the American people's supposedly insatiable appetite for government checks and privileges, combined with their miserly unwillingness to pay for them. According to what one can hear from practically every talking head in the mainstream media, pork and corruption are demand-side problems. The politicians and their bureaucratic allies are innocent, just following orders.\n\tThis is nonsense. The social programs that have done so much harm to this country have been sold to the American people with false pretenses. Sometimes the very names of the programs are Orwellian reversals of reality--none more so than ``aid to families with dependent children.'' Who would have voted for Social Security if it had been presented as what it is, a chain letter, a ponzi scheme, that spends the workers money the moment it comes in, and that cannot return it unless each generation is taxed more heavily than the previous one? Who would have voted for Medicare if it had been made clear that this would bureaucratize and render much more expensive all health care in America? And who the heck voted for the Supreme Court decisions that ended America's tradition of local self-government, and made pornography, abortion, and vagrancy into basic rights while pushing religion out of public life? Who ever voted to institute a system of racial classification in this country? Certainly not the American people. All of these things are anathema to the average American.\n\tBut now comes the crucial questions: How long can any people, no matter how virtuous, remain uncorrupted when governed by laws and elites that tend to corrupt? This week's New York Times carries an account of widespread tax evasion in Germany. In Germany? That most order-loving of countries? Buy why? Simply because it seems that tax burden has grown so great that the people think it unreasonable. There is no doubt that our own laws and administration, fiscal and otherwise, have become so burdensome and unreasonable that our own tradition of law-abiding is fading.\n\tThere is no doubt that entitlements and privileges corrupt those who give and those who receive them, whether they are rich or poor. This list of threats to the American people's virtue is long. No one can say how long the character and habits bequeathed to us by the Founding Fathers will last and whether they will vanquish the threats or be overcome by them.\n\tThe size our continent, its fabulous wealth, its indescribable beauty, the ships, tanks, and airplanes in our arsenal, are no treasure compared to the moral character of the American people. I pray to God that he will graciously help us preserve and improve it.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Malcolm Wallop"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

It would simply require that agencies use commonsense to devise reasonable regulations which take into account the particular properties and characteristics of animal fats and vegetable oils.\n\tBecause of the clear merit of and need for this legislation, I can foresee no good reason why we should not be able to obtain its enactment very early in the next Congress.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Tom Harkin"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe exemption for commercial aviation from the transportation fuels \ntax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the commercial aviation fuel tax exemption extension act\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \non behalf of myself, Senator Bryan, and Senator McCain to extend the \ncurrent tax exemption on commercial aviation fuel which is due to \nexpire on October 1, 1995.\n  Over the past 4 years, U.S. airlines have lost over $12 billion. \nDuring that time they have either canceled or deferred orders and \noptions for more than 1,000 aircraft. As a result, 125,000 aircraft \nmanufacturing jobs have been eliminated. Each aircraft order that is \ncanceled translates into job losses of approximately 250 airline \nemployees and almost 5,000 manufacturing employees.\n  If the 4.3-cents-per-gallon tax goes into effect on October 1, 1995, \nit will cost the airlines more than $527 million annually. It will only \nescalate employee layoffs, aircraft order cancellations, and service \ncutbacks. Recognizing this, the chairman of President Clinton's own \nNational Airline Commission has written to the President to urge that \nthe exemption be extended.\n  Mr. President, I recognize that this is the last day of the 103d \nCongress, and that this legislation will not be enacted prior to \nadjournment. Nonetheless, I am introducing this bill to underscore the \nimportance of this issue and to serve notice that I will reintroduce it \nat the beginning of the 104th Congress.\n  Mr. President, a majority of Senators have already indicated their \nsupport for an extension of the jet fuel tax waiver. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the following items be printed in full in the Record.\n\n       A copy of a letter to President Clinton signed by 56 \n     Senators.\n       Letters to the President from Senators Hollings, Faircloth, \n     and Helms and Congressmen Kyl, Inhofe, Santorum, Watt, Quinn, \n     McCurdy, and Byrne.\n       A letter to the President signed by the leadership of the \n     House Public Works Committee.\n       Letters from Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, Texas \n     Governor Ann Richards and Hawaii Governor Jim Waihee.\n       A list of organizations supporting extension of the waiver.\n       A letter to the President from the Transportation Trades \n     Department of the AFL-CIO.\n       A letter to the President from former Virginia Governor \n     Gerald Baliles, chairman of the National Airline Commission.\n       A list of airports that support extension of the waiver.\n\n  Mr. President, extension of the fuel tax exemption for the airlines \nis vitally important to the health of the entire aviation industry. \nThis industry has suffered through four devastating years and is just \nnow beginning to show signs of improvement. The airlines must be \nallowed to recover and cannot afford one more enormous tax increase.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1994.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In 1993, when Congress enacted the \n     Administration's $500 billion deficit reduction plan, an \n     overwhelming majority of Members of the United States Senate \n     believed that the 4.3 cent per gallon tax on transportation \n     fuels should not apply to the financially troubled airline \n     industry. While the Senate passed version of the bill \n     included a full five year exemption for the airline industry, \n     the compromise reached by the conference committee reduced \n     the exemption to two years. The exemption expires on October \n     1, 1995.\n       In the meantime, the airline industry continues to \n     struggle. Over the past four years, the industry's losses \n     have totaled a staggering $12.8 billion. Although there have \n     been some signs of recovery, the industry suffered $150 \n     million in losses in the first half of 1994. The possibility \n     of the fuel tax applying to the industry could not come at a \n     worse time. The industry is faced with massive fleet \n     replacement restrictions mandated by the government. It is \n     conservatively estimated that it would cost $7-$8 billion a \n     year for the industry to meet noise requirements, as well as \n     replace aging aircraft.\n       In its final report last year, the National Airline \n     Commission stated that to return the industry to \n     profitability, Congress must act to ``relieve the airline \n     industry of its unfair tax and user fee burden.'' In \n     addition, the Commission recognized that the airline industry \n     is already under an enormous tax burden. Adding an additional \n     tax at this point will cause even greater losses and layoffs, \n     and is not in the best interests of our nation's travel and \n     tourism industry.\n       Given the current state of the airline industry, and the \n     potential adverse impact of new taxes on the industry, we are \n     requesting that the Administration include in its FY 1996 \n     budget an extension of the tax exemption on domestic jet fuel \n     through September 30, 1998. Providing this exemption will \n     give this beleaguered industry a chance to resolve other \n     pressing financial issues and find firmer economic ground in \n     its attempt to compete in the global marketplace.\n           Sincerely,\n         Richard H.

I \n     want to let you know that I too support the need to extend \n     further the exemption. In 1993, in accordance with the \n     Administration's $500 billion deficit reduction plan, the \n     House and Senate both agreed that a two-year exemption of the \n     4.3 cents per gallon gasoline tax should apply to the \n     commercial airline industry due to its precarious economic \n     situation. The exemption expires on October 1, 1995, and I \n     believe it should be extended.\n       When you first took office, you visited Seattle and met \n     with the aircraft manufacturers and airline CEOs to stress \n     the importance of this industry to our economic recovery. \n     While the economic recovery of our nation continues, the \n     imposition of a fuel tax could have a harmful impact on the \n     airlines' chances for economic recovery. Over the last four \n     years the industry has lost more than $12.8 billion. The \n     airlines' ability to provide service, particularly to small \n     communities, is at risk and could be at greater risk should \n     the fuel tax apply to them. I urge you to support an \n     extension of the exemption until September 30, 1998, so that \n     the industry may continue to work on its economic problems.\n       With kindest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ernest F. Hollings,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 1994.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     Office of the President,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In 1993 when Congress enacted the \n     Administration's $500 billion deficit reduction plan, an \n     overwhelming majority of Members of the United States Senate \n     believed that the 4.3 cent per gallon tax on transportation \n     fuels should not apply to the financially troubled airline \n     industry. As a result, a compromise was reached to defer the \n     implementation of the tax on the airline industry until \n     October 1, 1995.\n       As you recognized when you established the National Airline \n     Commission, the industry--which is critical to the economic \n     development of our country and to our balance of trade \n     payments--continues to struggle. Over the past four years, \n     the industry's losses have totaled a staggering $12.8 \n     billion. Although there have been some signs of recovery, the \n     industry suffered $150 million in losses in the first half of \n     1994.\n       The prospect of this jet fuel tax applying to this industry \n     effective in October of next year is alarming. If the tax had \n     been in effect this year, it would have added a new tax \n     burden of $527 million per year to the industry--clearly \n     worsening the industry's financial situation. As recognized \n     by your Commission, this industry is already under an \n     enormous tax burden. In addition to federal income taxes and \n     state taxes, the passenger and cargo excise taxes which are \n     equivalent to a 45.82 per gallon fuel tax. In addition, the \n     airlines indirectly pay or collect a 10% ticket tax and \n     numerous other fees. Overall, about 25% of the price of a \n     ticket goes to taxes.\n       The possibility of the fuel tax applying to this industry \n     could not come at a worse time. The industry is faced with \n     massive fleet replacement restrictions--mandated by the \n     government. it is conservatively estimated that it would cost \n     $7-$8 billion a year for the industry to meet noise \n     requirements, as well as replace existing aircraft.\n       In order to restructure itself and remain competitive, the \n     industry has let thousands of employees go because of \n     financial losses. Since 1992, over 20,000 employees have been \n     furloughed or terminated at our major airlines. At the same \n     time, the industry has deferred billions of dollars of \n     capital investment because of this bleak economic situation. \n     This deferral itself has meant that the industry will employ \n     tens of thousands fewer people this year than expected.\n       In its final report last year, the National Airline \n     Commission stated that to return the industry to \n     profitability, Congress must act to ``relieve the airline \n     industry of its unfair tax and user fee burden.'' The airline \n     industry and its 540,000 employees, joined by the aircraft \n     manufacturing industry, ask you to give serious attention to \n     your Commission's recommendation and continue the industry's \n     exemption from the 4.3 cent per gallon transportation fuel \n     tax beyond its October, 1995 expiration date. Otherwise, the \n     industry will be faced with the need to layoff additional \n     employees and continue to shrink. This is not in the interest \n     of our nation's travel and tourism industry which is so \n     critical to this country.\n       Given the state of the industry, we are requesting that the \n     Administration extend the tax exemption on domestic jet fuel \n     that expires on September 30, 1995 to September 30, 1998. \n     This would give this beleaguered industry a chance to resolve \n     other pressing financial issues and find firmer economic \n     ground in its attempt to compete in the global marketplace.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jesse Helms,\n     Lauch Faircloth,\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1994.\n     Hon. Bill Clinton,\n     President of the United States of America,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n     of 1993 included provisions to exempt the financially \n     troubled airline industry from the 4.3 cents per gallon tax \n     on transportation fuels for a period of two years. The \n     exemption expires on October 1, 1995.\n       As you know, the airline industry continues to struggle, \n     with industry losses over the last four years totalling more \n     than $12 billion. Although there have been some signs of \n     recovery; losses totalled $150 million in the first half of \n     1994 alone. Those continuing losses come at a time when the \n     industry is facing costly federal mandates to modify its \n     fleet, e.g. to meet noise requirements, and replace aging \n     aircraft--at a cost of between $7 billion and $8 billion. The \n     imposition of the fuel tax at the start of the next fiscal \n     year could not come at a worse time.\n       Given the state of the airline industry and the adverse \n     impact new taxes are likely to have on its ability to recover \n     and thrive, I urge you to include in your FY96 budget an \n     extension of the tax exemption on domestic jet fuel through \n     September 30, 1998.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Jon Kyl,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to express my concern \n     about the impending expiration of the transportation fuel tax \n     exemption.\n       In 1993, when Congress enacted the Administration's $500 \n     billion deficit reduction plan, it included a 4.3 cent-per-\n     gallon tax on transportation fuels. However, because of the \n     immense financial losses plaguing the airline industry, the \n     tax was deferred until 1993.\n       In the past four years, the industry's losses have exceeded \n     $12 billion, while more than 120,000 airline employees have \n     lost their jobs and 125,000 U.S. aircraft manufacturing jobs \n     have been eliminated.\n       Moreover, the industry is now facing government-mandated \n     fleet replacements to meet ``Stage 3'' aircraft noise \n     requirements at a cost of roughly $7-8 billion a year to the \n     industry for the foreseeable future.\n       In its final report last year, the National Airline \n     Commission recognized the industry must be relieved of its \n     ``unfair tax and user fee burden,'' and recommended \n     ``exempting airline fuel from any proposed transportation \n     fuel tax.'' We ask that you give serious attention to that \n     recommendation and continue the industry's exemption from the \n     jet fuels tax before it expires in 1995.\n       Providing the exemption will give the airline industry a \n     chance to regain its financial footing and remain competitive \n     in the international marketplace.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M. Inhofe,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 1994.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing with regard to the October \n     1, 1995 expiration of the airline industry fuel tax \n     exemption.\n       The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) imposed a \n     new 4.3 cents per gallon tax on transportation fuels. The \n     conference agreement for the OMRA '93 bill provided a short-\n     term exemption for gasoline and jet fuel used in commercial \n     aviation. That exemption is set to expire next year, however, \n     and the tax will become effective for commercial aviation on \n     October 1st. A floor stocks tax assessment is also scheduled \n     to become effective on that same date.\n       In preparing your budget recommendations for fiscal year \n     1996, I hope you would review the current airline industry \n     tax exemption and consider an extension of that exemption in \n     hopes of bolstering the industry's economic recovery. Over \n     the past four years, the airline industry as a whole has \n     suffered losses of $12.8 billion. Since 1990 in particular, \n     U.S. airlines have had workforce reductions of 120,000 and \n     have witnessed corresponding reductions of 125,000 employees \n     in the aircraft manufacturing sector due to cancellation or \n     deferment of approximately 1,000 aircraft orders and options.\n       Federal tax policies have contributed directly to the \n     industry's financial problems. Tax collection from the \n     industry over the past four years has resulted in cumulative \n     losses of $12 billion. As jet fuel remains the industry's \n     second largest operating cost for airlines, the pending \n     imposition of the new fuels tax carries a projected annual \n     cost to airlines of $527 million. As the industry struggles \n     to regain its financial footing, this new tax will be a \n     further setback and could exacerbate additional employee \n     layoffs, aircraft order cancellations, and service cutbacks.\n       I appreciate your time and consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rick Santorum,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 1994.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to express my concern \n     about the scheduled imposition of the fuel tax on the airline \n     industry. This tax on commercial aviation jet fuel was \n     included as part of last year's budget deficit reduction \n     package and is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, \n     1995.\n       USAir, which is a major employer and has a hub at the \n     Charlotte Airport in my congressional district, has expressed \n     deep concern about the jet fuel tax. USAir is struggling \n     particularly hard to recover from the huge losses suffered by \n     the airline industry during the recession and from other \n     business adversities. The imposition of the fuel tax would \n     have a major, adverse effect on its ability to recover.\n       Because of the importance of USAir and the airline industry \n     to the economic health of my congressional district and the \n     Nation as a whole, I ask you to consider including a \n     deferment of the fuel tax for the industry in the \n     Administration's budget for FY 1996. Deferring the tax until \n     the industry is better able to sustain it will greatly assist \n     in the industry's recovery and will contribute to the \n     improving economic health and employment picture of the \n     Nation.\n       Thank you for you attention to this request. I look forward \n     to continuing to work with you on important issues in the \n     balance of this Congress and next year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Melvin L.

Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to you regarding a tax \n     imposed on transportation fuels, which was part of your \n     budget reconciliation plan enacted last year. This additional \n     tax on transportation fuels of 4.3 cents-per-gallon was \n     imposed with a two-year deferment, in the hopes that by 1995 \n     the airline industry would be in better financial standing \n     and consequently able to handle the additional tax burden.\n       Unfortunately, as I am sure you are aware, the financial \n     situation of the airline industry has only gotten worse. \n     Financial losses, along with the loss of some 60,000 airline \n     jobs and an already-imposed ticket tax of 10% make the \n     airlines unable to handle any further tax burdens. Moreover, \n     the size of the airline industry makes its financial \n     viability essential to our country's economic recovery. For \n     these reasons, I urge you to consider a continued deferment \n     of this fuel tax. I ask that this deferment be imposed \n     indefinitely so that the airline industry can once again gain \n     firm financial standing.\n       I'm sure you would agree that the airline industry greatly \n     contributes to the economic stability of our country. If I \n     can assist you further regarding this matter, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration of this issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                       Jack Quinn,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1994.\n     Hon.

William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to raise my concerns about \n     the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gasoline tax that passed last year \n     but was deferred for the airline industry until October 1, \n     1995. With the airline industry continuing to experience \n     financial losses, I ask that you continue your strong \n     commitment to strengthening the airline industry by deferring \n     the imposition of this tax in your budget proposals until the \n     airline industry is in better financial shape.\n       This issue is of particular concern to my constituents \n     because of the economic stimulus that one particular carrier, \n     USAir, has in Virginia. USAir is Virginia's largest air \n     carrier employing over 4,947 people and pumping over $2 \n     billion into the Virginia economy annually. Their economic \n     viability is intricately linked to the economic health and \n     well-being of many of my constituents, with their payroll \n     exceeding $12,545,924 in the 11th Congressional District.\n       As you know, when the 4.3 cents-per-gallon tax passed in \n     August, 1993, as part of the deficit reduction plan, it was \n     deferred for the airline industry until October 1, 1995, with \n     the hope that the industry would be out of the financial \n     woods at that time. A 10% ticket tax was imposed specifically \n     in lieu of a fuel tax, which means that the industry is \n     already contributing $5.129 billion toward deficit reduction.\n       Recent reports indicate that the industry continues to \n     experience financial woes. Imposing the gas tax on top of the \n     10% ticket tax at this sensitive time could jeopardize the \n     health and viability of the airline industry and threaten our \n     nation's economic recovery. Therefore, I ask that you \n     continue to defer this tax in your budget proposals until the \n     airline industry is in better financial shape.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this matter and your \n     commitment to strengthening the airline industry. I look \n     forward to continuing to work with you on issues affecting \n     the health of the airline industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leslie L. Byrne,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n                                         Committee on Public Works\n\n\n                                           and Transportation,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 16, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge that the \n     Administration include in its FY 1996 budget an extension \n     (through September 30, 1998) of the airline industry \n     exemption from the domestic jet fuel tax. A continued \n     exemption is justified as a matter of fairness to the airline \n     industry which is already paying more than its share of \n     special taxes. The extended exemption will also enable the \n     industry to continue its recovery from recent catastrophic \n     financial losses, which have undermined the industries' \n     ability to compete in the global marketplace.\n       The airline industry is already subject to an overwhelming \n     array of special taxes. Federal taxes imposed exclusively, or \n     primarily, on the airlines include a 10% excise tax on \n     airline tickets, a 6.25% excise tax on cargo shipments, a $6 \n     per passenger international departure tax, special taxes to \n     support customs, immigration, and agricultural inspection \n     services, and a $3 passenger facilitation charge at many \n     major airports. These taxes impose costs of $6.7 billion a \n     year on an industry with total revenues of $64 billion a \n     year.\n       The heavy taxes have been an important factor in the \n     industry's cumulative losses, which exceeded $12 billion over \n     the past four years. If the industry is profitable in 1994, \n     profits are not expected to exceed $1 billion.\n       The industry's poor financial results have to led the \n     elimination of 125, 000 high paying jobs. The impacts have \n     extended beyond the airlines and into this country's most \n     successful export business--aircraft manufacturing. Since \n     1990, U.S. airlines have canceled or deferred orders and \n     options for more than 1,000 new aircraft.\n       In recognition of the airlines' financial difficulties and \n     high tax burden, the 1993 deficit reduction package exempted \n     airlines from the new 4.3 cents per gallon tax on jet fuel \n     for two years. Since the condition of the airline industry \n     has not changed significantly, the exemption should be \n     continued. The industry is in no position to pay the \n     additional $527 million a year which this tax would cost. The \n     elastic demand for air travel prevents airlines from raising \n     their fares to cover these added costs. The price sensitive \n     market means any increase in air fares is likely to be offset \n     by a decline in passengers. An additional $527 million tax \n     burden would wipe out much of the industry's estimated profit \n     for 1995, further exacerbating the industry's tenuous \n     financial position.\n       Mr. President, as your Administration prepares its fiscal \n     year 1996 budget, we respectfully ask that this budget \n     include an extension of the exemption of airlines from the \n     commercial aviation fuel tax, through September 30, 1998. \n     This action would forcefully demonstrate your \n     Administration's strong commitment to the vital travel and \n     tourism sector of our nation's economy.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Bud Shuster,\n       Ranking Republican, Committee on Public Works \n     Transportation.\n     William F.

Unfortunately with that \n     date fast approaching, the U.S. airlines are far from being \n     able to absorb an additional $527 million annually. Still \n     recovering from four years of staggering losses totaling over \n     $12 billion and with $150 million loss during the fist half \n     of this year, any new tax could not come at a more fragile \n     time for the industry.\n       As your National Airline Commission indicated in its report \n     last year, the airlines are already under heavy tax burden. \n     In addition to the federal and state taxes paid by all \n     businesses, the airlines pay over $5.4 billion annually in \n     passenger and cargo excise taxes--the equivalent of a 45.8 \n     cents per gallon fuel tax. Now at a time when the industry \n     also faces fleet replacement costs conservatively estimated \n     at $7 to $8 billion a year to comply with mandated quiet-\n     technology requirements, the prospect of a new tax is \n     especially devastating.\n       As a former governor, you understand that a healthy U.S. \n     airline industry is critical to the vitality of a state's \n     economy, especially in the way it serves as a catalyst for \n     our booming travel and tourism sector.\n       On behalf of the state of Arkansas, I respectfully request \n     that your administration's FY 1996 budget include an \n     extension of the tax exemption on commercial aviation fuel \n     through September 30, 1998.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jim Guy Tucker.\n                                  ____\n\n    \n    \n                                                   State of Texas,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Austin, TX, October 25, 1994.\n     Hon.

In my view, \n     the airlines are still struggling to become consistently \n     profitable and need assistance in reducing their tax burden.\n       The State of Hawaii has provided financial support for \n     airlines serving the State through a subsidy to reduce \n     airport fees and charges. The special fund of the State \n     airport program will provide the subsidy through the 1997 \n     fiscal year. Funds came from cash reserves generated by \n     airport concessions and were intended for airport improvement \n     projects.\n       With Hawaii's dependence on reliable, regular air service \n     to support our tourism industry and for intra- and inter-\n     state transportation for our citizens, we feel it is urgent \n     that our nation's airline industry be assisted until it \n     becomes financially stable. Extending the fuel tax exemption \n     will provide some of the relief they need.\n       Your favorable consideration of our request is appreciated.\n       With kindest regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Waihee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    December 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: For two reasons, next year will be an \n     extremely important one for the travel and tourism industry: \n     Your Administration will highlight the significance of our \n     industry to our nation's economy by hosting the White House \n     Conference on Travel and Tourism. Unfortunately, next year \n     will also be the year in which the backbone of our industry, \n     the U.S. airline industry, will lose its exemption from the \n     4.3 cents per gallon tax on transportation fuels. As your \n     Administration works to develop its budget for the coming \n     fiscal year, we respectfully ask that you extend the current \n     exemption on commercial aviation fuel.\n       As you are probably aware, the U.S. airline industry has \n     lost a staggering $12.8 billion since 1990. More devastating, \n     however, has been the decimation of airline, aircraft \n     manufacturing and travel and tourism jobs. During this same \n     period, nearly 120,000 U.S. airline employees and 125,000 \n     U.S. aircraft manufacturing employees have lost their jobs. \n     While the industry has recently shown small signs of \n     recovery, U.S. airlines collectively suffered $150 million in \n     losses during the first half of 1994. Sadly, on October 1, \n     1995, the airline industry's exemption from the \n     transportation fuels tax will expire. At current consumption \n     levels, this new 4.3 cents per gallon tax will amount to an \n     additional $527 million annual burden on this industry. \n     Almost certainly, this new tax will wipe out any profit the \n     industry had hoped to make in 1995, and further exacerbate \n     the industry's already tenuous financial position. Because \n     the airlines have such a large impact on our economy--\n     transporting nearly 500 million passengers each year--they \n     are a major catalyst for the entire U.S. travel and tourism \n     industry, as well as the economy as a whole. Whether the fuel \n     tax results in higher fares or more service cutbacks, the \n     repercussions will be felt throughout our industry by hotel, \n     restaurant, rental car, and all other travel industry \n     employees.\n       In its final report to Congress and your Administration \n     last year, the National Airline Commission stated that, to \n     return the industry to profitability, Congress must act to \n     ``relieve the airline industry of its unfair tax and user fee \n     burden.'' The Commission clearly recognized that the U.S. \n     airline industry is already under an enormous tax burden. In \n     addition to the federal and state taxes paid by all \n     businesses, the airline industry is currently paying over \n     $5.4 billion annually in passenger and cargo excise taxes--\n     the equivalent of a 45.8 cents per gallon fuel tax. Airlines \n     indirectly pay or collect a 10 percent ticket tax, a $6.00 \n     International Departure Tax, a $6.50 Customs User Fee, a \n     $6.00 Immigration User Fee and a $1.45 Agriculture Inspection \n     Fee.\n       Mr. President, as your Administration prepares its Fiscal \n     Year 1996 budget, we respectfully ask that this budget \n     include an extension of the tax exemption on commercial \n     aviation fuel. With the White House Conference on Travel and \n     Tourism already underway, this one action would forcefully \n     demonstrate your Administration's strong commitment to this \n     vital sector of our nation's economy.\n           Sincerely,\n       Aerospace Industries Association, Air Freight Association \n     of America, Air Midwest, Inc., Air Wisconsin Airlines \n     Corporation, African-American Travel and Tourism Association, \n     Alamo Rent-A-Car, Allegheny Commuter Airlines, Inc.\n       Allied Tours, AlliedSignal, Inc., American Express Company, \n     American Hotel and Motel Association, American Recreation \n     Coalition, American Society of Travel Agents, Arizona \n     Airways, Inc.\n       Association of Retail Travel Agents, Atlantic Southeast \n     Airlines, Inc., Bemidji Aviation Services, Inc., The \n     BFGoodrich Company, The Boeing Company, Greater Boston \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, Business Express, Inc., \n     California Chamber of Commerce, California Travel Industry \n     Association, Cascadia Airlines.\n       Chautauqua Airlines, Inc., Chicago Convention and Tourism \n     Bureau, Citicorp Diners Club, Cleveland Growth Association, \n     Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry, Colorado Hotel \n     and Lodging Association, Colorado Ski Country USA, Comair, \n     Inc., CommutAir, Conquest Airlines Corporation.\n       Continental Express, Inc., CUC Travel Services, Inc., \n     Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau, Denver Metro \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical \n     University, Empire Airlines, Executive Airlines, Inc., \n     Fairmont Hotels.\n       Flagship Airlines, Inc., FloridaGulf Airlines, General \n     Electric Company, Georgia Hospitality and Travel Association, \n     GP-Express Airlines, Inc., Gray Line Air.\n       Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd., Gulfstream International \n     Airlines, Inc., Greater Hartford Tourism District, The Hertz \n     Corporation, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Hilton International, \n     Holiday Inn, Honeywell, Inc., Horizon Air Industries, Inc., \n     Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association International.\n       Greater Houston Partnership, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, \n     Hyatt Regency Denver, Inter-continental Hotels, International \n     Airline Passengers Association, International Association of \n     Convention and Visitor Bureaus, Jetstream International \n     Airlines, Inc., Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, \n     Liberty Express Airlines, Lone Star Airlines.\n       Louisiana Travel Promotion Association, McDonnell Douglas \n     Corporation, Meeting Professionals International, Mesa \n     Airlines, Inc., Mesaba Aviation, Inc., Greater Miami \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, Michigan Hotel, Motel and \n     Resort Association, Greater Minneapolis Convention and \n     Visitors Bureau, Nantucket Airlines/Cape Air.\n       National Air Carrier Association, National Association of \n     RV Parks and Campgrounds, National Council of Area and \n     Regional Tourism Organizations, National Park Hospitality \n     Association, National Restaurant Association, New York State \n     Hospitality and Tourism Association, Pacific Air.\n       Paradise Island Airlines, Inc., Passenger Vessel \n     Association, Piedmont Airlines, Inc., Greater Pittsburgh \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, Greater Raleigh Convention \n     and Visitors Bureau, Recreational Vehicle Industry \n     Association, Red Lion Hotels & Inns, Regional Airline \n     Association.\n       Rockwell Collins Commercial Avionics, Sandals Resorts, San \n     Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau, SkyWay Airlines, \n     SkyWest Airlines, Inc., Society of Travel Agents in \n     Government, Trans States Airlines, Inc., Trans World Express, \n     Inc.\n       Travel Council of North Carolina, Travel Industry \n     Association of America, Travel and Tourism Government Affairs \n     Council, United States Tour Operators Association, United \n     Technologies Corporation, Washington Airports Task Force, \n     Wings Airways, Wings West Airlines, Inc., Wyndham Hotels and \n     Resorts.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Transportation Trades\n\n\n                                                   Department,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, Nov. 3, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Since 1990, the U.S. airlines have lost \n     a combined total of more than $12.8 billion. While the \n     financial suffering has been substantial, what is clearly \n     most distressing is the toll these loses have had on the \n     industry's employees. In the preceding four years, nearly \n     120,000 U.S. airline employees and 125,000 U.S. aircraft \n     manufacturing employees have lost their jobs.\n       During this same period, employees of nearly every U.S. \n     airline have sacrificed pay and/or benefits annually \n     totalling in the billions of dollars. Unfortunately, while \n     employees have contributed their fair share to help bring \n     this industry back to sustained profitability, next year the \n     government will impose a new commercial aviation fuel tax \n     which will almost certainly result in additional airline \n     employee layoffs. As representatives of the vast majority of \n     these employees whose jobs have already been lost, we ask \n     that, as your Administration works to develop its budget for \n     the coming fiscal year, you not jeopardize the concessions \n     made by labor and extend the current exemption on commercial \n     aviation fuel through September, 1998.\n       In its final report to Congress and your Administration \n     last year, the National Airline Commission stated that, to \n     return the industry to profitability, Congress must act to \n     ``relieve the airline industry of its unfair tax and user fee \n     burden.'' The Commission clearly recognized that U.S. \n     airlines are already under an enormous tax burden, and \n     currently pay taxes and fees totalling the equivalent of a \n     45.8 cents per gallon fuel tax. Although the industry has \n     recently begun to show modest signs of financial improvement, \n     U.S. airlines collectively suffered losses of $150 million \n     during the first half of 1994. When the industry's exemption \n     from the transportation fuels tax expires on October 1, 1995, \n     this new 4.3 cents per gallon tax will amount to an \n     additional $527 million annual burden on this industry--a \n     burden our employees simply cannot bear.\n       Mr. President, airline industry employees are some of the \n     most highly-trained, productive and efficient employees of \n     any U.S. industry. We ask that you not jeopardize the fragile \n     economic environment under which our employees work, and \n     extend the current tax exemption on commercial aviation fuel \n     through September, 1998.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. Randolph Babbitt,\n       President, Air Line Pilots Association.\n     Dee Maki,\n       Association of Flight Attendants.\n     William Scheri,\n       General Vice President, International Association of \n     Machinists and Aerospace Workers.\n     Ron Carey,\n       President, International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n     Barry Krasner,\n       National President, National Air Traffic Controllers, \n     Association/MEBA.\n     Sonny Hall,\n       International President, Transport Workers Union of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Hunton & Williams,\n\n                                       Richmond, VA Oct. 18, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Among the bright spots on today's \n     economic landscape is the improved performance of the U.S. \n     airline industry. While problems such as high debt levels \n     ensure continued uncertainty, the fact remains that the \n     trends have been moving in the right direction over the past \n     year.\n       As the administration begins to focus on the legislative \n     agenda for the new Congress, you will hear a great deal of \n     discussion about the issue of fuel taxes on the commercial \n     airline industry. As you might remember, the National Airline \n     Commission addressed this issue in its report.\n       The Commission recommended that no new tax on commercial \n     airline fuel be imposed.\n       In the commentary since the Commisison's report, our tax \n     recommendations have been characterized as special ``tax \n     relief.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. I would \n     like to share with you the Commission's thinking on the fuel \n     tax, and then conclude with a general comment on our overall \n     approach to tax issues.\n       The commercial airline industry has never been subjected to \n     a federal fuel tax. Unlike road improvements which are funded \n     through a fuel tax, aviation infrastructure improvements are \n     funded through the airline and cargo ticket tax. Thus, the \n     source of revenue for those purposes already exists.\n       The Commission could see no good public policy reason for \n     changing the tax treatment of airline fuel, one of the \n     industry's two highest cost items. In fact, one could hardly \n     call our recommendation ``tax relief'' since we were not \n     recommending the reduction of a tax, but that a new tax not \n     be imposed.\n       As Chairman of the Commission, I hope you will support \n     efforts to extend permanently the two-year exemption from the \n     4.3 cent fuel tax contained in the 1993 budget legislation.\n       Allow me to conclude with a few general comments about the \n     Commission's tax recommendations.\n       The National Airline Commission examined the entire range \n     of tax laws affecting the airline industry, as required by \n     our enabling legislation. The industry, and others, had many \n     ideas for our consideration. In some cases we took action, in \n     others we did not. In those areas in which we did make \n     recommendations, we believed there were important public \n     policy reasons to do so, such as the recommendation that \n     there be no new fuel tax.\n       Our recommendations had nothing to do with ``tax relief'' \n     for the industry. We rejected several ideas that would have \n     injected more cash into the industry, and advanced only those \n     we believed made sense in a critical, high tech, industry \n     struggling to compete in the 1990's. If tax relief for its \n     own sake was our goal, we would have focused in other areas. \n     Our only goal was to help make sense of the tax treatment of \n     this industry.\n       I have been disappointed that some have sought to portray \n     the Commission's recommendation as some sort of special \n     interest pleading. I wanted you to have a clear sense of our \n     thinking. I would be happy to discuss this issue with you at \n     any time.\n       With kindest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Gerald L.

In fact, the aviation \n     industry is in no position to bear the burden of financing \n     irrelevant federal programs. It is equally important that \n     airports and airlines together press for increased funding \n     levels in the AIP programs. The money is already there and \n     needs to be appropriated for desperately needed airport \n     infrastructure.\n       As I see it, these are issues on which we both can and \n     should stand side by side as a unified voice urging the \n     Administration and Congress to not kill the goose that lays \n     the golden egg-Air Transportation.\n       Let me know when and how you want to proceed with sending \n     the letter to the President.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Thomas E.

A bill to enhance the management of public lands, reduce \nFederal expenditures associated with such lands, and empower States \nwith respect to the ownership and control over lands that are or have \nbeen part of the public domain, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            the public land emancipation and management act\n\n Mr. WALLOP. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Public \nLand Emancipation and Management Improvement Act [PLEA] which, when \nenacted, will greatly limit the ponderous Federal influence on the \nWest.\n  In the West today, we are faced with an administration that is \nreaching unprecedented levels of government intervention into every \naspect of each of our lives using the terms ``environmentalism'' and \n``fair market value'' as spears which they chuck at every perceived \npublic resource management problem.\n  Increasingly, the role of Federal Government has become one of \n``ruling'' the people rather than one of ``serving'' he people. They \nare the masters; we have become their servants.\n  I do not often agree with the Clinton administration, nor its \nspokespersons, but no one has expressed the problem in a more \narticulate manner than the former Western Governor, and now, Secretary \nof the Interior Bruce Babbitt.\n  Mr. President, listen to excerpts from a speech he gave while \nGovernor at an National Governors Association meeting in Denver.\n  He said,\n\n       I share the concerns of my fellow governors. My sense of \n     alarm is perhaps a little more extreme. A lot of observers in \n     this country feel that, taken on a historic scale, the states \n     are obsolete, they are headed the way of the passenger pigeon \n     and the Edsel. Even the optimist, I think, would say the \n     states at best are in dire danger of becoming simply \n     administrative agents of Washington * * * it didn't begin \n     that way.\n\n  He goes on to say,\n\n     the proper role between states and the Federal Government * * \n     * was the centerpiece * * * of the most brilliant debate in \n     the history of western institutions.\n       * * * That debate * * * has gone neglected. The result is a \n     federal system * * * in total disarray.\n       * * * The United States Congress has lost all sense of \n     restraint. It no longer asks the question that Hamilton, \n     Madison and Jefferson considered to be the central question * \n     * * Is this an appropriate function for the Federal system?\n       * * * Hamilton and Jefferson would certainly ask * * * how \n     have we allowed their creation--a carefully layered \n     construction of federal, state and local responsibilities, to \n     become scrambled into one great undifferentiated, amorphous \n     omelet by a cook in Washington?\n\n  Mr. President, those words were spoken by a Federal chef who has \nbecome so supreme at his craft as to make Julia Childs look like a fry-\ncook.\n  Fourteen years have passed since Bruce Babbitt spoke those words in \nthe last year of the Carter administration--another Democratic \nadministration that had an ill-conceived agenda for the West. Today, \nthe current administration's concept of the ``New West'' has rapidly \ndegenerated to a ``war on the West.'' Government officials have been \ntransformed from environmental problem solvers to environmental storm \ntroopers with the power to punish, to prohibit, and to take. Virtually \nall Federal agencies are making decisions on the use of land and \nresources in unquestioning response to an ill-conceived environmental \nagenda which ignores the human side of the equation and disregards the \nconcept of private property rights. Worse still, it ignores Governor \nBabbitt's concern that the Federal Government has lost all sense of \nrestraint and the concepts of Jefferson and Madison.\n  In a 1994 speech to the Sierra Club's Annual Dinner, Secretary \nBabbitt said:\n\n       We need a new western land ethic for non-wilderness. The \n     old concept of multiple use no longer fits the reality of the \n     new West. It must be a concept of public use. From this day \n     on, we must recognize the new reality that the highest and \n     best, most productive use, of western land will usually be \n     for public purposes--watershed, wildlife and recreation.\n\n  Typically, he made no distinction in this speech between public and \nprivate land. Unlike his views in 1980 as a Western Governor, he now \nfeels that the Federal Government should be omnipotent.\n  The Clinton administration's agenda is clear, and only the users of \nthe public lands will become endangered in their war on the West. \nCitizens have been threatened with rules and regulations denying access \nto guns, rock collecting, and recreation.\n  In order to pay for increased control by big government, we see \nrepeated proposals to increase fees. Hunters, outfitters, radio \nbroadcast users, commercial air tour operators, ski area operators, \nconcessioners, and any other use that requires a Federal permit are \nbeing asked to shoulder a bigger burden. Not all of these permit \nholders will be able to afford to stay in business after paying the new \nfees on top of existing expenses. In addition, many who have \ntraditionally enjoyed a cooperative partnership with the Federal \nGovernment--including counties and municipalities--are now being asked \nto help pay the costs for more Federal control. Further, they are asked \nto cede back water rights, mineral rights and respass rights for \nrenewals of their permits. How ironic. How very contrary to the Clinton \ncampaign rhetoric.\n  The current furor over grazing fees is not a Federal deficit issue, \nas portrayed by the administration and the media. It is, in fact, a \npersonal economic issue for thousands of rural, western families. If \nimplemented, this range reform will result in seriously reduced \nrevenues ironically to the Federal Government, but more importantly to \nStates and counties which will suffer from rules and regulations that \nno one they know ever voted on.\n  Recently, the Secretary was forced by the courts to issue patents on \na Nevada gold mine. He had the nerve to characterize this as a steal \nand give-away of land and minerals. It made for good press to the \nuninformed. But the Secretary failed to state that the Barrick \nGoldstrike Mines in Nevada have developed over 1,700 jobs that did not \nexist before. It means millions of dollars in tax revenue to counties, \nStates, and yes, the Federal Government. The Secretary failed to \nmention the billion dollars the company spent on developing \ntechnologies to extract the mineral. That is $1 billion that did not \nexist in the American economy before this mine was planned. He also \nforgot to mention that the land was worth nothing, to the Federal \nGovernment, until after the private sector had developed the technology \nto recover the minerals.\n  Washington does not know how to mine anything. It never will know how \nto mine minerals and Congress won't ever pay for a billion dollars' \nworth of experimental technology. You know it and I know it. The wealth \nand the jobs that have been created from these lands for America has \nbeen realized by the private sector's willingness to commit capital and \ntechnology to a plan it had no way of knowing was going to be \nsuccessful.\n  The battle in the war on the West, if won by this administration will \nonly serve to send the private mining sector to foreign countries. The \ngovernments in those lands will not prohibit investors from achieving \nsuccess, boosting their economy, and employing their people. Nor will \nthey protect the environment.\n  Mr. President, as an example of the arrogance of which I speak, let \nme also remind you that during the grazing debates, we were told by the \nthen director of the BLM ``that if Congress refuses to act, we will do \nit administratively.'' That, Mr. President, is arrogance, and this \nadministration may never understand that laws in this country are not \nmade by residentially appointed bureaucrats, but by the Congress. When \nthe administration says to hell with them they are saying to hell with \nus. The hell with America's citizens of the West.\n  Mr. President, more recently, Interior Secretary Babbitt seriously \nmissed the point in claiming that a Federal judge's recent decision to \ntake the gnatcatcher off the Endangered Species list was just the \nresult of a procedural error.\n  Any observer can see that Judge Stanley Sporkin's detailed analysis \nof this case of administrative arrogance on the part of the \nadministration is almost a road map to some of the most serious \nshortcomings of the Endangered Species Act. It highlights the abuses \nthat Babbitt has tolerated in his eagerness to show that he can make \nthe Endangered Species Act work. How different from the Babbitt of \n1980. How sad that this man does not view his job as Secretary of \nInterior, but still the advocate of the League of Conservative Voters.\n  Even more troubling is Babbitt's apparent willingness to defy the \ncourts. The Secretary says if Judge Sporkin doesn't immediately \nreinstate protections for the gnatcatcher while the Government appeals \nhis ruling, he'll do it himself by declaring an emergency and invoke \nthe emergency listing procedures in the law so the Secretary of the \nInterior can just ignore the courts.\n  Mr. President, allow me to mention the subject of ecosystem \nmanagement. What the Clinton team apparently likes about this ecosystem \napproach is its sheer vagueness. If we don't understand what \n``ecosystem health'' is we won't be aware when that policy fails. Since \nmost of us wouldn't recognize an ecosystem boundary if we fell on it, \nthere's no limit to the amount of real estate the agencies can claim \nthey need to ``protect the ecosystem.'' All in the name of the new \nWest.\n  This administration is trying to close down roads and rights-of-way \nwhich are vital to the transportation, safety, law enforcement, and \ngeneral access of Western States.\n  Mr. President, it is time to take the war on the West seriously.\n  The Federal Government currently owns more than half of all the land \nin the 12 Western States. Unfortunately, recent actions taken by the \nClinton administration have made it clear that the Federal Government \nis managing these lands for the benefit of specific political interest \ngroups with little regard for the legitimate interests of Western \ncitizens and businesses. As a result, citizens of Western States have \nlittle or no control over vast areas of land that were contemplated as \na source of their livelihood at the time of their statehood.\n  The radical ``new West'' reforms proposed by Secretary Babbitt and \nothers are designed primarily to limit or prevent commercial and even \nsome recreational uses of many federally managed lands. Where such uses \nare allowed, land users face a daunting maze of Federal regulations, \nredtape and increased fees and arrogance.\n  There is little hope on the horizon as storm clouds grow.\n  Proposed revisions to timber, mining, and grazing policies coupled \nwith aggressive application of environmental laws such as the \nEndangered Species and Clean Water acts have only served to promote \neconomic uncertainty, with no resolution in sight. New initiatives to \nrevise western water law, hydropower projects, fish and wildlife \nprograms, and hunting regulations are just beginning to surface. The \nassault on the West is real. There is a strong feeling in many Western \nStates that these policies should not be decided inside the beltway by \npeople who have no constituent interest or control. The Federal \nGovernment has become too powerful, too prescriptive, too pervasive, \nand too arrogant.\n  After personally witnessing Washington's increasing indifference--and \neven hostility--toward the interests in the West, I believe there is a \nsimple, fair, and straightforward solution to these problems that can \nbe accomplished by transferring the ownership of much of this land from \nthe Federal Government to the States.\n  This legislation, when enacted, will approach but not provide equity \namong the States. The playing field will never be completely level, but \nthis will help ensure that Western States have a chance to continue to \nbe a vital and productive part of this Nation, just as their eastern \ncounterparts have always been able to do. Other than Louisiana, no \nState east of the 100th meridian has more than 14 percent of the lands \nwithin its boundary tied up by the Federal Government.\n  Under this bill, at a State's behest, the Federal Government would be \nprevented from owning more than 20 percent of the land area of any \nState, excluding Indian lands. In those States where the Federal \nownership currently is higher than 20 percent, the President would be \nrequired to select up to 20 percent of the land in the State that would \nremain under Federal ownership. The remainder would be transferred to \nthe State unless the Governor determines that some portion of it should \nremain under Federal ownership and control.\n  Recognizing the special nature of our national parks, these lands \nwould automatically be included within the 20 percent and would \ntherefore perpetually remain under Federal ownership. However, other \nWestern lands owned by the Federal Government would be turned over to \nthe States, where locally elected officials would be immediately \naccountable to the citizens who have proven to be wise stwards for over \na century.\n  There will be those opposed to this proposal, some hunting and \nfishing groups will at first panic citing their access as a major \nproblem. Yet when they think about the behavior and objectives of this \nadministration, I believe they will come to embrace its purpose. The \nrules and regulations that were recently pulled back by the Forest \nService regarding firearms and law enforcement coupled with Forest \nService Chief Thomas's idea to impose a $100 Federal hunting license to \nkill one elk because the elk once lived on a National Forest give some \ninsight to the fact there is an active movement to eliminate hunting, \nguns, and other recreation on public lands.\n\n       Without fanfare, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has \n     decided that stocking trout and bass fish is a politically \n     incorrect ecological evil. It plans to prohibit this activity \n     on State and private, as well as Federal, lands.\n\n  I am quoting from an Austin Chase article in the Washington Times, \nMr. President, and I ask unanimous consent that the article be included \nin the Record.\n  Additionally, today there is legislation, advanced by the \nadministration, working its way through Congress which would eliminate \nany multiple use activity on a wildlife refuge, if a bureaucrat \ndeclares it incompatible. And do not forget this is the administration \nthat pushed through the Brady bill and assault weapons ban ostensibly \nto fight the war on crime but in reality the first ominous steps toward \ngun control.\n  Others may fear that the States will only dispose of the previously \nFederal lands for profit. Mr. President, let me tell you what just \nhappened in my own State with regard to that issue. There was a recent \neffort by the State land board to dispose of certain State trust lands. \nHowever, the citizens of Wyoming rose up and literally stopped the \nventure in its tracks. It is my view that I trust citizens of a State \nto be responsible, to care, and to better be able to effect policy at \nthe level of State and local government than are the unaffected Members \nof Congress and the anonymous bureaucracy in Washington.\n  I firmly believe that the States will manage these lands better and \nin a more cost-effective manner than the bloated bureaucracy. For \nexample, the Federal Government spends $60 million to collect $400 \nmillion in mineral royalties in Wyoming while the State achieves the \nsame result at a much lower cost. The identical cost saving rational \ncan easily be applied to other land management programs currently \nconducted by the Federal Government.\n  Our fight is for the West. We need first to reestablish multiple-use \nand the rights of Westerners and second we need to establish fairness \nand equity among the States by returning their land to them.\n  The West constitutes some of the best of America--the best in \nAmerica, let us see that it is not the last of the best.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I now ask unanimous \nconsent that the full text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2568\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, That this Act may be referred to as the ``Public \n     Land Emancipation and Management Improvement Act''.\n       Sec. 2. Effective on January 1, 1998, all right, title, and \n     interest in and to any real property owned by the United \n     States that is or has been at any time part of the public \n     domain, including, but not limited to, lands that have been \n     withdrawn or disposed of and reacquired, is vested by \n     operation of law in the State in which such property is \n     located subject only to the limitations set forth in section \n     3 of this Act and any valid existing rights.\n       Sec. 3. For the purposes of this Act, the definition of \n     real property shall exclude:\n       (a) any lands or interests therein owned by the United \n     States as of January 1, 1998 within the exterior boundaries \n     of any unit of the National Park System;\n       (b) any lands or interests therein which the United States \n     holds title to in trust for the benefit of a federally \n     recognized Indian Tribe, a member thereof, or an individual \n     allottee;\n       (c) such lands as the President shall have identified for \n     continued federal retention, except that the total of all \n     lands and interests therein identified pursuant to this \n     subsection, when combined with any other lands or interests \n     therein owned by the United States, excluding only lands \n     included under subsections (b) or (d) of this section, may \n     not exceed twenty percent of the total acreage within any \n     given State; and\n       (d) any lands or interests therein which the Governor of \n     the State in which such lands are located does not wish to \n     have transferred pursuant to this Act and which the Governor \n     has identified in writing to the President prior to January \n     1, 1998 as not subject to transfer.\n       Sec. 4. Not later than January 1, 1997, the President shall \n     prepare a comprehensive inventory of all real property owned \n     by the Federal Government within each of the several States \n     and transmit such list to the Governor of each State and \n     shall accompany such list with an identification of all real \n     property which meets requirements of subsections 3 (a) or (b) \n     or which have been identified for continued Federal retention \n     under subsection 3(c).\n       Sec. 5. In the event that the identification of real \n     property under section 3(c) exceeds 20 percent of the total \n     acreage within a State, the Governor of the State may bring \n     an action to modify the list of lands in any Federal district \n     court within such State. Review shall be limited solely to \n     whether the acreage exceeds 20 percent of the total acreage \n     within the State. If the court concludes that the acreage \n     contained in the listing prepared pursuant to subsection 3(c) \n     does exceed 20 percent, then the court shall exclude such \n     acreage as is necessary to reduce the total to no more than \n     20 percent. The acreage to be excluded shall be based solely \n     on a priority list furnished by the Governor. The list shall \n     be final and shall not be subject to any review or \n     modification.\n       Sec. 6. For the purpose of this Act, the term ``State'' \n     shall include the several States of the Union, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and the Virgin \n     Islands.\n       Sec. 7. The Federal Government shall remain strictly liable \n     for the cost of any clean-up associated with hazardous \n     materials or contamination associated with any lands \n     transferred pursuant to this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Murkowski):\n  S. 2569. A bill to prohibit the United States from entering into any \ninternational agreement which would prevent full implementation of the \nUnited Nations moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing on the high \nseas; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n        THE HIGH SEAS DRIFTNET FISHING MORATORIUM PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, once again I come before this body \nto introduce legislation to help protect our fishery resources. This \nbill would prohibit the United States from entering into any agreement \nthat would prevent the full implementation of the United Nations \nmoratorium on high seas driftnet fishing.\n  In 1989, at the urging of Members of this body, the United States \nintroduced the resolution at the United Nations which established a \nglobal moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing. In 1991 the \nPresident signed into law strong legislation to enforce that \nmoratorium.\n  While still not fully complied with in all the world's oceans, the \nmoratorium has been effective in the North Pacific. The Coast Guard has \nworked closely with other Federal agencies to detect and pursue fishing \nvessels that try to violate the moratorium in the North Pacific and the \nBering Sea. We need to bring that same cooperation to the aid of \nfisheries that need protection in other areas of the world. This bill \nwould help do that.\n  As a result of the efforts by the United States and other concerned \nnations to prevent the use of large-scale driftnet fishing on the high \nseas and to limit fishing on other shared stocks in areas like the \ncentral Bering Sea and the South Pacific, the nations of the world have \nrecently adopted ``an agreement to promote compliance with \ninternational conservation and management measures by fishing vessels \non the high seas'', and are discussing a draft agreement on the \nconservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly \nmigratory fish stocks. Both of these agreements should help further \nadvance efforts to protect and rebuild the world's fish stocks and \nother living marine resources.\n  There is concern that some nations might try to use the straddling \nstocks negotiations as a means to undo the United Nations moratorium on \nlarge-scale driftnet fishing. This bill simply makes it clear that the \nUnited States will not support or endorse any effort to prevent the \nfull implementation of the United Nations moratorium on large-scale \ndriftnet fishing. Nor will we be part of any effort to undermine its \neffectiveness. Under this bill the United States cannot sign any \nagreement that would have that effect.\n  As this is the last day of the 103d Congress we will not have a \nchance to pass this bill this year. But I want to put the world on \nnotice that our commitment to halting large-scale driftnet fishing has \nnot weakened, and I look forward to reintroducing this bill early in \nthe 104th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n          STATEMENTS OF INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mr. Bryan and Mr. McCain):\n\tS. 2567. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the exemption for commercial aviation from the transportation fuels tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the commercial aviation fuel tax exemption extension act\n\tMr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation on behalf of myself, Senator Bryan, and Senator McCain to extend the current tax exemption on commercial aviation fuel which is due to expire on October 1, 1995.\n\tOver the past 4 years, U.S. airlines have lost over $12 billion. During that time they have either canceled or deferred orders and options for more than 1,000 aircraft. As a result, 125,000 aircraft manufacturing jobs have been eliminated. Each aircraft order that is canceled translates into job losses of approximately 250 airline employees and almost 5,000 manufacturing employees.\n\tIf the 4.3-cents-per-gallon tax goes into effect on October 1, 1995, it will cost the airlines more than $527 million annually. It will only escalate employee layoffs, aircraft order cancellations, and service cutbacks. Recognizing this, the chairman of President Clinton's own National Airline Commission has written to the President to urge that the exemption be extended.\n\tMr. President, I recognize that this is the last day of the 103d Congress, and that this legislation will not be enacted prior to adjournment. Nonetheless, I am introducing this bill to underscore the importance of this issue and to serve notice that I will reintroduce it at the beginning of the 104th Congress.\n\tMr. President, a majority of Senators have already indicated their support for an extension of the jet fuel tax waiver. I ask unanimous consent that the following items be printed in full in the Record.\n\n       A copy of a letter to President Clinton signed by 56 \n     Senators.\n       Letters to the President from Senators Hollings, Faircloth, \n     and Helms and Congressmen Kyl, Inhofe, Santorum, Watt, Quinn, \n     McCurdy, and Byrne.\n       A letter to the President signed by the leadership of the \n     House Public Works Committee.\n       Letters from Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, Texas \n     Governor Ann Richards and Hawaii Governor Jim Waihee.\n       A list of organizations supporting extension of the waiver.\n       A letter to the President from the Transportation Trades \n     Department of the AFL-CIO.\n       A letter to the President from former Virginia Governor \n     Gerald Baliles, chairman of the National Airline Commission.\n       A list of airports that support extension of the waiver.\n\n\tMr. President, extension of the fuel tax exemption for the airlines is vitally important to the health of the entire aviation industry. This industry has suffered through four devastating years and is just now beginning to show signs of improvement. The airlines must be allowed to recover and cannot afford one more enormous tax increase.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1994.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In 1993, when Congress enacted the \n     Administration's $500 billion deficit reduction plan, an \n     overwhelming majority of Members of the United States Senate \n     believed that the 4.3 cent per gallon tax on transportation \n     fuels should not apply to the financially troubled airline \n     industry. While the Senate passed version of the bill \n     included a full five year exemption for the airline industry, \n     the compromise reached by the conference committee reduced \n     the exemption to two years. The exemption expires on October \n     1, 1995.\n       In the meantime, the airline industry continues to \n     struggle. Over the past four years, the industry's losses \n     have totaled a staggering $12.8 billion. Although there have \n     been some signs of recovery, the industry suffered $150 \n     million in losses in the first half of 1994. The possibility \n     of the fuel tax applying to the industry could not come at a \n     worse time. The industry is faced with massive fleet \n     replacement restrictions mandated by the government. It is \n     conservatively estimated that it would cost $7-$8 billion a \n     year for the industry to meet noise requirements, as well as \n     replace aging aircraft.\n       In its final report last year, the National Airline \n     Commission stated that to return the industry to \n     profitability, Congress must act to ``relieve the airline \n     industry of its unfair tax and user fee burden.'' In \n     addition, the Commission recognized that the airline industry \n     is already under an enormous tax burden. Adding an additional \n     tax at this point will cause even greater losses and layoffs, \n     and is not in the best interests of our nation's travel and \n     tourism industry.\n       Given the current state of the airline industry, and the \n     potential adverse impact of new taxes on the industry, we are \n     requesting that the Administration include in its FY 1996 \n     budget an extension of the tax exemption on domestic jet fuel \n     through September 30, 1998. Providing this exemption will \n     give this beleaguered industry a chance to resolve other \n     pressing financial issues and find firmer economic ground in \n     its attempt to compete in the global marketplace.\n           Sincerely,\n         Richard H.

I \n     want to let you know that I too support the need to extend \n     further the exemption. In 1993, in accordance with the \n     Administration's $500 billion deficit reduction plan, the \n     House and Senate both agreed that a two-year exemption of the \n     4.3 cents per gallon gasoline tax should apply to the \n     commercial airline industry due to its precarious economic \n     situation. The exemption expires on October 1, 1995, and I \n     believe it should be extended.\n       When you first took office, you visited Seattle and met \n     with the aircraft manufacturers and airline CEOs to stress \n     the importance of this industry to our economic recovery. \n     While the economic recovery of our nation continues, the \n     imposition of a fuel tax could have a harmful impact on the \n     airlines' chances for economic recovery. Over the last four \n     years the industry has lost more than $12.8 billion. The \n     airlines' ability to provide service, particularly to small \n     communities, is at risk and could be at greater risk should \n     the fuel tax apply to them. I urge you to support an \n     extension of the exemption until September 30, 1998, so that \n     the industry may continue to work on its economic problems.\n       With kindest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ernest F. Hollings,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 1994.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     Office of the President,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: In 1993 when Congress enacted the \n     Administration's $500 billion deficit reduction plan, an \n     overwhelming majority of Members of the United States Senate \n     believed that the 4.3 cent per gallon tax on transportation \n     fuels should not apply to the financially troubled airline \n     industry. As a result, a compromise was reached to defer the \n     implementation of the tax on the airline industry until \n     October 1, 1995.\n       As you recognized when you established the National Airline \n     Commission, the industry--which is critical to the economic \n     development of our country and to our balance of trade \n     payments--continues to struggle. Over the past four years, \n     the industry's losses have totaled a staggering $12.8 \n     billion. Although there have been some signs of recovery, the \n     industry suffered $150 million in losses in the first half of \n     1994.\n       The prospect of this jet fuel tax applying to this industry \n     effective in October of next year is alarming. If the tax had \n     been in effect this year, it would have added a new tax \n     burden of $527 million per year to the industry--clearly \n     worsening the industry's financial situation. As recognized \n     by your Commission, this industry is already under an \n     enormous tax burden. In addition to federal income taxes and \n     state taxes, the passenger and cargo excise taxes which are \n     equivalent to a 45.82 per gallon fuel tax. In addition, the \n     airlines indirectly pay or collect a 10% ticket tax and \n     numerous other fees. Overall, about 25% of the price of a \n     ticket goes to taxes.\n       The possibility of the fuel tax applying to this industry \n     could not come at a worse time. The industry is faced with \n     massive fleet replacement restrictions--mandated by the \n     government. it is conservatively estimated that it would cost \n     $7-$8 billion a year for the industry to meet noise \n     requirements, as well as replace existing aircraft.\n       In order to restructure itself and remain competitive, the \n     industry has let thousands of employees go because of \n     financial losses. Since 1992, over 20,000 employees have been \n     furloughed or terminated at our major airlines. At the same \n     time, the industry has deferred billions of dollars of \n     capital investment because of this bleak economic situation. \n     This deferral itself has meant that the industry will employ \n     tens of thousands fewer people this year than expected.\n       In its final report last year, the National Airline \n     Commission stated that to return the industry to \n     profitability, Congress must act to ``relieve the airline \n     industry of its unfair tax and user fee burden.'' The airline \n     industry and its 540,000 employees, joined by the aircraft \n     manufacturing industry, ask you to give serious attention to \n     your Commission's recommendation and continue the industry's \n     exemption from the 4.3 cent per gallon transportation fuel \n     tax beyond its October, 1995 expiration date. Otherwise, the \n     industry will be faced with the need to layoff additional \n     employees and continue to shrink. This is not in the interest \n     of our nation's travel and tourism industry which is so \n     critical to this country.\n       Given the state of the industry, we are requesting that the \n     Administration extend the tax exemption on domestic jet fuel \n     that expires on September 30, 1995 to September 30, 1998. \n     This would give this beleaguered industry a chance to resolve \n     other pressing financial issues and find firmer economic \n     ground in its attempt to compete in the global marketplace.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jesse Helms,\n     Lauch Faircloth,\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1994.\n     Hon. Bill Clinton,\n     President of the United States of America,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n     of 1993 included provisions to exempt the financially \n     troubled airline industry from the 4.3 cents per gallon tax \n     on transportation fuels for a period of two years. The \n     exemption expires on October 1, 1995.\n       As you know, the airline industry continues to struggle, \n     with industry losses over the last four years totalling more \n     than $12 billion. Although there have been some signs of \n     recovery; losses totalled $150 million in the first half of \n     1994 alone. Those continuing losses come at a time when the \n     industry is facing costly federal mandates to modify its \n     fleet, e.g. to meet noise requirements, and replace aging \n     aircraft--at a cost of between $7 billion and $8 billion. The \n     imposition of the fuel tax at the start of the next fiscal \n     year could not come at a worse time.\n       Given the state of the airline industry and the adverse \n     impact new taxes are likely to have on its ability to recover \n     and thrive, I urge you to include in your FY96 budget an \n     extension of the tax exemption on domestic jet fuel through \n     September 30, 1998.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Jon Kyl,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to express my concern \n     about the impending expiration of the transportation fuel tax \n     exemption.\n       In 1993, when Congress enacted the Administration's $500 \n     billion deficit reduction plan, it included a 4.3 cent-per-\n     gallon tax on transportation fuels. However, because of the \n     immense financial losses plaguing the airline industry, the \n     tax was deferred until 1993.\n       In the past four years, the industry's losses have exceeded \n     $12 billion, while more than 120,000 airline employees have \n     lost their jobs and 125,000 U.S. aircraft manufacturing jobs \n     have been eliminated.\n       Moreover, the industry is now facing government-mandated \n     fleet replacements to meet ``Stage 3'' aircraft noise \n     requirements at a cost of roughly $7-8 billion a year to the \n     industry for the foreseeable future.\n       In its final report last year, the National Airline \n     Commission recognized the industry must be relieved of its \n     ``unfair tax and user fee burden,'' and recommended \n     ``exempting airline fuel from any proposed transportation \n     fuel tax.'' We ask that you give serious attention to that \n     recommendation and continue the industry's exemption from the \n     jet fuels tax before it expires in 1995.\n       Providing the exemption will give the airline industry a \n     chance to regain its financial footing and remain competitive \n     in the international marketplace.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M. Inhofe,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 1, 1994.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing with regard to the October \n     1, 1995 expiration of the airline industry fuel tax \n     exemption.\n       The 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) imposed a \n     new 4.3 cents per gallon tax on transportation fuels. The \n     conference agreement for the OMRA '93 bill provided a short-\n     term exemption for gasoline and jet fuel used in commercial \n     aviation. That exemption is set to expire next year, however, \n     and the tax will become effective for commercial aviation on \n     October 1st. A floor stocks tax assessment is also scheduled \n     to become effective on that same date.\n       In preparing your budget recommendations for fiscal year \n     1996, I hope you would review the current airline industry \n     tax exemption and consider an extension of that exemption in \n     hopes of bolstering the industry's economic recovery. Over \n     the past four years, the airline industry as a whole has \n     suffered losses of $12.8 billion. Since 1990 in particular, \n     U.S. airlines have had workforce reductions of 120,000 and \n     have witnessed corresponding reductions of 125,000 employees \n     in the aircraft manufacturing sector due to cancellation or \n     deferment of approximately 1,000 aircraft orders and options.\n       Federal tax policies have contributed directly to the \n     industry's financial problems. Tax collection from the \n     industry over the past four years has resulted in cumulative \n     losses of $12 billion. As jet fuel remains the industry's \n     second largest operating cost for airlines, the pending \n     imposition of the new fuels tax carries a projected annual \n     cost to airlines of $527 million. As the industry struggles \n     to regain its financial footing, this new tax will be a \n     further setback and could exacerbate additional employee \n     layoffs, aircraft order cancellations, and service cutbacks.\n       I appreciate your time and consideration of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Rick Santorum,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 27, 1994.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to express my concern \n     about the scheduled imposition of the fuel tax on the airline \n     industry. This tax on commercial aviation jet fuel was \n     included as part of last year's budget deficit reduction \n     package and is scheduled to go into effect on October 1, \n     1995.\n       USAir, which is a major employer and has a hub at the \n     Charlotte Airport in my congressional district, has expressed \n     deep concern about the jet fuel tax. USAir is struggling \n     particularly hard to recover from the huge losses suffered by \n     the airline industry during the recession and from other \n     business adversities. The imposition of the fuel tax would \n     have a major, adverse effect on its ability to recover.\n       Because of the importance of USAir and the airline industry \n     to the economic health of my congressional district and the \n     Nation as a whole, I ask you to consider including a \n     deferment of the fuel tax for the industry in the \n     Administration's budget for FY 1996. Deferring the tax until \n     the industry is better able to sustain it will greatly assist \n     in the industry's recovery and will contribute to the \n     improving economic health and employment picture of the \n     Nation.\n       Thank you for you attention to this request. I look forward \n     to continuing to work with you on important issues in the \n     balance of this Congress and next year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Melvin L.

Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to you regarding a tax \n     imposed on transportation fuels, which was part of your \n     budget reconciliation plan enacted last year. This additional \n     tax on transportation fuels of 4.3 cents-per-gallon was \n     imposed with a two-year deferment, in the hopes that by 1995 \n     the airline industry would be in better financial standing \n     and consequently able to handle the additional tax burden.\n       Unfortunately, as I am sure you are aware, the financial \n     situation of the airline industry has only gotten worse. \n     Financial losses, along with the loss of some 60,000 airline \n     jobs and an already-imposed ticket tax of 10% make the \n     airlines unable to handle any further tax burdens. Moreover, \n     the size of the airline industry makes its financial \n     viability essential to our country's economic recovery. For \n     these reasons, I urge you to consider a continued deferment \n     of this fuel tax. I ask that this deferment be imposed \n     indefinitely so that the airline industry can once again gain \n     firm financial standing.\n       I'm sure you would agree that the airline industry greatly \n     contributes to the economic stability of our country. If I \n     can assist you further regarding this matter, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me.\n       Thank you very much for your consideration of this issue.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                       Jack Quinn,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1994.\n     Hon.

William J. Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to raise my concerns about \n     the 4.3 cents-per-gallon gasoline tax that passed last year \n     but was deferred for the airline industry until October 1, \n     1995. With the airline industry continuing to experience \n     financial losses, I ask that you continue your strong \n     commitment to strengthening the airline industry by deferring \n     the imposition of this tax in your budget proposals until the \n     airline industry is in better financial shape.\n       This issue is of particular concern to my constituents \n     because of the economic stimulus that one particular carrier, \n     USAir, has in Virginia. USAir is Virginia's largest air \n     carrier employing over 4,947 people and pumping over $2 \n     billion into the Virginia economy annually. Their economic \n     viability is intricately linked to the economic health and \n     well-being of many of my constituents, with their payroll \n     exceeding $12,545,924 in the 11th Congressional District.\n       As you know, when the 4.3 cents-per-gallon tax passed in \n     August, 1993, as part of the deficit reduction plan, it was \n     deferred for the airline industry until October 1, 1995, with \n     the hope that the industry would be out of the financial \n     woods at that time. A 10% ticket tax was imposed specifically \n     in lieu of a fuel tax, which means that the industry is \n     already contributing $5.129 billion toward deficit reduction.\n       Recent reports indicate that the industry continues to \n     experience financial woes. Imposing the gas tax on top of the \n     10% ticket tax at this sensitive time could jeopardize the \n     health and viability of the airline industry and threaten our \n     nation's economic recovery. Therefore, I ask that you \n     continue to defer this tax in your budget proposals until the \n     airline industry is in better financial shape.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this matter and your \n     commitment to strengthening the airline industry. I look \n     forward to continuing to work with you on issues affecting \n     the health of the airline industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Leslie L.

A continued \n     exemption is justified as a matter of fairness to the airline \n     industry which is already paying more than its share of \n     special taxes. The extended exemption will also enable the \n     industry to continue its recovery from recent catastrophic \n     financial losses, which have undermined the industries' \n     ability to compete in the global marketplace.\n       The airline industry is already subject to an overwhelming \n     array of special taxes. Federal taxes imposed exclusively, or \n     primarily, on the airlines include a 10% excise tax on \n     airline tickets, a 6.25% excise tax on cargo shipments, a $6 \n     per passenger international departure tax, special taxes to \n     support customs, immigration, and agricultural inspection \n     services, and a $3 passenger facilitation charge at many \n     major airports. These taxes impose costs of $6.7 billion a \n     year on an industry with total revenues of $64 billion a \n     year.\n       The heavy taxes have been an important factor in the \n     industry's cumulative losses, which exceeded $12 billion over \n     the past four years. If the industry is profitable in 1994, \n     profits are not expected to exceed $1 billion.\n       The industry's poor financial results have to led the \n     elimination of 125, 000 high paying jobs. The impacts have \n     extended beyond the airlines and into this country's most \n     successful export business--aircraft manufacturing. Since \n     1990, U.S. airlines have canceled or deferred orders and \n     options for more than 1,000 new aircraft.\n       In recognition of the airlines' financial difficulties and \n     high tax burden, the 1993 deficit reduction package exempted \n     airlines from the new 4.3 cents per gallon tax on jet fuel \n     for two years. Since the condition of the airline industry \n     has not changed significantly, the exemption should be \n     continued. The industry is in no position to pay the \n     additional $527 million a year which this tax would cost. The \n     elastic demand for air travel prevents airlines from raising \n     their fares to cover these added costs. The price sensitive \n     market means any increase in air fares is likely to be offset \n     by a decline in passengers. An additional $527 million tax \n     burden would wipe out much of the industry's estimated profit \n     for 1995, further exacerbating the industry's tenuous \n     financial position.\n       Mr. President, as your Administration prepares its fiscal \n     year 1996 budget, we respectfully ask that this budget \n     include an extension of the exemption of airlines from the \n     commercial aviation fuel tax, through September 30, 1998. \n     This action would forcefully demonstrate your \n     Administration's strong commitment to the vital travel and \n     tourism sector of our nation's economy.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Bud Shuster,\n       Ranking Republican, Committee on Public Works \n     Transportation.\n     William F. Clinger, Jr,\n       Ranking Republican, Subcommittee on Aviation.\n     Norman Y. Mineta,\n       Chair, and Committee on Public Works and Transportation.\n     James L.

William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On October 1, 1995, the airline \n     industry's exemption from the 4.3 cents per gallon \n     transportation fuels tax will expire. Unfortunately with that \n     date fast approaching, the U.S. airlines are far from being \n     able to absorb an additional $527 million annually. Still \n     recovering from four years of staggering losses totaling over \n     $12 billion and with $150 million loss during the fist half \n     of this year, any new tax could not come at a more fragile \n     time for the industry.\n       As your National Airline Commission indicated in its report \n     last year, the airlines are already under heavy tax burden. \n     In addition to the federal and state taxes paid by all \n     businesses, the airlines pay over $5.4 billion annually in \n     passenger and cargo excise taxes--the equivalent of a 45.8 \n     cents per gallon fuel tax. Now at a time when the industry \n     also faces fleet replacement costs conservatively estimated \n     at $7 to $8 billion a year to comply with mandated quiet-\n     technology requirements, the prospect of a new tax is \n     especially devastating.\n       As a former governor, you understand that a healthy U.S. \n     airline industry is critical to the vitality of a state's \n     economy, especially in the way it serves as a catalyst for \n     our booming travel and tourism sector.\n       On behalf of the state of Arkansas, I respectfully request \n     that your administration's FY 1996 budget include an \n     extension of the tax exemption on commercial aviation fuel \n     through September 30, 1998.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jim Guy Tucker.\n                                  ____\n\n    \n    \n                                                   State of Texas,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                     Austin, TX, October 25, 1994.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On October 1, 1995, the airline \n     industry's exemption from the 4.3 cents per gallon \n     transportation fuels tax will expire. Unfortunately, with \n     that date fast approaching, the U.S. airlines are far from \n     being able to absorb an additional $527 million annually. \n     Still recovering from four years of staggering losses \n     totaling over $12 billion and with $150 million loss during \n     the fist half of this year, any new tax could not come at a \n     more fragile time for the industry.\n       As your National Airline Commission indicated in its report \n     last year, the airlines are already under a heavy tax burden. \n     In addition to the federal and state taxes paid by all \n     businesses, the airlines pay over $5.4 billion annually in \n     passenger and cargo excise taxes--the equivalent of a 45.8 \n     cents per gallon fuel tax. Now, at a time when the industry \n     also faces fleet replacement costs conservatively estimated \n     at $7 to $8 billion a year to comply with mandated quiet-\n     technology requirements, the prospect of a new tax is \n     especially devastating.\n       As a former governor, you understand that a healthy U.S. \n     airline industry is critical to the vitality of a state's \n     economy, especially in the way it serves as a catalyst for \n     our booming travel and tourism sector. Because the airlines \n     have such a large direct impact on the Texas economy--\n     boarding over 48 million passengers annually and employing \n     over 61,000 in this state--it is crucial that government does \n     all it can to assist the industry in its recovery.\n       On behalf of the state of Texas, I respectfully request \n     that your administration's FY 1996 budget include an \n     extension of the tax exemption on commercial aviation fuel \n     through September 30, 1998.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ann W. Richards,\n                                                         Governor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Executive Chambers,\n\n                                   Honolulu, HI, November 2, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I urge you to include in your Fiscal \n     Year 1996 budget a two-year extension of the tax exemption \n     presently authorized on commercial aviation fuel. In my view, \n     the airlines are still struggling to become consistently \n     profitable and need assistance in reducing their tax burden.\n       The State of Hawaii has provided financial support for \n     airlines serving the State through a subsidy to reduce \n     airport fees and charges. The special fund of the State \n     airport program will provide the subsidy through the 1997 \n     fiscal year. Funds came from cash reserves generated by \n     airport concessions and were intended for airport improvement \n     projects.\n       With Hawaii's dependence on reliable, regular air service \n     to support our tourism industry and for intra- and inter-\n     state transportation for our citizens, we feel it is urgent \n     that our nation's airline industry be assisted until it \n     becomes financially stable. Extending the fuel tax exemption \n     will provide some of the relief they need.\n       Your favorable consideration of our request is appreciated.\n       With kindest regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      John Waihee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    December 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: For two reasons, next year will be an \n     extremely important one for the travel and tourism industry: \n     Your Administration will highlight the significance of our \n     industry to our nation's economy by hosting the White House \n     Conference on Travel and Tourism. Unfortunately, next year \n     will also be the year in which the backbone of our industry, \n     the U.S. airline industry, will lose its exemption from the \n     4.3 cents per gallon tax on transportation fuels. As your \n     Administration works to develop its budget for the coming \n     fiscal year, we respectfully ask that you extend the current \n     exemption on commercial aviation fuel.\n       As you are probably aware, the U.S. airline industry has \n     lost a staggering $12.8 billion since 1990. More devastating, \n     however, has been the decimation of airline, aircraft \n     manufacturing and travel and tourism jobs. During this same \n     period, nearly 120,000 U.S. airline employees and 125,000 \n     U.S. aircraft manufacturing employees have lost their jobs. \n     While the industry has recently shown small signs of \n     recovery, U.S. airlines collectively suffered $150 million in \n     losses during the first half of 1994. Sadly, on October 1, \n     1995, the airline industry's exemption from the \n     transportation fuels tax will expire. At current consumption \n     levels, this new 4.3 cents per gallon tax will amount to an \n     additional $527 million annual burden on this industry. \n     Almost certainly, this new tax will wipe out any profit the \n     industry had hoped to make in 1995, and further exacerbate \n     the industry's already tenuous financial position. Because \n     the airlines have such a large impact on our economy--\n     transporting nearly 500 million passengers each year--they \n     are a major catalyst for the entire U.S. travel and tourism \n     industry, as well as the economy as a whole. Whether the fuel \n     tax results in higher fares or more service cutbacks, the \n     repercussions will be felt throughout our industry by hotel, \n     restaurant, rental car, and all other travel industry \n     employees.\n       In its final report to Congress and your Administration \n     last year, the National Airline Commission stated that, to \n     return the industry to profitability, Congress must act to \n     ``relieve the airline industry of its unfair tax and user fee \n     burden.'' The Commission clearly recognized that the U.S. \n     airline industry is already under an enormous tax burden. In \n     addition to the federal and state taxes paid by all \n     businesses, the airline industry is currently paying over \n     $5.4 billion annually in passenger and cargo excise taxes--\n     the equivalent of a 45.8 cents per gallon fuel tax. Airlines \n     indirectly pay or collect a 10 percent ticket tax, a $6.00 \n     International Departure Tax, a $6.50 Customs User Fee, a \n     $6.00 Immigration User Fee and a $1.45 Agriculture Inspection \n     Fee.\n       Mr. President, as your Administration prepares its Fiscal \n     Year 1996 budget, we respectfully ask that this budget \n     include an extension of the tax exemption on commercial \n     aviation fuel. With the White House Conference on Travel and \n     Tourism already underway, this one action would forcefully \n     demonstrate your Administration's strong commitment to this \n     vital sector of our nation's economy.\n           Sincerely,\n       Aerospace Industries Association, Air Freight Association \n     of America, Air Midwest, Inc., Air Wisconsin Airlines \n     Corporation, African-American Travel and Tourism Association, \n     Alamo Rent-A-Car, Allegheny Commuter Airlines, Inc.\n       Allied Tours, AlliedSignal, Inc., American Express Company, \n     American Hotel and Motel Association, American Recreation \n     Coalition, American Society of Travel Agents, Arizona \n     Airways, Inc.\n       Association of Retail Travel Agents, Atlantic Southeast \n     Airlines, Inc., Bemidji Aviation Services, Inc., The \n     BFGoodrich Company, The Boeing Company, Greater Boston \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, Business Express, Inc., \n     California Chamber of Commerce, California Travel Industry \n     Association, Cascadia Airlines.\n       Chautauqua Airlines, Inc., Chicago Convention and Tourism \n     Bureau, Citicorp Diners Club, Cleveland Growth Association, \n     Colorado Association of Commerce and Industry, Colorado Hotel \n     and Lodging Association, Colorado Ski Country USA, Comair, \n     Inc., CommutAir, Conquest Airlines Corporation.\n       Continental Express, Inc., CUC Travel Services, Inc., \n     Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau, Denver Metro \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical \n     University, Empire Airlines, Executive Airlines, Inc., \n     Fairmont Hotels.\n       Flagship Airlines, Inc., FloridaGulf Airlines, General \n     Electric Company, Georgia Hospitality and Travel Association, \n     GP-Express Airlines, Inc., Gray Line Air.\n       Great Lakes Aviation, Ltd., Gulfstream International \n     Airlines, Inc., Greater Hartford Tourism District, The Hertz \n     Corporation, Hilton Hotels & Resorts, Hilton International, \n     Holiday Inn, Honeywell, Inc., Horizon Air Industries, Inc., \n     Hospitality Sales and Marketing Association International.\n       Greater Houston Partnership, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, \n     Hyatt Regency Denver, Inter-continental Hotels, International \n     Airline Passengers Association, International Association of \n     Convention and Visitor Bureaus, Jetstream International \n     Airlines, Inc., Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, \n     Liberty Express Airlines, Lone Star Airlines.\n       Louisiana Travel Promotion Association, McDonnell Douglas \n     Corporation, Meeting Professionals International, Mesa \n     Airlines, Inc., Mesaba Aviation, Inc., Greater Miami \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, Michigan Hotel, Motel and \n     Resort Association, Greater Minneapolis Convention and \n     Visitors Bureau, Nantucket Airlines/Cape Air.\n       National Air Carrier Association, National Association of \n     RV Parks and Campgrounds, National Council of Area and \n     Regional Tourism Organizations, National Park Hospitality \n     Association, National Restaurant Association, New York State \n     Hospitality and Tourism Association, Pacific Air.\n       Paradise Island Airlines, Inc., Passenger Vessel \n     Association, Piedmont Airlines, Inc., Greater Pittsburgh \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, Greater Raleigh Convention \n     and Visitors Bureau, Recreational Vehicle Industry \n     Association, Red Lion Hotels & Inns, Regional Airline \n     Association.\n       Rockwell Collins Commercial Avionics, Sandals Resorts, San \n     Francisco Convention & Visitors Bureau, SkyWay Airlines, \n     SkyWest Airlines, Inc., Society of Travel Agents in \n     Government, Trans States Airlines, Inc., Trans World Express, \n     Inc.\n       Travel Council of North Carolina, Travel Industry \n     Association of America, Travel and Tourism Government Affairs \n     Council, United States Tour Operators Association, United \n     Technologies Corporation, Washington Airports Task Force, \n     Wings Airways, Wings West Airlines, Inc., Wyndham Hotels and \n     Resorts.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Transportation Trades\n\n\n                                                   Department,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, Nov. 3, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Since 1990, the U.S. airlines have lost \n     a combined total of more than $12.8 billion. While the \n     financial suffering has been substantial, what is clearly \n     most distressing is the toll these loses have had on the \n     industry's employees. In the preceding four years, nearly \n     120,000 U.S. airline employees and 125,000 U.S. aircraft \n     manufacturing employees have lost their jobs.\n       During this same period, employees of nearly every U.S. \n     airline have sacrificed pay and/or benefits annually \n     totalling in the billions of dollars. Unfortunately, while \n     employees have contributed their fair share to help bring \n     this industry back to sustained profitability, next year the \n     government will impose a new commercial aviation fuel tax \n     which will almost certainly result in additional airline \n     employee layoffs. As representatives of the vast majority of \n     these employees whose jobs have already been lost, we ask \n     that, as your Administration works to develop its budget for \n     the coming fiscal year, you not jeopardize the concessions \n     made by labor and extend the current exemption on commercial \n     aviation fuel through September, 1998.\n       In its final report to Congress and your Administration \n     last year, the National Airline Commission stated that, to \n     return the industry to profitability, Congress must act to \n     ``relieve the airline industry of its unfair tax and user fee \n     burden.'' The Commission clearly recognized that U.S. \n     airlines are already under an enormous tax burden, and \n     currently pay taxes and fees totalling the equivalent of a \n     45.8 cents per gallon fuel tax. Although the industry has \n     recently begun to show modest signs of financial improvement, \n     U.S. airlines collectively suffered losses of $150 million \n     during the first half of 1994. When the industry's exemption \n     from the transportation fuels tax expires on October 1, 1995, \n     this new 4.3 cents per gallon tax will amount to an \n     additional $527 million annual burden on this industry--a \n     burden our employees simply cannot bear.\n       Mr. President, airline industry employees are some of the \n     most highly-trained, productive and efficient employees of \n     any U.S. industry. We ask that you not jeopardize the fragile \n     economic environment under which our employees work, and \n     extend the current tax exemption on commercial aviation fuel \n     through September, 1998.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. Randolph Babbitt,\n       President, Air Line Pilots Association.\n     Dee Maki,\n       Association of Flight Attendants.\n     William Scheri,\n       General Vice President, International Association of \n     Machinists and Aerospace Workers.\n     Ron Carey,\n       President, International Brotherhood of Teamsters.\n     Barry Krasner,\n       National President, National Air Traffic Controllers, \n     Association/MEBA.\n     Sonny Hall,\n       International President, Transport Workers Union of \n     America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            Hunton & Williams,\n\n                                       Richmond, VA Oct. 18, 1994.\n     The President,\n     The White House\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Among the bright spots on today's \n     economic landscape is the improved performance of the U.S. \n     airline industry. While problems such as high debt levels \n     ensure continued uncertainty, the fact remains that the \n     trends have been moving in the right direction over the past \n     year.\n       As the administration begins to focus on the legislative \n     agenda for the new Congress, you will hear a great deal of \n     discussion about the issue of fuel taxes on the commercial \n     airline industry. As you might remember, the National Airline \n     Commission addressed this issue in its report.\n       The Commission recommended that no new tax on commercial \n     airline fuel be imposed.\n       In the commentary since the Commisison's report, our tax \n     recommendations have been characterized as special ``tax \n     relief.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. I would \n     like to share with you the Commission's thinking on the fuel \n     tax, and then conclude with a general comment on our overall \n     approach to tax issues.\n       The commercial airline industry has never been subjected to \n     a federal fuel tax. Unlike road improvements which are funded \n     through a fuel tax, aviation infrastructure improvements are \n     funded through the airline and cargo ticket tax. Thus, the \n     source of revenue for those purposes already exists.\n       The Commission could see no good public policy reason for \n     changing the tax treatment of airline fuel, one of the \n     industry's two highest cost items. In fact, one could hardly \n     call our recommendation ``tax relief'' since we were not \n     recommending the reduction of a tax, but that a new tax not \n     be imposed.\n       As Chairman of the Commission, I hope you will support \n     efforts to extend permanently the two-year exemption from the \n     4.3 cent fuel tax contained in the 1993 budget legislation.\n       Allow me to conclude with a few general comments about the \n     Commission's tax recommendations.\n       The National Airline Commission examined the entire range \n     of tax laws affecting the airline industry, as required by \n     our enabling legislation. The industry, and others, had many \n     ideas for our consideration. In some cases we took action, in \n     others we did not. In those areas in which we did make \n     recommendations, we believed there were important public \n     policy reasons to do so, such as the recommendation that \n     there be no new fuel tax.\n       Our recommendations had nothing to do with ``tax relief'' \n     for the industry. We rejected several ideas that would have \n     injected more cash into the industry, and advanced only those \n     we believed made sense in a critical, high tech, industry \n     struggling to compete in the 1990's. If tax relief for its \n     own sake was our goal, we would have focused in other areas. \n     Our only goal was to help make sense of the tax treatment of \n     this industry.\n       I have been disappointed that some have sought to portray \n     the Commission's recommendation as some sort of special \n     interest pleading. I wanted you to have a clear sense of our \n     thinking. I would be happy to discuss this issue with you at \n     any time.\n       With kindest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Gerald L. Baliles.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Airports That Support Extension of the Waiver\n\n       The following is a list of airports that have agreed to \n     either sign on the ATA airports letter or send its own letter \n     to the President:\n       AUS--Austin.\n       BUR--Burbank.\n       CLE--Cleveland.\n       CMH--Ohio.\n       DCA--Wash.

In fact, the aviation \n     industry is in no position to bear the burden of financing \n     irrelevant federal programs. It is equally important that \n     airports and airlines together press for increased funding \n     levels in the AIP programs. The money is already there and \n     needs to be appropriated for desperately needed airport \n     infrastructure.\n       As I see it, these are issues on which we both can and \n     should stand side by side as a unified voice urging the \n     Administration and Congress to not kill the goose that lays \n     the golden egg-Air Transportation.\n       Let me know when and how you want to proceed with sending \n     the letter to the President.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                  Thomas E.

A bill to enhance the management of public lands, reduce Federal expenditures associated with such lands, and empower States with respect to the ownership and control over lands that are or have been part of the public domain, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n            the public land emancipation and management act\n\tMr. WALLOP. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Public Land Emancipation and Management Improvement Act [PLEA] which, when enacted, will greatly limit the ponderous Federal influence on the West.\n\tIn the West today, we are faced with an administration that is reaching unprecedented levels of government intervention into every aspect of each of our lives using the terms ``environmentalism'' and ``fair market value'' as spears which they chuck at every perceived public resource management problem.\n\tIncreasingly, the role of Federal Government has become one of ``ruling'' the people rather than one of ``serving'' he people. They are the masters; we have become their servants.\n\tI do not often agree with the Clinton administration, nor its spokespersons, but no one has expressed the problem in a more articulate manner than the former Western Governor, and now, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt.\n\tMr. President, listen to excerpts from a speech he gave while Governor at an National Governors Association meeting in Denver.\n\tHe said,\n\n       I share the concerns of my fellow governors. My sense of \n     alarm is perhaps a little more extreme. A lot of observers in \n     this country feel that, taken on a historic scale, the states \n     are obsolete, they are headed the way of the passenger pigeon \n     and the Edsel. Even the optimist, I think, would say the \n     states at best are in dire danger of becoming simply \n     administrative agents of Washington * * * it didn't begin \n     that way.\n\n\tHe goes on to say,\n\n     the proper role between states and the Federal Government * * \n     * was the centerpiece * * * of the most brilliant debate in \n     the history of western institutions.\n       * * * That debate * * * has gone neglected. The result is a \n     federal system * * * in total disarray.\n       * * * The United States Congress has lost all sense of \n     restraint. It no longer asks the question that Hamilton, \n     Madison and Jefferson considered to be the central question * \n     * * Is this an appropriate function for the Federal system?\n       * * * Hamilton and Jefferson would certainly ask * * * how \n     have we allowed their creation--a carefully layered \n     construction of federal, state and local responsibilities, to \n     become scrambled into one great undifferentiated, amorphous \n     omelet by a cook in Washington?\n\n\tMr. President, those words were spoken by a Federal chef who has become so supreme at his craft as to make Julia Childs look like a fry-cook.\n\tFourteen years have passed since Bruce Babbitt spoke those words in the last year of the Carter administration--another Democratic administration that had an ill-conceived agenda for the West. Today, the current administration's concept of the ``New West'' has rapidly degenerated to a ``war on the West.'' Government officials have been transformed from environmental problem solvers to environmental storm troopers with the power to punish, to prohibit, and to take. Virtually all Federal agencies are making decisions on the use of land and resources in unquestioning response to an ill-conceived environmental agenda which ignores the human side of the equation and disregards the concept of private property rights. Worse still, it ignores Governor Babbitt's concern that the Federal Government has lost all sense of restraint and the concepts of Jefferson and Madison.\n\tIn a 1994 speech to the Sierra Club's Annual Dinner, Secretary Babbitt said:\n\n       We need a new western land ethic for non-wilderness. The \n     old concept of multiple use no longer fits the reality of the \n     new West. It must be a concept of public use. From this day \n     on, we must recognize the new reality that the highest and \n     best, most productive use, of western land will usually be \n     for public purposes--watershed, wildlife and recreation.\n\n\tTypically, he made no distinction in this speech between public and private land. Unlike his views in 1980 as a Western Governor, he now feels that the Federal Government should be omnipotent.\n\tThe Clinton administration's agenda is clear, and only the users of the public lands will become endangered in their war on the West. Citizens have been threatened with rules and regulations denying access to guns, rock collecting, and recreation.\n\tIn order to pay for increased control by big government, we see repeated proposals to increase fees. Hunters, outfitters, radio broadcast users, commercial air tour operators, ski area operators, concessioners, and any other use that requires a Federal permit are being asked to shoulder a bigger burden. Not all of these permit holders will be able to afford to stay in business after paying the new fees on top of existing expenses. In addition, many who have traditionally enjoyed a cooperative partnership with the Federal Government--including counties and municipalities--are now being asked to help pay the costs for more Federal control. Further, they are asked to cede back water rights, mineral rights and respass rights for renewals of their permits. How ironic. How very contrary to the Clinton campaign rhetoric.\n\tThe current furor over grazing fees is not a Federal deficit issue, as portrayed by the administration and the media. It is, in fact, a personal economic issue for thousands of rural, western families. If implemented, this range reform will result in seriously reduced revenues ironically to the Federal Government, but more importantly to States and counties which will suffer from rules and regulations that no one they know ever voted on.\n\tRecently, the Secretary was forced by the courts to issue patents on a Nevada gold mine. He had the nerve to characterize this as a steal and give-away of land and minerals. It made for good press to the uninformed. But the Secretary failed to state that the Barrick Goldstrike Mines in Nevada have developed over 1,700 jobs that did not exist before. It means millions of dollars in tax revenue to counties, States, and yes, the Federal Government. The Secretary failed to mention the billion dollars the company spent on developing technologies to extract the mineral. That is $1 billion that did not exist in the American economy before this mine was planned. He also forgot to mention that the land was worth nothing, to the Federal Government, until after the private sector had developed the technology to recover the minerals.\n\tWashington does not know how to mine anything. It never will know how to mine minerals and Congress won't ever pay for a billion dollars' worth of experimental technology. You know it and I know it. The wealth and the jobs that have been created from these lands for America has been realized by the private sector's willingness to commit capital and technology to a plan it had no way of knowing was going to be successful.\n\tThe battle in the war on the West, if won by this administration will only serve to send the private mining sector to foreign countries. The governments in those lands will not prohibit investors from achieving success, boosting their economy, and employing their people. Nor will they protect the environment.\n\tMr. President, as an example of the arrogance of which I speak, let me also remind you that during the grazing debates, we were told by the then director of the BLM ``that if Congress refuses to act, we will do it administratively.'' That, Mr. President, is arrogance, and this administration may never understand that laws in this country are not made by residentially appointed bureaucrats, but by the Congress. When the administration says to hell with them they are saying to hell with us. The hell with America's citizens of the West.\n\tMr. President, more recently, Interior Secretary Babbitt seriously missed the point in claiming that a Federal judge's recent decision to take the gnatcatcher off the Endangered Species list was just the result of a procedural error.\n\tAny observer can see that Judge Stanley Sporkin's detailed analysis of this case of administrative arrogance on the part of the administration is almost a road map to some of the most serious shortcomings of the Endangered Species Act. It highlights the abuses that Babbitt has tolerated in his eagerness to show that he can make the Endangered Species Act work. How different from the Babbitt of 1980. How sad that this man does not view his job as Secretary of Interior, but still the advocate of the League of Conservative Voters.\n\tEven more troubling is Babbitt's apparent willingness to defy the courts. The Secretary says if Judge Sporkin doesn't immediately reinstate protections for the gnatcatcher while the Government appeals his ruling, he'll do it himself by declaring an emergency and invoke the emergency listing procedures in the law so the Secretary of the Interior can just ignore the courts.\n\tMr. President, allow me to mention the subject of ecosystem management. What the Clinton team apparently likes about this ecosystem approach is its sheer vagueness. If we don't understand what ``ecosystem health'' is we won't be aware when that policy fails. Since most of us wouldn't recognize an ecosystem boundary if we fell on it, there's no limit to the amount of real estate the agencies can claim they need to ``protect the ecosystem.'' All in the name of the new West.\n\tThis administration is trying to close down roads and rights-of-way which are vital to the transportation, safety, law enforcement, and general access of Western States.\n\tMr. President, it is time to take the war on the West seriously.\n\tThe Federal Government currently owns more than half of all the land in the 12 Western States. Unfortunately, recent actions taken by the Clinton administration have made it clear that the Federal Government is managing these lands for the benefit of specific political interest groups with little regard for the legitimate interests of Western citizens and businesses. As a result, citizens of Western States have little or no control over vast areas of land that were contemplated as a source of their livelihood at the time of their statehood.\n\tThe radical ``new West'' reforms proposed by Secretary Babbitt and others are designed primarily to limit or prevent commercial and even some recreational uses of many federally managed lands. Where such uses are allowed, land users face a daunting maze of Federal regulations, redtape and increased fees and arrogance.\n\tThere is little hope on the horizon as storm clouds grow.\n\tProposed revisions to timber, mining, and grazing policies coupled with aggressive application of environmental laws such as the Endangered Species and Clean Water acts have only served to promote economic uncertainty, with no resolution in sight. New initiatives to revise western water law, hydropower projects, fish and wildlife programs, and hunting regulations are just beginning to surface. The assault on the West is real. There is a strong feeling in many Western States that these policies should not be decided inside the beltway by people who have no constituent interest or control. The Federal Government has become too powerful, too prescriptive, too pervasive, and too arrogant.\n\tAfter personally witnessing Washington's increasing indifference--and even hostility--toward the interests in the West, I believe there is a simple, fair, and straightforward solution to these problems that can be accomplished by transferring the ownership of much of this land from the Federal Government to the States.\n\tThis legislation, when enacted, will approach but not provide equity among the States. The playing field will never be completely level, but this will help ensure that Western States have a chance to continue to be a vital and productive part of this Nation, just as their eastern counterparts have always been able to do. Other than Louisiana, no State east of the 100th meridian has more than 14 percent of the lands within its boundary tied up by the Federal Government.\n\tUnder this bill, at a State's behest, the Federal Government would be prevented from owning more than 20 percent of the land area of any State, excluding Indian lands. In those States where the Federal ownership currently is higher than 20 percent, the President would be required to select up to 20 percent of the land in the State that would remain under Federal ownership. The remainder would be transferred to the State unless the Governor determines that some portion of it should remain under Federal ownership and control.\n\tRecognizing the special nature of our national parks, these lands would automatically be included within the 20 percent and would therefore perpetually remain under Federal ownership. However, other Western lands owned by the Federal Government would be turned over to the States, where locally elected officials would be immediately accountable to the citizens who have proven to be wise stwards for over a century.\n\tThere will be those opposed to this proposal, some hunting and fishing groups will at first panic citing their access as a major problem. Yet when they think about the behavior and objectives of this administration, I believe they will come to embrace its purpose. The rules and regulations that were recently pulled back by the Forest Service regarding firearms and law enforcement coupled with Forest Service Chief Thomas's idea to impose a $100 Federal hunting license to kill one elk because the elk once lived on a National Forest give some insight to the fact there is an active movement to eliminate hunting, guns, and other recreation on public lands.\n\n       Without fanfare, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has \n     decided that stocking trout and bass fish is a politically \n     incorrect ecological evil. It plans to prohibit this activity \n     on State and private, as well as Federal, lands.\n\n\tI am quoting from an Austin Chase article in the Washington Times, Mr. President, and I ask unanimous consent that the article be included in the Record.\n\tAdditionally, today there is legislation, advanced by the administration, working its way through Congress which would eliminate any multiple use activity on a wildlife refuge, if a bureaucrat declares it incompatible. And do not forget this is the administration that pushed through the Brady bill and assault weapons ban ostensibly to fight the war on crime but in reality the first ominous steps toward gun control.\n\tOthers may fear that the States will only dispose of the previously Federal lands for profit. Mr. President, let me tell you what just happened in my own State with regard to that issue. There was a recent effort by the State land board to dispose of certain State trust lands. However, the citizens of Wyoming rose up and literally stopped the venture in its tracks. It is my view that I trust citizens of a State to be responsible, to care, and to better be able to effect policy at the level of State and local government than are the unaffected Members of Congress and the anonymous bureaucracy in Washington.\n\tI firmly believe that the States will manage these lands better and in a more cost-effective manner than the bloated bureaucracy. For example, the Federal Government spends $60 million to collect $400 million in mineral royalties in Wyoming while the State achieves the same result at a much lower cost. The identical cost saving rational can easily be applied to other land management programs currently conducted by the Federal Government.\n\tOur fight is for the West. We need first to reestablish multiple-use and the rights of Westerners and second we need to establish fairness and equity among the States by returning their land to them.\n\tThe West constitutes some of the best of America--the best in America, let us see that it is not the last of the best.\n\tI urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I now ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2568\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, That this Act may be referred to as the ``Public \n     Land Emancipation and Management Improvement Act''.\n       Sec. 2. Effective on January 1, 1998, all right, title, and \n     interest in and to any real property owned by the United \n     States that is or has been at any time part of the public \n     domain, including, but not limited to, lands that have been \n     withdrawn or disposed of and reacquired, is vested by \n     operation of law in the State in which such property is \n     located subject only to the limitations set forth in section \n     3 of this Act and any valid existing rights.\n       Sec. 3. For the purposes of this Act, the definition of \n     real property shall exclude:\n       (a) any lands or interests therein owned by the United \n     States as of January 1, 1998 within the exterior boundaries \n     of any unit of the National Park System;\n       (b) any lands or interests therein which the United States \n     holds title to in trust for the benefit of a federally \n     recognized Indian Tribe, a member thereof, or an individual \n     allottee;\n       (c) such lands as the President shall have identified for \n     continued federal retention, except that the total of all \n     lands and interests therein identified pursuant to this \n     subsection, when combined with any other lands or interests \n     therein owned by the United States, excluding only lands \n     included under subsections (b) or (d) of this section, may \n     not exceed twenty percent of the total acreage within any \n     given State; and\n       (d) any lands or interests therein which the Governor of \n     the State in which such lands are located does not wish to \n     have transferred pursuant to this Act and which the Governor \n     has identified in writing to the President prior to January \n     1, 1998 as not subject to transfer.\n       Sec. 4. Not later than January 1, 1997, the President shall \n     prepare a comprehensive inventory of all real property owned \n     by the Federal Government within each of the several States \n     and transmit such list to the Governor of each State and \n     shall accompany such list with an identification of all real \n     property which meets requirements of subsections 3 (a) or (b) \n     or which have been identified for continued Federal retention \n     under subsection 3(c).\n       Sec. 5. In the event that the identification of real \n     property under section 3(c) exceeds 20 percent of the total \n     acreage within a State, the Governor of the State may bring \n     an action to modify the list of lands in any Federal district \n     court within such State. Review shall be limited solely to \n     whether the acreage exceeds 20 percent of the total acreage \n     within the State. If the court concludes that the acreage \n     contained in the listing prepared pursuant to subsection 3(c) \n     does exceed 20 percent, then the court shall exclude such \n     acreage as is necessary to reduce the total to no more than \n     20 percent. The acreage to be excluded shall be based solely \n     on a priority list furnished by the Governor. The list shall \n     be final and shall not be subject to any review or \n     modification.\n       Sec. 6. For the purpose of this Act, the term ``State'' \n     shall include the several States of the Union, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa, and the Virgin \n     Islands.\n       Sec. 7. The Federal Government shall remain strictly liable \n     for the cost of any clean-up associated with hazardous \n     materials or contamination associated with any lands \n     transferred pursuant to this Act.\n                                 ______\n\n      By Mr. STEVENS (for himself and Mr. Murkowski):\n\tS. 2569. A bill to prohibit the United States from entering into any international agreement which would prevent full implementation of the United Nations moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n        THE HIGH SEAS DRIFTNET FISHING MORATORIUM PROTECTION ACT\n\tMr. STEVENS. Mr. President, once again I come before this body to introduce legislation to help protect our fishery resources. This bill would prohibit the United States from entering into any agreement that would prevent the full implementation of the United Nations moratorium on high seas driftnet fishing.\n\tIn 1989, at the urging of Members of this body, the United States introduced the resolution at the United Nations which established a global moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing. In 1991 the President signed into law strong legislation to enforce that moratorium.\n\tWhile still not fully complied with in all the world's oceans, the moratorium has been effective in the North Pacific. The Coast Guard has worked closely with other Federal agencies to detect and pursue fishing vessels that try to violate the moratorium in the North Pacific and the Bering Sea. We need to bring that same cooperation to the aid of fisheries that need protection in other areas of the world. This bill would help do that.\n\tAs a result of the efforts by the United States and other concerned nations to prevent the use of large-scale driftnet fishing on the high seas and to limit fishing on other shared stocks in areas like the central Bering Sea and the South Pacific, the nations of the world have recently adopted ``an agreement to promote compliance with international conservation and management measures by fishing vessels on the high seas'', and are discussing a draft agreement on the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks. Both of these agreements should help further advance efforts to protect and rebuild the world's fish stocks and other living marine resources.\n\tThere is concern that some nations might try to use the straddling stocks negotiations as a means to undo the United Nations moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing. This bill simply makes it clear that the United States will not support or endorse any effort to prevent the full implementation of the United Nations moratorium on large-scale driftnet fishing. Nor will we be part of any effort to undermine its effectiveness. Under this bill the United States cannot sign any agreement that would have that effect.\n\tAs this is the last day of the 103d Congress we will not have a chance to pass this bill this year. But I want to put the world on notice that our commitment to halting large-scale driftnet fishing has not weakened, and I look forward to reintroducing this bill early in the 104th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Slade Gorton", "Malcolm Wallop", "Ted Stevens"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

Mr. President, I want to apprise Senators of the \nstatus of the regulation of animal fats and vegetable oils under the \nOil Pollution Act of 1990. This law, known as OPA 90, was enacted in \nresponse to catastrophic petroleum oil spills such as the Exxon Valdez \nincident, to improve the response to, and minimize the impact of those \nspills. However, due to the broad statutory definition of ``oil,'' OPA \n90 has been applied not only to toxic oils, for example, petroleum oil, \nbut also to nontoxic agricultural products such as animal fats and \nvegetable oils. As a result, these nontoxic substances used to make \nfoodstuffs and other consumer products are unfortunately swept up in \nthe same broad definition as petroleum and other toxic oils.\n  Lacking clear congressional direction on differentiation, \nimplementing agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency and \nthe Coast Guard, are issuing rules that regulate animal fats and \nvegetable oils in much the same way as toxic oils, while ignoring the \nunique nontoxic nature of these agricultural products. Although these \nagencies have classified them in a nonpetroleum oil category under the \nvarious interim and final rules for spill response, there are a long \nlist of toxic oils in this same nonpetroleum category.\n  Senator Harkin and I, along with others, introduced and supported \nlegislation to insure that both of these objectives are accomplished. \nThe underlying principles of OPA 90 would remain unchanged with the \nlanguage to require differentiating animal fats and vegetable oils from \nother oils. The House passed a nearly identical measure twice as part \nof H.R. 4422 and H.R. 4852. The Senate passed the bill as S. 2559.\n\n  Although final legislation could not be completed in the time \nremaining in this Congress, I want to assure all Senators that I will \nbe working to clarify this unintended consequence of the Oil Pollution \nAct when we reconvene in the 104th Congress. This issue should be a \npriority as we examine more closely the unnecessary and costly \nregulatory burdens placed on U.S. business that do not add any \nadditional measure of protection to the environment or the health and \nsafety of our citizens.\n  The scientific data collected to date indicate that the animal fats \nand vegetable oils industry has an excellent spill history for these \nproducts justifying differentiation of these materials from toxic oils. \nSpecifically, these products account for less than one-half of 1 \npercent of all oilspills in the United States, which are mostly less \nthan 1,000 gallons each. In making these remarks, I want to be clear \nthat the animal fats and vegetable oils industry is not seeking to be \nexempt from oilspill response requirements, but is merely seeking two \nsimple objectives.\n  First, the industry seeks a separate category for vegetable oils. \nThis is as much for scientific differences in the oils as it is for \neconomic reasons. There is no reason why nontoxic vegetable oils must \nbe in the same category as toxic oils.\n  Second, the industry seeks response requirements that recognize the \ndifferent characteristics of animal fats and vegetable oils within this \nseparate category. A separate category without separate response \nrequirements is nothing more than a hollow gesture. There is more \nflexibility available under the National Contingency Plan to respond in \nthe case of a spill of nontoxic animal fats and vegetable oils than \nthere is for toxic oils like petroleum. These agencies should more \nfully and clearly spell out the additional appropriate options \navailable under the NCP in the regulations themselves so that no doubt \nexists as to the availability of these options.\n  Now, all spills involving oils of any kind are unfortunate and may \nhave some similar environmental impacts. However, the response to all \nspills does not have to be the same. Nontoxic animal fats and vegetable \noils by their very nature do not have the same total environmental \nimpact as a toxic oil, and it makes sense that the response plan need \nnot be identical. Vegetable oils, after all, are the same products used \nin most households every day, the same products each of us consumes in \nthe normal course of living.\n  So I hope that agencies will exercise common sense and promulgate \nrules that reflect these differences. To insure that this is the case, \nI will pursue legislation to require differentiation for animal fats \nand vegetable oils under OPA 90 in the 104th Congress, and hope my \ncolleagues will join me in that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n\n\n              REGULATION OF ANIMAL FATS AND VEGETABLE OILS\n\tMr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues a report from the General Accounting Office, written at \nthe request of myself and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, \nSenator Lieberman.\n  For a number of years, I have been deeply concerned over the state of \nour economy and the standard of living of American working men and \nwomen. The last two decades have not been kind to American workers, who \nhave seen their wages stagnate at the same time they have seen their \njob security disappear.\n  To overcome our economic stagnation, I have long advocated a coherent \nplan of concerted action by business, labor and government, working \ntogether in a team America approach. I believe we have made strides in \ncrafting such a partnership to address the deep root structural \nproblems facing our economy. For example, the Partnership for a New \nGeneration Vehicle, also know as the ``Clean Car'' initiative, holds \ngreat promise. This partnership between the government and the auto \nindustry is dedicated to ensuring that the American industry remains a \nleader in innovation, economic growth and job creation. other \ninitiatives of the Clinton administration, such as Secretary Reich's \nproposals to overhaul and strengthen our worker training and retraining \nsystem, are all steps in the right direction.\n  Yet, the Federal Government still lacks a coherent strategy for \nassisting American business in dealing with structural change in the \neconomy. As the GAO report points out, there are at least 24 Federal \nprograms to provide managerial and technical assistance to business. \nHowever, there is no office that tracks or coordinates these programs.\n  Many of these programs fulfill complimentary needs, and should not \nsimply be eliminated in a mindless rush to cut programs. For example, \nThe Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers provide marketing, cost \naccounting, human resources management and business strategy \nassistance. The Manufacturing Technology Centers specialize in the \ndeployment of modern manufacturing technology. The Small Business \nDevelopment Centers typically specialize in assistance to firms in the \nretail and services sector, not manufacturing firms. Likewise, the \nMinority Business Development Centers exist to serve a specialized \nneed.\n  All of these programs are compliments to one another, not \nreplacements for each other. Eliminating any one of them would tear a \nlarge hole out of this business assistance network. However, they do \nneed to be coordinated if they are to be as effective as they should \nbe.\n  A similar situation faced us a few years ago in the area of export \npromotion. Again, a GAO report identified numerous export promotion \nprograms with no coordination among them. At hearing of the Banking \nCommittee where we had all of the heads of these agencies appear as \nwitnesses, my colleague Senator Sarbanes asked a simple question--\n``have you ever met before.'' The answer was astonishing--that was \ntheir first meeting. Not only did they not coordinate programs, they \ndidn't even know each other.\n  That hearing lead us to pass legislation creating the Trade Promotion \nCoordinating Committee [TPCC]. The TPCC is made up of the head of 19 \nagencies and departments involved in export promotion, including the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisors [CEA] and the Office of \nManagement and Budget [OMB]. Chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ron \nBrown, the TPCC has made tremendous progress in raising the level of \neffectiveness of our export promotion activities.\n  The TPCC show what can be done to improve Government effectiveness in \nthe delivery of importance assistance to business. It is my hope that \nthe 104th Congress will build on the example of the TPCC and other \ninitiative to bring coherence to all our business assistance \nprograms.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to echo the sentiments of \nthe distinguished gentleman from Michigan. He has been a leader in the \neffort to address the structural problems facing our economy and I \ncommend him for all his work. We will certainly miss him in the years \nahead.\n  It has been said that in order to manage a problem you have to be \nable to measure that problem. This study is a variation on that theme. \nIn order to figure out how to coordinate among the various Federal \nprograms that provide management and technical assistance, we need to \nknow how many of these programs exist and where they exist. This report \ngives us that information.\n  With this information in hand, I hope that we can work toward \ncoordinating these programs in the next Congress as a way to raise the \nlevel of effectiveness of these business assistance programs.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the summary and appendix of this GAO report \nwhich outlines the various Federal program that provide management and \ntechnical assistance to U.S. businesses, be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                        General Accounting Office,\n\n\n                                  General Government Division,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1994.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Donald W. Riegle,  Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n       As you requested, this fact sheet provides information on \n     federal government programs that give management and \n     technical assistance to business. As agreed with you, we have \n     attempted to (1) identify as many federal government programs \n     that provide management and or technical assistance to \n     business as possible, within the limited time constraints of \n     this assignment; (2) provide a brief description of these \n     programs and identify the target customers that these \n     programs were designed to serve; and (3) report the current \n     funding levels for these programs.\n\n\n                            Results in Brief\n\n       We found no particular federal office that tracks or \n     coordinates all the various management and technical \n     assistance programs at the different government agencies. We \n     identified 24 federally sponsored government programs that \n     primarily provide management and technical assistance to \n     business. They are listed in the appendix. These programs \n     offer a variety of services to business, including assistance \n     in areas such as accounting; developing business plans; \n     proposal and bid preparation; marketing; worker training; and \n     assistance in implementing improved manufacturing technology.\n       The Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department \n     of Commerce (DOC) had the largest number of management and \n     technical assistance programs that we identified for fiscal \n     year 1994. Other programs were in the Departments of Defense, \n     Energy, Labor (DOL), Transportation, and the Treasury. In \n     addition, government agencies that have procurement authority \n     generally have an Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business \n     Utilization (OSDBU) that, in conjunction with SBA, is \n     designed to assist in the development of small businesses \n     owned and controlled by socially and economically \n     disadvantaged individuals. OSDBUS primarily focus on helping \n     companies procure contracts with the federal government \n     through various outreach efforts including conferences, \n     procurement fairs, and business strategy sessions.\n       The majority of the programs that we identified were \n     targeted to small business.\n       Proposed fiscal year 1994 funding levels for the programs \n     varied widely, ranging from a high of $71 million for SBA's \n     Small Business Development Centers to a low of $1.5 million \n     for DOL's Micro-enterprise Grant Program.\n\n\n                         Scope and Methodology\n\n       To determine which government agencies had management and \n     technical assistance programs, we interviewed officials at \n     SBA and at DOC's Economic Development Administration and its \n     Minority Business Development Agency. These particular \n     agencies were identified in the request that we conduct this \n     review. In order to identify additional programs, we also \n     searched government publications, such as the Federal \n     Register and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.\n       We obtained documentation describing these programs from \n     respective program officials, notifications in the Federal \n     Register, and prior GAO studies.\n       When possible, we obtained proposed fiscal year 1994 \n     program funding levels from the federal budget; however, \n     because not all programs were explicitly identified in the \n     federal budget, we also consulted program officials for this \n     information.\n       We did our work between July 1994 and September 1994 in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n       We are providing copies of this fact sheet to the agencies \n     we identified in the appendix that have programs and to \n     interested congressional committees. We will also make copies \n     available to others upon request.\n       Please contact me on (202) 512-4812 if you have any \n     questions concerning this fact sheet.

Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of my colleagues a report from the General Accounting Office, written at the request of myself and the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman.\n\tFor a number of years, I have been deeply concerned over the state of our economy and the standard of living of American working men and women. The last two decades have not been kind to American workers, who have seen their wages stagnate at the same time they have seen their job security disappear.\n\tTo overcome our economic stagnation, I have long advocated a coherent plan of concerted action by business, labor and government, working together in a team America approach. I believe we have made strides in crafting such a partnership to address the deep root structural problems facing our economy. For example, the Partnership for a New Generation Vehicle, also know as the ``Clean Car'' initiative, holds great promise. This partnership between the government and the auto industry is dedicated to ensuring that the American industry remains a leader in innovation, economic growth and job creation. other initiatives of the Clinton administration, such as Secretary Reich's proposals to overhaul and strengthen our worker training and retraining system, are all steps in the right direction.\n\tYet, the Federal Government still lacks a coherent strategy for assisting American business in dealing with structural change in the economy. As the GAO report points out, there are at least 24 Federal programs to provide managerial and technical assistance to business. However, there is no office that tracks or coordinates these programs.\n\tMany of these programs fulfill complimentary needs, and should not simply be eliminated in a mindless rush to cut programs. For example, The Trade Adjustment Assistance Centers provide marketing, cost accounting, human resources management and business strategy assistance. The Manufacturing Technology Centers specialize in the deployment of modern manufacturing technology. The Small Business Development Centers typically specialize in assistance to firms in the retail and services sector, not manufacturing firms. Likewise, the Minority Business Development Centers exist to serve a specialized need.\n\tAll of these programs are compliments to one another, not replacements for each other. Eliminating any one of them would tear a large hole out of this business assistance network. However, they do need to be coordinated if they are to be as effective as they should be.\n\tA similar situation faced us a few years ago in the area of export promotion. Again, a GAO report identified numerous export promotion programs with no coordination among them. At hearing of the Banking Committee where we had all of the heads of these agencies appear as witnesses, my colleague Senator Sarbanes asked a simple question--``have you ever met before.'' The answer was astonishing--that was their first meeting. Not only did they not coordinate programs, they didn't even know each other.\n\tThat hearing lead us to pass legislation creating the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee [TPCC]. The TPCC is made up of the head of 19 agencies and departments involved in export promotion, including the President's Council of Economic Advisors [CEA] and the Office of Management and Budget [OMB]. Chaired by Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, the TPCC has made tremendous progress in raising the level of effectiveness of our export promotion activities.\n\tThe TPCC show what can be done to improve Government effectiveness in the delivery of importance assistance to business. It is my hope that the 104th Congress will build on the example of the TPCC and other initiative to bring coherence to all our business assistance programs.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to echo the sentiments of the distinguished gentleman from Michigan. He has been a leader in the effort to address the structural problems facing our economy and I commend him for all his work. We will certainly miss him in the years ahead.\n\tIt has been said that in order to manage a problem you have to be able to measure that problem. This study is a variation on that theme. In order to figure out how to coordinate among the various Federal programs that provide management and technical assistance, we need to know how many of these programs exist and where they exist. This report gives us that information.\n\tWith this information in hand, I hope that we can work toward coordinating these programs in the next Congress as a way to raise the level of effectiveness of these business assistance programs.\n\tMr. President, I ask that the summary and appendix of this GAO report which outlines the various Federal program that provide management and technical assistance to U.S. businesses, be printed in the Record following my statement.\n\tThe material follows:\n\n                                        General Accounting Office,\n\n\n                                  General Government Division,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1994.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Donald W. Riegle,  Jr.,\n     U.S. Senate,\n       As you requested, this fact sheet provides information on \n     federal government programs that give management and \n     technical assistance to business. As agreed with you, we have \n     attempted to (1) identify as many federal government programs \n     that provide management and or technical assistance to \n     business as possible, within the limited time constraints of \n     this assignment; (2) provide a brief description of these \n     programs and identify the target customers that these \n     programs were designed to serve; and (3) report the current \n     funding levels for these programs.\n\n\n                            Results in Brief\n\n       We found no particular federal office that tracks or \n     coordinates all the various management and technical \n     assistance programs at the different government agencies. We \n     identified 24 federally sponsored government programs that \n     primarily provide management and technical assistance to \n     business. They are listed in the appendix. These programs \n     offer a variety of services to business, including assistance \n     in areas such as accounting; developing business plans; \n     proposal and bid preparation; marketing; worker training; and \n     assistance in implementing improved manufacturing technology.\n       The Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department \n     of Commerce (DOC) had the largest number of management and \n     technical assistance programs that we identified for fiscal \n     year 1994. Other programs were in the Departments of Defense, \n     Energy, Labor (DOL), Transportation, and the Treasury. In \n     addition, government agencies that have procurement authority \n     generally have an Office of Small and Disadvantaged Business \n     Utilization (OSDBU) that, in conjunction with SBA, is \n     designed to assist in the development of small businesses \n     owned and controlled by socially and economically \n     disadvantaged individuals. OSDBUS primarily focus on helping \n     companies procure contracts with the federal government \n     through various outreach efforts including conferences, \n     procurement fairs, and business strategy sessions.\n       The majority of the programs that we identified were \n     targeted to small business.\n       Proposed fiscal year 1994 funding levels for the programs \n     varied widely, ranging from a high of $71 million for SBA's \n     Small Business Development Centers to a low of $1.5 million \n     for DOL's Micro-enterprise Grant Program.\n\n\n                         Scope and Methodology\n\n       To determine which government agencies had management and \n     technical assistance programs, we interviewed officials at \n     SBA and at DOC's Economic Development Administration and its \n     Minority Business Development Agency. These particular \n     agencies were identified in the request that we conduct this \n     review. In order to identify additional programs, we also \n     searched government publications, such as the Federal \n     Register and the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance.\n       We obtained documentation describing these programs from \n     respective program officials, notifications in the Federal \n     Register, and prior GAO studies.\n       When possible, we obtained proposed fiscal year 1994 \n     program funding levels from the federal budget; however, \n     because not all programs were explicitly identified in the \n     federal budget, we also consulted program officials for this \n     information.\n       We did our work between July 1994 and September 1994 in \n     accordance with generally accepted government auditing \n     standards.\n       We are providing copies of this fact sheet to the agencies \n     we identified in the appendix that have programs and to \n     interested congressional committees. We will also make copies \n     available to others upon request.\n       Please contact me on (202) 512-4812 if you have any \n     questions concerning this fact sheet.

EGAN OF BRIDGEPORT, CT\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. a short while ago, the Most \nReverend Edward M. Egan, bishop of Bridgeport, was asked to deliver the \nhomily at the Red Mass at St. Matthew's Cathedral here in Washington. \nThe Red Mass is held every October on the Sunday before the Supreme \nCourt convenes to ask for God's blessing for the judiciary and Congress \nas well.\n  Bishop Egan has provided wonderful leadership in his time in \nConnecticut in so many different ways. I am proud to consider him a \nfriend. His homily to the leaders of our legal system, including the \nAttorney General and the members of the Supreme Court, was on the \ntimely problem of political correctness. Whether my colleagues agree or \ndisagree with all of Bishop Egan's words and examples, I know they will \nfind his homily to be eloquent and thought-provoking. It is in that \nspirit that I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n  The homily follows:\n\n      Homily of the Most Reverend Edward M. Egan, October 2, 1994\n\n       Your Excellency, Archbishop Cacciavillan, Reverend Clergy, \n     Members of the John Carroll Society, Distinguished \n     Representatives of the Bench and Bar, and Friends All:\n       This past summer, in Canton in the South of China, I sat in \n     a hotel restaurant with a Chinese tour-guide who spoke \n     English quite well. He had brought a busload of tourists to a \n     store that sold porcelain and silk; and once they were safely \n     inside, he invited me to join him for a cup of tea.\n       He was forty-five years of age, he told me. In his youth he \n     had dreamed of mastering the English language and French as \n     well. However, in the second year of his university studies, \n     the so-called Cultural Revolution had intervened.\n       His eyes flashed as he described that decade of madness in \n     China. He and dozens of his fellow students had been forced \n     to watch two of their professors killed in a public square by \n     a government-inspired mob. He had stood at attention for \n     hours on several occasions as thousands of books from the \n     university library were destroyed in bonfires. And in due \n     course, he had been taken to the West of China to labor for \n     three years on collective farms, his whereabouts unknown \n     to family and friends.\n       ``What,'' I asked him, ``were the leaders of the Cultural \n     Revolution hoping to achieve with all of this?''\n       ``They wanted the people to stop having unapproved \n     thoughts,'' he replied. ``They felt that the nation could \n     prosper only if all were thinking in the same way--their way, \n     the approved way.''\n       He winced a bit as he offered this explanation but was \n     clearly convinced that his analysis was correct. For he \n     repeated it word for word as he stared into his empty teacup: \n     ``They felt that the nation could prosper only if all were \n     thinking in the same way--their way, the approved way.''\n       You and I, my dear friends, are privileged to live in a \n     land in which the imposition of thought by government is \n     rejected out of hand. And in no small measure we have the \n     legal profession to thank for this blessing.\n       It was lawyers like Montesquieu and Montaigne who were \n     crucial in developing the basic political ideas of our free \n     society. Twenty-five of the fifty-six who signed the \n     Declaration of Independence, with its cry for justice and \n     equality, were practicing attorneys. Even more, the \n     fundamental charters of our nation, such as the Constitution \n     and the Bill of Rights, with their uncompromising commitments \n     to freedom of thought, were largely the work of legal experts \n     with names like Jefferson, Adams, Wilson, Jay, Wythe, and \n     Marshall.\n       Still, there are in our country today rumblings in many \n     quarters about thoughts that are approved and thoughts that \n     are not. Thus, the expression, ``politically correct,'' has \n     become a staple in our vocabularies. Indeed, over the past \n     year or two it has graduated to the level of a familiar \n     abbreviation. Few there are who do not know the meaning of \n     ``p.c.''\n       One is politically correct, we understand, when one agrees \n     with the ``important'' newspapers, the ``quoted'' professors, \n     the ``best'' commentators, the ``most influential'' \n     personalities. Nor can there be any doubt that this \n     understanding is operating with remarkable efficiency. From \n     Atlantic to Pacific, the vast majority of adult Americans are \n     able to identify with extraordinary case and accuracy those \n     ideas, positions, and thoughts which are today in our land \n     ``correct'' or, if you prefer, ``approved.''\n       The Readings from Sacred Scripture in our Mass this morning \n     remind us of two cases in point. The first of these \n     Readings, from the Book of Genesis, is among the most \n     familiar in all of Holy Writ. It speaks of the mind of the \n     Divinity as regards the basics of the human condition. The \n     male, we read, was from the time of creation not to be \n     left alone. Rather, he was to be joined by a companion, a \n     partner, a wife, so that together they might live out \n     their years, two in fact but one in heart and love. And \n     from that love was to result a miracle within the wife, a \n     miracle before which every generation since creation has \n     stood in awe.\n       In our time, however, the miracle has become as well a \n     source of controversy. Simply put, the matter under \n     discussion is this: May society stand idly by while a private \n     party puts a violent end to the miracle?\n       Those who have embraced the ``approved'' thinking, the \n     ``correct'' thinking, answer with a resounding ``yes.'' The \n     miracle, they allege, may be killed with impunity.\n       Others, however, dare to sing outside the chorus. Their \n     reasoning should not be difficult to understand. The being \n     within the mother, they note, gives strong indications of \n     being a human being, a person with an inalienable right to \n     live. Certainly, no one has ever been able to prove the \n     contrary. Hence, they conclude, society has no choice but to \n     fulfill its most fundamental duty as regards the being in \n     question. It must protect it against attack.\n       There is no hint of religion in any of this unapproved \n     thinking, through many religious people, for a multitude of \n     religious reasons, support it. There is no mention of \n     doctrine, dogma, sacred writings, or anything of the sort. At \n     issue are only matters which are properly and strictly \n     matters of the law: the meaning of personhood, the basic \n     rights of individuals, the power of legal presumptions, and \n     the most elementary and essential duties of society. These \n     and nothing more.\n       Still, there is a tactic abroad in our land to characterize \n     the unapproved thinking as exclusively religious and to \n     refuse to allow it a fair hearing on this score. The tactic \n     is clever, widespread, and effective. It should also be \n     frightening to all who cherish the free and honorable \n     exchange of ideas, positions, and thoughts--lawyers first and \n     foremost.\n       The Gospel Reading, too, calls to mind a controversy of our \n     time in which only certain thoughts appear to be approved.\n       The Lord, in the lovely account of Saint Luke, instructs \n     His closest followers not to keep children from Him. ``Let \n     them come to Me, do not hinder them,'' He says, ``for it is \n     to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs.''\n       Parents there are, to be sure, who would not be comfortable \n     with having their children, the miracles of their love, \n     accept such an invitation. And in this free land of ours \n     their point of view is properly and vigorously protected. But \n     other parents there are who firmly believe that the \n     invitation of the Lord is most worthy, parents who wish their \n     offspring to be educated according to the mind and will of \n     the One Whom they call their God.\n       The thought of this second group is, of course, unapproved; \n     and the tactic for dismissing it is well-known. All monies \n     that governments collect to support schools, it is announced, \n     must go only to those institutions in which every mention of \n     the Divinity is outlawed. For otherwise, the state would be \n     sustaining religion.\n       But when such a rule is implemented, the unapproved \n     thinkers protest, it is not irreligion being sustained? Why \n     erect a wall only between religion and the state? Why not \n     erect another no less high, between the state and irreligion? \n     Or more to the point: why not simply concede to all parents \n     equally the right to choose the schools of their children and \n     to share in the funds gathered by society to support them.\n       The plea is somehow ruled out of order. The ``important'' \n     newspapers, the ``quoted'' professors, the ``best'' \n     commentators, the ``most influential'' personalities have \n     spoken. It remains, it would seem, for lawyers to insist that \n     the unapproved point of view be heard and explored. For they \n     are uniquely positioned to do this as counselors, judges, \n     writers, thinkers, and legislators; and what is more: they \n     have a long and noble tradition in this land of respecting \n     and defending thought, even when it is ``unapproved.''\n       But the second Reading of our Mass this morning, from the \n     Epistle to the Hebrews, provides yet another reason for \n     lawyers to address the aforementioned issues of unapproved \n     thinking and any others that come to mind. That reason is, I \n     confess, plainly and exquisitely religious. It is simply \n     this: We are all children of the one Father in heaven; hence, \n     we have no choice but to listen to one another with \n     attention, concern, and love.\n       Many years ago I pastored a parish on the Southside of \n     Chicago. The community was African-American. In fact, one of \n     my parishioners often reminded me that I was very likely the \n     only white voter in the precinct.\n       My closest adviser was a retired army major who spent many \n     an evening chatting with me about life in the distressed \n     neighborhoods of the Windy City.\n       ``Father,'' he used to tell me, ``we are never going to be \n     the nation we should be as long as any of us are kept out of \n     the national conversation. We've got to find some powerful \n     folks to let us all in.''\n       This morning, thanks to the very kind invitation of the \n     Archbishop of Washington, James Cardinal Mickey, I have the \n     honor to speak to just such ``powerful folks.'' Over the past \n     thirty years, we as a nation have learned that the Black \n     community must be a respected participant in the ``national \n     conversation.'' We are every day becoming more aware that the \n     same is true of the Hispanic community. I pray that now is \n     the time for the religious community as well. And I pray too \n     that lawyers will lead the way in this regard, not only \n     because of their historic position as protectors of thought \n     and its free expression but also, and especially, because \n     they realize, indeed, embrace in faith, that we are all \n     children of one God, sisters and brothers who need--and have \n     a right--to be heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n       IN RECOGNITION OF BISHOP EDWARD M. EGAN OF BRIDGEPORT, CT\n\tMr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. a short while ago, the Most Reverend Edward M. Egan, bishop of Bridgeport, was asked to deliver the homily at the Red Mass at St. Matthew's Cathedral here in Washington. The Red Mass is held every October on the Sunday before the Supreme Court convenes to ask for God's blessing for the judiciary and Congress as well.\n\tBishop Egan has provided wonderful leadership in his time in Connecticut in so many different ways. I am proud to consider him a friend. His homily to the leaders of our legal system, including the Attorney General and the members of the Supreme Court, was on the timely problem of political correctness. Whether my colleagues agree or disagree with all of Bishop Egan's words and examples, I know they will find his homily to be eloquent and thought-provoking. It is in that spirit that I ask that it be printed in the Record.\n\tThe homily follows:\n\n      Homily of the Most Reverend Edward M. Egan, October 2, 1994\n\n       Your Excellency, Archbishop Cacciavillan, Reverend Clergy, \n     Members of the John Carroll Society, Distinguished \n     Representatives of the Bench and Bar, and Friends All:\n       This past summer, in Canton in the South of China, I sat in \n     a hotel restaurant with a Chinese tour-guide who spoke \n     English quite well. He had brought a busload of tourists to a \n     store that sold porcelain and silk; and once they were safely \n     inside, he invited me to join him for a cup of tea.\n       He was forty-five years of age, he told me. In his youth he \n     had dreamed of mastering the English language and French as \n     well. However, in the second year of his university studies, \n     the so-called Cultural Revolution had intervened.\n       His eyes flashed as he described that decade of madness in \n     China. He and dozens of his fellow students had been forced \n     to watch two of their professors killed in a public square by \n     a government-inspired mob. He had stood at attention for \n     hours on several occasions as thousands of books from the \n     university library were destroyed in bonfires. And in due \n     course, he had been taken to the West of China to labor for \n     three years on collective farms, his whereabouts unknown \n     to family and friends.\n       ``What,'' I asked him, ``were the leaders of the Cultural \n     Revolution hoping to achieve with all of this?''\n       ``They wanted the people to stop having unapproved \n     thoughts,'' he replied. ``They felt that the nation could \n     prosper only if all were thinking in the same way--their way, \n     the approved way.''\n       He winced a bit as he offered this explanation but was \n     clearly convinced that his analysis was correct. For he \n     repeated it word for word as he stared into his empty teacup: \n     ``They felt that the nation could prosper only if all were \n     thinking in the same way--their way, the approved way.''\n       You and I, my dear friends, are privileged to live in a \n     land in which the imposition of thought by government is \n     rejected out of hand. And in no small measure we have the \n     legal profession to thank for this blessing.\n       It was lawyers like Montesquieu and Montaigne who were \n     crucial in developing the basic political ideas of our free \n     society. Twenty-five of the fifty-six who signed the \n     Declaration of Independence, with its cry for justice and \n     equality, were practicing attorneys. Even more, the \n     fundamental charters of our nation, such as the Constitution \n     and the Bill of Rights, with their uncompromising commitments \n     to freedom of thought, were largely the work of legal experts \n     with names like Jefferson, Adams, Wilson, Jay, Wythe, and \n     Marshall.\n       Still, there are in our country today rumblings in many \n     quarters about thoughts that are approved and thoughts that \n     are not. Thus, the expression, ``politically correct,'' has \n     become a staple in our vocabularies. Indeed, over the past \n     year or two it has graduated to the level of a familiar \n     abbreviation. Few there are who do not know the meaning of \n     ``p.c.''\n       One is politically correct, we understand, when one agrees \n     with the ``important'' newspapers, the ``quoted'' professors, \n     the ``best'' commentators, the ``most influential'' \n     personalities. Nor can there be any doubt that this \n     understanding is operating with remarkable efficiency. From \n     Atlantic to Pacific, the vast majority of adult Americans are \n     able to identify with extraordinary case and accuracy those \n     ideas, positions, and thoughts which are today in our land \n     ``correct'' or, if you prefer, ``approved.''\n       The Readings from Sacred Scripture in our Mass this morning \n     remind us of two cases in point. The first of these \n     Readings, from the Book of Genesis, is among the most \n     familiar in all of Holy Writ. It speaks of the mind of the \n     Divinity as regards the basics of the human condition. The \n     male, we read, was from the time of creation not to be \n     left alone. Rather, he was to be joined by a companion, a \n     partner, a wife, so that together they might live out \n     their years, two in fact but one in heart and love. And \n     from that love was to result a miracle within the wife, a \n     miracle before which every generation since creation has \n     stood in awe.\n       In our time, however, the miracle has become as well a \n     source of controversy. Simply put, the matter under \n     discussion is this: May society stand idly by while a private \n     party puts a violent end to the miracle?\n       Those who have embraced the ``approved'' thinking, the \n     ``correct'' thinking, answer with a resounding ``yes.'' The \n     miracle, they allege, may be killed with impunity.\n       Others, however, dare to sing outside the chorus. Their \n     reasoning should not be difficult to understand. The being \n     within the mother, they note, gives strong indications of \n     being a human being, a person with an inalienable right to \n     live. Certainly, no one has ever been able to prove the \n     contrary. Hence, they conclude, society has no choice but to \n     fulfill its most fundamental duty as regards the being in \n     question. It must protect it against attack.\n       There is no hint of religion in any of this unapproved \n     thinking, through many religious people, for a multitude of \n     religious reasons, support it. There is no mention of \n     doctrine, dogma, sacred writings, or anything of the sort. At \n     issue are only matters which are properly and strictly \n     matters of the law: the meaning of personhood, the basic \n     rights of individuals, the power of legal presumptions, and \n     the most elementary and essential duties of society. These \n     and nothing more.\n       Still, there is a tactic abroad in our land to characterize \n     the unapproved thinking as exclusively religious and to \n     refuse to allow it a fair hearing on this score. The tactic \n     is clever, widespread, and effective. It should also be \n     frightening to all who cherish the free and honorable \n     exchange of ideas, positions, and thoughts--lawyers first and \n     foremost.\n       The Gospel Reading, too, calls to mind a controversy of our \n     time in which only certain thoughts appear to be approved.\n       The Lord, in the lovely account of Saint Luke, instructs \n     His closest followers not to keep children from Him. ``Let \n     them come to Me, do not hinder them,'' He says, ``for it is \n     to such as these that the kingdom of God belongs.''\n       Parents there are, to be sure, who would not be comfortable \n     with having their children, the miracles of their love, \n     accept such an invitation. And in this free land of ours \n     their point of view is properly and vigorously protected. But \n     other parents there are who firmly believe that the \n     invitation of the Lord is most worthy, parents who wish their \n     offspring to be educated according to the mind and will of \n     the One Whom they call their God.\n       The thought of this second group is, of course, unapproved; \n     and the tactic for dismissing it is well-known. All monies \n     that governments collect to support schools, it is announced, \n     must go only to those institutions in which every mention of \n     the Divinity is outlawed. For otherwise, the state would be \n     sustaining religion.\n       But when such a rule is implemented, the unapproved \n     thinkers protest, it is not irreligion being sustained? Why \n     erect a wall only between religion and the state? Why not \n     erect another no less high, between the state and irreligion? \n     Or more to the point: why not simply concede to all parents \n     equally the right to choose the schools of their children and \n     to share in the funds gathered by society to support them.\n       The plea is somehow ruled out of order. The ``important'' \n     newspapers, the ``quoted'' professors, the ``best'' \n     commentators, the ``most influential'' personalities have \n     spoken. It remains, it would seem, for lawyers to insist that \n     the unapproved point of view be heard and explored. For they \n     are uniquely positioned to do this as counselors, judges, \n     writers, thinkers, and legislators; and what is more: they \n     have a long and noble tradition in this land of respecting \n     and defending thought, even when it is ``unapproved.''\n       But the second Reading of our Mass this morning, from the \n     Epistle to the Hebrews, provides yet another reason for \n     lawyers to address the aforementioned issues of unapproved \n     thinking and any others that come to mind. That reason is, I \n     confess, plainly and exquisitely religious. It is simply \n     this: We are all children of the one Father in heaven; hence, \n     we have no choice but to listen to one another with \n     attention, concern, and love.\n       Many years ago I pastored a parish on the Southside of \n     Chicago.

Mr. President, Vermont may be one of the last \nStates in the Union to host the Grateful Dead, but we may have spawned \ntheir eventual successor--Phish.\n  The band Phish began 10 years ago with a live debut at Nectar's, a \nmodest tavern in downtown Burlington, VT. Trey Anastasio, the lead \nguitarist and songwriter, remembers playing to a crowd of two on their \nsecond week.\n  In 1991, 7 years later, Phish produced its first album with a major \nrecord label and paid tribute to their Vermont roots. The album, ``A \nPicture of Nectar'', has sold a quarter of a million copies.\n  When Phish came through this area most recently they broke the \nPatriot Center's all-time attendance record, selling 10,356 seats. They \nhave toured through Europe and filled venues coast to coast for several \nyears. This fall they sold out Madison Square Garden in 4 hours. Their \nstar is on the rise.\n  Phish's music spans many genres--from classically inspired pieces--to \nhillbilly country--to slick jazz--to hard rock. Add two trampolines, a \nvacuum cleaner, a first rate light show and you have a live performance \nthat is hard to forget.\n  A lot of good things come out of Vermont--Phish is one that seems \npoised to play a prominent role in the American musical scene. Do not \nexpect hit singles from these talented Vermonters, but expect the \ngrassroots of the Phish movement to grow thick.\n  Mr. President, I want to congratulate Trey Anastasio, Mike Gordon, \nJon Fishman and Page O'Connell on their success. I look forward to \ntheir continued success. I ask that an article from the Washington Post \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n  The article follows:\n\n               The Hottest Band the World Has Never Heard\n\n                           (By Richard Leiby)\n\n       It all sort of came together in the little town of \n     Bethlehem, Pa. There I found a gentle, longhaired wanderer \n     named Nazzarine (``Nazz'' for short), who is among the many \n     followers of a group whose symbol is a fish. Generally I \n     don't consult Scripture, but that night after the concert I \n     did. The Gideon Bible on the hotel room dresser was already \n     open and turned to Psalm 31, which was written ``to the chief \n     musician.''\n       This I took to be a sign.\n       ``Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for \n     me: for thou art my strength,'' the psalmist wrote. ``Thou \n     has set my feet in a large room.''\n       Yes, rock-and-roll works in mysterious ways. Hear now the \n     tale of a band called Phish.\n       They've been together for 11 years, and touring the country \n     for seven, but most of America has never heard of Phish. The \n     Vermont-based quartet has never had a hit single or a gold \n     album. Radio deejays ignore them because their sound fits no \n     format; it's capable of roaming from dissonant classical to \n     mellow bluegrass, from screeching rock to syncopated funk, \n     sometimes in the same song. MTV shunned their one and only \n     video, from the latest album, ``Hoist.''\n       And yet: On Saturday, Oct. 8, the night after the Bethlehem \n     gig, Phish broke Patriot Center's all-time attendance record, \n     selling 10,356 tickets. That's more tickets than Jimmy \n     Buffett, who established the record in 1987; more than such \n     million-album-selling acts as the Spin Doctors, Kenny G, \n     Pearl Jam and Mary Chapin Carpenter, all of whom have played \n     Patriot Center in recent months.\n       Why? All Phish fans--be they suburban teeny-boppers or \n     erudite college students, grimy homeless hippies or married-\n     with-kids professionals--talk about the uplifting ``vibe'' of \n     the band's live performances, the inexplicable ``connection'' \n     they feel with the musicians, though they rarely address the \n     crowd. Some fans cite the spiritual charge they get from a \n     Phish concert, although the band itself espouses no religious \n     mission or message.\n       At best, the members of Phish offer awkward explanations \n     for their cultlike following. ``It's an intangible energy,'' \n     attempts Trey Anastasio, the shaggy red-haired guitarist. \n     ``This spiritual aspect,'' theorizes bassist Mike Gordon, \n     ``is that there's something universal that exists and can \n     come through the musicians and the music, if we're not \n     blocking. To put it all in words sounds kind of pretentious. \n     It sounds like a bunch of words, until it's actually an \n     experience.''\n       Phish frequently has been compared to the Grateful Dead, \n     another touring band blessed with a trailing caravan of \n     seekers. Jerry Garcia and Co., having been at it for more \n     than a quarter-century, draw far larger audiences--selling \n     some 1.5 million tickets compared with Phish's 650,000 this \n     year. But, says Dead researcher Rebecca Adams, ``Phish is the \n     heir apparent to the Dead. It's quite clear they are winning \n     the lottery.''\n       An academic cottage industry and an Internet debating \n     society have formed around both bands, allowing sages and \n     neophytes to proselytize, soothsay and trade revelations.\n       ``It's a spiritual phenomenon, not just entertainment,'' \n     argues professor Adams, a sociologist at the University of \n     North Carolina who's writing a book about Deadheads and \n     discerns connections to Phish's fans. ``But it's not a belief \n     in musicians as deities. It's a belief in the power of music \n     to create community.''\n       ``It is an experience unlike any other,'' insists Shira \n     Koch, Phish Head, Wesleyan Class of '98, by e-mail message. \n     ``For a few short hours or days, we can almost lose ourselves \n     in music, fun, youth.'' (Though she feels compelled to add: \n     ``Maybe I am just a spoiled college student who tries to give \n     meaning to an activity which is senseless.'')\n       True belief requires going ``on tour,'' committing oneself \n     to an ascetic lifestyle of following the band's every stop. \n     But unlike hard-core Deadheads, some of whom survive on food \n     stamps, Phish fans tend to arrange tours around their lives--\n     knocking off in the fall when school starts, working toward \n     real-world careers. The tour community, even if only \n     temporarily joined, offers more than mere fellowship; it is \n     an example of how children of unstable modern households have \n     reinvented the very concept of family.\n       ``Definitely the scene is a surrogate family,'' says Nav \n     Jiwan Khalsa, 21, whose American parents (now divorced) \n     adopted the Sikh religion in the '60s. ``Anywhere you go that \n     the Dead and Phish are playing, you find people of like \n     minds.''\n\n\n                           Big Piney Pilgrim\n\n       My journey to Bethlehem really began in July in the remote \n     mountains near Big Piney, Wyo., where I camped along with \n     13,000 other people in search of something transcendent, or \n     at least something you'll never see on C-SPAN. It was the \n     Rainbow Gathering, an annual celebration of woolly-headed \n     idealism and primitive collectivism that attempts to \n     transplant the Good Samaritan spirit--usually at loose in \n     America only on Christmas Day--to a national forest for an \n     entire week.\n       Incredibly, it works. Everyone belongs, everyone pitches \n     in, everyone gets fed--for free.\n       ``Where you headed?`` I asked a skinny, dirt-caked youth of \n     18 who was hiking down the two-mile trail from the Rainbow \n     encampment. He was struggling with his box of meager \n     possessions, so I offered a hand.\n       ``Vermont,'' he said. ``Going to follow Phish.''\n       Who?\n       ``Brother, you should check them out. When Jerry Garcia \n     dies, they are gonna be it.''\n       A chain of equally crusty teens, friends of his, soon filed \n     alongside us, offering water and fruit.\n       ``Mmmm nomm me nommm,'' they loudly hummed. ``Do do do do \n     do.''\n       The tune sounded familiar. It made everyone smile against \n     the drudgery of the hike.\n       ``Is that Phish?'' I asked.\n       No, they giggled. ``It's from `Sesame Street.' The Muppet \n     theme.''\n\n\n                           Phish and the Dead\n\n       Last week, many of those who journeyed to Fairfax for \n     Phish's show moved on to the Dead's three-night stand at \n     USAir Arena. The parking-lot villages for both bands often \n     feature the same characters and rituals: tribal drum circles \n     convened by dead-headed white kids: the wandering, LSD-dosed \n     bliss ninnies in search of ``miracle'' free tickets; the \n     unmistakable musk of patchouli oil and BO; and the insistent \n     hiss of nitrous oxide tanks, as kids suck $5 balloons full of \n     laughing gas--called ``hippie crack'' because the rush lasts \n     about 20 seconds.\n       Though the bands' following intersect, it's not because the \n     music is the same. Many years ago Phish covered Dead songs, \n     but any comparison today is wrongheaded; the only similarity \n     is that both are jam bands, offering hours-long sets and \n     extended improvisations capable of sending listeners into a \n     twirling dance of ecstasy. (``If you need to find me later, \n     I'll be spinning at Portal 4,'' Buckley Kuhn, 20, a former \n     debutante from McLean, told me at the Patriot Center show.)''\n       What Phish shares principally with the Dead is a marketing \n     strategy that breaks down the barrier between artist and \n     audience. Both bands invite fans to record their live shows, \n     and tapes are traded extensively (never sold). Both use hot \n     lines and mailing lists to enhance the word-of-mouth network. \n     All of this builds a more intimately connected, and loyal, \n     fan base. Today both the Dead and Phish generate their main \n     income from touring rather than album sales, subverting the \n     music industry wisdom that touring is something a band does \n     to sell records.\n       Several other young groups--Blues Traveler, Widespread \n     Panic, God Street Wine, Aquarium Rescue Unit, Leftover Salmon \n     and the Dave Matthews Band--are applying the Dead-Phish \n     formula with varying degrees of success. Matthews, a regional \n     favorite based in Charlottesville, has caught on with Phish \n     fans and last month sold out the 3,400-seat Roseland Ballroom \n     in New York.\n       Many of these bands share something else: a rejection of \n     the voguish alienation and anger of so-called alternative \n     groups, and a return to a celebratory spirit of rock's \n     barefoot-and-tie-dyed past. Phish in particular is a fun \n     band, as playful as children (though the members' average age \n     is 29\\1/2\\) and inventively wacky; for example, when drummer \n     Jon Fishman, dressed in a frock, sings Prince's ``Purple \n     Rain'' while accompanying himself on a Electrolux vacuum \n     cleaner.\n       Add in expertly honed, unpredictable sets and on-stage \n     trampoline gymnastics, and the Dead start to look like what \n     they are; a bunch of old men.\n       ``With the Dead, you're going to get an average to lame \n     show,'' says Steve Logan, 27 a computer salesman from \n     suburban Philadelphia who used to collect live Dead tapes but \n     now concentrates on Phish. He's seen them 73 times; he has \n     stockpiled nearly 500 hours of digital audio tape. ``With \n     Phish, for the most part, it's an excellent show,'' Logan \n     says after setting up his $600 Sony recorder. ``The majority \n     of the crowd is going to walk away saying, `That's one of the \n     best shows I've ever seen.'''\n       Says Jonathan Epstein, 21, a Massachusetts correspondent on \n     the Phishnet, a computer bulletin board: ``I lost my faith in \n     the Grateful Dead. I lost my faith in the Dead when I herd \n     Phish.''\n\n\n                              on the road\n\n     Stun the puppy!\n     Burn the whale!\n     Bark a scruff and go to jail!\n     Forge the coin and lick the stamp!\n     Little Jimmy's off to camp.\n                             --From Phish's ``The Squirming Coil''\n       Nazz and his four friends were road-tripping from \n     Cincinnati in a red Bronco packed with sleeping bags, flannel \n     shirts and sustenance that included a case of Pete's Wicked \n     Ale. First stop, Bethlehem, then on to Fairfax, then \n     Louisville before returning to reality at the University of \n     Cincinnati.\n       Many Phish fans attend college. But some, like Scott \n     Nazzarine, are taking a break. He is 20, an architecture \n     school dropout. He follows both the Dead and Phish, and \n     tramped to Wyoming this summer for the Rainbow Gathering. He \n     wrote his high school senior thesis on Jack Kerouac.\n       ``I try to avoid working as much as possible,'' he says, \n     laughing. He doesn't worry about surviving, he says because \n     ``people are so friendly'' on tour.\n       But like the hippies of yore, today's self-seeking \n     transients often have middle-class roots to return to.\n       ``I've worked Phish into my master plan,'' says Todd \n     Overbeck, 21, a ponytailed sociology major at the U of C. \n     That blueprint includes: graduating with a good GPA, \n     mastering Swahili and enrolling in the Peace Corps (he hopes \n     to work in Africa), then getting a graduate degree. But for a \n     year or two in between, starting in fall '95, he will follow \n     Phish.\n       Why? It's part of his religion, he says, but not the \n     conservative Catholicism he was raised in. ``It's the \n     spirituality of carpe diem--of seizing life, being happy,'' \n     he says. ``It's the spirituality of having a good time.''\n       Do Phish's lyrics contain deeper meaning? Of course, \n     Overbeck and his friends say. They cite the parable of \n     ``Possum'': ``I was driving down the road one day and I hit a \n     possum. Possum, possum, possum.''\n       Nazz smiles, as if revealing a secret. ``Sometimes whatever \n     they're saying doesn't matter,'' he says. ``They could be \n     saying anything.''\n\n\n                              sacred music\n\n       Before the Bethlehem show, the rabbi tends the cookstove, \n     stirring beans to make veggie nachos, a quick nosh for the \n     parking lot faithful.\n       How much?\n       ``By donation,'' He demurs. He also offers Camel wides for \n     a more worldly sum of $3 a pack, and a free glimpse at his \n     set-list catalogue of Phish's live shows, back to '86.\n       ``This is part of my research and part of my occupation, \n     because I'm clergy,'' says Yanni Cohen, 25, an assistant \n     rabbi in Manhattan. ``I get a spiritual boost big-time from \n     Phish shows. And I'm here for advice if someone needs it.''\n       It pleases Cohen that Phish sometimes breaks into the \n     ancient chant ``Aveinu Malkeinu'' (``Our father, our king'') \n     and other Hebrew songs in concert, (Though no longer an \n     observant Jew, bassist Mike Gordon attended Hebrew day \n     school.) ``It's a right-on message,'' the young rabbi says.\n       I offer Cohen my extra free ticket to attend the concert. \n     Sorry, he says, but the sun has set, his observation of \n     Sabbath has begun. He cannot attend.\n       So I offer it to his friend, Wanda D'Orta, 32, a former \n     dental hygienist who now sells tie-dyed clothing, who was \n     raised by strict Christian parents and still follows Jesus \n     but rejects the institutional church. D'Orta says she finds \n     truly Christ-like ``unconditional love'' among Phish fans.\n       ``There are a lot of disciples here,'' she says, gesturing \n     to the assembled, ``even if they don't know it.''\n       She has never seen a Phish concert. She marvels at the free \n     ticket and seems on the verge of weeping with happiness.\n       ``This is such a blessing,'' she says, ``God bless you.''\n\n\n                        present at the creation\n\n       Amy Skelton is the legendary Phirst Phan. She alone was \n     there to applaud Phish during its debut live show 10 years \n     ago on a winter night in Burlington, Vt., at Nectar's--a \n     tavern that is now a sacred site, drawing pilgrims by the \n     carload.\n       ``The second week there were two people, literally,'' \n     recalls guitarist Trey Anastasio. From there the affinity \n     circle kept expanding, as Skelton used her pickup truck to \n     haul loads of 10 fans to bar gigs. ``And we met all of \n     them,'' says Anastasio.\n       He and other band members still wander into the parking lot \n     after shows, but nobody treats them like gurus, or even rock \n     stars. They dress like perpetual grad students. Their idea of \n     a wicked good time on the bus is a chess match (keyboardist \n     Page McConnell and drummer Fishman ended the spring tour tied \n     11-11).\n       ``The guys have never taken themselves too seriously,'' \n     says Skelton, 29, who now handles the band's merchandising on \n     tour. That's her horse, Maggie, dangling on the cover of \n     ``Hoist,'' which has sold about 250,000 copies.\n       Phish's third album for Elektra, ``Hoist'' was an exercise \n     in, well, fishing for radio and MTV exposure, Elektra hoped \n     for a breakthrough after earlier releases flopped \n     commercially.\n       ``So we made a conscious decision,'' Anastasio recalls. \n     ``They want a couple of radio songs, they want a video, let's \n     just do it and see how it feels. And we did it, and I didn't \n     like it.''\n       Why? ``It's too commercial.''\n       Anastasio realizes the irony of this. Most bands, no matter \n     how loudly they bray about the evils of selling out, actually \n     are willing to enter pacts with Lucifer to get a record on \n     the Billboard chart. Phish is genuinely fearful of becoming \n     too popular, of losing the intimate relationship with its \n     fans (up until last year, band members even answered all mail \n     personally). Many Phish Heads denounced the making of a video \n     for the song ``Down With Disease.''\n       ``We don't think we'll make any more,'' says Gordon, who \n     directed it.\n       So far, the band has played to no audience larger than \n     18,000; New York's Madison Square Garden, an upcoming stop, \n     holds 20,000. Anastasio says that's the limit.\n       ``We won't be hitting RFK Stadium,'' he vows. ``It's too \n     big; it's just a stupid place to have a concert. The only \n     reason to play in a room like that is because you make a \n     whole lot of money.''\n       It is a very large room, indeed. But perhaps the Great tour \n     Manager in the Sky will decide the size of the room into \n     which this man sets his feet.\n\n\n                                 phame\n\n       Within minutes of asking Phish to pose for photos, we are \n     surrounded by a frenzied swarm of pre-pubescent girls \n     demanding autographs. The girls play for a 13-and-under \n     soccer team in Cold Spring Harbor, on Long Island, they're in \n     Fairfax for a tournament, and not only have they heard of \n     Phish, they have CDs right here for them to sign! Albums \n     their 15-year-old sisters told them to buy! They looooovvve \n     Phish!\n       The band is estatic, yet surprised that their fame has \n     reached this level. ``This is new for us,'' Anastasio says, \n     shaking his mane.\n       But it's no wonder: Phish's music has built-in kid appeal. \n     Anastasio used to write songs with his mom, once the editor \n     of Sesame Street magazine. One of Phish's songs, ``The \n     Divided Sky,'' takes its melody from a family musical, ``Gus \n     the Christmas Dog.''\n       It turns out the soccer team has no idea Phish is playing \n     that very night, right down the street. Instantly, Anastasio \n     invites all 15 girls to the concert. A few hours later, in \n     the middle of ``Cymbal,'' the Cold Spring Harbor Muppets file \n     in front of the 10,356 spinners, seekers and just plain \n     astonished music lovers, and chant:\n       ``Everything we go, people wanna know! Who we are, where we \n     come from! So we tell them: North, south, east, west--Muppets \n     are the best!''\n       It's too perfect. The lesser deities that watch over \n     feature journalists are clearly working overtime. And in the \n     end, the story of Phish becomes a simple lesson:\n       To find happiness, be as if a child. Play and share. Love \n     one another. Dance and sing. Somewhere in there, you may even \n     find God.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                                 PHISH\n\tMr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont may be one of the last States in the Union to host the Grateful Dead, but we may have spawned their eventual successor--Phish.\n\tThe band Phish began 10 years ago with a live debut at Nectar's, a modest tavern in downtown Burlington, VT. Trey Anastasio, the lead guitarist and songwriter, remembers playing to a crowd of two on their second week.\n\tIn 1991, 7 years later, Phish produced its first album with a major record label and paid tribute to their Vermont roots. The album, ``A Picture of Nectar'', has sold a quarter of a million copies.\n\tWhen Phish came through this area most recently they broke the Patriot Center's all-time attendance record, selling 10,356 seats. They have toured through Europe and filled venues coast to coast for several years. This fall they sold out Madison Square Garden in 4 hours. Their star is on the rise.\n\tPhish's music spans many genres--from classically inspired pieces--to hillbilly country--to slick jazz--to hard rock. Add two trampolines, a vacuum cleaner, a first rate light show and you have a live performance that is hard to forget.\n\tA lot of good things come out of Vermont--Phish is one that seems poised to play a prominent role in the American musical scene. Do not expect hit singles from these talented Vermonters, but expect the grassroots of the Phish movement to grow thick.\n\tMr. President, I want to congratulate Trey Anastasio, Mike Gordon, Jon Fishman and Page O'Connell on their success. I look forward to their continued success. I ask that an article from the Washington Post be printed in the Record at this point.\n\tThe article follows:\n\n               The Hottest Band the World Has Never Heard\n\n                           (By Richard Leiby)\n\n       It all sort of came together in the little town of \n     Bethlehem, Pa. There I found a gentle, longhaired wanderer \n     named Nazzarine (``Nazz'' for short), who is among the many \n     followers of a group whose symbol is a fish. Generally I \n     don't consult Scripture, but that night after the concert I \n     did. The Gideon Bible on the hotel room dresser was already \n     open and turned to Psalm 31, which was written ``to the chief \n     musician.''\n       This I took to be a sign.\n       ``Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for \n     me: for thou art my strength,'' the psalmist wrote. ``Thou \n     has set my feet in a large room.''\n       Yes, rock-and-roll works in mysterious ways. Hear now the \n     tale of a band called Phish.\n       They've been together for 11 years, and touring the country \n     for seven, but most of America has never heard of Phish. The \n     Vermont-based quartet has never had a hit single or a gold \n     album. Radio deejays ignore them because their sound fits no \n     format; it's capable of roaming from dissonant classical to \n     mellow bluegrass, from screeching rock to syncopated funk, \n     sometimes in the same song. MTV shunned their one and only \n     video, from the latest album, ``Hoist.''\n       And yet: On Saturday, Oct. 8, the night after the Bethlehem \n     gig, Phish broke Patriot Center's all-time attendance record, \n     selling 10,356 tickets. That's more tickets than Jimmy \n     Buffett, who established the record in 1987; more than such \n     million-album-selling acts as the Spin Doctors, Kenny G, \n     Pearl Jam and Mary Chapin Carpenter, all of whom have played \n     Patriot Center in recent months.\n       Why? All Phish fans--be they suburban teeny-boppers or \n     erudite college students, grimy homeless hippies or married-\n     with-kids professionals--talk about the uplifting ``vibe'' of \n     the band's live performances, the inexplicable ``connection'' \n     they feel with the musicians, though they rarely address the \n     crowd. Some fans cite the spiritual charge they get from a \n     Phish concert, although the band itself espouses no religious \n     mission or message.\n       At best, the members of Phish offer awkward explanations \n     for their cultlike following. ``It's an intangible energy,'' \n     attempts Trey Anastasio, the shaggy red-haired guitarist. \n     ``This spiritual aspect,'' theorizes bassist Mike Gordon, \n     ``is that there's something universal that exists and can \n     come through the musicians and the music, if we're not \n     blocking. To put it all in words sounds kind of pretentious. \n     It sounds like a bunch of words, until it's actually an \n     experience.''\n       Phish frequently has been compared to the Grateful Dead, \n     another touring band blessed with a trailing caravan of \n     seekers. Jerry Garcia and Co., having been at it for more \n     than a quarter-century, draw far larger audiences--selling \n     some 1.5 million tickets compared with Phish's 650,000 this \n     year. But, says Dead researcher Rebecca Adams, ``Phish is the \n     heir apparent to the Dead. It's quite clear they are winning \n     the lottery.''\n       An academic cottage industry and an Internet debating \n     society have formed around both bands, allowing sages and \n     neophytes to proselytize, soothsay and trade revelations.\n       ``It's a spiritual phenomenon, not just entertainment,'' \n     argues professor Adams, a sociologist at the University of \n     North Carolina who's writing a book about Deadheads and \n     discerns connections to Phish's fans. ``But it's not a belief \n     in musicians as deities. It's a belief in the power of music \n     to create community.''\n       ``It is an experience unlike any other,'' insists Shira \n     Koch, Phish Head, Wesleyan Class of '98, by e-mail message. \n     ``For a few short hours or days, we can almost lose ourselves \n     in music, fun, youth.'' (Though she feels compelled to add: \n     ``Maybe I am just a spoiled college student who tries to give \n     meaning to an activity which is senseless.'')\n       True belief requires going ``on tour,'' committing oneself \n     to an ascetic lifestyle of following the band's every stop. \n     But unlike hard-core Deadheads, some of whom survive on food \n     stamps, Phish fans tend to arrange tours around their lives--\n     knocking off in the fall when school starts, working toward \n     real-world careers. The tour community, even if only \n     temporarily joined, offers more than mere fellowship; it is \n     an example of how children of unstable modern households have \n     reinvented the very concept of family.\n       ``Definitely the scene is a surrogate family,'' says Nav \n     Jiwan Khalsa, 21, whose American parents (now divorced) \n     adopted the Sikh religion in the '60s. ``Anywhere you go that \n     the Dead and Phish are playing, you find people of like \n     minds.''\n\n\n                           Big Piney Pilgrim\n\n       My journey to Bethlehem really began in July in the remote \n     mountains near Big Piney, Wyo., where I camped along with \n     13,000 other people in search of something transcendent, or \n     at least something you'll never see on C-SPAN. It was the \n     Rainbow Gathering, an annual celebration of woolly-headed \n     idealism and primitive collectivism that attempts to \n     transplant the Good Samaritan spirit--usually at loose in \n     America only on Christmas Day--to a national forest for an \n     entire week.\n       Incredibly, it works. Everyone belongs, everyone pitches \n     in, everyone gets fed--for free.\n       ``Where you headed?`` I asked a skinny, dirt-caked youth of \n     18 who was hiking down the two-mile trail from the Rainbow \n     encampment. He was struggling with his box of meager \n     possessions, so I offered a hand.\n       ``Vermont,'' he said. ``Going to follow Phish.''\n       Who?\n       ``Brother, you should check them out. When Jerry Garcia \n     dies, they are gonna be it.''\n       A chain of equally crusty teens, friends of his, soon filed \n     alongside us, offering water and fruit.\n       ``Mmmm nomm me nommm,'' they loudly hummed. ``Do do do do \n     do.''\n       The tune sounded familiar. It made everyone smile against \n     the drudgery of the hike.\n       ``Is that Phish?'' I asked.\n       No, they giggled. ``It's from `Sesame Street.' The Muppet \n     theme.''\n\n\n                           Phish and the Dead\n\n       Last week, many of those who journeyed to Fairfax for \n     Phish's show moved on to the Dead's three-night stand at \n     USAir Arena. The parking-lot villages for both bands often \n     feature the same characters and rituals: tribal drum circles \n     convened by dead-headed white kids: the wandering, LSD-dosed \n     bliss ninnies in search of ``miracle'' free tickets; the \n     unmistakable musk of patchouli oil and BO; and the insistent \n     hiss of nitrous oxide tanks, as kids suck $5 balloons full of \n     laughing gas--called ``hippie crack'' because the rush lasts \n     about 20 seconds.\n       Though the bands' following intersect, it's not because the \n     music is the same. Many years ago Phish covered Dead songs, \n     but any comparison today is wrongheaded; the only similarity \n     is that both are jam bands, offering hours-long sets and \n     extended improvisations capable of sending listeners into a \n     twirling dance of ecstasy. (``If you need to find me later, \n     I'll be spinning at Portal 4,'' Buckley Kuhn, 20, a former \n     debutante from McLean, told me at the Patriot Center show.)''\n       What Phish shares principally with the Dead is a marketing \n     strategy that breaks down the barrier between artist and \n     audience. Both bands invite fans to record their live shows, \n     and tapes are traded extensively (never sold). Both use hot \n     lines and mailing lists to enhance the word-of-mouth network. \n     All of this builds a more intimately connected, and loyal, \n     fan base. Today both the Dead and Phish generate their main \n     income from touring rather than album sales, subverting the \n     music industry wisdom that touring is something a band does \n     to sell records.\n       Several other young groups--Blues Traveler, Widespread \n     Panic, God Street Wine, Aquarium Rescue Unit, Leftover Salmon \n     and the Dave Matthews Band--are applying the Dead-Phish \n     formula with varying degrees of success. Matthews, a regional \n     favorite based in Charlottesville, has caught on with Phish \n     fans and last month sold out the 3,400-seat Roseland Ballroom \n     in New York.\n       Many of these bands share something else: a rejection of \n     the voguish alienation and anger of so-called alternative \n     groups, and a return to a celebratory spirit of rock's \n     barefoot-and-tie-dyed past. Phish in particular is a fun \n     band, as playful as children (though the members' average age \n     is 29\\1/2\\) and inventively wacky; for example, when drummer \n     Jon Fishman, dressed in a frock, sings Prince's ``Purple \n     Rain'' while accompanying himself on a Electrolux vacuum \n     cleaner.\n       Add in expertly honed, unpredictable sets and on-stage \n     trampoline gymnastics, and the Dead start to look like what \n     they are; a bunch of old men.\n       ``With the Dead, you're going to get an average to lame \n     show,'' says Steve Logan, 27 a computer salesman from \n     suburban Philadelphia who used to collect live Dead tapes but \n     now concentrates on Phish. He's seen them 73 times; he has \n     stockpiled nearly 500 hours of digital audio tape. ``With \n     Phish, for the most part, it's an excellent show,'' Logan \n     says after setting up his $600 Sony recorder. ``The majority \n     of the crowd is going to walk away saying, `That's one of the \n     best shows I've ever seen.'''\n       Says Jonathan Epstein, 21, a Massachusetts correspondent on \n     the Phishnet, a computer bulletin board: ``I lost my faith in \n     the Grateful Dead. I lost my faith in the Dead when I herd \n     Phish.''\n\n\n                              on the road\n\n     Stun the puppy!\n     Burn the whale!\n     Bark a scruff and go to jail!\n     Forge the coin and lick the stamp!\n     Little Jimmy's off to camp.\n                             --From Phish's ``The Squirming Coil''\n       Nazz and his four friends were road-tripping from \n     Cincinnati in a red Bronco packed with sleeping bags, flannel \n     shirts and sustenance that included a case of Pete's Wicked \n     Ale. First stop, Bethlehem, then on to Fairfax, then \n     Louisville before returning to reality at the University of \n     Cincinnati.\n       Many Phish fans attend college. But some, like Scott \n     Nazzarine, are taking a break. He is 20, an architecture \n     school dropout. He follows both the Dead and Phish, and \n     tramped to Wyoming this summer for the Rainbow Gathering. He \n     wrote his high school senior thesis on Jack Kerouac.\n       ``I try to avoid working as much as possible,'' he says, \n     laughing. He doesn't worry about surviving, he says because \n     ``people are so friendly'' on tour.\n       But like the hippies of yore, today's self-seeking \n     transients often have middle-class roots to return to.\n       ``I've worked Phish into my master plan,'' says Todd \n     Overbeck, 21, a ponytailed sociology major at the U of C. \n     That blueprint includes: graduating with a good GPA, \n     mastering Swahili and enrolling in the Peace Corps (he hopes \n     to work in Africa), then getting a graduate degree. But for a \n     year or two in between, starting in fall '95, he will follow \n     Phish.\n       Why? It's part of his religion, he says, but not the \n     conservative Catholicism he was raised in. ``It's the \n     spirituality of carpe diem--of seizing life, being happy,'' \n     he says. ``It's the spirituality of having a good time.''\n       Do Phish's lyrics contain deeper meaning? Of course, \n     Overbeck and his friends say. They cite the parable of \n     ``Possum'': ``I was driving down the road one day and I hit a \n     possum. Possum, possum, possum.''\n       Nazz smiles, as if revealing a secret. ``Sometimes whatever \n     they're saying doesn't matter,'' he says. ``They could be \n     saying anything.''\n\n\n                              sacred music\n\n       Before the Bethlehem show, the rabbi tends the cookstove, \n     stirring beans to make veggie nachos, a quick nosh for the \n     parking lot faithful.\n       How much?\n       ``By donation,'' He demurs. He also offers Camel wides for \n     a more worldly sum of $3 a pack, and a free glimpse at his \n     set-list catalogue of Phish's live shows, back to '86.\n       ``This is part of my research and part of my occupation, \n     because I'm clergy,'' says Yanni Cohen, 25, an assistant \n     rabbi in Manhattan. ``I get a spiritual boost big-time from \n     Phish shows. And I'm here for advice if someone needs it.''\n       It pleases Cohen that Phish sometimes breaks into the \n     ancient chant ``Aveinu Malkeinu'' (``Our father, our king'') \n     and other Hebrew songs in concert, (Though no longer an \n     observant Jew, bassist Mike Gordon attended Hebrew day \n     school.) ``It's a right-on message,'' the young rabbi says.\n       I offer Cohen my extra free ticket to attend the concert. \n     Sorry, he says, but the sun has set, his observation of \n     Sabbath has begun. He cannot attend.\n       So I offer it to his friend, Wanda D'Orta, 32, a former \n     dental hygienist who now sells tie-dyed clothing, who was \n     raised by strict Christian parents and still follows Jesus \n     but rejects the institutional church. D'Orta says she finds \n     truly Christ-like ``unconditional love'' among Phish fans.\n       ``There are a lot of disciples here,'' she says, gesturing \n     to the assembled, ``even if they don't know it.''\n       She has never seen a Phish concert. She marvels at the free \n     ticket and seems on the verge of weeping with happiness.\n       ``This is such a blessing,'' she says, ``God bless you.''\n\n\n                        present at the creation\n\n       Amy Skelton is the legendary Phirst Phan. She alone was \n     there to applaud Phish during its debut live show 10 years \n     ago on a winter night in Burlington, Vt., at Nectar's--a \n     tavern that is now a sacred site, drawing pilgrims by the \n     carload.\n       ``The second week there were two people, literally,'' \n     recalls guitarist Trey Anastasio. From there the affinity \n     circle kept expanding, as Skelton used her pickup truck to \n     haul loads of 10 fans to bar gigs. ``And we met all of \n     them,'' says Anastasio.\n       He and other band members still wander into the parking lot \n     after shows, but nobody treats them like gurus, or even rock \n     stars. They dress like perpetual grad students. Their idea of \n     a wicked good time on the bus is a chess match (keyboardist \n     Page McConnell and drummer Fishman ended the spring tour tied \n     11-11).\n       ``The guys have never taken themselves too seriously,'' \n     says Skelton, 29, who now handles the band's merchandising on \n     tour. That's her horse, Maggie, dangling on the cover of \n     ``Hoist,'' which has sold about 250,000 copies.\n       Phish's third album for Elektra, ``Hoist'' was an exercise \n     in, well, fishing for radio and MTV exposure, Elektra hoped \n     for a breakthrough after earlier releases flopped \n     commercially.\n       ``So we made a conscious decision,'' Anastasio recalls. \n     ``They want a couple of radio songs, they want a video, let's \n     just do it and see how it feels. And we did it, and I didn't \n     like it.''\n       Why? ``It's too commercial.''\n       Anastasio realizes the irony of this. Most bands, no matter \n     how loudly they bray about the evils of selling out, actually \n     are willing to enter pacts with Lucifer to get a record on \n     the Billboard chart. Phish is genuinely fearful of becoming \n     too popular, of losing the intimate relationship with its \n     fans (up until last year, band members even answered all mail \n     personally). Many Phish Heads denounced the making of a video \n     for the song ``Down With Disease.''\n       ``We don't think we'll make any more,'' says Gordon, who \n     directed it.\n       So far, the band has played to no audience larger than \n     18,000; New York's Madison Square Garden, an upcoming stop, \n     holds 20,000. Anastasio says that's the limit.\n       ``We won't be hitting RFK Stadium,'' he vows. ``It's too \n     big; it's just a stupid place to have a concert. The only \n     reason to play in a room like that is because you make a \n     whole lot of money.''\n       It is a very large room, indeed. But perhaps the Great tour \n     Manager in the Sky will decide the size of the room into \n     which this man sets his feet.\n\n\n                                 phame\n\n       Within minutes of asking Phish to pose for photos, we are \n     surrounded by a frenzied swarm of pre-pubescent girls \n     demanding autographs. The girls play for a 13-and-under \n     soccer team in Cold Spring Harbor, on Long Island, they're in \n     Fairfax for a tournament, and not only have they heard of \n     Phish, they have CDs right here for them to sign! Albums \n     their 15-year-old sisters told them to buy! They looooovvve \n     Phish!\n       The band is estatic, yet surprised that their fame has \n     reached this level. ``This is new for us,'' Anastasio says, \n     shaking his mane.\n       But it's no wonder: Phish's music has built-in kid appeal. \n     Anastasio used to write songs with his mom, once the editor \n     of Sesame Street magazine. One of Phish's songs, ``The \n     Divided Sky,'' takes its melody from a family musical, ``Gus \n     the Christmas Dog.''\n       It turns out the soccer team has no idea Phish is playing \n     that very night, right down the street. Instantly, Anastasio \n     invites all 15 girls to the concert. A few hours later, in \n     the middle of ``Cymbal,'' the Cold Spring Harbor Muppets file \n     in front of the 10,356 spinners, seekers and just plain \n     astonished music lovers, and chant:\n       ``Everything we go, people wanna know! Who we are, where we \n     come from! So we tell them: North, south, east, west--Muppets \n     are the best!''\n       It's too perfect. The lesser deities that watch over \n     feature journalists are clearly working overtime. And in the \n     end, the story of Phish becomes a simple lesson:\n       To find happiness, be as if a child. Play and share. Love \n     one another. Dance and sing. Somewhere in there, you may even \n     find God.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Patrick J.

Mr. President, I rise today to enter into the \nrecord recommendations from the report of a trip that I led to Africa \nearlier this year with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Russell \nFeingold of Wisconsin. We traveled to Liberia, Angola, and Tunisia to \nlook at the effects of war and the prospects for peace. In addition, we \nmet with Yassir Arafat to discuss the Palestinian National Authority, \nand Foreign Minister Solana of Spain regarding the Western Sahara.\n  Considering the current state of affairs in Liberia and Angola these \nrecommendations will help in providing some guidance to the \nadministration. Liberia remains enmeshed in war with the regional \npeacekeeping operation--the first of its kind in Africa--funded by \nwestern African nations, most of the problems that the mission is \nexperiencing are due to resource shortages. Others are due to the \nupsurge in the war among the factions. Under the new leadership of \nPresident Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, the region is getting reengaged on \nLiberia, and working hard to put together a workable peace agreement \nthat incorporates all parties within Liberia.\n  The recommendations suggests ways in which the United States can \nsupport those regional efforts, and how we can put pressure on those \nLiberians who are working against the cause of peace. In addition, the \nfull report suggests how we can make a difference in the lives of \nordinary Liberians.\n  Recently a peace accord was signed in Lusaka, Zambia, by the warring \nsides in the Angolan conflict. Our country has had a long history with \nAngola beginning during the colonization of America. Angolans were \nbrought to the south eastern part of the United States as slaves. Some \nof their descendants are presently known as the Gullah people of the \nCarolina's. However, most of us have come to know Angola during the \nperiod of the cold war where the United States provided support to a \nnumber of Angolan parties.\n  Angola's people, economy, and territory have been devastated by war, \nbut with the signing of this new peace accord, brokered by the \ninternational community, we may for the first time in two decades see \npeace in Angola.\n  This peace is not only historic for Angola, but also for the southern \nAfrica reason. With elections this year in Mozambique and South Africa, \nwe may now see a southern African region that will begin to see its \npotential as an engine for Africa.\n  Our report addresses areas where the United States can make a \ndifference in the lives of Angolans from immunizations for kids to \nreconstructing civil society. We hope that this report will serve as a \nbasis for the new Congress and the administration to work with Africans \non constructing peace and national reconciliation.\n  Note.--Because of limitations on the amount of material that could be \nplaced in the Record, I urge my colleagues to contact my office for a \ncopy of the trip report.\n\n Visit to Liberia, Angola, Tunisia, and Spain--Recommendations to the \n  Committee on Foreign Relations by Senator Paul Simon, Senator Harry \n                   Reid, and Senator Russell Feingold\n\n\n              findings and recommendations for u.s. policy\n\n       The main findings of our report are listed below for each \n     country we visited:\n\n\n                                liberia\n\n       1. Liberians who raise money in the United States for \n     weapons and/or are implicated in committing crimes in Liberia \n     should be bared entry. Most of the Liberian factions have \n     high ranking members that reside in the United States.\n       Under the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1986, the \n     President may make a proclamation that individuals or groups \n     from certain countries are barred access to the United States \n     for foreign policy reasons.\n       2. Senators Simon and Reid believe that the Secretary of \n     State should recognize the Liberian National Transitional \n     Government [LNTG].\n       Senator Feingold raised concern about the premature \n     recognition of the LNTG. He noted that since the LNTG was \n     appointed as a caretaker government pending democratic \n     elections in Liberia, U.S. recognition should be tied to the \n     holding of elections. Indeed, consistent with its priority on \n     advancing human rights and democracy, US policy has \n     explicitly linked recognition of the Liberian Government to \n     elections. No other country has recognized the LNTG, though \n     the United States and the United Nations have regular contact \n     with members of the LNTG on a working basis. Senator Feingold \n     supports developing a ``road map''--a graduated step-by-step \n     plan--aimed at legitimizing an elected Liberian Government.\n       3. There needs to be increased UN scrutiny of the arms \n     embargo against Liberia. Recent reports have suggested that \n     the embargo needs to be strengthened.\n       The delegation was particularly alarmed by widespread \n     reports that other countries--including Burkina Faso and Cote \n     D'Ivoire--are participating in the arming of various factions \n     in Liberia. It is also concerned about the role of ECOMOG in \n     enforcing the embargo. It is our belief that the war will not \n     end and economic development and political reconciliation \n     will not begin unless the arms trade is halted. As private \n     and public negotiations on a peace accord continue, the arms \n     trade should be a top priority. The delegation heard from \n     many sources that the Nigerian component of ECOMOG is arming \n     certain factions in Liberia.\n       4. Given that ECOMOG appears to be the only hope for \n     Liberia, particularly under the invigorated leadership of \n     President Jerry Rawlings. The Administration should consider \n     providing additional resource support for ECOMOG, including \n     logistical and vehicle support that would allow the force to \n     fan out throughout the country.\n       5. During our negotiations with the warring parties, there \n     should be an emphasis on demobilization and the reintegration \n     of soldiers with the understanding that elections can occur \n     if ``real'' demobilization is adhered to.\n       Demobilization and reintegration, however, are inextricably \n     linked to economic development and peace. For instance, \n     soldiering is one of the only employment options available to \n     children. For disarming, soldiers are offered only a pair of \n     tennis shoes, a bag or rice, and a can of cooking oil--hardly \n     enough to sustain a family. The U.S., the U.N. and, ideally, \n     ECOWAS should look at possibilities (1) to create jobs as a \n     lever in the peace negotiations and (2) to develop programs--\n     such as ``midnight basketball''--for children to give them \n     alternative activities to fighting.\n       6. The Administration should discuss with ECOWAS the \n     request, made by the Transitional Government, to name a \n     political envoy to liaise with the Government.\n       7. We should stress to all factions that they must abide by \n     the Cotonou Accord. The international community is looking to \n     the U.S. to take the lead in Liberia, and given our \n     historical ties and responsibilities in Liberia, we recommend \n     that the resolution of the war in Liberia become a higher \n     priority in our policy in Africa. Specifically, we recommend \n     that the U.S. send a high-level delegation to the region at \n     the appropriate time in the peace talks.\n\n\n                                 angola\n\n       1.

The Agency for International Development should provide \n     funding to the UNICEF appeal for a national immunization \n     program.\n       3. A problem common throughout the developing world is also \n     present in Angolan refugee camps: vaccines expire before they \n     arrive, or they spoil upon receipt because there are \n     inadequate storage facilities in Angola. The same is true for \n     food shipments. Critically, the U.S. should support ongoing \n     research on cold chain technology to ensure the utility of \n     vaccines as intended, as well as continuing research on \n     bags and containers holding food supplies.\n       4. The Administration should insist that President Mobutu \n     of Zaire stop overflights of weapons shipments destined for \n     Angola.\n       5. The Chairman of the Export-Import Bank should examine \n     the issue of providing risk insurance and financing for U.S. \n     firms operating in Angola.\n       6. The Administration should discuss with Angolan President \n     Dos Santos the proposal by the opposition to convene on a \n     regular basis the Council of the Republic. The opposition \n     believes it needs institutional protection to guarantee its \n     voice in government decisions. This would also be a positive \n     confidence-building measure.\n       7. The Administration should discuss with President Dos \n     Santos the opposition's proposal to accelerate the \n     appointment of justices to fulfill the remaining seats in the \n     Judiciary.\n       8. Humanitarian NGO's on the ground should be mindful of \n     the concern that humanitarian assistance efforts not thwart \n     the production of indigenously produced goods. In addition, \n     resettlement programs should begin whenever areas that are \n     calm and safe can be opened up.\n       9. Within funding already allocated for foreign assistance, \n     AID should provide additional money to initiatives like OTI \n     (Office of Transition Initiatives) because they can dispatch \n     assessment missions and quick infusions of money to countries \n     in transition such as Angola. Many times these countries do \n     not need humanitarian assistance for extended periods because \n     they have extreme potential, however, until they get beyond \n     the crisis, they cannot be provided developmental assistance.\n\n\n                                tunisia\n\n       1.

The Congress should consider holding joint meetings with \n     Tunisian legislators on focused issues, such as regional \n     concerns and the development of democracy.\n       3. The U.S. should continue its support of Tunisia as \n     Chairman of the Organization of African Unity.\n       4. As Tunisia continues its process of democratization, the \n     U.S. should emphasize the importance of the protection of \n     internationally-recognized human rights in a democratic and \n     pluralistic society. For example, the U.S. should continue to \n     raise issues such as the incarceration of human rights \n     activists and freedom of speech.\n\n\n meeting with palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat\n\n       1. The Administration should continue to press Chairman \n     Arafat to take the lead in lifting the Arab boycott of \n     Israel.\n       2.

As water resources become more stressed and water \n     sources are increasingly shared, desalination techniques are \n     more timely than ever.\n       3. The Administration should discuss with Arab states the \n     need to allow the Palestinian National Authority to collect \n     Palestinian remunerations that remain in Arab banks, in \n     connection with the Middle East peace process.\n       4. The Administration should work closely with multilateral \n     institutions and other donor countries to ensure that the \n     Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank and Gaza is \n     receiving the money it has been pledged as implementation of \n     the peace accords continues.\n\n\n  meeting with foreign minister solana of spain regarding the western \n                                 sahara\n\n       1.

Mr. President, I rise today to enter into the record recommendations from the report of a trip that I led to Africa earlier this year with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin. We traveled to Liberia, Angola, and Tunisia to look at the effects of war and the prospects for peace. In addition, we met with Yassir Arafat to discuss the Palestinian National Authority, and Foreign Minister Solana of Spain regarding the Western Sahara.\n\tConsidering the current state of affairs in Liberia and Angola these recommendations will help in providing some guidance to the administration. Liberia remains enmeshed in war with the regional peacekeeping operation--the first of its kind in Africa--funded by western African nations, most of the problems that the mission is experiencing are due to resource shortages. Others are due to the upsurge in the war among the factions. Under the new leadership of President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, the region is getting reengaged on Liberia, and working hard to put together a workable peace agreement that incorporates all parties within Liberia.\n\tThe recommendations suggests ways in which the United States can support those regional efforts, and how we can put pressure on those Liberians who are working against the cause of peace. In addition, the full report suggests how we can make a difference in the lives of ordinary Liberians.\n\tRecently a peace accord was signed in Lusaka, Zambia, by the warring sides in the Angolan conflict. Our country has had a long history with Angola beginning during the colonization of America. Angolans were brought to the south eastern part of the United States as slaves. Some of their descendants are presently known as the Gullah people of the Carolina's. However, most of us have come to know Angola during the period of the cold war where the United States provided support to a number of Angolan parties.\n\tAngola's people, economy, and territory have been devastated by war, but with the signing of this new peace accord, brokered by the international community, we may for the first time in two decades see peace in Angola.\n\tThis peace is not only historic for Angola, but also for the southern Africa reason. With elections this year in Mozambique and South Africa, we may now see a southern African region that will begin to see its potential as an engine for Africa.\n\tOur report addresses areas where the United States can make a difference in the lives of Angolans from immunizations for kids to reconstructing civil society. We hope that this report will serve as a basis for the new Congress and the administration to work with Africans on constructing peace and national reconciliation.\n\tNote.--Because of limitations on the amount of material that could be placed in the Record, I urge my colleagues to contact my office for a copy of the trip report.\n\tVisit to Liberia, Angola, Tunisia, and Spain--Recommendations to the \n\tCommittee on Foreign Relations by Senator Paul Simon, Senator Harry \n                   Reid, and Senator Russell Feingold\n\n\n              findings and recommendations for u.s. policy\n\n       The main findings of our report are listed below for each \n     country we visited:\n\n\n                                liberia\n\n       1.

Mr. President, I want to share with our colleagues \na recent articles by Matthew L. Wald published in the New York Times \nabout Noel Perrin, a professor emeritus of English and American \nliterature at Dartmouth, Mr. Wald writes about Professor Perrin's \nexperiences with electric cars and of his devotion to bringing about a \npollution free environment through the widespread use of these \nvehicles.\n  Automobile ownership is expected to increase worldwide by up to 50 \npercent in the next 20 years. If we do not take action, the \nenvironmental and energy problems that will result from the use of \ngasoline-powered cares will be monumental. The air pollution and oil \nconsumption will create problems that simply will be intractable. The \nwidespread use of electric cars, however, would go a long way toward \nresolving our Nation's environmental and energy problems.\n  For some years I have been trying to promote greater research and use \nof electric cars. And we are making progress. New environmental \nregulations have been adopted in California, New York and \nMassachusetts, and are under consideration in other States. In these \nthree States, starting in 1998, 2 percent of the cars sold in the State \nmust be electric. Early this year, the Ozone Transport Commission, \nrepresenting a group of eastern States and the District of Columbia, \nvoted to support California's efforts to develop a market for electric \ncars as a means of reducing air pollution. The Commission vote was a \nformal recommendation to the EPA to require ``progressively cleaner \nstandards'' for automobile emissions.\n  We are making progress, but we must continue our efforts. We must \nwork on the problems that are inherent in any new technology. Batteries \nthat take too long to recharge, the short range of travel before \nrecharging, and the high cost of the electric car are some of the \nproblems that must be resolved.\n  There is great interest in the electric car abroad. Japan wants to \nhave 200,000 electric cares in use by the year 2000, and Europe will \nnot be far behind. We must encourage U.S. auto companies in every way \nwe can to produce electric cars. We must get on the cutting-edge of \nthis technology, Mr. President, before other nations move ahead of us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the New York Times \narticle ``A Man and His Plug-In-Car and their American Odyssey'' be \nprinted in full in the Record.\n\n          A Man and His Plug-In Car and Their American Odyssey\n\n                          (By Matthew L. Wald)\n\n       As bad trips through the Donner Pass go, Noel Perrin's \n     ended relatively painlessly. Nobody froze, starved or ate any \n     unusual meals; all that died was his dream of driving an \n     electric car from Los Angeles home to Vermont. Instead, he \n     rolled back down the mountain, bought a secondhand 1981 \n     Toyota pickup and ignominiously towed the electric across the \n     continent.\n       Mr. Perrin, a professor emeritus of English and American \n     literature at Dartmouth, has recently been teaching \n     environmental studies and driving what he preaches--just now \n     a 1983 Audi, converted to electricity in 1992. Last year it \n     made the daily run from his home in Thetford, Vt., to his \n     classroom in Hanover, N.H., 13 miles each way, and covered \n     5,000 miles; this semester he is teaching at Boston \n     University, and the Audi sits at the bus station in White \n     River Junction, where he picks it up every Friday night for \n     the drive home.\n       Auto executives are very nervous about requirements in \n     California, New York and Massachusetts that beginning in \n     1998, 2 percent of the cars offered for sale must be \n     electric. But Mr. Perrin is confident: ``They've got to make \n     them attractive. But the electric cars are like those girls \n     in 1950's movies that don't realize they're beautiful. The \n     cars are attractive. It's just that Ford and Chrysler and \n     G.M. don't really realize that.''\n       Could he sell the idea to 2 percent of his neighbors?\n       Actually, he could, he said in a telephone interview last \n     week. ``The reason I think I can get one in 50 and probably \n     one in 20 of my neighbors to buy is almost entirely \n     environmental,'' he explained. ``Someone speculated that \n     about 1 percent of Americans are eco-fanatics but that in \n     Vermont the percentage is more like 20.''\n       Professor Perrin was goaded into pioneerhood in 1990, by a \n     student who listened to his lecture on energy conservation \n     and then asked how he could drive a gas-guzzler. A few months \n     later, he flew to Santa Rosa, Calif., to buy a car from the \n     only manufacturer he could find, Solar and Electric \n     Engineering, now U.S. Electricar. It was a 1985 Escort, \n     equipped with lead-acid batteries, which he named Solo. It \n     had a quoted range of 45 to 60 miles between recharges. It \n     turned out to be less going uphill.\n\n\n                             not the first\n\n       He is a self-conscious pioneer, as he shows in his 1992 \n     book, ``Life with an Electric Car'' (reissued last month by \n     the Sierra Club Paperback Library, on acid-free paper \n     containing a minimum of 50 percent recovered waste paper). He \n     wrote that he had believed he was the first to try to cross \n     the country with an electric, but found out later that others \n     had preceded him. Still, if the late 1990's turns out to be \n     the dawn of a new age of transportation, he can lay claim to \n     experiences that are already a thing of the past. One is \n     having to cross the country to find a car; there are now at \n     least 16 builders and converters around the country.\n       He made the trip with nine half-pints of Vermont maple \n     syrup, to barter along the way or give to people who were \n     particularly helpful. He also carried a letter from the \n     manufacturer to show wary motel managers that his car, \n     plugged in overnight with an extension cord strung through a \n     window or into a laundry room, could not draw more than $1.50 \n     worth of electricity.\n       ``You can plug one in anywhere there's power right now; \n     it's just that you have to explain what you're doing,'' he \n     said.\n       He did not take a gasoline-powered generator, which, he \n     said, would not have drawn converts to the cause of electric \n     vehicles. As it was, Solo did not win over everybody; there \n     was the service station attendant in Utah, for example, who \n     asked what he had paid for the converted Escort ($17,500) and \n     offered, ``Around here you could get three 1985 Ford Escorts \n     for that. Maybe four.''\n       At home, Mr. Perrin avoids tapping into the local utility, \n     which simply trades pollution from a tailpipe for pollution \n     from a power plant stack. To get electricity for his car, he \n     covered the south side of his barn roof with $18,000 worth of \n     solar photovoltaic cells.\n       The automakers argue that apart from some elite, special \n     cases like Professor Perrin--although ``special'' isn't quite \n     the term they use--Americans don't have the money or the \n     inclination to deal with an electric. Professor Perrin \n     disagrees.\n       ``It certainly is true that right now they're more \n     expensive, because electric cars are hand-converted,'' he \n     said. But they have fewer parts than conventional cars, and \n     in three or four years, with mass production, will be cheaper \n     than internal-combustion models. ``I don't see that that's \n     particularly elitist.'' he said. ``You may say it's elitist \n     for people to buy Cadillacs and Ferraris and read Road and \n     Track or Car & Driver.''\n       Detroit has drawn its own profile of who would buy an \n     electric, and Professor. Perrin fits much of it, as an \n     ``early adopter'' of new technology with unusually strong \n     views on the environment. Detroit has missed another \n     characteristic of those who buy first; they are extroverts, \n     who will roll down the window at every red light to answer \n     questions. (Solo called attention to itself with a roof rack \n     of photovoltaic cells and the words ``Solar Electric \n     Vehicle'' on its back and sides.)\n\n\n                           White-Haired Fans\n\n       ``All sorts of people, white-haired old ladies--I'm a \n     white-haired gent myself--will come up and say that they're \n     determined to have one before they die,'' he said. ``Kids in \n     high school come up, too.''\n       ``Now, all of us Americans want convenient personal \n     transportation even more than we want to be good to the \n     environment. But I think there are going to be several \n     different kinds of electric cars built from the ground up.''\n       In these closing years of the 20th century, Professor \n     Perrin, at 67, is like a test pilot in a battle among the \n     auto manufacturers, the air regulators, the entrepreneurs \n     and, of course, the lawyers for each. The battle is to \n     determine whose legacy will prove more enduring on the \n     American road; the contestants are Henry Ford, who perfected \n     the mass-produced internal combustion car, and his friend \n     Thomas Edison, who built the first practical electric \n     generator.\n       There is another pioneer Professor Perrin would like to \n     emulate: Sacagawea, the Shoshone Indian who accompanied Lewis \n     and Clark. In later years, Sacagawea covered part of the \n     route again by train.\n       ``My fantasy is just really good batteries in an electric \n     car, maybe lithium polymer,'' he said, ``because I want to \n     drive across country and visit all the places I had trouble \n     when I first brought Solo home in 1991.''\n       Solo is just a memory now. The car died on a back road in a \n     collision with a telephone pole, as Mr. Perrin's book \n     recorded:\n       ``There was a monster dent in front, exactly the size and \n     shape of a telephone pole, but there was no flood of sulfuric \n     acid from the forward batteries. No hiss of steam from the \n     radiator. (Couldn't be. No radiator.) Dazed as I felt, I \n     still was able to notice the one tiny bit of silver lining. \n     This head-on crash showed that electric cars are pretty safe \n     in accidents, maybe safer than gasoline cars. At least Solo \n     was.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                           ELECTRIC VEHICLES\n\tMr. SIMON.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago draft national \nstandards for the teaching of civics and government in grades \nkindergarten through 12 were released by the Center for Civil \nEducation. At about the same time, draft national standards in \ngeography were also released by the Geography Education Standards \nProject. I have long been an advocate of the development of standards \nin the core academic subjects as a way to improve our Nation's \neducational system and the academic achievement of America's young \npeople. Accordingly, I am very happy to see two more installments of \nproposed national standards announced to the public. I want to \ncongratulate the Center for Civic Education and the Geography Education \nStandards Project for what appear to be two very solid and \ncomprehensive efforts to produce standards in these important areas.\n  I would like to take this occasion to comment on the standards \nprocess, of which these latest releases are a part, and on the \nimportance of academic standards to the improvement of education in \nAmerica.\n  In 1991 Congress created a National Council on Education Standards \nand Testing--NCEST--and charged it with advising the Congress and the \nNation on the desirability and feasibility of establishing world class \neducation standards for the United States, methods to assess their \nattainment and a mechanism for establishing those standards. I was \nprivileged to serve on that Council and joined in its report, ``Raising \nStandards for American Education.'' That report concluded that national \nstandards were needed to provide more equitable educational opportunity \nfor all Americans and to increase the competitiveness of the economy. \nThat report further called for high, nationwide, voluntary standards as \na resource to State and local reform efforts and recommended that an \nnew council be established to review standards and, with the National \nEducation Goals Panel, participate in approval of such standards.\n  The Goals 2000 legislation--Public Law 103-227--which we passed last \nspring carries forward the recommendations of NCEST. It provides for \nthe establishment of the National Education Standards and Improvement \nCouncil--known as NESIC--to encourage the development of standards, to \nreview standards and, as appropriate, certify them. The NESIC, which \nhas not yet been appointed, is to consist of experts in various aspects \nof education. The members will be appointed by the President from \nnominations made by the Goals Panel, the leaders of the House and the \nSenate, and the Secretary of Education. Its members are to be evenly \nsplit in political affiliation.\n  When appointed, the NESIC will adopt criteria for the certification \nof standards and will review the standards submitted to it in \naccordance with such criteria. Criteria for review have suggested in \nthe excellent report ``Promises to Keep: Creating High Standards for \nAmerican Students'' which was prepared for the Goals Panel last \nNovember by a panel consisting of such distinguished individuals as \nShirley Malcom, Chester Finn, David Hornbeck, Richard Mills, among \nothers. Those criteria for standards include the following: world-\nclass, important and focussed; useful; reflective of broad consensus-\nbuilding; balanced; accurate and sound; clear and usable; assessable; \nadaptable and flexible; and developmentally appropriate. These or other \nsimilar criteria may be adopted by NESIC for purpose of reviewing \nstandards submitted to it. If standards meet such criteria, NESIC may \ncertify the standards. NESIC will also consider other issues, such as \nwhether there can be more than one set of national standards certified \nin a single subject.\n\n  NESIC will submit the standards that it certifies to the National \nEducation Goals Panel for its review. The Goals Panel, on which I \nserve, may disapprove those standards within 90 days of receipt; \notherwise, the certification will stand as a kind of ``Good \nHousekeeping Seal of Approval'' to guide States in their selection of \nstandards for their schools. Those States may adopt these certified \nnational standards if they choose; alternatively, they may develop \ntheir own standards and seek certification for them from NESIC; or they \nmay adopt standards without certification or decline to adopt any \nstandards at all. The standards are purely voluntary, but it is my hope \nand expectation that all States will adopt the NESIC certified \nstandards or comparable State-developed standards.\n  Thus, the standards process envisioned by Goals 2000 is one with many \nsteps--the first of which is the development of the standards \nthemselves by interested groups. The civics and government standards \nand the geography standards are steps in that initial process, but not \nthe first steps. Other standards have already been developed and \nreleased. In 1989, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics \nreleased standards for mathematics which are now in use in about 30 \npercent of the country's school districts. This year has seen the \nannouncement of standards in the arts and in history in addition to the \ncivics and geography standards which were just released. I understand \nthat science and foreign language standards will be announced soon. The \nprocess is moving along and we are getting closer to having a set of \nworld-class standards in each of the nine core academic subjects \nidentified in the Goals 2000 law.\n  Having challenging, world-class standards for our students to meet in \nthe core academic subjects is critical to the efforts to improve the \neducational level of our citizens. For too long, we have concerned \nourselves with making sure that our students meet minimum standards, \nwith the result that while many students do reach those minimum \nstandards, not enough meet the higher standards that students in other \ncountries meet. As a nation, we need to challenge ourselves and our \nyoung people to do our best, not just get by. The adoption of national, \nvoluntary standards in the core academic subjects will send a very \nstrong and positive message to our young people: that the entire Nation \nwants and supports the best for them.\n  National, voluntary standards are important because they set an \nagenda of excellence for all students, not just the privileged or the \ngifted. I have not yet met a parent who does not want his or her child \nto meet high standards--and when I talk to students in my State of New \nMexico, they say that they want to be given the same opportunities and \nheld to the same expectations as students in other States.\n  Further, in our highly mobile society, national standards will \nprovide some uniformity and predictability and, I hope, the opportunity \nfor the first time for students to know that whatever school they may \nattend will share academic objectives with other schools across the \ncountry.\n  I also expect that the standards process will help us all focus on \nand understand what we as a nation expect from our schools so that we \ncan set about supporting and helping the schools meet those \nexpectations.\n  The standards which I see being certified as a result of the process \nset out in the Goals legislation should be realistic but tough and \nprovide a benchmark for all schools in the Nation to meet. Local \ndistricts can choose how to teach in order to meet the voluntary \nstandards, but they will be guided in their curriculum decisions by \nconsistent, challenging standards. The kinds of standards I am talking \nabout are not a list of facts which each student will be expected to \nmemorize by a certain age. Rather, they are standards such as those set \nout in the civics standards--for example, by grade 4, ``a student \nshould be able to explain the purposes of rules and laws and why they \nare important in their classroom, school, community, state and \nnation.'' Or, by grade 12 ``students should be able to evaluate, take \nand defend positions on the proper relationship between the national \ngovernment and the state and local governments.'' These and similar \nstandards are critical for our students to meet, no matter where the \nschool or the circumstances of the student.\n  There are many reasons that we should all be pleased that the process \nof developing standards in the core academic subjects is proceeding. \nThere is still a long way to go: these standards must all be reviewed \nby NESIC before certification. I have always envisioned that the NESIC \nreview would encompass dialog and revisions so that the standards which \nemerge meet broadly accepted criteria. Nevertheless, the announcement \nof these civics and geography standards signals another major step down \nthe road toward educational excellence for our Nation.\n  In conclusion I would like to note that it is fitting that civics \nstandards should come at this time, following historic elections which \nhave changed the majority in both the House and the Senate for the \nfirst time in over 40 years. This dramatic change in the majority of \nCongress was accomplished in an election in which less than 40 percent \nof the voters exercised their right to vote. The commentators have \nwritten at great length about the anger of our citizens as expressed at \nthe ballot box--but there has been little commentary on a more dramatic \nfact--the fact that a majority of those entitled to vote chose not to \ndo so in this election. There may be many reasons for that low level of \nparticipation in our democracy, but I believe that one of those reasons \nis a lack of appreciation and understanding of the system and the \nimportant role that individuals must play in it at all levels of \ngovernment.\n  The newly announced civics standards seek through ambitious and \nchallenging standards to provide an understanding of that system to \nstudents at all levels as they move through school from kindergarten to \ngraduation. As a member of the Goals Panel which will review the \nstandards if they are certified by NESIC, I do not want to prejudge \nthem at this point. But as I looked through them I thought to myself \nhow wonderful it would be if all students in America could leave high \nschool with a firm grasp of the material covered by these standards and \na commitment to responsible, informed and active participation in our \ndemocracy.\n  Again, my congratulations to the Center for Civic Education, to the \nGeography Education Standards Project, and to all the groups and \nindividuals who participated in the drafting of these standards. They \nhave made an important contribution to the process which I hope will \ntransfer our educational system and give all of our students the chance \nto be the best in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\tNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR GEOGRAPHY AND NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR CIVICS AND \n                               GOVERNMENT\n\tMr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago draft national standards for the teaching of civics and government in grades kindergarten through 12 were released by the Center for Civil Education. At about the same time, draft national standards in geography were also released by the Geography Education Standards Project. I have long been an advocate of the development of standards in the core academic subjects as a way to improve our Nation's educational system and the academic achievement of America's young people. Accordingly, I am very happy to see two more installments of proposed national standards announced to the public. I want to congratulate the Center for Civic Education and the Geography Education Standards Project for what appear to be two very solid and comprehensive efforts to produce standards in these important areas.\n\tI would like to take this occasion to comment on the standards process, of which these latest releases are a part, and on the importance of academic standards to the improvement of education in America.\n\tIn 1991 Congress created a National Council on Education Standards and Testing--NCEST--and charged it with advising the Congress and the Nation on the desirability and feasibility of establishing world class education standards for the United States, methods to assess their attainment and a mechanism for establishing those standards. I was privileged to serve on that Council and joined in its report, ``Raising Standards for American Education.'' That report concluded that national standards were needed to provide more equitable educational opportunity for all Americans and to increase the competitiveness of the economy. That report further called for high, nationwide, voluntary standards as a resource to State and local reform efforts and recommended that an new council be established to review standards and, with the National Education Goals Panel, participate in approval of such standards.\n\tThe Goals 2000 legislation--Public Law 103-227--which we passed last spring carries forward the recommendations of NCEST. It provides for the establishment of the National Education Standards and Improvement Council--known as NESIC--to encourage the development of standards, to review standards and, as appropriate, certify them. The NESIC, which has not yet been appointed, is to consist of experts in various aspects of education. The members will be appointed by the President from nominations made by the Goals Panel, the leaders of the House and the Senate, and the Secretary of Education. Its members are to be evenly split in political affiliation.\n\tWhen appointed, the NESIC will adopt criteria for the certification of standards and will review the standards submitted to it in accordance with such criteria. Criteria for review have suggested in the excellent report ``Promises to Keep: Creating High Standards for American Students'' which was prepared for the Goals Panel last November by a panel consisting of such distinguished individuals as Shirley Malcom, Chester Finn, David Hornbeck, Richard Mills, among others. Those criteria for standards include the following: world-class, important and focussed; useful; reflective of broad consensus-building; balanced; accurate and sound; clear and usable; assessable; adaptable and flexible; and developmentally appropriate. These or other similar criteria may be adopted by NESIC for purpose of reviewing standards submitted to it. If standards meet such criteria, NESIC may certify the standards. NESIC will also consider other issues, such as whether there can be more than one set of national standards certified in a single subject.\n\n\tNESIC will submit the standards that it certifies to the National Education Goals Panel for its review. The Goals Panel, on which I serve, may disapprove those standards within 90 days of receipt; otherwise, the certification will stand as a kind of ``Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval'' to guide States in their selection of standards for their schools. Those States may adopt these certified national standards if they choose; alternatively, they may develop their own standards and seek certification for them from NESIC; or they may adopt standards without certification or decline to adopt any standards at all. The standards are purely voluntary, but it is my hope and expectation that all States will adopt the NESIC certified standards or comparable State-developed standards.\n\tThus, the standards process envisioned by Goals 2000 is one with many steps--the first of which is the development of the standards themselves by interested groups. The civics and government standards and the geography standards are steps in that initial process, but not the first steps. Other standards have already been developed and released. In 1989, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics released standards for mathematics which are now in use in about 30 percent of the country's school districts.

Or, by grade 12 ``students should be able to evaluate, take and defend positions on the proper relationship between the national government and the state and local governments.'' These and similar standards are critical for our students to meet, no matter where the school or the circumstances of the student.\n\tThere are many reasons that we should all be pleased that the process of developing standards in the core academic subjects is proceeding.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of \nthe Senate a true success story in Indian country. Back in 1978, I \nserved as chairman of the Subcommittee on Postsecondary Education in \nthe House of Representatives. One of the bills that came out of that \nSubcommittee was the Tribally Controlled Community College Assistance \nAct of 1978.\n  What these colleges do, they do very well, with funding sharply below \nthat of State or Federally support community colleges. Little Federal \nmoney is available to tribal colleges for renovation and repair, and no \nmoney for new construction.\n  Tribal colleges prepare students for today's job market and provide \ninstruction in Native American traditions and history. Because of their \nsuccess, tribal college enrollments have been steadily increasing over \nthe past decade. In 1993, over 14,000 students were enrolled in tribal \ncolleges.\n  A review of tribal college facilities by the Bureau of Indian Affairs \n[BIA] found that most of the classrooms were minimally functional, and \nall the colleges had buildings that were in non-compliance with safety \nand building codes. Most of the colleges were established in surplus \nbuildings from the BIA and the Indian Health Service must remain in \ndeplorable condition.\n  The article ``Breaking Point'' details the problems facing the Navajo \nCommunity College. Over 300 deficiencies were identified by the BIA for \nhealth and safety violations. Yet students travel hours from all over \nthe reservation to attend college. We must even the playing field by \nincreasing the money tribal college institutions receive. I ask that \nthe article ``Breaking Point'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                             Breaking Point\n\n                      (By Kathleen Kennedy Manzo)\n\n       Shiprock, NM.--The aging sandstone structure that serves as \n     a main instructional facility at the satellite campus of the \n     Navajo Community College has suffered from years of neglect.\n       It is a victim of the limited resources and the need to \n     address greater priorities that characterize the mission of \n     most of the 31 tribal colleges throughout the nation.\n       When inspectors for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) \n     visited the campus last spring, they found poor lighting \n     throughout the building, a leaking roof that caused \n     electrical problems and slippery floors, a gymnasium floor \n     that collapsed on the locker rooms below it and a fire alarm \n     system and safety lights that did not function properly.\n       Some of the nearly 300 deficiencies identified by BIA \n     safety managers who inspected the site had been evident for \n     years, ignored as either too minor, or too expensive, to fix. \n     But when the inspectors threatened to close the facility \n     unless more than half the problems were repaired, it set into \n     motion a cooperative effort to ensure that classes could go \n     on.\n       Workers have been repairing the facility for more than a \n     month by replacing light bulbs, patching the roof and doing \n     routine maintenance to keep the building open. BIA safety \n     personnel completed another inspection recently and found \n     that more than half the problems were fixed, so the building \n     could stay open for classes. The Navajo Nation Tribal Council \n     granted $300,000 toward the upgrading of the structure. \n     Tribal and education leaders, the U.S. Department of the \n     Interior, the BIA and college officials are all working to \n     secure funding to continue the repairs.\n       The U.S. Congress, concerned about the poor financial \n     health of Native American colleges, has begun work on \n     amendments to bring their financing more in line with \n     community colleges nationwide. But that effort is still \n     making its way through the sluggish Capitol Hill legislative \n     process.\n       BIA inspectors have noted the deficiencies at Navajo \n     Community College for years, according to Alfred Abeyta, of \n     the safety management office in Gallup, NM. But the repairs \n     have never been a priority with college officials who have \n     put more immediate concerns first, he said.\n       ``They had a very poor maintenance program because of the \n     lack of manpower and lack of funds,'' Abeyta said. ``We have \n     so many deficiencies in all our [tribal] schools that it's \n     hard to say who to fault. . . . They are thinking about \n     things like books and trying to get the kids educated.''\n\n\n                            problems debated\n\n       There has been disagreement about the extent of the \n     problems. The BIA first advised closure and demolition of the \n     building, which houses about 60 classrooms. An agency report \n     issued in July stated, ``Because of the excessive number of \n     deficiencies and the enormous amount of money required to \n     correct these deficiencies, the Shiprock Acting Safety \n     Manager recommends [that the building] be totally demolished. \n     The structure is a hazard to students, educators, \n     administrative personnel and visitors. The building is \n     rapidly decaying and is past the point of safe usage and \n     occupancy.''\n       It was estimated it would cost anywhere from $4 million to \n     $8 million to make the building and the campus safe. But \n     school administrators felt the BIA report was overly harsh \n     because it blew the problems out of proportion.\n       ``All in all, the big old uproar about the building being \n     in [an] unsafe condition is just a small factor,'' compared \n     to other challenges, said Shiprock campus spokesman D \n     Johnson. ``The building is old and it does need some work, \n     but I don't think it's in critical condition.''\n       The problems paled in comparison to those of smaller and \n     older community centers run by the college, according to NCC \n     Vice President James McNeley.\n       ``It is a structurally sound facility,'' in need of some \n     repairs, he said of the former boarding school site. ``It's \n     like a comfortable old shoe. Some of the facility needs at \n     the community centers are much greater.''\n       But Abeyta said the severity of the report was necessary to \n     force the college to take action on long-standing problems.\n\n\n                     abandoned buildings, trailers\n\n       Navajo Community College, established in 1968, was the \n     first tribally controlled college in the nation. Its main \n     campus, where the administration is housed, is in Tsaile, AZ, \n     100 miles west of the Shiprock campus. The Shiprock campus \n     serves older adults--the average age of its students is 29--\n     and offers programs in science and engineering. The two \n     campuses and five community centers serve the Navajo \n     reservation, which stretches 25,000 square miles into New \n     Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Like many of the reservations \n     throughout the United States, the Navajo Nation is sparsely \n     populated and plagued by high unemployment, low educational \n     attainment and severe poverty.\n       These factors have created extreme challenges for the \n     tribal colleges. The problems highlighted in the BIA report \n     brought national attention to some of those challenges, \n     particularly those centered on inadequate facilities and \n     resources.\n       ``It's a miracle we're even around with the amount of money \n     we were given to start up. By and large, tribes are \n     impoverished and don't have the money to support the \n     colleges,'' said David Archambault, president of Standing \n     Rock Community College in North Dakota. ``With regards to \n     facilities, many of the tribal colleges are in abandoned \n     buildings and even condemned buildings . . . most operate out \n     of the cheapest mode of shelter, like trailers.''\n       Archambault said that NCC has one of the better facilities \n     among tribal colleges.\n       Blackfeet Community College in Browning, MT, was founded in \n     1976 and housed in an old house, an abandoned metal building \n     and a renovated roller rink. Fort Belknap College in Harlem, \n     Mt, moved into a tribe-owned storefront and erected \n     partitions to wall off offices and classrooms. The Institute \n     for American Indian and Native American Art Development in \n     Santa Fe, NM, a 32-year-old federally chartered college \n     dedicated to he fine arts, conducts classes in 50-year-old \n     military barracks and portable buildings located on the \n     campus of Santa Fe Community College.\n\n\n                           aid from congress\n\n       In its last session, the U.S. Senate approved an amendment, \n     as part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act, to give limited land-grant status to \n     tribal colleges in an effort to bring their funding levels up \n     to par with other community colleges. At presstime Congress \n     was expected to pass the legislation by early October.\n       Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), who sponsored the legislation, \n     pointed to the ``report on the deplorable condition of the \n     Navajo Community College in Shiprock [as] a glaring, but \n     instructive example of the funding inequities that confront \n     American Indian community colleges.''\n       Said Bingaman: ``If tribal colleges don't even have the \n     resources necessary to provide basic facilities, they \n     certainly can't provide the skills necessary for American \n     Indians to compete and succeed in the job market.''\n       Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), who co-sponsored the \n     legislation, said shortly after the BIA report was released \n     that the bureau's recommendations were made in haste and \n     threatened the educational future of the nearly 500 students \n     at the northwest New Mexico campus.\n       Domenici was critical of the BIA regulations that prevented \n     the bureau from making the repairs. Since the college became \n     a contract school and was released from BIA control six years \n     ago, the bureau's authority is limited, according to Alfred \n     Abeyta in the bureau's Gallup office. But Domenici said that \n     the BIA does have the authority to make the repairs under the \n     Tribally Controlled Community Colleges Act. He has charged \n     that the BIA has spent no money or made other efforts to \n     force in to action a plan for repairs despite the threat to \n     student safety.\n       Although Congress approved $43 million in its fiscal 1995 \n     budget for the BIA to make repairs to education facilities, \n     NCC is not included in that plan. However, the land-grant \n     status would provide a $23 million endowment, held in trust \n     for the colleges, with the annual dividend going to \n     supplement current educational programs. Each school, \n     including NCC, will also get $50,000 per year. And the \n     colleges will share $1.7 million per year in building grants.\n       Although relying almost entirely on federal funds, tribal \n     colleges receive less than $3,000 per full-time equivalent \n     student in government aid. Historically Black colleges \n     receive nearly $17,000 per student, and mainstream community \n     colleges get about $7,000 per student. Land-grant colleges \n     were established to improve economic opportunities in rural \n     areas. HBCUs and those institutions located in American \n     territories were first given that designation more than 100 \n     years ago.\n       The limited land-grant status is expected to give the \n     tribal colleges access to a wider variety of programs and \n     resources and foster cooperative agreements between them and \n     existing land-grant colleges seeking to attract more Native-\n     Americans.\n       The lack of adequate facilities has not discouraged many \n     students from attending the two-year schools. Although \n     officials expected that the problems in Shiprock would \n     negatively affect enrollments, they remain high. The Tsaile \n     campus had a record number of students last year with 2,500 \n     attending full-time. Many of the tribal colleges represent an \n     opportunity for students to pursue higher education while \n     allowing them to stay close to their families, a high \n     priority steeped in centuries-old traditions and a strong \n     attachment to their homelands, McNeley said.\n       ``We have no difficulty attracting students because, in \n     their hearts, most Navajo people would prefer to stay on the \n     reservation,'' McNeley said. ``Our challenge is to be able to \n     meet that demand.''\n       Despite the limitations, tribal colleges have continued to \n     meet the varied needs of thousands of Native Americans, said \n     Joseph McDonald, president of Salish Kootenai College in \n     Pablo, MT.\n       ``The working conditions are austere . . . but I've been in \n     real nice buildings where the educational programs are \n     poor,'' he said. ``You can teach in a barn, or a hay shed, or \n     have an exciting program on the street. Tribal colleges have \n     proven that . . .. But inflation keeps going up, faculty \n     salaries, electrical costs and the cost of books and \n     materials keep increasing . . . but the money [appropriated \n     to tribal colleges] stays the same. We're really at the \n     breaking point where something has to give real soon, or the \n     tribal colleges will be in great trouble.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                  THE PROBLEMS FACING TRIBAL COLLEGES\n\tMr. SIMON.

Most of the colleges were established in surplus buildings from the BIA and the Indian Health Service must remain in deplorable condition.\n\tThe article ``Breaking Point'' details the problems facing the Navajo Community College. Over 300 deficiencies were identified by the BIA for health and safety violations. Yet students travel hours from all over the reservation to attend college. We must even the playing field by increasing the money tribal college institutions receive. I ask that the article ``Breaking Point'' be printed in the Record.\n\tThe article follows:\n\n                             Breaking Point\n\n                      (By Kathleen Kennedy Manzo)\n\n       Shiprock, NM.--The aging sandstone structure that serves as \n     a main instructional facility at the satellite campus of the \n     Navajo Community College has suffered from years of neglect.\n       It is a victim of the limited resources and the need to \n     address greater priorities that characterize the mission of \n     most of the 31 tribal colleges throughout the nation.\n       When inspectors for the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) \n     visited the campus last spring, they found poor lighting \n     throughout the building, a leaking roof that caused \n     electrical problems and slippery floors, a gymnasium floor \n     that collapsed on the locker rooms below it and a fire alarm \n     system and safety lights that did not function properly.\n       Some of the nearly 300 deficiencies identified by BIA \n     safety managers who inspected the site had been evident for \n     years, ignored as either too minor, or too expensive, to fix. \n     But when the inspectors threatened to close the facility \n     unless more than half the problems were repaired, it set into \n     motion a cooperative effort to ensure that classes could go \n     on.\n       Workers have been repairing the facility for more than a \n     month by replacing light bulbs, patching the roof and doing \n     routine maintenance to keep the building open. BIA safety \n     personnel completed another inspection recently and found \n     that more than half the problems were fixed, so the building \n     could stay open for classes. The Navajo Nation Tribal Council \n     granted $300,000 toward the upgrading of the structure. \n     Tribal and education leaders, the U.S. Department of the \n     Interior, the BIA and college officials are all working to \n     secure funding to continue the repairs.\n       The U.S. Congress, concerned about the poor financial \n     health of Native American colleges, has begun work on \n     amendments to bring their financing more in line with \n     community colleges nationwide. But that effort is still \n     making its way through the sluggish Capitol Hill legislative \n     process.\n       BIA inspectors have noted the deficiencies at Navajo \n     Community College for years, according to Alfred Abeyta, of \n     the safety management office in Gallup, NM. But the repairs \n     have never been a priority with college officials who have \n     put more immediate concerns first, he said.\n       ``They had a very poor maintenance program because of the \n     lack of manpower and lack of funds,'' Abeyta said. ``We have \n     so many deficiencies in all our [tribal] schools that it's \n     hard to say who to fault. . . . They are thinking about \n     things like books and trying to get the kids educated.''\n\n\n                            problems debated\n\n       There has been disagreement about the extent of the \n     problems. The BIA first advised closure and demolition of the \n     building, which houses about 60 classrooms. An agency report \n     issued in July stated, ``Because of the excessive number of \n     deficiencies and the enormous amount of money required to \n     correct these deficiencies, the Shiprock Acting Safety \n     Manager recommends [that the building] be totally demolished. \n     The structure is a hazard to students, educators, \n     administrative personnel and visitors. The building is \n     rapidly decaying and is past the point of safe usage and \n     occupancy.''\n       It was estimated it would cost anywhere from $4 million to \n     $8 million to make the building and the campus safe. But \n     school administrators felt the BIA report was overly harsh \n     because it blew the problems out of proportion.\n       ``All in all, the big old uproar about the building being \n     in [an] unsafe condition is just a small factor,'' compared \n     to other challenges, said Shiprock campus spokesman D \n     Johnson. ``The building is old and it does need some work, \n     but I don't think it's in critical condition.''\n       The problems paled in comparison to those of smaller and \n     older community centers run by the college, according to NCC \n     Vice President James McNeley.\n       ``It is a structurally sound facility,'' in need of some \n     repairs, he said of the former boarding school site. ``It's \n     like a comfortable old shoe. Some of the facility needs at \n     the community centers are much greater.''\n       But Abeyta said the severity of the report was necessary to \n     force the college to take action on long-standing problems.\n\n\n                     abandoned buildings, trailers\n\n       Navajo Community College, established in 1968, was the \n     first tribally controlled college in the nation. Its main \n     campus, where the administration is housed, is in Tsaile, AZ, \n     100 miles west of the Shiprock campus. The Shiprock campus \n     serves older adults--the average age of its students is 29--\n     and offers programs in science and engineering. The two \n     campuses and five community centers serve the Navajo \n     reservation, which stretches 25,000 square miles into New \n     Mexico, Arizona and Utah. Like many of the reservations \n     throughout the United States, the Navajo Nation is sparsely \n     populated and plagued by high unemployment, low educational \n     attainment and severe poverty.\n       These factors have created extreme challenges for the \n     tribal colleges. The problems highlighted in the BIA report \n     brought national attention to some of those challenges, \n     particularly those centered on inadequate facilities and \n     resources.\n       ``It's a miracle we're even around with the amount of money \n     we were given to start up. By and large, tribes are \n     impoverished and don't have the money to support the \n     colleges,'' said David Archambault, president of Standing \n     Rock Community College in North Dakota. ``With regards to \n     facilities, many of the tribal colleges are in abandoned \n     buildings and even condemned buildings . . . most operate out \n     of the cheapest mode of shelter, like trailers.''\n       Archambault said that NCC has one of the better facilities \n     among tribal colleges.\n       Blackfeet Community College in Browning, MT, was founded in \n     1976 and housed in an old house, an abandoned metal building \n     and a renovated roller rink. Fort Belknap College in Harlem, \n     Mt, moved into a tribe-owned storefront and erected \n     partitions to wall off offices and classrooms. The Institute \n     for American Indian and Native American Art Development in \n     Santa Fe, NM, a 32-year-old federally chartered college \n     dedicated to he fine arts, conducts classes in 50-year-old \n     military barracks and portable buildings located on the \n     campus of Santa Fe Community College.\n\n\n                           aid from congress\n\n       In its last session, the U.S. Senate approved an amendment, \n     as part of the reauthorization of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act, to give limited land-grant status to \n     tribal colleges in an effort to bring their funding levels up \n     to par with other community colleges. At presstime Congress \n     was expected to pass the legislation by early October.\n       Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), who sponsored the legislation, \n     pointed to the ``report on the deplorable condition of the \n     Navajo Community College in Shiprock [as] a glaring, but \n     instructive example of the funding inequities that confront \n     American Indian community colleges.''\n       Said Bingaman: ``If tribal colleges don't even have the \n     resources necessary to provide basic facilities, they \n     certainly can't provide the skills necessary for American \n     Indians to compete and succeed in the job market.''\n       Sen. Pete V. Domenici (R-NM), who co-sponsored the \n     legislation, said shortly after the BIA report was released \n     that the bureau's recommendations were made in haste and \n     threatened the educational future of the nearly 500 students \n     at the northwest New Mexico campus.\n       Domenici was critical of the BIA regulations that prevented \n     the bureau from making the repairs. Since the college became \n     a contract school and was released from BIA control six years \n     ago, the bureau's authority is limited, according to Alfred \n     Abeyta in the bureau's Gallup office. But Domenici said that \n     the BIA does have the authority to make the repairs under the \n     Tribally Controlled Community Colleges Act. He has charged \n     that the BIA has spent no money or made other efforts to \n     force in to action a plan for repairs despite the threat to \n     student safety.\n       Although Congress approved $43 million in its fiscal 1995 \n     budget for the BIA to make repairs to education facilities, \n     NCC is not included in that plan. However, the land-grant \n     status would provide a $23 million endowment, held in trust \n     for the colleges, with the annual dividend going to \n     supplement current educational programs. Each school, \n     including NCC, will also get $50,000 per year. And the \n     colleges will share $1.7 million per year in building grants.\n       Although relying almost entirely on federal funds, tribal \n     colleges receive less than $3,000 per full-time equivalent \n     student in government aid. Historically Black colleges \n     receive nearly $17,000 per student, and mainstream community \n     colleges get about $7,000 per student. Land-grant colleges \n     were established to improve economic opportunities in rural \n     areas. HBCUs and those institutions located in American \n     territories were first given that designation more than 100 \n     years ago.\n       The limited land-grant status is expected to give the \n     tribal colleges access to a wider variety of programs and \n     resources and foster cooperative agreements between them and \n     existing land-grant colleges seeking to attract more Native-\n     Americans.\n       The lack of adequate facilities has not discouraged many \n     students from attending the two-year schools. Although \n     officials expected that the problems in Shiprock would \n     negatively affect enrollments, they remain high. The Tsaile \n     campus had a record number of students last year with 2,500 \n     attending full-time. Many of the tribal colleges represent an \n     opportunity for students to pursue higher education while \n     allowing them to stay close to their families, a high \n     priority steeped in centuries-old traditions and a strong \n     attachment to their homelands, McNeley said.\n       ``We have no difficulty attracting students because, in \n     their hearts, most Navajo people would prefer to stay on the \n     reservation,'' McNeley said. ``Our challenge is to be able to \n     meet that demand.''\n       Despite the limitations, tribal colleges have continued to \n     meet the varied needs of thousands of Native Americans, said \n     Joseph McDonald, president of Salish Kootenai College in \n     Pablo, MT.\n       ``The working conditions are austere . . . but I've been in \n     real nice buildings where the educational programs are \n     poor,'' he said. ``You can teach in a barn, or a hay shed, or \n     have an exciting program on the street. Tribal colleges have \n     proven that . . .. But inflation keeps going up, faculty \n     salaries, electrical costs and the cost of books and \n     materials keep increasing . . . but the money [appropriated \n     to tribal colleges] stays the same. We're really at the \n     breaking point where something has to give real soon, or the \n     tribal colleges will be in great trouble.''\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Paul Simon"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

Mr. President, just over a month ago, the \nadministration announced that it had entered into a deal with the North \nKoreans to address the smoldering nuclear crisis on the Korean \npeninsula. At the time the agreement was announced, I had serious \nreservations as to whether it was in our Nation's--or the world's--best \ninterests. Having had more time to understand the agreement and to \ngather more information about it, I am now even more concerned that we \ngot a bad deal--a deal that will come back to haunt us in the future.\n  The problems with this agreement are many. Most important, it grants \nmajor concessions to the North Koreans while not requiring significant \nreciprocal actions for a decade. The administration agreed to give \nNorth Korea the two things it has coveted for decades--the prestige of \ndiplomatic recognition and the economic boost that will come with a \nlowering of sanctions.\n  The lowering of economic sanctions is particularly important to a \nregime that is unable to feed its population to the point that it has \nbeen forced to lead a national campaign to cut back on the number of \nmeals that its citizens eat each day. This move to lower economic \nbarriers will significantly relieve pressure on the current leadership \nand give them breathing room they would not otherwise have had.\n  Another problem with the agreement is that it leaves North Korea with \ncontrol over the nuclear weapons--which our intelligence services have \nsaid they have--for at least a decade. That gives them a significant \namount of leverage in future negotiations, and continues a great threat \nto stability in Northeast Asia.\n  Also, the agreement fails to address the conventional military threat \nto South Korea and the tens of thousands of Americans there. North \nKorea will continue to maintain a 1-million-man Army just 30 miles from \nSeoul, along with thousands of artillery pieces and other offensive \nequipment. Withdrawal of at least some of those forces should have been \na requirement of an agreement.\n  And, not insignificantly, the agreement sets the precedent for other \nnations that don't want to live up to their commitments under the \nNuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, that they do not have to do so. \nInstead, they can try to bargain their way into a better deal as North \nKorea has done.\n  Proponents of the agreement will, of course, argue that we got a good \ndeal because once it is fully implemented--10 years from now--nuclear \nweapons will have been eliminated from the peninsula. The problem with \nthat argument is that it assumes the agreement will be fully \nimplemented and that the North Koreans will live up to their promises. \nExperience would show that those are not safe assumptions.\n  The North Koreans have mastered the art of using negotiating tactics \nas a means of delay. Time and again they have made agreements and then \nfailed to live up to them. There is no reason to believe that they are \nnot once again simply buying time--getting diplomatic recognition, \ngetting economic assistance and investment--only to change their minds \nwhen it comes time to fulfill their side of the bargain. I hope the \nadministration is not so naive as to assume that the North is telling \nthe truth this time as they have failed to do so many times in the \npast.\n  All of these objections occurred to me when I first learned about the \nagreement in October. My concern soared, however, when I learned about \na side letter that the President had signed along with initial \nagreement.\n  It is interesting to note that there was no mention of the side \nletter when the agreement was first announced by the administration. In \nfact, the letter was not released until the following week, giving the \nclear appearance that the administration was trying to avoid scrutiny \nof its contents.\n  There are several problems with the letter which is from the \nPresident to Kim Jong Il, the son of recently deceased dictator Kim Il \nsong.\n  The letter is addressed to ``His Excellency Kim Jong Il, Supreme \nLeader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.'' That is news to \nme. Unless I have missed something, Kim has never been designated the \nleader of the DPRK. Instead, the leadership of the country has remained \nin limbo. It seems particularly ill-advised to have addressed the \nletter in a way that may not be accurate and that may have an impact on \nsome internal power struggle of which we are not aware.\n  More importantly, in the letter, the President gives his commitment \nthat he will use the full powers of the White House to facilitate the \nconstruction of light-water reactor in the DPRK and the provision of \ninterim oil supplies to meet that country's needs. He goes on to \nindicate that if the reactor and oil supplies are not paid for--as \nplanned--by other countries such as Japan and South Korea, he will do \nall he can to ensure that the United States pays for them. He does \nmention that such action would be subject to the approval of Congress.\n  In my opinion, that is a very significant letter. In it, the \nPresident commits to pay--with our tax dollars--the billions it will \ncost to build a nuclear reactor, and to pay for the hundreds of \nthousands of tons of oil that the agreement promises over the next \nseveral years.\n  Already there are disputes over who will bear the costs of the deal. \nSouth Korea's Foreign Minister has stated clearly that his country does \nnot intend to pay for the supply of oil to the North over the next \ndecade, and already the U.S. taxpayers are picking up the tab for the \nfirst 50,000 tons.\n  I strongly question the idea of using U.S. taxpayer dollars to \nprovide economic assistance to North Korea--a country responsible for a \nmajor war, for the fact that we are forced to station almost 40,000 \ntroops in Korea, for dozens of acts of terrorism, and for contributing \nto the spread of dangerous weapons throughout the world. I would \nimagine that the majority of this body would share that view.\n  It is clear to me that the Korean agreement deserves significantly \nmore study. I am pleased that several Members of this body have \nannounced the intention to review the agreement, and I certainly intend \nto participate in that review.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                 UNITED STATES-NORTH KOREA NUCLEAR DEAL\n\tMr. BOND.

Instead, they can try to bargain their way into a better deal as North Korea has done.\n\tProponents of the agreement will, of course, argue that we got a good deal because once it is fully implemented--10 years from now--nuclear weapons will have been eliminated from the peninsula. The problem with that argument is that it assumes the agreement will be fully implemented and that the North Koreans will live up to their promises. Experience would show that those are not safe assumptions.\n\tThe North Koreans have mastered the art of using negotiating tactics as a means of delay. Time and again they have made agreements and then failed to live up to them. There is no reason to believe that they are not once again simply buying time--getting diplomatic recognition, getting economic assistance and investment--only to change their minds when it comes time to fulfill their side of the bargain. I hope the administration is not so naive as to assume that the North is telling the truth this time as they have failed to do so many times in the past.\n\tAll of these objections occurred to me when I first learned about the agreement in October. My concern soared, however, when I learned about a side letter that the President had signed along with initial agreement.\n\tIt is interesting to note that there was no mention of the side letter when the agreement was first announced by the administration. In fact, the letter was not released until the following week, giving the clear appearance that the administration was trying to avoid scrutiny of its contents.\n\tThere are several problems with the letter which is from the President to Kim Jong Il, the son of recently deceased dictator Kim Il song.\n\tThe letter is addressed to ``His Excellency Kim Jong Il, Supreme Leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.'' That is news to me. Unless I have missed something, Kim has never been designated the leader of the DPRK. Instead, the leadership of the country has remained in limbo. It seems particularly ill-advised to have addressed the letter in a way that may not be accurate and that may have an impact on some internal power struggle of which we are not aware.\n\tMore importantly, in the letter, the President gives his commitment that he will use the full powers of the White House to facilitate the construction of light-water reactor in the DPRK and the provision of interim oil supplies to meet that country's needs. He goes on to indicate that if the reactor and oil supplies are not paid for--as planned--by other countries such as Japan and South Korea, he will do all he can to ensure that the United States pays for them. He does mention that such action would be subject to the approval of Congress.\n\tIn my opinion, that is a very significant letter. In it, the President commits to pay--with our tax dollars--the billions it will cost to build a nuclear reactor, and to pay for the hundreds of thousands of tons of oil that the agreement promises over the next several years.\n\tAlready there are disputes over who will bear the costs of the deal. South Korea's Foreign Minister has stated clearly that his country does not intend to pay for the supply of oil to the North over the next decade, and already the U.S. taxpayers are picking up the tab for the first 50,000 tons.\n\tI strongly question the idea of using U.S. taxpayer dollars to provide economic assistance to North Korea--a country responsible for a major war, for the fact that we are forced to station almost 40,000 troops in Korea, for dozens of acts of terrorism, and for contributing to the spread of dangerous weapons throughout the world. I would imagine that the majority of this body would share that view.\n\tIt is clear to me that the Korean agreement deserves significantly more study. I am pleased that several Members of this body have announced the intention to review the agreement, and I certainly intend to participate in that review.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Christopher S.

As soon as we return for the start of the 104th \nCongress, I intend to introduce amendments to the Truth in Lending Act \n(``TILA'') in response to the recent case of Rodash against A.I.B. \nMortgage Co., 16 F. 3d 1146 (11th Cir. 1994) decided in March of this \nyear. In Rodash, the Court held that a tax levied on security \ninstruments that must be paid as a pre-condition to recording the \nmortgage and delivery fees were both ``finance charges'' under TILA. \nAlthough the tax and fees were disclosed to the consumer, in the \nopinion of the court, their disclosure as components of the ``amount \nfinanced'' rather than as part of the ``finance charge'' was improper. \nBased primarily on Rodash, over fifty class action suits have already \nbeen filed and more are being brought every week. At least 30 of these \nsuits have been brought in my home state of Florida. The average tax is \nabout $200.00 and on average the courier fees are $30.00 per \ntransaction.\n  These developments present a serious and immediate threat to the \nfuture of mortgage lending that necessitate prompt responsive steps to \naddress the issue. Under the TILA, a refinance or second mortgage loan \ncan be rescinded if a lender is found to have made improper material \ndisclosures, including the amount of the finance charge. Virtually all \nof the class actions have sought class rescission or a declaration by \nthe Court that members of the class have continuing rescission rights. \nThe Courts have liberally construed what constitutes a material \nnondisclosure so that even minor discrepancies allow borrowers to \nexercise the right to rescind a loan or seek statutory penalties. If a \nborrower rescinds a loan, the lender must reimburse all fees and cost \nto the borrower, including all interest paid, and must release the \nmortgage lien. Generally speaking, the borrower's right to rescind may \nbe asserted against any subsequent owners of the loan, even if it did \nnot make or contribute to the incorrect disclosure. This aspect affects \nmortgages that have been resold as mortgage-backed securities.\n  Mortgage lending faces dire consequences if loans are rescinded in \nsignificant numbers because the losses could be in the billions of \ndollars. Since 1991, 11.8 million loans totaling $1.3 trillion have \nbeen refinanced. The exposure from this litigation could impair the \nsafety and soundness of the thrift and banking institutions. \nPrepayments from massive rescissions would also affect the mortgage-\nbacked securities marketplace.\n  The legislation I will offer will address liability under the TILA \nbased upon the manner in which a creditor disclosed certain taxes and \ndelivery fees.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I understand the importance of the amendment my \ncolleague from Florida intends to offer. I expect that the issues he \nraises will be considered early in the next session. I also appreciate \nthe disruptive affect of unlimited future litigation on this issue. \nHowever, I am concerned about the impact of this legislation on pending \nlawsuits and recission claims.\n  Mr. MACK. I understand and share his concern. My amendment will \nstrike a balance in eliminating hyper-technical liability on lenders \nwhile preserving individual consumer rights under TILA. We will \npropose, therefore, to exclude from the effect to the limitations on \nliability only individual actions filed, rescission claims made by \nindividuals, or class action certified, prior to October 1, 1994, and \nin which a claimant alleged, prior to that time, improper disclosure of \ndelivery fees or taxes. The consumers who will be affected by these \namendments are those who have not filed an individual action or \ncounterclaim, who are not part of certified ``class,'' or who have not \nmade a rescission claim prior to October 1, 1994. Cases already \ndecided, including Rodash, will not be affected. We've made out \nintention to act on this issue very clear and none will suffer any \nunanticipated adverse affect.\n  It is also my intention that the legislation have a fixed effective \ndate so that it will be apparent that future class actions would be \nforeclosed insofar as they allege violations of the items treated in \nthe amendment, as would existing class action suits where the class had \nnot been certified before October 1, 1994. For class actions that were \nnot certified before that date however, the named individual \nplaintiff's representatives would be permitted to pursue their \nindividual claims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                          TRUTH IN LENDING ACT\n\tMr. MACK.

Mr. President, today Senator Paul Simon, \nchairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, Senator Harry Reid, \nand I are submitting a report on the our trip to Africa earlier this \nsummer. As a new member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and \nthe Subcommittee on African Affairs, I was exposed firsthand to some of \nthe tragedies in Africa, and, for the first time, had an opportunity to \nmeet with international actors in the region, as well as reflect on the \nrole the United States can play in Africa. I benefited greatly from \nSenator Simon's and Senator Reid's experience and expertise during the \ntrip, and thank them for their leadership on these issues.\n  The severe problems in Africa today are, by and large, the \nconsequences of colonial and post-colonial struggles. In the past \ndecades, countries such as Angola have transitioned from colonies to \nbattlegrounds for cold war ideological warfare to struggling post-cold \nwar democracies. Today, the continent continues to suffer serious \npolitical problems. The bitter wars in western and southern Africa \ndestroy not only entire countries but prevent subregional and \ncontinental development as well. And clearly, the violence exacerbates \ntransnational problems such as the environment, public health, and \ndemographics.\n  From an economic and political point of view, the United States would \ndo well to transcend its historic view that Africa is of marginal \nimportance. With almost 700 million people and rich natural resources, \nAfrica holds tremendous potential for United States interests. \nDemocratic and free market reforms are sweeping almost all 48 countries \nin the continent, which, with political stability and proper land \nmanagement, will create a booming consumer base and labor market for \nthe next century. As the United States forges new alliances throughout \nthe globe, we would be foolish to leave Africa behind.\n  The United States also bears at least partial responsibility for the \nmilitarization of western and southern Africa during the cold war, \nwhich has led to the humanitarian disasters in Angola and Liberia. For \nthese reasons, the United States has an obligation and an interest to \nhelp wage peace in Africa.\n  In the past, the United States has perceived its policy options in \nAfrica very narrowly: We can either send money, including weapons, or \ndeploy troops. Today, with a mounting Federal deficit and questionable \neffectiveness of some foreign aid programs, Americans have been \ndisinclined to throw money at problems. The use of United States \nmilitary force, especially as part of multilateral operations in places \nlike Somalia has been equally unpopular. With the dissolution of the \nSoviet Union, the United States and Africa can both benefit from an \nexpanded and more creative relationship.\n\n\n                 1. facilitation of peace negotiations\n\n  First, with most of Africa tilting in our direction, the United \nStates and other Western leaders have unprecedented opportunities to \nfacilitate peace negotiations in decades-old conflicts, as we have seen \nin other parts of the world. In Liberia and Angola particularly, where \npeace negotiations are in their second rounds, the United States can \nset a tone--or create an atmosphere for peace--by persuading all \nparties that peace and regional stability are in everyone's interest. \nThe United States has taken an active role in negotiations in both \nthese conflicts, and its tenacity has helped push along an often \nfrustrating and discouraging process. Hopefully, the conclusion of the \nLusaka protocols on November 20 signals a new start to the peace \nprocess in Angola.\n  From our discussions in Liberia it was evident that the \nimplementation of the Cotonou agreement of 1991, the first peace treaty \nin Liberia, had failed. During this past summer, fighting intensified \nand the humanitarian situation worsened. Nongovernmental organizations \n[NGOs]--the lifeline in many of these areas--are leaving because the \nUnited Nations cannot protect them. As a step toward perfecting \nCotonou, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, the new President of the \nEconomic Community of West African States [ECOWAS], mediated the \nAkosombo accords, consolidating factions of the opposition of the LNTG. \nAs followup, he will convene all parties to the Cotonou and Akosombo \nagreements this month to conclude Akosombo II, which hopefully will end \n5 years of civil war and anarchy. With historical United States \ninterest and ties to Liberia, the resolution of this war deserves \nhigher American priority, and we should stand ready to advance the \nprocess of reconciliation and cooperation.\n  Like Liberia, the Angola peace process appears to be on the verge of \na breakthrough. During our visit, the U.N.-sponsored Lusaka talks were \nat a standstill: The Angolan Government had accepted a U.N. proposal, \nbut UNITA had not. Our delegation explored several ways to accommodate \nas well as pressure Dr. Jones Savimbi, leader of UNITA, to accept the \nagreement. We encouraged the principals to seek South African President \nNelson Mandela's help to break the stalemate. Since then President \nMandela has met with Angolan President dos Santos and Zairian President \nMobutu. Dr. Savimbi did not attend.\n  After protracted negotiations, the Angolan Government and the UNITA \nrebel movement initialed the Lusaka protocols on October 31, and, after \nmuch touch and go, including abominable air strikes by the Government \nagainst UNITA, signed a peace pact on November 20. In a major \nconcession, Dr. Savimbi agreed to abandon control of Huambo, the \nprovince of his headquarters, in exchange for the vice-presidency and \ncontrol of some diamond-rich areas. The protocols also call for talks \nbetween the two militaries on the modalities of a ceasefire and \ndisarmament, as mandated in the Bicesse accords.\n  In spite of these achievements, though, I am somewhat skeptical that \nthis is the end of warfare in Angola. Immediately following the \ninitialing, the Government sought to consolidate its gains by launching \naggressive attacks on several UNITA strongholds, forcing UNITA leaders \nto flee. Both sides are heavily armed, and neither trusts the other, or \nfeels the other has demonstrated a commitment to peace. The United \nStates should use its influence to discourage any further offensive in \nAngola by either side, and clarify that we will not support any \nmultilateral aid package to any party that undermines the Lusaka \nprotocols or the spirit of the accords. At the same time, we should \nassist to the extent we can in the daunting tasks which lay before \nAngola: No matter what agreement is reached, the road to reconciliation \nwill be difficult.\n  I also want to mention an important point about United States forces \njoining a United Nations peacekeeping force in Angola. I raised this \nissue during the appropriate meetings in Angola. The unanimous response \nfrom the President, the Foreign Minister and the United Nations Mission \n[UNAVEM] was that U.S. troops were neither expected nor wanted. In \nfact, President dos Santos has submitted to the United Nations a list \nof countries from which he will request peacekeepers; the United States \nwas not included. Furthermore, American pubic opinion would not support \nsuch a deployment. According to a UNAVEM general, the most effective \ncontribution America can make is administrative and financial support, \nan extension of its role in facilitating the peace talks.\n\n\n           2. Halting the Proliferation of Conventional Arms\n\n  A second avenue for American leadership is halting the proliferation \nof conventional arms. Wars continue to ravage Angola and Liberia in \npart because regional governments and peacekeepers lack the resolve to \nintercept the arms trade. The smuggling of weapons prospers because, \namong other reasons, corrupt officials will tolerate the sales if they \nwill earn a profit; military men with an interest in one side will \ntransfer weapons out of ethnic affinities; or, as in the case with \nLiberia, soldiers need additional money to buy food.\n  This is an area which the United States can influence. We should work \nmore closely with other countries to crack down on arms smuggling by \nsanctioning arms suppliers; raising the issue at the highest levels, \nand publicizing violations of arms embargoes and sales moratoria. Upon \nour return, several Senators wrote letters requesting leaders in \nBurkina Faso, Cote D'Ivoire and Nigeria to crackdown on arms trading, \nbut so far no one has come forward willing to work with us. I would \nurge the State Department to leverage the issue.\n  We also urged the United Nations to report publicly on ceasefire \nviolations, such as arms smuggling, a request supported by the United \nNations Security Council on July 13. I would further suggest that the \nUnited Nations Observer Mission in Liberia [UNOMIL] look into halting \nthe trade at the point of origin by tightening border controls in Cote \nd'Ivoire and Guines; and at the point of entry by inspecting all \naircraft destined for Liberia for illegal weapons.\n\n\n                    3. Lessons of America for Africa\n\n  A third approach the United States can take is offering some of its \nown experiences and successes as possible solutions to problems in \nAfrica. While we have not as a nation experienced much of the horrific \nwarfare or extreme poverty that has transpired in Africa, some of our \ndilemmas may relate in some way to problems in Africa. One issue in \nwhich I saw a connection is in the wrenching problem of the widespread \nuse of child soldiers.\n  According to UNICEF, an estimated 6,000 children under the age of 15 \nare combatants in Liberia's civil war. Human Rights Watch/Africa \nreports that children are often conscripted to fight or to monitor \nmilitary checkpoints, and many of them are tortured. This issue \nresonated strongly with representatives of the LNTG when I raised it in \nour meeting. They stressed that children are going into soldiering \nbecause they have to survive, or there is little else to do.\n  I was reminded of a Milwaukee project called ``Hang Tough'' which \nencourages child-gang members to give up their guns and integrate into \nmainstream society. Kids ask, though, ``Hang Tough, for what?'' To \ndisarm, a gang member or a child warrior has to be granted safety and \ngiven a chance. I described to the LNTG the ``midnight basketball'' \nprogram we have in some areas which offers children a positive \nalternative to roaming the streets at night, dodging bullets, and \nrunning drugs. In response, someone said that is what was needed in \nLiberia.\n  America must urge the warring factions in Liberia to end the \nrecruitment of child soldiers in accordance with international human \nrights conventions. And we should support the campaigns of UNICEF and \nthe International Red Cross to ban the use of child soldiers. But we \nmust also give the children an alternative to professional soldiering \nby which they can still feed and protect themselves. A pilot program \nsuch as that in Milwaukee may be useful.\n\n\n            4. Improving Quality of Humanitarian Assistance\n\n  Africa has suffered vicious brutality from these wars. After 19 years \nof war, Luanda is barely a functioning capitol. Though the worst of the \nwar has not reached inner-Luanda, it bears the scars of a city that has \nbeen isolated and starved for years. What was once a beautiful urban \ncenter is today a series of delapidated, nonfunctional buildings. There \nare few young men in the city, and those that remain are either armed, \nor are amputees. Random gunshots are heard all day and night, and \nviolent personal crimes are common. Every few blocks you can see and \nsmell 4-foot heaps  of garbage, which serve as playgrounds for Angolan \nchildren. Hospitals are barely supplied, and in the only children's \nhospital in Luanda up to 15 children die a day.\n\n  In response to early warning signs that up to 1,000 people could die \na day in Luanda, the United Nations, through the World Food Programme, \nestablished the largest food lift in the history of the world. While \nthe humanitarian effort has been successful, I became concerned when I \nlearned that, like in other parts of the world, much of the food and \nvaccines are spoiled or rotten by the time they reach refugee camps. In \nour tour of a refugee camp outside of Luanda, we saw vaccines which had \nnot been properly refrigerated, and were administered with dirty, \nrecycled needles. Bags of rice and wheat were either rotten or infested \nbecause of weather conditions in Angola. In some cases, it is more \ndangerous to get a spoiled product than to get nothing at all.\n  In an effort to maximize the limited supplies sent overseas, we \nshould be applying the necessary technology to ensure that food and \nvaccines are administered intact. At the request of officials in the \ncamps, we looked into available packaging to preserve the food sent to \nAngola. A time-released pesticide within the bags, as suggested by \nsome, is not possible because it would expose consumers directly to \nharmful toxins. I have been able to find no other technologies to \naddress this problem.\n  The Department of Agriculture maintains that approximately 2 percent \nof the world's food assistance is lost because of infestation and/or \nmoisture problems, and that storage problems in-country account for far \nmore problems than packaging does. The reports we heard on the ground \nindicated that closer to 25 percent of all food was spoiled even before \nit reached the camps, and that a great deal more was invested while in \nthe camps. It is imperative that international food assistance efforts \ninclude technical assistance for storage in-country and in the camps, \nand that the donor community send only usable food as assistance. It \nmakes little sense to get through the logistical nightmare of shipping \nfood to crisis areas only to see it spoiled upon distribution.\n  Similarly, we have looked into available mechanisms to preserve the \n``cold chain,'' the path by which vaccines reach their destinations. In \nessence, the cold chain depends upon trained personnel setting up a \nsystem in which vaccines can be transported from cold storage box to \ncold storage box to protect their integrity until they are used. \nBecause so many warring countries lack any kind of refrigeration, \nelectricity, or easy transport, it becomes a complicated process. In \nfact, WHO estimates that 50 percent of vaccines purchased for \ndeveloping countries become unviable in the cold chain. USAID, UNICEF, \nand WHO are working together to develop technologies to strengthen the \ncold chain, but success is of course intertwined with overall \ndevelopment and infrastructure. I will continue to work to apply \navailable technologies to our humanitarian assistance \nprograms, particularly to war-torn areas, in the hope that we get the \nmost for our money.\n\n  These assistance programs are critical to Africa's survival, and \nshould continue. However, in some cases, such as Angola, the Government \nshould be required to contribute more to internal needs. For example, \nthe Government of Angola takes in a reported $3 billion a year in oil \nrevenues. While it claims that all of its resources are tied up in the \nwar effort, the President recently inaugurated his new $10 million \nplace, and the Government just opened up a lavish new central bank in \nthe capitol. Similarly, UNITA earns hefty profits from its diamond \nmines. Instead of supplying supporters with basic services, though, \nUNITA invests more in weapons. As peace nears, the international \ncommunity cannot be expected to provide basic services if the \nGovernment is squandering its money.\n  In the same vein, as the President of the Angolan National Assembly \npointed out, food and medical aid will only save people from dying: It \nwill sustain their lives. In peacetime, Angola has the potential not \nonly to feed itself, but to generate revenue by feeding other countries \nas well. For this reason, donor countries and aid agencies should \npromote ``food for work'' programs to give Africans the tools to grow \nand sell their own food. The United States can organize such packages \nwithout being the sole donor.\n\n\n                  5. Supporting Regional Institutions\n\n  While development assistance for basic needs such as nutrition, \neducation, family planning and immunizations are critical, these \nprograms will lack sustainability unless the political systems in \nAfrica can guarantee stability. As the saying goes, it is more hopeful \nif African solutions can be found for African conflicts.\n  To operationalize this, we should concentrate on strengthening \nregional and subregional institutions, such as the OAU, the \nIntergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGAAD], \nSouthern Africa Development Community [SADC], and the Economic \nCommunity of West African States [ECOWAS]. These organizations could \nprovide a framework for Africans--rather than the United Nations or \nindividual nations--to engage in preventive diplomacy, and resolve \ntheir own conflicts, on their own terms, before they explode. As \nregionalism overtakes the globe, the development of such institutions \nwill be an important factor in the growth of areas such as Asia and the \nMiddle East. Likewise, regional organizations can potentially \nfacilitate peace and growth in Africa, and minimize the cost to the \ninternational community.\n  While the OAU may have been ineffective in the past, it is worthwhile \nand timely to enhance the organization's conflict resolution \ncapabilities. Indeed, with a tightly stretched United Nations and \n``crises fatigue'' by the international community, there is no other \noption. We discussed these issues in Tunisia, and encouraged President \nBen Ali to take an activist approach in restructuring the OAU for its \nnew responsibilities. The African Conflict Resolution Act, introduced \nby Congressman Harry Johnston, chairman of the House Subcommittee on \nAfrican Affairs and enacted last month, is the kind of creative and \nexperimental approach which integrates African and American interests.\n\n\n                6. advancing human rights and democracy\n\n  While democracy and human rights are completely absent in war-torn \nAngola and Liberia, other African countries are making real attempts to \nincorporate these concepts into their government. The United States \nshould support these movements, while emphasizing the links between \nhuman rights and economic development.\n  In Cote D'Ivoire, where the Government is transitioning to a market \neconomy while building democracy, human rights are being sacrificed for \nthe Government's policy of economic austerity. For example, during \nunofficial meetings in Abidjan with human rights activists and a member \nof Parliament, our delegation discovered that human rights has become \nthe underlying theme of the student movement. Upon learning of 18 \nstudents who were missing after protesting cuts in student subsidies, \nthe delegation conveyed the importance of police accountability in a \ndemocracy, and urged the Ivorian Government to inform the families of \nthe whereabouts of those arrested. Within days after our visit, the \nU.S. Embassy in Abidjan told us that the 18 students were released from \npolice custody.\n  Cote D'Ivoire should be commended for its efforts to reconstruct the \ncountry. But the United States should continue to press for the \nprotection of human rights throughout all phases of development. This \nwill not only strengthen democracy, but ensure the success of economic \nreforms.\n  Our policy in Tunisia should be the same. Tunisia has made \nsignificant gains in women's rights, family planning, and protection of \nreligious beliefs. However, it has administered an often oppressive \npolicy toward human rights activists. The Government justifies its \ncrackdown by citing legitimate concerns about Islamic fundamentalism \ndominating its political and military system. With Algeria to its west \nand Libya to its east, Tunisia is trapped between two countries which \ndo not support its new direction. Further, internal support for \nreligious extremism is potentially threatening to the regime.\n  Tunisia is on the verge of becoming a fully developed country. \nHowever, its economic prosperity could be sacrificed if it is not \nfollowed up by political freedom. I believe that it is in the interest \nof the United States to support Tunisia's continued reforms, assist in \nits struggle against violent extremism, and support its integration \ninto the international economy. To do this most effectively, we should \nencourage human rights reform as well. As one Tunisian official said, \nthe moderate government is truly Islamic in its values, while the \nextremists, in many cases, are using religion as a political tool to \ndefeat Western influence in the Arab world. While we have been unable \nto design a policy to combat violent Islamism in the world, I believe \nthat democracy is one of our most potent weapons against extremism.\n\n  With the end of the cold war and its emergence as the strongest power \nin the world, the United States has new responsibilities and new \nopportunities. Through creative approaches to diplomacy, we potentially \nhave the ability to influence events which will determine whether the \nmajority of Africa joins the international community, or whether it \ndestroys itself in the aftermath of its post-colonial struggles. Beyond \na moral imperative to assist Africa in its transition, the United \nStates has a great deal to gain from a properous Africa. If we \nstrategize wisely, the investment we make today can be small, but \ngarner significant advantages later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                  OBSERVATIONS ON U.S. ROLE IN AFRICA\n\tMr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today Senator Paul Simon, chairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, Senator Harry Reid, and I are submitting a report on the our trip to Africa earlier this summer. As a new member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I was exposed firsthand to some of the tragedies in Africa, and, for the first time, had an opportunity to meet with international actors in the region, as well as reflect on the role the United States can play in Africa. I benefited greatly from Senator Simon's and Senator Reid's experience and expertise during the trip, and thank them for their leadership on these issues.\n\tThe severe problems in Africa today are, by and large, the consequences of colonial and post-colonial struggles. In the past decades, countries such as Angola have transitioned from colonies to battlegrounds for cold war ideological warfare to struggling post-cold war democracies. Today, the continent continues to suffer serious political problems. The bitter wars in western and southern Africa destroy not only entire countries but prevent subregional and continental development as well. And clearly, the violence exacerbates transnational problems such as the environment, public health, and demographics.\n\tFrom an economic and political point of view, the United States would do well to transcend its historic view that Africa is of marginal importance. With almost 700 million people and rich natural resources, Africa holds tremendous potential for United States interests. Democratic and free market reforms are sweeping almost all 48 countries in the continent, which, with political stability and proper land management, will create a booming consumer base and labor market for the next century. As the United States forges new alliances throughout the globe, we would be foolish to leave Africa behind.\n\tThe United States also bears at least partial responsibility for the militarization of western and southern Africa during the cold war, which has led to the humanitarian disasters in Angola and Liberia. For these reasons, the United States has an obligation and an interest to help wage peace in Africa.\n\tIn the past, the United States has perceived its policy options in Africa very narrowly: We can either send money, including weapons, or deploy troops. Today, with a mounting Federal deficit and questionable effectiveness of some foreign aid programs, Americans have been disinclined to throw money at problems. The use of United States military force, especially as part of multilateral operations in places like Somalia has been equally unpopular. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the United States and Africa can both benefit from an expanded and more creative relationship.\n\n\n                 1. facilitation of peace negotiations\n\n\tFirst, with most of Africa tilting in our direction, the United States and other Western leaders have unprecedented opportunities to facilitate peace negotiations in decades-old conflicts, as we have seen in other parts of the world. In Liberia and Angola particularly, where peace negotiations are in their second rounds, the United States can set a tone--or create an atmosphere for peace--by persuading all parties that peace and regional stability are in everyone's interest. The United States has taken an active role in negotiations in both these conflicts, and its tenacity has helped push along an often frustrating and discouraging process. Hopefully, the conclusion of the Lusaka protocols on November 20 signals a new start to the peace process in Angola.\n\tFrom our discussions in Liberia it was evident that the implementation of the Cotonou agreement of 1991, the first peace treaty in Liberia, had failed. During this past summer, fighting intensified and the humanitarian situation worsened. Nongovernmental organizations [NGOs]--the lifeline in many of these areas--are leaving because the United Nations cannot protect them. As a step toward perfecting Cotonou, Ghanaian President Jerry Rawlings, the new President of the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS], mediated the Akosombo accords, consolidating factions of the opposition of the LNTG. As followup, he will convene all parties to the Cotonou and Akosombo agreements this month to conclude Akosombo II, which hopefully will end 5 years of civil war and anarchy. With historical United States interest and ties to Liberia, the resolution of this war deserves higher American priority, and we should stand ready to advance the process of reconciliation and cooperation.\n\tLike Liberia, the Angola peace process appears to be on the verge of a breakthrough. During our visit, the U.N.-sponsored Lusaka talks were at a standstill: The Angolan Government had accepted a U.N. proposal, but UNITA had not. Our delegation explored several ways to accommodate as well as pressure Dr. Jones Savimbi, leader of UNITA, to accept the agreement. We encouraged the principals to seek South African President Nelson Mandela's help to break the stalemate. Since then President Mandela has met with Angolan President dos Santos and Zairian President Mobutu. Dr. Savimbi did not attend.\n\tAfter protracted negotiations, the Angolan Government and the UNITA rebel movement initialed the Lusaka protocols on October 31, and, after much touch and go, including abominable air strikes by the Government against UNITA, signed a peace pact on November 20. In a major concession, Dr. Savimbi agreed to abandon control of Huambo, the province of his headquarters, in exchange for the vice-presidency and control of some diamond-rich areas. The protocols also call for talks between the two militaries on the modalities of a ceasefire and disarmament, as mandated in the Bicesse accords.\n\tIn spite of these achievements, though, I am somewhat skeptical that this is the end of warfare in Angola. Immediately following the initialing, the Government sought to consolidate its gains by launching aggressive attacks on several UNITA strongholds, forcing UNITA leaders to flee. Both sides are heavily armed, and neither trusts the other, or feels the other has demonstrated a commitment to peace. The United States should use its influence to discourage any further offensive in Angola by either side, and clarify that we will not support any multilateral aid package to any party that undermines the Lusaka protocols or the spirit of the accords. At the same time, we should assist to the extent we can in the daunting tasks which lay before Angola: No matter what agreement is reached, the road to reconciliation will be difficult.\n\tI also want to mention an important point about United States forces joining a United Nations peacekeeping force in Angola. I raised this issue during the appropriate meetings in Angola. The unanimous response from the President, the Foreign Minister and the United Nations Mission [UNAVEM] was that U.S. troops were neither expected nor wanted. In fact, President dos Santos has submitted to the United Nations a list of countries from which he will request peacekeepers; the United States was not included. Furthermore, American pubic opinion would not support such a deployment. According to a UNAVEM general, the most effective contribution America can make is administrative and financial support, an extension of its role in facilitating the peace talks.\n\n\n           2. Halting the Proliferation of Conventional Arms\n\n\tA second avenue for American leadership is halting the proliferation of conventional arms. Wars continue to ravage Angola and Liberia in part because regional governments and peacekeepers lack the resolve to intercept the arms trade. The smuggling of weapons prospers because, among other reasons, corrupt officials will tolerate the sales if they will earn a profit; military men with an interest in one side will transfer weapons out of ethnic affinities; or, as in the case with Liberia, soldiers need additional money to buy food.\n\tThis is an area which the United States can influence. We should work more closely with other countries to crack down on arms smuggling by sanctioning arms suppliers; raising the issue at the highest levels, and publicizing violations of arms embargoes and sales moratoria. Upon our return, several Senators wrote letters requesting leaders in Burkina Faso, Cote D'Ivoire and Nigeria to crackdown on arms trading, but so far no one has come forward willing to work with us. I would urge the State Department to leverage the issue.\n\tWe also urged the United Nations to report publicly on ceasefire violations, such as arms smuggling, a request supported by the United Nations Security Council on July 13. I would further suggest that the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia [UNOMIL] look into halting the trade at the point of origin by tightening border controls in Cote d'Ivoire and Guines; and at the point of entry by inspecting all aircraft destined for Liberia for illegal weapons.\n\n\n                    3. Lessons of America for Africa\n\n\tA third approach the United States can take is offering some of its own experiences and successes as possible solutions to problems in Africa. While we have not as a nation experienced much of the horrific warfare or extreme poverty that has transpired in Africa, some of our dilemmas may relate in some way to problems in Africa. One issue in which I saw a connection is in the wrenching problem of the widespread use of child soldiers.\n\tAccording to UNICEF, an estimated 6,000 children under the age of 15 are combatants in Liberia's civil war. Human Rights Watch/Africa reports that children are often conscripted to fight or to monitor military checkpoints, and many of them are tortured. This issue resonated strongly with representatives of the LNTG when I raised it in our meeting. They stressed that children are going into soldiering because they have to survive, or there is little else to do.\n\tI was reminded of a Milwaukee project called ``Hang Tough'' which encourages child-gang members to give up their guns and integrate into mainstream society. Kids ask, though, ``Hang Tough, for what?'' To disarm, a gang member or a child warrior has to be granted safety and given a chance. I described to the LNTG the ``midnight basketball'' program we have in some areas which offers children a positive alternative to roaming the streets at night, dodging bullets, and running drugs. In response, someone said that is what was needed in Liberia.\n\tAmerica must urge the warring factions in Liberia to end the recruitment of child soldiers in accordance with international human rights conventions. And we should support the campaigns of UNICEF and the International Red Cross to ban the use of child soldiers. But we must also give the children an alternative to professional soldiering by which they can still feed and protect themselves. A pilot program such as that in Milwaukee may be useful.\n\n\n            4. Improving Quality of Humanitarian Assistance\n\n\tAfrica has suffered vicious brutality from these wars. After 19 years of war, Luanda is barely a functioning capitol. Though the worst of the war has not reached inner-Luanda, it bears the scars of a city that has been isolated and starved for years. What was once a beautiful urban center is today a series of delapidated, nonfunctional buildings. There are few young men in the city, and those that remain are either armed, or are amputees. Random gunshots are heard all day and night, and violent personal crimes are common. Every few blocks you can see and smell 4-foot heaps  of garbage, which serve as playgrounds for Angolan children. Hospitals are barely supplied, and in the only children's hospital in Luanda up to 15 children die a day.\n\n\tIn response to early warning signs that up to 1,000 people could die a day in Luanda, the United Nations, through the World Food Programme, established the largest food lift in the history of the world. While the humanitarian effort has been successful, I became concerned when I learned that, like in other parts of the world, much of the food and vaccines are spoiled or rotten by the time they reach refugee camps. In our tour of a refugee camp outside of Luanda, we saw vaccines which had not been properly refrigerated, and were administered with dirty, recycled needles. Bags of rice and wheat were either rotten or infested because of weather conditions in Angola. In some cases, it is more dangerous to get a spoiled product than to get nothing at all.\n\tIn an effort to maximize the limited supplies sent overseas, we should be applying the necessary technology to ensure that food and vaccines are administered intact. At the request of officials in the camps, we looked into available packaging to preserve the food sent to Angola. A time-released pesticide within the bags, as suggested by some, is not possible because it would expose consumers directly to harmful toxins. I have been able to find no other technologies to address this problem.\n\tThe Department of Agriculture maintains that approximately 2 percent of the world's food assistance is lost because of infestation and/or moisture problems, and that storage problems in-country account for far more problems than packaging does. The reports we heard on the ground indicated that closer to 25 percent of all food was spoiled even before it reached the camps, and that a great deal more was invested while in the camps. It is imperative that international food assistance efforts include technical assistance for storage in-country and in the camps, and that the donor community send only usable food as assistance. It makes little sense to get through the logistical nightmare of shipping food to crisis areas only to see it spoiled upon distribution.\n\tSimilarly, we have looked into available mechanisms to preserve the ``cold chain,'' the path by which vaccines reach their destinations. In essence, the cold chain depends upon trained personnel setting up a system in which vaccines can be transported from cold storage box to cold storage box to protect their integrity until they are used. Because so many warring countries lack any kind of refrigeration, electricity, or easy transport, it becomes a complicated process. In fact, WHO estimates that 50 percent of vaccines purchased for developing countries become unviable in the cold chain. USAID, UNICEF, and WHO are working together to develop technologies to strengthen the cold chain, but success is of course intertwined with overall development and infrastructure. I will continue to work to apply available technologies to our humanitarian assistance programs, particularly to war-torn areas, in the hope that we get the most for our money.\n\n\tThese assistance programs are critical to Africa's survival, and should continue. However, in some cases, such as Angola, the Government should be required to contribute more to internal needs. For example, the Government of Angola takes in a reported $3 billion a year in oil revenues. While it claims that all of its resources are tied up in the war effort, the President recently inaugurated his new $10 million place, and the Government just opened up a lavish new central bank in the capitol. Similarly, UNITA earns hefty profits from its diamond mines. Instead of supplying supporters with basic services, though, UNITA invests more in weapons. As peace nears, the international community cannot be expected to provide basic services if the Government is squandering its money.\n\tIn the same vein, as the President of the Angolan National Assembly pointed out, food and medical aid will only save people from dying: It will sustain their lives. In peacetime, Angola has the potential not only to feed itself, but to generate revenue by feeding other countries as well. For this reason, donor countries and aid agencies should promote ``food for work'' programs to give Africans the tools to grow and sell their own food. The United States can organize such packages without being the sole donor.\n\n\n                  5. Supporting Regional Institutions\n\n\tWhile development assistance for basic needs such as nutrition, education, family planning and immunizations are critical, these programs will lack sustainability unless the political systems in Africa can guarantee stability. As the saying goes, it is more hopeful if African solutions can be found for African conflicts.\n\tTo operationalize this, we should concentrate on strengthening regional and subregional institutions, such as the OAU, the Intergovernmental Authority on Drought and Development [IGAAD], Southern Africa Development Community [SADC], and the Economic Community of West African States [ECOWAS]. These organizations could provide a framework for Africans--rather than the United Nations or individual nations--to engage in preventive diplomacy, and resolve their own conflicts, on their own terms, before they explode. As regionalism overtakes the globe, the development of such institutions will be an important factor in the growth of areas such as Asia and the Middle East. Likewise, regional organizations can potentially facilitate peace and growth in Africa, and minimize the cost to the international community.\n\tWhile the OAU may have been ineffective in the past, it is worthwhile and timely to enhance the organization's conflict resolution capabilities. Indeed, with a tightly stretched United Nations and ``crises fatigue'' by the international community, there is no other option. We discussed these issues in Tunisia, and encouraged President Ben Ali to take an activist approach in restructuring the OAU for its new responsibilities. The African Conflict Resolution Act, introduced by Congressman Harry Johnston, chairman of the House Subcommittee on African Affairs and enacted last month, is the kind of creative and experimental approach which integrates African and American interests.\n\n\n                6. advancing human rights and democracy\n\n\tWhile democracy and human rights are completely absent in war-torn Angola and Liberia, other African countries are making real attempts to incorporate these concepts into their government. The United States should support these movements, while emphasizing the links between human rights and economic development.\n\tIn Cote D'Ivoire, where the Government is transitioning to a market economy while building democracy, human rights are being sacrificed for the Government's policy of economic austerity. For example, during unofficial meetings in Abidjan with human rights activists and a member of Parliament, our delegation discovered that human rights has become the underlying theme of the student movement. Upon learning of 18 students who were missing after protesting cuts in student subsidies, the delegation conveyed the importance of police accountability in a democracy, and urged the Ivorian Government to inform the families of the whereabouts of those arrested. Within days after our visit, the U.S. Embassy in Abidjan told us that the 18 students were released from police custody.\n\tCote D'Ivoire should be commended for its efforts to reconstruct the country. But the United States should continue to press for the protection of human rights throughout all phases of development. This will not only strengthen democracy, but ensure the success of economic reforms.\n\tOur policy in Tunisia should be the same. Tunisia has made significant gains in women's rights, family planning, and protection of religious beliefs. However, it has administered an often oppressive policy toward human rights activists. The Government justifies its crackdown by citing legitimate concerns about Islamic fundamentalism dominating its political and military system. With Algeria to its west and Libya to its east, Tunisia is trapped between two countries which do not support its new direction. Further, internal support for religious extremism is potentially threatening to the regime.\n\tTunisia is on the verge of becoming a fully developed country. However, its economic prosperity could be sacrificed if it is not followed up by political freedom. I believe that it is in the interest of the United States to support Tunisia's continued reforms, assist in its struggle against violent extremism, and support its integration into the international economy. To do this most effectively, we should encourage human rights reform as well. As one Tunisian official said, the moderate government is truly Islamic in its values, while the extremists, in many cases, are using religion as a political tool to defeat Western influence in the Arab world. While we have been unable to design a policy to combat violent Islamism in the world, I believe that democracy is one of our most potent weapons against extremism.\n\n\tWith the end of the cold war and its emergence as the strongest power in the world, the United States has new responsibilities and new opportunities. Through creative approaches to diplomacy, we potentially have the ability to influence events which will determine whether the majority of Africa joins the international community, or whether it destroys itself in the aftermath of its post-colonial struggles. Beyond a moral imperative to assist Africa in its transition, the United States has a great deal to gain from a properous Africa. If we strategize wisely, the investment we make today can be small, but garner significant advantages later.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Russell D.

Mr. President, later this month family, friends \nand fans of the great band leader, Glenn Miller, will assemble at \nArlington National Cemetery for a memorial service to honor his memory. \nThis event will commemorate the 50th anniversary of his disappearance \nduring World War II.\n  I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of this man who \nI am proud to say was born in Clarinda, IA on March 1, 1904. He grew up \nin neighboring Missouri and founded the very successful Glenn Miller \nOrchestra. The band was synonomous with his distinctive ``big band'' \nstyle of music and gave us many memorable songs including ``Moonlight \nSerenade'' and ``Little Brown Jug''.\n  Glenn Miller was a gifted musician with a popular band when he \nenlisted in the armed forces during the Second World War.

Mr. President, this past summer the Clinton \nadministration chose to tighten the economic embargo and accept more \nCuban immigrants in response to thousands of Cuban rafters who set sail \nto Florida. I question its goals in tightening the embargo against \nCuba. Tightening the embargo, which is already tighter than the one we \nhave against Iraq, could lead to a major crisis in Cuba. The embargo \nagainst Cuba only makes the situation there worse by restricting the \nsupply of food and medicine to people who desperately need it, without \nlessening Castro's grip on the Cuban political machinery. Our recent \nexperience in Eastern Europe has shown us that sealing Communist \ncountries from contact with democratic societies is not the answer. \nProgress can be obtained by encouraging a steady flow of information \nand goods between Cubans who seek change and Americans.\n  During the 104th Congress, the administration and Congress should \ntake a close look at our current policy toward Cuba. It is in the \ninterest of the United States to encourage democracy and the rule of \nlaw in Cuba, but it is not in our interest to continue a policy that \ncauses needless suffering and that has proven unsuccessful. I urge my \ncolleagues to read the following article from the National Journal, \n``The Cuban Conundrum,'' by Bruce Stokes. It provides a good outline of \ncurrent U.S. policy toward Cuba and what it could lead to.\n  I ask that the article be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the National Journal, Sept. 17, 1994]\n\n                          The Cuban Conundrum\n\n                           (By Bruce Stokes)\n\n       In recent weeks, the searing television images of women and \n     children in inner tubes and flimsy rafts braving the shark-\n     invested waters of the Straits of Florida to flee Cuba have \n     momentarily overshadowed the more complex, underlying story \n     of the economic collapse that sparked the exodus.\n       While the Clinton Administration has, for the time being, \n     apparently resolved the crisis by agreeing to take in more \n     Cubans as legal immigrants, the long-term challenge that \n     faces Havana--and Washington--is the reconstruction of the \n     Cuban economy through its transformation, in one form or \n     another, from a socialist to a market economy.\n       The stakes in such a transformation are high.\n       ``An early restructuring to a market-oriented economy could \n     produce a very quick and robust recovery from Cuba's present \n     crisis situation.'' said Ernest H. Preeg, an economist at the \n     Washington-based Center for Strategic and International \n     Studies.\n       But failure could unleash a new torrent of Cuban \n     migration--legal or illegal--to the United States. Already, \n     more people have tried to flee Cuba this year than in the \n     previous decade. And with Cuba's geographic proximity to \n     Florida, a large Cuban-American population to welcome \n     refugees and the wide disparity between the standard of \n     living in Havana and what's available in Key West, just 90 \n     miles away, experts say it's possible that as many as a \n     million Cubans may want to emigrate to the United States \n     rather than wait for better times in Cuba.\n       The experts seem to agree that the transformation of Cuba's \n     economy has already begun. But there's no agreement on how \n     far it has gone or how much further Cuban President Fidel \n     Castro is willing to go.\n       ``Castro is gradually losing power to market forces, and \n     the reform process appears irresistible,'' Carmelo Mesa-Lago, \n     a professor of Cuban studies at the University of Miami, \n     said. But unfortunately, he added, ``I don't really think \n     they understand how the market works.''\n       And lulled by 35 years of false hopes of Castro's imminent \n     demise, few American economists or U.S. government officials \n     have begun to prepare for the day when a new, transitional \n     Cuban government will have to make the market work or risk \n     backsliding into deeper economic and political chaos.\n       ``This thing is going to catch them with their pants down, \n     and they are unprepared,'' said Armando M. Lago, the \n     president of Ecosometrics Inc., a Bethesda (Md.)-based \n     consulting company and the current president of the \n     Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy.\n       The Clinton Administration's instinctive reaction to the \n     new flood of Cuban boat people was to tighten the current \n     U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. It was decision driven more by \n     domestic political considerations--chief among them the \n     desire to placate the conservative Cuban-American community--\n     rather than with any forethought of its debilitating impact \n     on emerging market forces inside Cuba.\n       It's been up to Congress and some Cuban-American economists \n     to begin to lay out a new economic strategy for dealing with \n     Cuba. Their plans include a lifting of the embargo calibrated \n     to political and economic reforms inside the island nation, \n     detailed blueprints for the macro-economic stabilization of a \n     transitional Cuban economy and guidelines for foreign \n     investment and trade expansion.\n       When and whether these plans are tested, of course, depends \n     on how long Castro remains in power.\n\n\n                            desmerengamiento\n\n       Like a giant, tempting meringue, the Cuban economy is \n     collapsing in on itself, its frothy exterior no longer \n     supported by the hot air that first gave it form. This \n     process--what the Spanish call desmerengamiento--is well-\n     known to pastry chefs the world over, but economists have \n     never seen such a dramatic economic contraction.\n       From 1989-93, the Cuban economy shrank by nearly half, \n     according to most reliable estimates. This contraction \n     exceeds that experienced by Cuba during the Great \n     Depression in the 1930s, Mesa-Lago said, and is much worse \n     than the economic deterioration suffered in recent years \n     in Eastern Europe.\n       The Cuban economy is rapidly disengaging from the global \n     marketplace. In 1993, the value of Cuba's exports and imports \n     was less than a third of what it was in 1989. (See table) \n     Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, once Castro's \n     main trading partners, will no longer sell him machinery and \n     oil at cut-rate prices, and they refuse to buy Cuban sugar at \n     prices far in excess of the world market price.\n       Reflecting this economic breakdown, the value of the Cuban \n     peso has plummeted. While a Cuban peso is still officially \n     worth $1, the black market exchange rate in August was 130 to \n     $1.\n       ``Cuba has become an undeveloping country,'' Preeg said. \n     Nothing works.\n       In Havana, power blackouts are a daily occurrence. With \n     gasoline and spare parts in short supply, automobiles, trucks \n     and buses are disappearing in favor of bicycles and ox carts. \n     Unemployment is soaring because at any given time more than \n     two-thirds of Cuba's industrial plants are closed, owning to \n     a lack of power or raw materials.\n       Government rationing provides only about half of the food \n     that average families need to survive, forcing them to turn \n     to the underground economy. And while state-set prices for \n     many basic goods and services have changed little in the past \n     three decades, no such constraints exist on the black market, \n     where inflation is rampant. In May, Cuba's monthly minimum \n     wage would buy only a two-pound chicken or a pound of pork or \n     four liters of milk in unofficial markets.\n       In a society that once prided itself on meeting basic human \n     needs, the human toll of food shortages in mounting. \n     Infectious diseases that were once thought to have been \n     eradicated, such as tuberculosis and malaria, are returning. \n     In early 1993, the U.N. Children's Fund reported that half of \n     all Cuban infants in their first year of life showed symptoms \n     of anemia.\n       To reflate the collapsing Cuban economic meringue, the \n     Castro government has introduced some elements of a market \n     economy into what was once an autarkic socialist state. Some \n     foreign investment is now allowed. To encourage farmers to \n     grow more food, many state farms have been turned into \n     cooperatives, and the prices of agricultural products have \n     been increased somewhat to stimulate production. Taxi \n     drivers, hairdressers and workers in more than 130 other \n     categories can now sell their services on the open market. \n     And the widespread use of the dollar as the preferred medium \n     of exchange has been legalized.\n       But the economic reform process is a halting one, raising \n     uncertainty about the evolution of Cuban capitalism. In the \n     past few months. For example, the government has arrested \n     people for making ``too much'' money in the flourishing \n     dollar economy. The scope of permitted ``family business'' \n     has been scaled back. And tax rates have been raised on self-\n     employment income.\n       ``The adopted measures and reforms are incoherent, \n     inconsistent and ill-conceived in design; incomplete in \n     scope; incorrect and delayed in execution; and, consequently, \n     inadequate in impact,'' George Plinio Montalvan, a former \n     chief economist of the Organization of American States, said.\n       The problem, Mesa-Lago said, is that ``Castro listens to \n     different ideas and implements only those that appeal to him \n     most--he lacks a blueprint.''\n\n\n                         FIDELISMO WITOUT FIDEL\n\n       Most experts see only two designs for the Cuban economy of \n     the future.\n       Now that the emigration turmoil has subsided, the likeliest \n     scenario is that Cuba will renew its tentative reforms and \n     evolve toward a Nicaraguan-style economy, in which the state \n     continues to play a major role. Under such conditions, there \n     will be an increasing number of small and medium-sized \n     private companies. But the commanding heights of the economy \n     will be controlled by large, public enterprises. And while at \n     some point Castro will step down or die, his cadre of \n     bureaucratic apparatchiks will continue to drive economic \n     decision making.\n       But this option holds little attraction to the outside \n     world because, at best, it would provide only modest economic \n     growth. And the paucity of serious research on such an \n     eventuality is primarily because many conservative Cuban-\n     Americans, who provide much of the money for academic work on \n     Cuba, see a Nicaraguan-style Cuba--what they call ``Fidelismo \n     Without Fidel''--as their worst nightmare. It would delay \n     indefinitely the emergence of a truly free market economy in \n     Cuba. And, more important to some of them, it would postpone \n     their own return to power.\n       ``There is distaste among many Cuban-Americans to consider \n     the unconsiderable,'' admitted Matias F. Travieso-Diaz, a \n     partner in the Washington law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & \n     Trowbridge.\n       The scenario preferred by most Cuban-Americans and \n     Administration officials is a fairly rapid transition to a \n     market-style economy. Most economists agree that only this \n     course will provide Cuba with the rate of sustained economic \n     growth needed to bring unemployment down to manageable \n     levels, while continuing to provide sufficient social \n     services to ensure political stability.\n       The first obstacle on this path is the U.S. embargo against \n     trade with, and investment in, Cuba.\n       The 1961 Foreign Assistance Act first imposed the trade \n     ban, both to pressure Cuba into compensating Americans for \n     property nationalized by the revolutionary regime and to \n     punish the Castro government for its embrace of Communism. \n     The 1992 Cuban Democracy Act extended the embargo by denying \n     foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms the licenses they need to \n     trade with Cuba. And to signal its dissatisfaction with the \n     Cuban government's failure to curb the current exodus of boat \n     people, the Clinton Administration has banned all dollar \n     remittances to Cuba from relatives or friends living in the \n     United States. (Previously, remittances of as much as $500 \n     per quarter were permitted.)\n       It is an article of faith among older, more conservative \n     Cuban-Americans--and the politicians they have supported--\n     that any loosening of these economic screws will only prop up \n     the Castro government and postpone the transition to a market \n     economy. To this end, hard-liners have supported escalation \n     of the embargo through imposition of an economic blockade on \n     Cuba.\n       Younger, more moderate Cuban-Americans and critics of the \n     current U.S. policy toward Cuba question why trade with China \n     and Vietnam is viewed as a means of liberalizing their \n     socialist economies, while trade with Cuba is rejected as \n     counterproductive.\n       ``If the goal is as peaceful and as productive a transition \n     as possible,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of \n     economics at Smith College, ``engagement rather than \n     isolation has proven to be a better policy.''\n       But engagement is prohibited by the Cuban Democracy Act, \n     which requires democratic elections in Cuba before \n     the embargo can be lifted. Such sequencing flies in the \n     face of the experience in Eastern Europe, where democracy \n     came at the end of the transition from socialism, well \n     after the seeds of capitalism had been planted and \n     nurtured and had borne fruit. And, said Rep. Charles B. \n     Rangel, D-N.Y., ``we are losing billions of dollars in \n     business opportunities to invest and trade with Cuba.''\n       There is growing sentiment on Capitol Hill to reverse the \n     policy of isolating Cuba. Rangle has proposed the Free Trade \n     With Cuba Act, which would repeal the Cuban Democracy Act and \n     the embargo; open up travel, mail and telecommunications \n     services; and launch new negotiations on U.S. economic claims \n     against Havana and on the human rights situation in Cuba. \n     Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman of the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee, and Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., the \n     chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, have \n     proposed a similar unilateral lifting of the ban on travel, \n     remittances and commercial sales of food. And Rep. Robert \n     Menendez, D-N.J., has introduced legislation that would offer \n     a transitional Cuban government humanitarian assistance and \n     help in downsizing its military.\n       Rolando H. Casteneda, a senior operations officer at the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, and Montalvan have suggested \n     a step-by-step approach, linking the expansion of U.S. \n     economic ties with Cuba to Cuban political liberalization. \n     They suggest that the United States take the first step by \n     permitting commercial sales of U.S. food, medicine and \n     medical instruments to Cuba and rescinding the recent \n     prohibition on all remittances. If Cuba then agrees to free \n     political prisoners and adhere to international human rights \n     conventions, Castaneda and Montalvan say, the United States \n     should lift what's left of the trade embargo. If Havana \n     implements market-based economic reforms, Washington in \n     return wouldn't stand in the way of International Monetary \n     Fund (IMF) loans to Cuba. Finally, once Cuba adopts a new \n     constitution and has free and fair elections, they say, the \n     United States would lift its ban on travel and investment, \n     support a restructuring and some forgiveness of Cuban debt \n     and further open the U.S. market to Cuban goods.\n       None of these proposals is likely to pass Congress this \n     session. And all face an uphill political fight.\n       ``The idea that opening a McDonald's in Havana will make \n     Castro into a Thomas Jefferson blows my mind,'' said Jose S. \n     Sorzano, the chairman of Austin Group Inc., a consulting firm \n     in Arlington, Va. Once the embargo is cracked, conservatives \n     predict, the pressure from U.S. commercial interests to \n     quickly normalize economic relations without regard to \n     political concessions by Castro will prove inexorable and \n     Washington will end up trading something for nothing.\n       Moreover, for most lawmakers, there is potential pain and \n     little gain for supporting an end to the embargo. The \n     business community is not pressing for liberalization. In the \n     past, lawmakers who have advocated an easing of tensions with \n     Cuba have been Red-baited. Finally, if the Administration \n     dares to change its stance and supports a calibrated \n     relaxation of the embargo, conservative Cuban-Americans have \n     threatened to pillory President Clinton for waffling on yet \n     another foreign policy issue.\n\n\n                      RESTITUTION V. COMPENSATION\n\n       Once the economic transformation of Cuba has begun, the \n     biggest obstacle to normalization of economic relations with \n     the United States will be the claims against the Cuban \n     government by Americans whose property in Cuba was \n     nationalized after the revolution.\n       ``It's the crazy-aunt-in-the-basement issue,'' said Robert \n     E. Freer Jr., a senior partner in the Washington law firm of \n     Freer & McGarry. And like the unpredictable relative it's a \n     highly emotional issue likely to cause hitches in lifting the \n     embargo and serious clashes between the exile community and \n     the people in Cuba today.\n       In the 1960s the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission \n     valued the nationalized property--primarily industrial \n     plants, commercial buildings and farmland--at $1.8 billion. \n     It's now valued at $5.6 billion. And then there's all the \n     confiscated property, much of it residential, that was \n     owned at the time of the revolution by Cuban citizens who \n     subsequently became U.S. citizens.\n       Claimants have different interests in resolving the status \n     of the assets. Some large U.S. corporations, especially those \n     with a brand name to protect, want restitution of their \n     original property. Similarly, many middle and upper-class \n     Cuban-American refugees who left a lot of property behind in \n     Cuba have an economic and emotional stake in the return of \n     their original holdings. Others who have little desire to \n     return to Cuba would be happy with financial compensation for \n     their losses. And some Cuban-Americans who made their \n     fortunes in the United States only care that the confiscated \n     properties be privatized at auction so that they will have a \n     crack at them.\n       Freer, who's the general counsel to the U.S.-Cuba Business \n     Council, contends that restitution will ensure an immediate \n     infusion of foreign investment and modern management in Cuba.\n       But fights over restitution delayed the privatization of \n     property in Eastern Germany for years, holding up foreign \n     investment. Moreover, Montalvan argued, ``restitution would \n     install the same distribution of wealth in Cuba that you had \n     before the revolution.'' Americans would control 90 per cent \n     of Cuba's electricity generating capacity, its entire \n     telephone system, most of its mining industry and some of its \n     best land, providing dry tinder to rekindle Cuban \n     nationalism.\n       Compensation--on the surface, a more straightforward \n     resolution of the problem--sparks similar controversy. It \n     could burden an already indebted Cuba with new foreign \n     obligations. It took the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission \n     six years to come up with estimates of losses. ``To ask a \n     country in the midst of rebuilding to administer that kind of \n     thing, or deal with claimants on an individual basis, is \n     absolute folly,'' Montalvan said.\n       Nevertheless, Travieso-Diaz said, ``the paramount issue is, \n     when and how is the title going to be put to rest?'' \n     Claimants' lawyers have threatened to use the courts to delay \n     the privatization of their former properties until some \n     restitution or compensation is made. To avoid that \n     economically debilitating eventuality, Travieso-Diaz \n     suggested that some partial compensation for claims, some \n     percentage on the dollar, is inevitable.\n       The sleeper political issue could be what to do with small \n     and medium-sized businesses, which have sentimental and real \n     estate value, and residential property. These were the \n     hardest claims to resolve in Eastern Germany and the Baltic \n     states. The Cuban-American community has largely disavowed \n     any interest in restitution of former residences. But this \n     is, in part, a tactical move to counter Castro's propaganda \n     that Cuban-Americans want to return to steal people's homes. \n     Notwithstanding such disavowals, reclaiming family homesteads \n     could suddenly have a powerful emotional appeal once the \n     opportunity arises.\n\n\n                          containing inflation\n\n       Clearing the underbrush of the embargo and foreign claims \n     issues merely sets the stage for tackling the fundamental \n     economic challenges facing Cuba's transition to a market \n     economy.\n       The first problem is to contain the seemingly inevitable \n     inflation that's triggered by the end of socialism. The \n     government subsidies inherent in a state-run economy mask \n     inflation by making up the difference between what consumers \n     pay and what the price of a good or service would be if the \n     value were determined strictly by supply and demand. As \n     Cuba's economic crisis worsened in the past few years, \n     subsidies grew, and by 1993 Cuba's budget deficit was equal \n     to a third of the value of its economy. By printing money to \n     cover those subsidies as domestic production shrank, the \n     Cuban government provided average citizens with plenty of \n     money, but little to buy. As a result, a huge volume of \n     excess liquidity has been built up that will feed \n     inflationary fires if restraints on prices are lifted.\n       To stimulate production to meet demand and get the Cuban \n     economy moving again, most economists recommend an immediate \n     end to price controls, which could lead to a tripling or \n     quadrupling in prices. The trick will be to stabilize those \n     prices once they have initially adjusted so that the \n     inflation rate doesn't spiral out of control.\n       This requires curbing the flow of money into the economy \n     and sopping up some of the excess liquidity. Economists \n     prescribe a reduction in government spending and some hard \n     budget constraints; a freeze on public-sector wages and a \n     cutback in public-sector employment, including the military; \n     the imposition of new taxes; and a positive real interest \n     rate to encourage savings.\n\n\n                          capital from abroad\n\n       Domestic macroeconomic stability is a necessary, but not \n     sufficient, condition for a robust economic recovery in Cuba. \n     If Cuba is to climb out of its economic hole, it also needs \n     new capital from abroad.\n       Cuba's needs are great. In the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union \n     pumped an estimated $4.4 billion a year into Cuba's \n     economy--about 15 per cent of its gross national product. \n     With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, that \n     largess ended, and Cuba will somehow need to make up the \n     shortfall. In addition, Manuel Cereijo, a professor of \n     engineering at Florida International University in Miami, \n     estimates that Cuba will need $3.6 billion over a decade \n     to reconstruct its rundown transportation system and \n     another $2.5 billion to modernize its telecommunications \n     system.\n       Simply lifting the current ban on remittances, economists \n     say, could inject as much as $1 billion a year into Cuba's \n     economy.\n       Cuba has an estimated $10.8 billion debt with European and \n     Asian lenders and a 20 billion-ruble obligation (about $100 \n     million at the current exchange rate) to the former Soviet \n     Union. To obtain some breathing room during its economic \n     transition, economists say, Havana will first have to \n     negotiate a moratorium on repaying its debts and then \n     renegotiate them at some fraction of their original value. \n     There is ample international precedent for such debt \n     restructuring, and the lenders should be obliging because \n     Cuba hasn't paid any interest or principal on its debt since \n     the mid-1980s.\n       A speedy resolution of the debt question would open lending \n     windows at the IMF and World Bank. Depending on the initial \n     exchange rate, Cuba's per capita income may be judged to be \n     low enough to qualify for concessional loans, a definite \n     plus. Economists estimate that Havana will initially need to \n     borrow at least $750 million a year. The main sticking point \n     could be bureaucratic inertia.\n       ``From the time Latvia turned democratic and applied for a \n     loan and got it, it took 18 months,'' economist Lago said. \n     ``If the international financial institutions take that long \n     in Cuba, with the current economic conditions, there will be \n     mass starvation.''\n       Foreign aid is another likely source of foreign exchange. \n     Many economists think that Cuba will need as much as $1 \n     billion a year in foreign aid. With the shrinking U.S. \n     foreign aid budget, however, Havana cannot expect much help \n     from Washington.\n       Foreign investors could provide an additional supply of \n     capital. Foreign investment in Cuba has been growing. By the \n     end of 1993, there were 83 joint ventures in the industrial \n     sector and 29 in tourism, with Spanish companies in the lead. \n     Foreign interest was further whetted in June 1994, when it \n     was announced that Grupo Domos of Mexico had bought 49 per \n     cent of EmtelCuba, the national phone company, for $1.5 \n     billion. But despite all this hoopla, many of the investments \n     have involved little cash upfront, and economist Preeg \n     estimates that real foreign investment may have totaled only \n     $50 million in 1992.\n       Long constrained by the embargo, U.S. companies have only \n     begun to show any interest in Cuban investment opportunities. \n     (Business consultants, for example, tell stories of U.S. oil \n     companies scouting for gasoline station sites.) Lago and Jose \n     F. Alonso, a senior economic researcher with Radio Marti, \n     estimate that direct foreign investment in Cuba could reach \n     $250 million a year 5 years into an economic transition and \n     top $1 billion a year 15 years out.\n       At first, investments are likely to center on a few key \n     sectors of the Cuban economy:\n       Sugar.--Sugar plantations and mills are Cuba's largest \n     employers, and sugar exports provide its largest single \n     source of foreign exchange. The 1994 sugar harvest was 3.4 \n     million tons, less than half the harvest in 1989. Four of \n     every five sugar mills in Cuba were built before World War \n     I, and many need to be replaced.\n       Tourism.--Tourism, Cuba's second largest source of foreign \n     exchange, is deemed by many economists to have the greatest \n     economic potential. Cuba once dominated the Caribbean tourist \n     trade, but had only 3.2 per cent of the market in 1992. \n     Alonso and Lago think that Cuba's market share could rise to \n     11 per cent with adequate investment and to 15 per cent if \n     gambling returns.\n       Minerals.--Cuba has the fourth-largest nickel reserves in \n     the world. But Cuban mining technology, largely from the \n     former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, is obsolete, pushing \n     up production costs at a time when world nickel prices are \n     falling. As a result, Cuba's nickel production has fallen \n     dramatically in the early 1990s. Reviving it will be costly.\n       Manufacturing.--Manufacturing plants for textiles, shoes \n     and sporting goods all have the potential to start up \n     quickly. The key will be the revival of small and medium-\n     sized firms, the conversion of military airports and ports to \n     civilian export use and the reconstruction of Cuba's public \n     infrastructure to support industrial expansion. Low wages \n     will initially be a major draw for new investors, but labor \n     costs will have to rise if state food, education and health \n     care subsidies are trimmed.\n       Most economists who have studied Cuba advocate, as part of \n     the initial economic stabilization package, a sharp \n     devaluation of the peso to ensure that Cuban-made products \n     are competitive internationally. They say that this should be \n     coupled with partial convertibility of the peso, to enable \n     investors to repatriate their profits. Such a move would not \n     be without risk, however, because it could fuel inflation.\n       Cuban investors will also want greater access to the U.S. \n     market. Without most-favored-nation trading status, however, \n     Cuban exports would face prohibitive U.S. import duties. \n     Cuba's poverty would also qualify it for lower tariffs under \n     the U.S. generalized system of trade preferences. And \n     admission to the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is on every Cuban-\n     American economist's wish list.\n\n                      CUBA AFTER 35 YEARS OF CASTRO                     \n                     [Selected economic indicators]                     \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               1989     1990     1991     1992     1993 \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChange in gross social                                                  \n product (equivalent to                                                 \n gross domestic product)                                                \n (Percent).................      0.1     -3.1      -25      -14      -10\nExports (in billions of                                                 \n pesos)....................      5.4      4.4      3.6      2.3      2.1\nImports (in billions of                                                 \n pesos)....................      8.1      6.4      3.7      2.5      1.7\nSugar production (in                                                    \n millions of metric tons)..      8.1      8.4      7.6      7.0      4.2\nBudget deficit as per cent                                              \n of GSP (Percent)..........       11       16       NA       NA       34\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource. George Plinio Montalvan                                         \n\n                            MAJOR OBSTACLES\n\n       But trade expansion and increased foreign investment in \n     Cuba face major obstacles.\n       In the 1950s, the United States bought nearly three million \n     tons of sugar from Cuba, accounting for more than half of its \n     total exports. Today, the United States imports only one \n     million tons of sugar from the entire world. Increasing the \n     import quota, even by several hundred thousand tons, as a \n     gestuer of support for Cuba would garner Havana only a few \n     hundred million dollars in revenue. Moreover, upping the \n     quota would draw severe opposition from U.S. sugar growers. \n     Expanding tourism in Cuba will come largely at the expense of \n     the tourism-dependent economies of other Caribbean nations, \n     leading to new requests for aid from them. And any proposal \n     to include Cuba in NAFTA is likely to be rapidly enmeshed in \n     domestic U.S. politics, with labor unions fearing job losses \n     to apparel and other labor-intensive assembly operations that \n     could shift to Cuba.\n       Moreover, Cuba currently lacks the basic legal and \n     institutional framework needed to assure foreign investors \n     that their funds are safe. Cuban law doesn't sufficiently \n     protect private property rights, the court system doesn't \n     adequately enforce the law and there are no bankruptcy \n     procedures to speed entrance and exit from the marketplace.\n       Moreover, the recent experiences of foreign investors have \n     already given ammunition to critics in Cuba. They complain \n     about investment deals at bargain basement prices. They \n     object to foreign control over national industrial assets, \n     such as the telephone company, and natural resources, such as \n     some of Cuba's best beaches, which are now off-limits to most \n     citizens. They resent the selling off of the nation's \n     patrimony--Grupo Domos obtained a 55-year monopoly over \n     telecommunications services. And they question the benefits \n     of foreign investment for average workers. Under the current \n     system, foreign investors must contract with the Cuban \n     government for labor. Havana is paid $400 per month per \n     employee. The workers are paid an average of 250 pesos per \n     month, less than $3 on the black market. The government \n     pockets the difference. ``It's an incredible case of \n     exploitation,'' Lago said.\n       To set a new standard for foreign investors in Cuba, \n     Castaneda of the Inter-American Development Bank and \n     Montalvan have drafted a set of foreign investment guidelines \n     that have been dubbed the Arcos Principles (after Gustavo \n     Arcos Bergns, the secretary-general of the Cuban Committee \n     for Human Rights in Cuba). Signatories would pledge to hire \n     Cubans directly instead of through a government intermediary, \n     commit themselves to a 48-hour workweek, hire regardless of \n     political background and allow employees to organize \n     independent unions. In a swipe at the tourist oasis that \n     exists amid the desert-like Cuban economy, investors would \n     pledge to grant all Cubans equal access to all public areas--\n     such as beaches and hotels--and equal access to the goods and \n     services that are now often reserved for tourists.\n\n\n                    PRESERVING THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET\n\n       The greatest threat to the success of Cuba's economic \n     transportation into a market economy is the social and \n     political unrest that could accompany a further fraying of \n     its already tattered social safety net.\n       During an economic transition, Cuba's high unemployment \n     would be expected to climb even higher. The first victims are \n     likely to be those on the state payroll. Cuba's regular armed \n     forces are 200,000 strong. Argentina protects a landmass 25 \n     time the size of Cuba, with a population three times Cuba's, \n     with an army, navy and air force just a 10th the size. Cuba \n     has a million civil servants out of a population of 11 \n     million. Most economists think that the government could \n     function adequately with 150,000 employees.\n       To sop up the expected legions of jobless workers. \n     Montalvan said, ``Cuba will need a WPA-type program,'' \n     referring to FDR's famous public works program.\n       Cubans pride themselves on their long life expectancy, \n     their low infant mortality rate and their widespread \n     literacy--all fruits of the revolution.\n       But, Lago said, ``there is clearly an over-investment of \n     resources in the Cuban health system.'' Hospitals have long \n     served as employer of last resort. Fully half of all health \n     care workers are gardeners, cleaners and cooks. Moreover, the \n     average Cuban visits a doctor 9.3 times per year. Americans \n     make the trip only 5.6 times per year.\n       Analysts forecast draconian cutbacks in medical staffing. \n     And, shades of Clinton, they suggest payroll taxes for basic \n     health care and a fee for all additional services.\n       Similar changes may be needed in the social security \n     system. Cubans don't pay for their pensions. Analysts say \n     that this has to change, at least for those under 50 with \n     some productive years left. The retirement age may also have \n     to be raised. Cuban women currently can retire at 55, and men \n     at 60.\n       ``People will have to understand that they will have to \n     take care of themselves,'' Cereijo said.\n       But any significant shrinkage of the social safety net \n     risks exacerbating existing racial and class differences in \n     Cuban society. Most of the Cuban-American community that will \n     be investing in and returning to Cuba is white and middle \n     class, while more than half the island population is black \n     and poor. Tensions have already flared between whites in Cuba \n     with relatives abroad (who, until recently, had access to \n     dollar remittances and could live off the underground \n     economy) and blacks (who were confined to the peso economy). \n     During a transition, such friction could worsen.\n       European intellectuals like to gloat that ``Cuba will be \n     America's East Germany''--a debilitating drain on the U.S. \n     economy that will give Washington a lesson in humility when \n     Americans begin preaching about making the transition from \n     socialism to a market economy.\n       The analogy is overdrawn. Cuba's population of 11 million \n     is only two-thirds that of the former German Democratic \n     Republic. Its economy is less than a fifth the size of East \n     Germany's. And the United States has no intention of ever \n     merging the Cuban and American economies, with all the costs \n     that would entail.\n       But as Cuba's most significant neighbor, it is the United \n     States that will have to foot the bill if Cuba's impending \n     economic and political transition is botched. Faced with that \n     reality, Washington has some tough choices--on the U.S. trade \n     embargo, on claims against the Cuban government and on the \n     nature of any post-Castro economic stabilization program. Is \n     the goal of U.S. policy a short-term one--to punish Cuba and \n     bring about Castro's rapid downfall, regardless of the long-\n     run impact on the island nation's economy? Or are the \n     interests of the United States best served by easing the \n     transformation of Cuba into a market economy, even if it \n     means that Castro might stay in power longer than some \n     conservative Cuban-Americans might wish? Will the U.S. \n     interests in having a politically stable Cuba best be served \n     by restoring to its original owners all property seized after \n     the Cuban revolution and by imposing fiscal discipline on \n     Cuba or by policies that attempt to avoid reimposing the old \n     patterns of the distribution of wealth in Cuba and by seeking \n     to preserve the Cuban social safety net?\n       The recent, at least temporary, resolution of the migration \n     crisis could once again relegate Cuba to the Administration's \n     back burner. But as long as Washington continues to overlook \n     Cuba's underlying economic problems--which drove its people \n     onto all those makeshift rafts in the first place--they will \n     continue to fester, and ultimately guarantee that Cuba will \n     come back to haunt Washington again soon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                    UNITED STATES POLICY TOWARD CUBA\n\tMr. SIMON. Mr. President, this past summer the Clinton administration chose to tighten the economic embargo and accept more Cuban immigrants in response to thousands of Cuban rafters who set sail to Florida. I question its goals in tightening the embargo against Cuba. Tightening the embargo, which is already tighter than the one we have against Iraq, could lead to a major crisis in Cuba. The embargo against Cuba only makes the situation there worse by restricting the supply of food and medicine to people who desperately need it, without lessening Castro's grip on the Cuban political machinery. Our recent experience in Eastern Europe has shown us that sealing Communist countries from contact with democratic societies is not the answer. Progress can be obtained by encouraging a steady flow of information and goods between Cubans who seek change and Americans.\n\tDuring the 104th Congress, the administration and Congress should take a close look at our current policy toward Cuba. It is in the interest of the United States to encourage democracy and the rule of law in Cuba, but it is not in our interest to continue a policy that causes needless suffering and that has proven unsuccessful. I urge my colleagues to read the following article from the National Journal, ``The Cuban Conundrum,'' by Bruce Stokes. It provides a good outline of current U.S. policy toward Cuba and what it could lead to.\n\tI ask that the article be printed in the Congressional Record.\n\tThe article follows:\n\n              [From the National Journal, Sept. 17, 1994]\n\n                          The Cuban Conundrum\n\n                           (By Bruce Stokes)\n\n       In recent weeks, the searing television images of women and \n     children in inner tubes and flimsy rafts braving the shark-\n     invested waters of the Straits of Florida to flee Cuba have \n     momentarily overshadowed the more complex, underlying story \n     of the economic collapse that sparked the exodus.\n       While the Clinton Administration has, for the time being, \n     apparently resolved the crisis by agreeing to take in more \n     Cubans as legal immigrants, the long-term challenge that \n     faces Havana--and Washington--is the reconstruction of the \n     Cuban economy through its transformation, in one form or \n     another, from a socialist to a market economy.\n       The stakes in such a transformation are high.\n       ``An early restructuring to a market-oriented economy could \n     produce a very quick and robust recovery from Cuba's present \n     crisis situation.'' said Ernest H. Preeg, an economist at the \n     Washington-based Center for Strategic and International \n     Studies.\n       But failure could unleash a new torrent of Cuban \n     migration--legal or illegal--to the United States. Already, \n     more people have tried to flee Cuba this year than in the \n     previous decade. And with Cuba's geographic proximity to \n     Florida, a large Cuban-American population to welcome \n     refugees and the wide disparity between the standard of \n     living in Havana and what's available in Key West, just 90 \n     miles away, experts say it's possible that as many as a \n     million Cubans may want to emigrate to the United States \n     rather than wait for better times in Cuba.\n       The experts seem to agree that the transformation of Cuba's \n     economy has already begun. But there's no agreement on how \n     far it has gone or how much further Cuban President Fidel \n     Castro is willing to go.\n       ``Castro is gradually losing power to market forces, and \n     the reform process appears irresistible,'' Carmelo Mesa-Lago, \n     a professor of Cuban studies at the University of Miami, \n     said. But unfortunately, he added, ``I don't really think \n     they understand how the market works.''\n       And lulled by 35 years of false hopes of Castro's imminent \n     demise, few American economists or U.S. government officials \n     have begun to prepare for the day when a new, transitional \n     Cuban government will have to make the market work or risk \n     backsliding into deeper economic and political chaos.\n       ``This thing is going to catch them with their pants down, \n     and they are unprepared,'' said Armando M. Lago, the \n     president of Ecosometrics Inc., a Bethesda (Md.)-based \n     consulting company and the current president of the \n     Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy.\n       The Clinton Administration's instinctive reaction to the \n     new flood of Cuban boat people was to tighten the current \n     U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. It was decision driven more by \n     domestic political considerations--chief among them the \n     desire to placate the conservative Cuban-American community--\n     rather than with any forethought of its debilitating impact \n     on emerging market forces inside Cuba.\n       It's been up to Congress and some Cuban-American economists \n     to begin to lay out a new economic strategy for dealing with \n     Cuba. Their plans include a lifting of the embargo calibrated \n     to political and economic reforms inside the island nation, \n     detailed blueprints for the macro-economic stabilization of a \n     transitional Cuban economy and guidelines for foreign \n     investment and trade expansion.\n       When and whether these plans are tested, of course, depends \n     on how long Castro remains in power.\n\n\n                            desmerengamiento\n\n       Like a giant, tempting meringue, the Cuban economy is \n     collapsing in on itself, its frothy exterior no longer \n     supported by the hot air that first gave it form. This \n     process--what the Spanish call desmerengamiento--is well-\n     known to pastry chefs the world over, but economists have \n     never seen such a dramatic economic contraction.\n       From 1989-93, the Cuban economy shrank by nearly half, \n     according to most reliable estimates. This contraction \n     exceeds that experienced by Cuba during the Great \n     Depression in the 1930s, Mesa-Lago said, and is much worse \n     than the economic deterioration suffered in recent years \n     in Eastern Europe.\n       The Cuban economy is rapidly disengaging from the global \n     marketplace. In 1993, the value of Cuba's exports and imports \n     was less than a third of what it was in 1989. (See table) \n     Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, once Castro's \n     main trading partners, will no longer sell him machinery and \n     oil at cut-rate prices, and they refuse to buy Cuban sugar at \n     prices far in excess of the world market price.\n       Reflecting this economic breakdown, the value of the Cuban \n     peso has plummeted. While a Cuban peso is still officially \n     worth $1, the black market exchange rate in August was 130 to \n     $1.\n       ``Cuba has become an undeveloping country,'' Preeg said. \n     Nothing works.\n       In Havana, power blackouts are a daily occurrence. With \n     gasoline and spare parts in short supply, automobiles, trucks \n     and buses are disappearing in favor of bicycles and ox carts. \n     Unemployment is soaring because at any given time more than \n     two-thirds of Cuba's industrial plants are closed, owning to \n     a lack of power or raw materials.\n       Government rationing provides only about half of the food \n     that average families need to survive, forcing them to turn \n     to the underground economy. And while state-set prices for \n     many basic goods and services have changed little in the past \n     three decades, no such constraints exist on the black market, \n     where inflation is rampant. In May, Cuba's monthly minimum \n     wage would buy only a two-pound chicken or a pound of pork or \n     four liters of milk in unofficial markets.\n       In a society that once prided itself on meeting basic human \n     needs, the human toll of food shortages in mounting. \n     Infectious diseases that were once thought to have been \n     eradicated, such as tuberculosis and malaria, are returning. \n     In early 1993, the U.N. Children's Fund reported that half of \n     all Cuban infants in their first year of life showed symptoms \n     of anemia.\n       To reflate the collapsing Cuban economic meringue, the \n     Castro government has introduced some elements of a market \n     economy into what was once an autarkic socialist state. Some \n     foreign investment is now allowed. To encourage farmers to \n     grow more food, many state farms have been turned into \n     cooperatives, and the prices of agricultural products have \n     been increased somewhat to stimulate production. Taxi \n     drivers, hairdressers and workers in more than 130 other \n     categories can now sell their services on the open market. \n     And the widespread use of the dollar as the preferred medium \n     of exchange has been legalized.\n       But the economic reform process is a halting one, raising \n     uncertainty about the evolution of Cuban capitalism. In the \n     past few months. For example, the government has arrested \n     people for making ``too much'' money in the flourishing \n     dollar economy. The scope of permitted ``family business'' \n     has been scaled back. And tax rates have been raised on self-\n     employment income.\n       ``The adopted measures and reforms are incoherent, \n     inconsistent and ill-conceived in design; incomplete in \n     scope; incorrect and delayed in execution; and, consequently, \n     inadequate in impact,'' George Plinio Montalvan, a former \n     chief economist of the Organization of American States, said.\n       The problem, Mesa-Lago said, is that ``Castro listens to \n     different ideas and implements only those that appeal to him \n     most--he lacks a blueprint.''\n\n\n                         FIDELISMO WITOUT FIDEL\n\n       Most experts see only two designs for the Cuban economy of \n     the future.\n       Now that the emigration turmoil has subsided, the likeliest \n     scenario is that Cuba will renew its tentative reforms and \n     evolve toward a Nicaraguan-style economy, in which the state \n     continues to play a major role. Under such conditions, there \n     will be an increasing number of small and medium-sized \n     private companies. But the commanding heights of the economy \n     will be controlled by large, public enterprises. And while at \n     some point Castro will step down or die, his cadre of \n     bureaucratic apparatchiks will continue to drive economic \n     decision making.\n       But this option holds little attraction to the outside \n     world because, at best, it would provide only modest economic \n     growth. And the paucity of serious research on such an \n     eventuality is primarily because many conservative Cuban-\n     Americans, who provide much of the money for academic work on \n     Cuba, see a Nicaraguan-style Cuba--what they call ``Fidelismo \n     Without Fidel''--as their worst nightmare. It would delay \n     indefinitely the emergence of a truly free market economy in \n     Cuba. And, more important to some of them, it would postpone \n     their own return to power.\n       ``There is distaste among many Cuban-Americans to consider \n     the unconsiderable,'' admitted Matias F. Travieso-Diaz, a \n     partner in the Washington law firm of Shaw, Pittman, Potts & \n     Trowbridge.\n       The scenario preferred by most Cuban-Americans and \n     Administration officials is a fairly rapid transition to a \n     market-style economy. Most economists agree that only this \n     course will provide Cuba with the rate of sustained economic \n     growth needed to bring unemployment down to manageable \n     levels, while continuing to provide sufficient social \n     services to ensure political stability.\n       The first obstacle on this path is the U.S. embargo against \n     trade with, and investment in, Cuba.\n       The 1961 Foreign Assistance Act first imposed the trade \n     ban, both to pressure Cuba into compensating Americans for \n     property nationalized by the revolutionary regime and to \n     punish the Castro government for its embrace of Communism. \n     The 1992 Cuban Democracy Act extended the embargo by denying \n     foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms the licenses they need to \n     trade with Cuba. And to signal its dissatisfaction with the \n     Cuban government's failure to curb the current exodus of boat \n     people, the Clinton Administration has banned all dollar \n     remittances to Cuba from relatives or friends living in the \n     United States. (Previously, remittances of as much as $500 \n     per quarter were permitted.)\n       It is an article of faith among older, more conservative \n     Cuban-Americans--and the politicians they have supported--\n     that any loosening of these economic screws will only prop up \n     the Castro government and postpone the transition to a market \n     economy. To this end, hard-liners have supported escalation \n     of the embargo through imposition of an economic blockade on \n     Cuba.\n       Younger, more moderate Cuban-Americans and critics of the \n     current U.S. policy toward Cuba question why trade with China \n     and Vietnam is viewed as a means of liberalizing their \n     socialist economies, while trade with Cuba is rejected as \n     counterproductive.\n       ``If the goal is as peaceful and as productive a transition \n     as possible,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor of \n     economics at Smith College, ``engagement rather than \n     isolation has proven to be a better policy.''\n       But engagement is prohibited by the Cuban Democracy Act, \n     which requires democratic elections in Cuba before \n     the embargo can be lifted. Such sequencing flies in the \n     face of the experience in Eastern Europe, where democracy \n     came at the end of the transition from socialism, well \n     after the seeds of capitalism had been planted and \n     nurtured and had borne fruit. And, said Rep. Charles B. \n     Rangel, D-N.Y., ``we are losing billions of dollars in \n     business opportunities to invest and trade with Cuba.''\n       There is growing sentiment on Capitol Hill to reverse the \n     policy of isolating Cuba. Rangle has proposed the Free Trade \n     With Cuba Act, which would repeal the Cuban Democracy Act and \n     the embargo; open up travel, mail and telecommunications \n     services; and launch new negotiations on U.S. economic claims \n     against Havana and on the human rights situation in Cuba. \n     Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., the chairman of the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee, and Lee H. Hamilton, D-Ind., the \n     chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, have \n     proposed a similar unilateral lifting of the ban on travel, \n     remittances and commercial sales of food. And Rep. Robert \n     Menendez, D-N.J., has introduced legislation that would offer \n     a transitional Cuban government humanitarian assistance and \n     help in downsizing its military.\n       Rolando H. Casteneda, a senior operations officer at the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, and Montalvan have suggested \n     a step-by-step approach, linking the expansion of U.S. \n     economic ties with Cuba to Cuban political liberalization. \n     They suggest that the United States take the first step by \n     permitting commercial sales of U.S. food, medicine and \n     medical instruments to Cuba and rescinding the recent \n     prohibition on all remittances. If Cuba then agrees to free \n     political prisoners and adhere to international human rights \n     conventions, Castaneda and Montalvan say, the United States \n     should lift what's left of the trade embargo. If Havana \n     implements market-based economic reforms, Washington in \n     return wouldn't stand in the way of International Monetary \n     Fund (IMF) loans to Cuba. Finally, once Cuba adopts a new \n     constitution and has free and fair elections, they say, the \n     United States would lift its ban on travel and investment, \n     support a restructuring and some forgiveness of Cuban debt \n     and further open the U.S. market to Cuban goods.\n       None of these proposals is likely to pass Congress this \n     session. And all face an uphill political fight.\n       ``The idea that opening a McDonald's in Havana will make \n     Castro into a Thomas Jefferson blows my mind,'' said Jose S. \n     Sorzano, the chairman of Austin Group Inc., a consulting firm \n     in Arlington, Va. Once the embargo is cracked, conservatives \n     predict, the pressure from U.S. commercial interests to \n     quickly normalize economic relations without regard to \n     political concessions by Castro will prove inexorable and \n     Washington will end up trading something for nothing.\n       Moreover, for most lawmakers, there is potential pain and \n     little gain for supporting an end to the embargo. The \n     business community is not pressing for liberalization. In the \n     past, lawmakers who have advocated an easing of tensions with \n     Cuba have been Red-baited. Finally, if the Administration \n     dares to change its stance and supports a calibrated \n     relaxation of the embargo, conservative Cuban-Americans have \n     threatened to pillory President Clinton for waffling on yet \n     another foreign policy issue.\n\n\n                      RESTITUTION V. COMPENSATION\n\n       Once the economic transformation of Cuba has begun, the \n     biggest obstacle to normalization of economic relations with \n     the United States will be the claims against the Cuban \n     government by Americans whose property in Cuba was \n     nationalized after the revolution.\n       ``It's the crazy-aunt-in-the-basement issue,'' said Robert \n     E. Freer Jr., a senior partner in the Washington law firm of \n     Freer & McGarry. And like the unpredictable relative it's a \n     highly emotional issue likely to cause hitches in lifting the \n     embargo and serious clashes between the exile community and \n     the people in Cuba today.\n       In the 1960s the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission \n     valued the nationalized property--primarily industrial \n     plants, commercial buildings and farmland--at $1.8 billion. \n     It's now valued at $5.6 billion. And then there's all the \n     confiscated property, much of it residential, that was \n     owned at the time of the revolution by Cuban citizens who \n     subsequently became U.S. citizens.\n       Claimants have different interests in resolving the status \n     of the assets. Some large U.S. corporations, especially those \n     with a brand name to protect, want restitution of their \n     original property. Similarly, many middle and upper-class \n     Cuban-American refugees who left a lot of property behind in \n     Cuba have an economic and emotional stake in the return of \n     their original holdings. Others who have little desire to \n     return to Cuba would be happy with financial compensation for \n     their losses. And some Cuban-Americans who made their \n     fortunes in the United States only care that the confiscated \n     properties be privatized at auction so that they will have a \n     crack at them.\n       Freer, who's the general counsel to the U.S.-Cuba Business \n     Council, contends that restitution will ensure an immediate \n     infusion of foreign investment and modern management in Cuba.\n       But fights over restitution delayed the privatization of \n     property in Eastern Germany for years, holding up foreign \n     investment. Moreover, Montalvan argued, ``restitution would \n     install the same distribution of wealth in Cuba that you had \n     before the revolution.'' Americans would control 90 per cent \n     of Cuba's electricity generating capacity, its entire \n     telephone system, most of its mining industry and some of its \n     best land, providing dry tinder to rekindle Cuban \n     nationalism.\n       Compensation--on the surface, a more straightforward \n     resolution of the problem--sparks similar controversy. It \n     could burden an already indebted Cuba with new foreign \n     obligations. It took the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission \n     six years to come up with estimates of losses. ``To ask a \n     country in the midst of rebuilding to administer that kind of \n     thing, or deal with claimants on an individual basis, is \n     absolute folly,'' Montalvan said.\n       Nevertheless, Travieso-Diaz said, ``the paramount issue is, \n     when and how is the title going to be put to rest?'' \n     Claimants' lawyers have threatened to use the courts to delay \n     the privatization of their former properties until some \n     restitution or compensation is made. To avoid that \n     economically debilitating eventuality, Travieso-Diaz \n     suggested that some partial compensation for claims, some \n     percentage on the dollar, is inevitable.\n       The sleeper political issue could be what to do with small \n     and medium-sized businesses, which have sentimental and real \n     estate value, and residential property. These were the \n     hardest claims to resolve in Eastern Germany and the Baltic \n     states. The Cuban-American community has largely disavowed \n     any interest in restitution of former residences. But this \n     is, in part, a tactical move to counter Castro's propaganda \n     that Cuban-Americans want to return to steal people's homes. \n     Notwithstanding such disavowals, reclaiming family homesteads \n     could suddenly have a powerful emotional appeal once the \n     opportunity arises.\n\n\n                          containing inflation\n\n       Clearing the underbrush of the embargo and foreign claims \n     issues merely sets the stage for tackling the fundamental \n     economic challenges facing Cuba's transition to a market \n     economy.\n       The first problem is to contain the seemingly inevitable \n     inflation that's triggered by the end of socialism. The \n     government subsidies inherent in a state-run economy mask \n     inflation by making up the difference between what consumers \n     pay and what the price of a good or service would be if the \n     value were determined strictly by supply and demand. As \n     Cuba's economic crisis worsened in the past few years, \n     subsidies grew, and by 1993 Cuba's budget deficit was equal \n     to a third of the value of its economy. By printing money to \n     cover those subsidies as domestic production shrank, the \n     Cuban government provided average citizens with plenty of \n     money, but little to buy. As a result, a huge volume of \n     excess liquidity has been built up that will feed \n     inflationary fires if restraints on prices are lifted.\n       To stimulate production to meet demand and get the Cuban \n     economy moving again, most economists recommend an immediate \n     end to price controls, which could lead to a tripling or \n     quadrupling in prices. The trick will be to stabilize those \n     prices once they have initially adjusted so that the \n     inflation rate doesn't spiral out of control.\n       This requires curbing the flow of money into the economy \n     and sopping up some of the excess liquidity. Economists \n     prescribe a reduction in government spending and some hard \n     budget constraints; a freeze on public-sector wages and a \n     cutback in public-sector employment, including the military; \n     the imposition of new taxes; and a positive real interest \n     rate to encourage savings.\n\n\n                          capital from abroad\n\n       Domestic macroeconomic stability is a necessary, but not \n     sufficient, condition for a robust economic recovery in Cuba. \n     If Cuba is to climb out of its economic hole, it also needs \n     new capital from abroad.\n       Cuba's needs are great. In the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union \n     pumped an estimated $4.4 billion a year into Cuba's \n     economy--about 15 per cent of its gross national product. \n     With the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, that \n     largess ended, and Cuba will somehow need to make up the \n     shortfall. In addition, Manuel Cereijo, a professor of \n     engineering at Florida International University in Miami, \n     estimates that Cuba will need $3.6 billion over a decade \n     to reconstruct its rundown transportation system and \n     another $2.5 billion to modernize its telecommunications \n     system.\n       Simply lifting the current ban on remittances, economists \n     say, could inject as much as $1 billion a year into Cuba's \n     economy.\n       Cuba has an estimated $10.8 billion debt with European and \n     Asian lenders and a 20 billion-ruble obligation (about $100 \n     million at the current exchange rate) to the former Soviet \n     Union. To obtain some breathing room during its economic \n     transition, economists say, Havana will first have to \n     negotiate a moratorium on repaying its debts and then \n     renegotiate them at some fraction of their original value. \n     There is ample international precedent for such debt \n     restructuring, and the lenders should be obliging because \n     Cuba hasn't paid any interest or principal on its debt since \n     the mid-1980s.\n       A speedy resolution of the debt question would open lending \n     windows at the IMF and World Bank. Depending on the initial \n     exchange rate, Cuba's per capita income may be judged to be \n     low enough to qualify for concessional loans, a definite \n     plus. Economists estimate that Havana will initially need to \n     borrow at least $750 million a year. The main sticking point \n     could be bureaucratic inertia.\n       ``From the time Latvia turned democratic and applied for a \n     loan and got it, it took 18 months,'' economist Lago said. \n     ``If the international financial institutions take that long \n     in Cuba, with the current economic conditions, there will be \n     mass starvation.''\n       Foreign aid is another likely source of foreign exchange. \n     Many economists think that Cuba will need as much as $1 \n     billion a year in foreign aid. With the shrinking U.S. \n     foreign aid budget, however, Havana cannot expect much help \n     from Washington.\n       Foreign investors could provide an additional supply of \n     capital. Foreign investment in Cuba has been growing. By the \n     end of 1993, there were 83 joint ventures in the industrial \n     sector and 29 in tourism, with Spanish companies in the lead. \n     Foreign interest was further whetted in June 1994, when it \n     was announced that Grupo Domos of Mexico had bought 49 per \n     cent of EmtelCuba, the national phone company, for $1.5 \n     billion. But despite all this hoopla, many of the investments \n     have involved little cash upfront, and economist Preeg \n     estimates that real foreign investment may have totaled only \n     $50 million in 1992.\n       Long constrained by the embargo, U.S. companies have only \n     begun to show any interest in Cuban investment opportunities. \n     (Business consultants, for example, tell stories of U.S. oil \n     companies scouting for gasoline station sites.) Lago and Jose \n     F. Alonso, a senior economic researcher with Radio Marti, \n     estimate that direct foreign investment in Cuba could reach \n     $250 million a year 5 years into an economic transition and \n     top $1 billion a year 15 years out.\n       At first, investments are likely to center on a few key \n     sectors of the Cuban economy:\n       Sugar.--Sugar plantations and mills are Cuba's largest \n     employers, and sugar exports provide its largest single \n     source of foreign exchange. The 1994 sugar harvest was 3.4 \n     million tons, less than half the harvest in 1989. Four of \n     every five sugar mills in Cuba were built before World War \n     I, and many need to be replaced.\n       Tourism.--Tourism, Cuba's second largest source of foreign \n     exchange, is deemed by many economists to have the greatest \n     economic potential. Cuba once dominated the Caribbean tourist \n     trade, but had only 3.2 per cent of the market in 1992. \n     Alonso and Lago think that Cuba's market share could rise to \n     11 per cent with adequate investment and to 15 per cent if \n     gambling returns.\n       Minerals.--Cuba has the fourth-largest nickel reserves in \n     the world. But Cuban mining technology, largely from the \n     former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, is obsolete, pushing \n     up production costs at a time when world nickel prices are \n     falling. As a result, Cuba's nickel production has fallen \n     dramatically in the early 1990s. Reviving it will be costly.\n       Manufacturing.--Manufacturing plants for textiles, shoes \n     and sporting goods all have the potential to start up \n     quickly. The key will be the revival of small and medium-\n     sized firms, the conversion of military airports and ports to \n     civilian export use and the reconstruction of Cuba's public \n     infrastructure to support industrial expansion. Low wages \n     will initially be a major draw for new investors, but labor \n     costs will have to rise if state food, education and health \n     care subsidies are trimmed.\n       Most economists who have studied Cuba advocate, as part of \n     the initial economic stabilization package, a sharp \n     devaluation of the peso to ensure that Cuban-made products \n     are competitive internationally. They say that this should be \n     coupled with partial convertibility of the peso, to enable \n     investors to repatriate their profits. Such a move would not \n     be without risk, however, because it could fuel inflation.\n       Cuban investors will also want greater access to the U.S. \n     market. Without most-favored-nation trading status, however, \n     Cuban exports would face prohibitive U.S. import duties. \n     Cuba's poverty would also qualify it for lower tariffs under \n     the U.S. generalized system of trade preferences. And \n     admission to the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is on every Cuban-\n     American economist's wish list.\n\n                      CUBA AFTER 35 YEARS OF CASTRO                     \n                     [Selected economic indicators]                     ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               1989     1990     1991     1992     1993 ------------------------------------------------------------------------Change in gross social                                                  \n product (equivalent to                                                 \n gross domestic product)                                                \n (Percent).................      0.1     -3.1      -25      -14      -10Exports (in billions of                                                 \n pesos)....................      5.4      4.4      3.6      2.3      2.1Imports (in billions of                                                 \n pesos)....................      8.1      6.4      3.7      2.5      1.7Sugar production (in                                                    \n millions of metric tons)..      8.1      8.4      7.6      7.0      4.2Budget deficit as per cent                                              \n of GSP (Percent)..........       11       16       NA       NA       34------------------------------------------------------------------------Source. George Plinio Montalvan                                         \n\n                            MAJOR OBSTACLES\n\n       But trade expansion and increased foreign investment in \n     Cuba face major obstacles.\n       In the 1950s, the United States bought nearly three million \n     tons of sugar from Cuba, accounting for more than half of its \n     total exports. Today, the United States imports only one \n     million tons of sugar from the entire world. Increasing the \n     import quota, even by several hundred thousand tons, as a \n     gestuer of support for Cuba would garner Havana only a few \n     hundred million dollars in revenue. Moreover, upping the \n     quota would draw severe opposition from U.S. sugar growers. \n     Expanding tourism in Cuba will come largely at the expense of \n     the tourism-dependent economies of other Caribbean nations, \n     leading to new requests for aid from them. And any proposal \n     to include Cuba in NAFTA is likely to be rapidly enmeshed in \n     domestic U.S. politics, with labor unions fearing job losses \n     to apparel and other labor-intensive assembly operations that \n     could shift to Cuba.\n       Moreover, Cuba currently lacks the basic legal and \n     institutional framework needed to assure foreign investors \n     that their funds are safe. Cuban law doesn't sufficiently \n     protect private property rights, the court system doesn't \n     adequately enforce the law and there are no bankruptcy \n     procedures to speed entrance and exit from the marketplace.\n       Moreover, the recent experiences of foreign investors have \n     already given ammunition to critics in Cuba. They complain \n     about investment deals at bargain basement prices. They \n     object to foreign control over national industrial assets, \n     such as the telephone company, and natural resources, such as \n     some of Cuba's best beaches, which are now off-limits to most \n     citizens. They resent the selling off of the nation's \n     patrimony--Grupo Domos obtained a 55-year monopoly over \n     telecommunications services. And they question the benefits \n     of foreign investment for average workers. Under the current \n     system, foreign investors must contract with the Cuban \n     government for labor. Havana is paid $400 per month per \n     employee. The workers are paid an average of 250 pesos per \n     month, less than $3 on the black market. The government \n     pockets the difference. ``It's an incredible case of \n     exploitation,'' Lago said.\n       To set a new standard for foreign investors in Cuba, \n     Castaneda of the Inter-American Development Bank and \n     Montalvan have drafted a set of foreign investment guidelines \n     that have been dubbed the Arcos Principles (after Gustavo \n     Arcos Bergns, the secretary-general of the Cuban Committee \n     for Human Rights in Cuba). Signatories would pledge to hire \n     Cubans directly instead of through a government intermediary, \n     commit themselves to a 48-hour workweek, hire regardless of \n     political background and allow employees to organize \n     independent unions. In a swipe at the tourist oasis that \n     exists amid the desert-like Cuban economy, investors would \n     pledge to grant all Cubans equal access to all public areas--\n     such as beaches and hotels--and equal access to the goods and \n     services that are now often reserved for tourists.\n\n\n                    PRESERVING THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET\n\n       The greatest threat to the success of Cuba's economic \n     transportation into a market economy is the social and \n     political unrest that could accompany a further fraying of \n     its already tattered social safety net.\n       During an economic transition, Cuba's high unemployment \n     would be expected to climb even higher. The first victims are \n     likely to be those on the state payroll. Cuba's regular armed \n     forces are 200,000 strong. Argentina protects a landmass 25 \n     time the size of Cuba, with a population three times Cuba's, \n     with an army, navy and air force just a 10th the size. Cuba \n     has a million civil servants out of a population of 11 \n     million. Most economists think that the government could \n     function adequately with 150,000 employees.\n       To sop up the expected legions of jobless workers. \n     Montalvan said, ``Cuba will need a WPA-type program,'' \n     referring to FDR's famous public works program.\n       Cubans pride themselves on their long life expectancy, \n     their low infant mortality rate and their widespread \n     literacy--all fruits of the revolution.\n       But, Lago said, ``there is clearly an over-investment of \n     resources in the Cuban health system.'' Hospitals have long \n     served as employer of last resort. Fully half of all health \n     care workers are gardeners, cleaners and cooks. Moreover, the \n     average Cuban visits a doctor 9.3 times per year. Americans \n     make the trip only 5.6 times per year.\n       Analysts forecast draconian cutbacks in medical staffing. \n     And, shades of Clinton, they suggest payroll taxes for basic \n     health care and a fee for all additional services.\n       Similar changes may be needed in the social security \n     system. Cubans don't pay for their pensions. Analysts say \n     that this has to change, at least for those under 50 with \n     some productive years left. The retirement age may also have \n     to be raised. Cuban women currently can retire at 55, and men \n     at 60.\n       ``People will have to understand that they will have to \n     take care of themselves,'' Cereijo said.\n       But any significant shrinkage of the social safety net \n     risks exacerbating existing racial and class differences in \n     Cuban society. Most of the Cuban-American community that will \n     be investing in and returning to Cuba is white and middle \n     class, while more than half the island population is black \n     and poor. Tensions have already flared between whites in Cuba \n     with relatives abroad (who, until recently, had access to \n     dollar remittances and could live off the underground \n     economy) and blacks (who were confined to the peso economy). \n     During a transition, such friction could worsen.\n       European intellectuals like to gloat that ``Cuba will be \n     America's East Germany''--a debilitating drain on the U.S. \n     economy that will give Washington a lesson in humility when \n     Americans begin preaching about making the transition from \n     socialism to a market economy.\n       The analogy is overdrawn. Cuba's population of 11 million \n     is only two-thirds that of the former German Democratic \n     Republic. Its economy is less than a fifth the size of East \n     Germany's. And the United States has no intention of ever \n     merging the Cuban and American economies, with all the costs \n     that would entail.\n       But as Cuba's most significant neighbor, it is the United \n     States that will have to foot the bill if Cuba's impending \n     economic and political transition is botched. Faced with that \n     reality, Washington has some tough choices--on the U.S. trade \n     embargo, on claims against the Cuban government and on the \n     nature of any post-Castro economic stabilization program. Is \n     the goal of U.S. policy a short-term one--to punish Cuba and \n     bring about Castro's rapid downfall, regardless of the long-\n     run impact on the island nation's economy? Or are the \n     interests of the United States best served by easing the \n     transformation of Cuba into a market economy, even if it \n     means that Castro might stay in power longer than some \n     conservative Cuban-Americans might wish? Will the U.S. \n     interests in having a politically stable Cuba best be served \n     by restoring to its original owners all property seized after \n     the Cuban revolution and by imposing fiscal discipline on \n     Cuba or by policies that attempt to avoid reimposing the old \n     patterns of the distribution of wealth in Cuba and by seeking \n     to preserve the Cuban social safety net?\n       The recent, at least temporary, resolution of the migration \n     crisis could once again relegate Cuba to the Administration's \n     back burner. But as long as Washington continues to overlook \n     Cuba's underlying economic problems--which drove its people \n     onto all those makeshift rafts in the first place--they will \n     continue to fester, and ultimately guarantee that Cuba will \n     come back to haunt Washington again soon.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Paul Simon"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

Howard M.

As you \n     explained in your floor statement of October 8, 1994, Section \n     7 of the Act, among other things, ``requires publication for \n     public comment'' of proposed antitrust mutual assistance \n     agreements and amendments thereto, and final agreements, \n     negotiated pursuant to the Act, between the United States \n     government and foreign governments. The final agreement must \n     be published (albeit not for further comment) before it ``can \n     be effective under the [A]ct.'' 140 Cong. Rec.

Indeed, it \n     is precisely because such a procedure is ``rare if not \n     unprecedented in foreign affairs'' matters, H.R. Rep. No. \n     103-772, 103d Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (Oct. 3, 1994) (``House \n     Report''), that Section 9(c)(1) of the Act, your floor \n     statement, and the House Report on the Act all make clear \n     that the publication-and-comment requirement is ``not \n     intended to make that procedure, or the use of the \n     agreements, subject to judicial review under the \n     Administrative Procedure Act.'' 140 Cong. Rec. S15022; see \n     House Report at 22.\n       In the particular and unique circumstances of this statute, \n     you have found a way for these provisions to coexist with the \n     basic principle that the negotiation of international \n     agreements is the responsibility of the President. Section 7 \n     ensures that the Attorney General and the Federal Trade \n     Commission will have the benefit of public views about the \n     protection afforded potentially sensitive U.S. business \n     information under a contemplated agreement, without requiring \n     that the Attorney General or the Commission change a proposed \n     agreement, modification, or amendment on the basis of any \n     public comment. The opportunity to receive such views would \n     not necessarily arise otherwise under the Act since the \n     Attorney General and Federal Trade Commission are not \n     required to provide public or other notice before sharing \n     certain information in their files pursuant to an antitrust \n     mutual assistance agreement. The Attorney General and the \n     Commission will retain, however, the option of not letting an \n     agreement go into effect as originally crafted if, after \n     considering the public comments, the Attorney General and \n     Commission agree that the Act's requirements have not been \n     met.\n       In closing, let me say once again how grateful I am for \n     your outstanding work in accomplishing the passage of this \n     important legislation.

As this office's dominant force behind our national and military health care initiatives, she worked tirelessly with the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, the Senate Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations, and the Senate Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations, and the Senate Armed Services Committee in an effort to realize the strategic goals of our evolving national health care systems. This was accomplished in a manner that would be consistent with any eventual health care reform.\n\tAs a recognized authority on health care, Captain Lescavage's expertise was in constant demand as a speaker and writer. She authored a book and journal articles; she has been involved in a myriad of speaking engagements and interviews. At significant personal sacrifice, she eagerly sought each and every opportunity to advance the health care goals and vision of America.\n\tIn all my years in the Congress, I have rarely seen such dedication. Captain Lescavage is an officer of whom the military and our Nation can and should be justifiably proud. As she leaves my office, I want to personally and publicly acknowledge my sincere appreciation to Captain Lescavage for her dedicated months of exemplary service and to bid her a fond aloha and heartfelt mahalo.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Daniel K.

Mr. President, on Wednesday, October 5, I held a \nhearing in my capacity as chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee of \nthe Judiciary Committee on the Constitutional Right to International \nTravel. The hearing focused on the derivation of this well-established \nconstitutional right, on the circumstances under which the right can be \nrestricted, and on the wisdom as a policy matter of restricting the \nability of Americans to visit nations with whom we may have political \ndifferences.\n  In the course of this hearing, it became clear to me that there are \nlimited instances in which the right of Americans to travel abroad \nshould be restricted--namely, instances where international travel \nendangers the safety of the traveler or implicates national security \nconcerns. Otherwise, as a matter of both constitutional law (the First \nand Fifth Amendments as well as other constitutional provisions) and \npolicy, the right to a free trade in ideas and to investigations into \nother nations and cultures should be not only left untrammelled, but \nencouraged.\n  During the course of this hearing, it also became clear to me that \nthis Administration, as well as past Administrations, has been less \nprotective or supportive of the right to travel as I think the \nConstitution requires. Administrations both past and present have on \nseveral occasions restricted travel to nations that pose absolutely no \nsecurity risk either to the United States or to those who travel to \nthat nation, relying on the Executive's foreign policy authority to \neffect these restrictions. This is true even though we have managed to \nachieve the greatest foreign policy successes in those very areas that \nwe have left open to American travelers.\n  On several occasions, Congress has not stood idly by while \nrestrictions have been placed on international travel, and has often \nundertaken efforts to protect the right to travel from inappropriate \nand unwise restrictions. More needs to be done, however; currently \ntravel restrictions are in place with respect to a number of countries \nthat pose no risk to our nation's or citizens' security. I intend to \nlook at this issue closely in the next session, and probably to \nintroduce legislation to address both present and future travel \nrestrictions. I hope to work closely with my colleagues in both Houses \nof Congress who agree with me as to the necessity of protecting this \nimportant right.\n  In the meantime, I would like to place in the record the written \nstatement from the October 5 hearing of Kate Martin, Executive Director \nof the ACLU's National Security Project. This statement explains the \nhistory of the constitutional right to travel, the ways in which \nCongress may inject itself into this debate, notwithstanding claims \nthat congressional involvement in the travel issue impinges on the \nPresident's foreign affairs authority. It is a thoughtful and thorough \ndiscussion of the travel issue, and one that suggests the need for \nreform in this area in the very near future.\n  The statement follows:\n\n   Statement of Kate Martin, Director, Center for National Security \nStudies, American Civil Liberties Union on the Constitutional Right To \n                                 Travel\n\n       Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am very pleased \n     to have this opportunity to testify on behalf of the Center \n     for National Security Studies of the American Civil Liberties \n     Union on the constitutional right to travel. The ACLU is a \n     non-profit, non-partisan organization, with over 275,000 \n     members, dedicated to the protection of civil liberties and \n     the democratic process. The ACLU takes no position on \n     substantive matters of U.S. foreign policy, including the \n     Cuban embargo, except to the extent that such policies \n     violate individual liberties or the democratic process.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       The right to travel is a fundamental aspect of individual \n     liberty protected by both international law and the \n     Constitution. It is also essential to the exercise of First \n     Amendment freedoms. The Supreme Court recognizes that right, \n     and the Congress has acted repeatedly to protect the right \n     against infringement by Executive branch actions.\n       The current travel ban on travel to Cuba imposed under the \n     Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), violates this fundamental \n     right. Bureaucratic enforcement of the current restrictions \n     has been arbitrary and involved improper government inquiries \n     and censorship. Moreover, the administration's most recent \n     actions tightening the Cuban travel restrictions also violate \n     its commitments made to Congress earlier this year.\n       The 1982 Supreme Count case, Regan v. Wald, which rejected \n     a challenge to the Cuba travel ban then in effect, is no \n     authority for the continuation of the present restrictions in \n     this post-Cold War world. The opinion in that case, written \n     by Justice Rehnquist for a narrow 5-4 majority did not hold \n     that there was no constitutional right to travel. Nor did it \n     hold that the government may restrict travel whenever it \n     deems such restrictions useful. To the contrary, Regan held \n     only that when the government asserts the weightiest of \n     national security reasons, important to the military defense \n     of the United States, for restricting travel, the court will \n     defer to such reasons. The reasons found sufficient in that \n     case--all related to the existence of the Cold War--no longer \n     exist. The current justification proffered for the travel \n     ban--to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba--does not \n     as a matter of law or common sense justify restricting the \n     human rights of Americans.\n       The events of the last fifteen months demonstrate that \n     protection of this constitutional right will never be secure \n     so long as it can be held hostage to the political or foreign \n     policy objectives of the moment. Congress should act now to \n     protect this right, by prohibiting all travel restrictions \n     imposed under economic embargoes.\n\n\n             The Constitution Protects the Right to Travel\n\n       Most Americans do not realize that it is a crime for them \n     to travel to Cuba and would be shocked to find out that is \n     the case. They instinctively understand that the right to \n     travel freely is part of the basic liberty which our \n     democratic government was established to protect. Indeed, the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Art, 13, recognizes \n     the right to travel both inside one's country and \n     internationally. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized \n     that the right to travel is protected under the Fifth \n     Amendment as a liberty interest that cannot be deprived \n     without due process of law.\\1\\ Indeed, even the Executive \n     Branch concedes that ``the right to travel--both domestically \n     and internationally--is constitutionally protected,'' \n     although it violates this principle in action. Report of the \n     United States of America Under the International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, (ICCPR Report) July 28, 1994, \n     Art. 12, p. 99.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Moreover, restrictions on the right to travel must be \n     judged against the central principle of the First Amendment: \n     ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech,'' means that every person is free to speak her mind \n     about the actions of the government and to participate in the \n     debate about the great issues of the day. To participate \n     effectively in this process, private persons must have access \n     to information. To participate in debate about foreign policy \n     questions, they must have access to information about events \n     taking place in the world. It would seem beyond debate that, \n     except in the most compelling circumstances, the government \n     may not interfere with the ability of private citizens to \n     find out for themselves what is going on around the world and \n     to use that information to influence public debate.\n       As the Supreme Court has explained:\n       ``. . . . In Anglo-Saxon law that right [to travel] was \n     emerging at least as early as the Magna Carta. Chafee, Three \n     Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787 (1956), 171-181, 187 \n     et seq., shows how deeply engrained in our history this \n     freedom of movement is. Freedom of movement across frontiers \n     in either direction, . . . was a part of our heritage. Travel \n     abroad, like travel within the country, may be necessary for \n     a livelihood. It may be as close to the heart of the \n     individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads. \n     Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values. . . . \n     ``Our nation,'' wrote Chafee, ``has thrived on the principle \n     that, outside areas of plainly harmful conduct, every \n     American is left to shape his own life as he thinks best, do \n     what he pleases, go where he pleases.''\n       ``Freedom of movement also has large social values. As \n     Chafee put it:\n       ``Foreign correspondents and lectures on public affairs \n     need firsthand information. Scientists and scholars gain \n     greatly from consultations with colleagues in other \n     countries. Students equip themselves for more fruitful \n     careers in the United States by instruction in foreign \n     universities. Then there are reasons close to the core of \n     personal life--marriage, reuniting families, spending hours \n     with old friends. Finally, travel abroad . . . helps them to \n     be well-informed on public issues. An American who has \n     crossed the ocean is not obliged to form his opinions about \n     our foreign policy merely from what he is told by \n     officials of our government or by a few correspondents of \n     American newspapers. Moreover, his views on domestic \n     questions are enriched by seeing how foreigners are trying \n     to solve similar problems. In many different ways direct \n     contact with other countries contributes to sounder \n     decisions at home.''\n\n     (Citations and footnotes omitted.) Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. \n     at 126-127.\n       Nevertheless, there is a long history of efforts to abridge \n     Americans' right to travel, usually in the name of some \n     foreign policy goal, such as fighting communism or promoting \n     democracy, sometimes, to punish Americans holding minority \n     political views. Each political branch has at different \n     times, acted both to protect and to restrict the right, \n     depending on the prevailing political winds. At times, the \n     Supreme Court has wavered in its commitment to this \n     fundamental right. However, history demonstrates a growing \n     and inexorable recognition that the sharing of information \n     and ideas by travel and otherwise is a cornerstone of \n     individual liberty, and essential to the building of \n     democracy.\n       It has become increasingly clear that banning travel by \n     Americans to foreign dictatorships has never resulted in the \n     avowed goal of undermining that dictatorship. Indeed the \n     current Administration no longer even attempts to justify the \n     Cuban travel ban on that basis. They, like all serious \n     observers, recognize the positive benefits democratic forces \n     derive from the sharing of information and ideas. Thus, they \n     are driven to pretend that in banning travel, they are not \n     banning the sharing of information and ideas, but only \n     implementing currency regulations. Testimony of Alexander \n     Watson, Assistant Secretary of State, Joint Hearing on U.S. \n     Policy and the Future of Cuba, Subcommittees on Economic \n     Policy, Trade, and Environment; Western Hemisphere Affairs; \n     and International Operations; of the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives, Nov. 18, 1993, p 19.\n       In recent years, protection of the right to travel and to \n     share information and ideas has fallen mainly to the \n     Congress. In particular, Congressman Howard Berman has been \n     instrumental in passing Free Trade In Ideas legislation, \n     first in 1988, then in 1991, and again this year. The recent \n     tightening of the Cuban travel ban demonstrates the necessity \n     for Congress to act again.\n\n\n                     history of the right to travel\n\n       Historically, Americans' right to travel was regulated \n     under the Passport Act, not the economic embargo laws. For \n     the first hundred years of travel regulations, travel was \n     restricted only during time of war. Although Congress passed \n     the first Passport Act in 1856, it did not make it illegal to \n     travel without a passport until 1918. The 1918 statute \n     delegated to the President the right during time of war, to \n     impose by proclamation, a requirement that U.S. citizens use \n     a passport when entering or leaving the country. In 1918 and \n     again in 1941, the President issued such proclamations. In \n     1952, as part of the McCarren-Walter Act, the Congress again \n     delegated power to the President to proclaim a national \n     emergency during which use of a passport would be required \n     and in 1953, President Truman declared the situation in North \n     Korea to be a national emergency. Immigration and \n     Nationality Act Sec. 215. Only in 1978, when Congress \n     otherwise restricted the President's authority, did it \n     permit him to always require a passport for entering or \n     leaving the country. 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1185(b).\n       During the McCarthy era, the government also sought to deny \n     the right to travel to certain Americans based on their \n     political beliefs. That practice was not finally outlawed \n     until 1991 when Congress amended the Passport Act. In 1952, \n     the Secretary of State declared pursuant to the delegation \n     provision in the 1926 Passport Act that passports were not to \n     be issued to members of the Communist Party for reasons of \n     national security. This prohibition was challenged as \n     unconstitutional and unauthorized and in 1958, the Supreme \n     Court struck it down on the ground that Congress had not \n     authorized it. Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116 (1958).\n       Six years later, the Court again considered the issue of \n     revocation of passports of Communists and this time held a \n     statute specifically authorizing such revocation \n     unconstitutional. Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. \n     500 (1964). In this case, the Subversive Activities Control \n     Act specifically provided that members of the Communist party \n     should have their passports revoked. There being no issue \n     whether the Executive had authority to revoke the passports, \n     the Court was forced to reach the constitutional issue and \n     struck down the law as overly broad and indiscriminate. \n     Justice Douglas declared that absent war, the government had \n     no power to keep a citizen from traveling unless there was \n     power to detain him or her.\n       Nevertheless, as late as 1981, the Executive Branch \n     continued to assert that the President's foreign policy \n     powers include the right to revoke an American's passport in \n     order to prevent her from denouncing U.S. policy abroad. See \n     Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981). In 1991, Congress amended \n     the Passport Act to prohibit revocation of passports on the \n     basis of activities protected by the First Amendment.\n       The Executive Branch also sought to restrict the travel \n     rights of Americans by putting area restrictions on the use \n     of passports. In Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1 (1965) the Supreme \n     Court decided that the statutory language, which had been \n     held not to authorize the President to refuse passports to \n     Communists, did authorize the President to refuse to validate \n     passports for travel to Cuba. The court went on to find the \n     passport restriction on travel to Cuba to be constitutional, \n     because it was supported by the ``weightiest considerations \n     of national security.''\n       However, even as the Supreme Court deferred to the \n     Executive concerning passport controls, the Congress became \n     increasingly active in protecting that right against \n     executive limitation. In 1978, Congress rejected the result \n     in Zemel and explicitly prohibited the President from \n     imposing geographic restrictions on the use of passports \n     under the Passport Act except ``where armed hostilities are \n     in progress, or where there is imminent danger to the public \n     health or the physical safety of United States \n     travellers.'' 22 U.S.C. Sec. 211a. In our judgment, this \n     provision of the Passport Act includes all circumstances, \n     in which the government may legitimately ban travel.\n       Indeed, in the late 1970's, Americans' right to travel and \n     in particular their right to travel to Cuba was for a time \n     secure. Although the trade embargo of Cuba first declared in \n     1963 under the TWEA, included restrictions on travel by \n     Americans, in 1977, President Carter lifted the ban to permit \n     all Americans to travel to Cuba, for any purpose. Thereafter, \n     Congress amended the Trading with the Enemy Act to restrict \n     its invocation by the President to times of war, although it \n     grandfathered existing restrictions. When Congress also \n     amended the Passport Act in 1978 to prohibit the Executive \n     from imposing geographic restrictions on the use of U.S. \n     passports except in narrowly limited circumstances, it \n     appeared that the right to travel had been protected.\n       However, in 1982, President Reagan found a way around the \n     limitation in the Passport Act by using the trade embargo \n     statute to impose currency restrictions on travel to Cuba. \n     President Reagan prohibited all travel to Cuba except by \n     journalists, professional researchers, and persons visiting \n     close relatives, or where Cuba hosted the travel. Americans \n     seeking to travel to Cuba brought suit challenging the \n     reimposition of the ban on the grounds that the President did \n     not have the authority to impose it under the TWEA. They \n     argued that when Congress repealed the President's national \n     emergency powers under TWEA, the grandfather clause \n     preserving ``the authorities'' ``which were being exercised \n     with respect to a country on July 1, 1977'' did not include \n     authority to impose a travel ban not in effect in July, 1977.\n       The appeals court struck down the travel ban as \n     unauthorized, based on earlier Supreme Court decisions \n     requiring a narrow construction of delegated presidential \n     powers restricting the right to travel.\\2\\ The appeals court \n     also reasoned that the 1978 Passport Act amendment \n     prohibiting geographic restrictions on the use of passports \n     would be meaningless if the President could achieve the same \n     result by imposing currency restrictions under the trade \n     embargo laws.\n       The Supreme Court, with Justice Rehnquist writing the \n     opinion, reversed. Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222 (1984). Taking \n     an expansive view of the President's powers in areas \n     affecting foreign policy, the Supreme Court read the \n     grandfather clause broadly to authorize the subsequent travel \n     restrictions. The Court did not explain how its conclusion \n     could be reconciled with Congress' explicit prohibition of \n     the imposition of geographic restrictions on the right to \n     travel. It upheld the travel restrictions, by a 5-4 vote, \n     because of the overriding national security concerns asserted \n     by the government. Specifically, the Court relied on State \n     Department assertions that the influx of hard currency from \n     beach tourism and other travel to Cuba posed a threat to \n     the national security of the United States because Cuba \n     was allied with the Soviet Union, was supporting armed \n     insurrection in the Western Hemisphere, and had 40,000 \n     troops stationed in Africa and the Middle East in support \n     of objectives inimical to U.S. national security \n     interests. 468 U.S. at 243.\\3\\\n       Of course, none of these national security concerns exist \n     today. The Soviet Union no longer exists. Cuba poses no \n     threat to the national defense of United States. It no longer \n     has troops stationed in Africa or elsewhere and is no longer \n     providing support for violence in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n           current developments: 1994 Free Trade in Ideas Act\n\n       After the end of the Cold War, Congress again took up the \n     issue of travel restrictions. In 1993, Rep. Howard Berman \n     introduced H.R. 1579, the ``Free Trade in Ideas Act of 1993'' \n     to prohibit trade embargo restrictions on the free exchange \n     of information and to protect the right to travel.\n       In June, 1993, Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote \n     Mr. Berman a letter asking him to withdraw the provision in \n     exchange for regulatory reform and ``an inter-agency review \n     of our existing sanctions programs, policies, and legislation \n     to ensure they properly reflect our mutual commitment to the \n     dissemination of information and ideas.''\\4\\ Secretary \n     Christopher also affirmed ``the Administration's commitment \n     to the dissemination of information and ideas as a \n     significant element in the promotion of democracy'' and \n     expressly endorsed ``the underlying objectives of the Free \n     Trade in Ideas Act.'' Id. In response, Congress deferred \n     further consideration of the bill.\n       When the Executive Branch review was not finished by the \n     spring of 1994, Congress enacted the 1994 Free Trade in Ideas \n     Act as part of the State Department Authorization Act. In \n     passing this bill, Congress explicitly recognized that \n     constitutional rights were at stake and acted to prohibit \n     travel bans being imposed as part of future embargoes. H. \n     Rept. 103-482, at 238. The Act amends the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to prohibit any \n     restrictions on travel (including currency restrictions) in \n     any future embargoes imposed pursuant to the IEEPA. The \n     provision exempts all current IEEPA embargoes from this \n     requirement, and it does not apply to embargoes under the \n     TWEA, such as Cuba and North Korea. The Clinton \n     Administration opposed this change. This is an important \n     protection for future embargoes, although it does not \n     explicitly apply to embargoes imposed by the United Nations \n     and implemented pursuant to the United Nations \n     Participation Act.\n       Based on its understanding of the Administration's \n     commitment to the principle of free trade in ideas and the \n     unfinished status of the inter-agency review, the Congress \n     did not pass binding legislation governing travel under \n     current embargoes. It did, however, pass a non-binding Sense \n     of the Congress resolution that ``the President should not \n     restrict travel or exchanges for informational, educational, \n     religious, cultural, or humanitarian purposes or for public \n     performances or exhibitions, between the United States and \n     any other country.'' The conference report accompanying the \n     final bill noted that ``[t]he committee of conference \n     understands that it is the policy of the executive branch to \n     now undertake to incorporate this principle through \n     regulatory and administrative changes, including issuance of \n     visas for these purposes, and removal of currency \n     restrictions for such activities, in all existing and future \n     embargoes.'' H. Rept. 103-482, at 239.\\5\\\n       Finally, the 1994 Act amends the TWEA and the IEEPA to \n     collect overly narrow Treasury Department interpretations of \n     1988 free trade in ideas legislation which prohibited \n     restrictions on the import or export of information and \n     informational materials. These changes make clear that all \n     information and informational materials are exempted from all \n     existing and future embargoes, regardless of the type, \n     format, or means of transmission (including electronic \n     information). Apparently in response to this provision, the \n     United Nations economic embargo to Haiti exempted information \n     from its coverage. See United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 917 (May 6, 1994).\n\n\n                 Current restrictions on travel to Cuba\n\n       For five years from 1977 to 1982, the government imposed no \n     restrictions on the right of Americans to travel to Cuba. See \n     42 Fed. Reg. 16621 (1977); 42 Fed. Reg. 25499 (1977). This \n     was the case despite ongoing Cold War hostilities and the \n     maintenance of the economic embargo. In 1982, however, \n     President Reagan reimposed the travel ban, with very limited \n     exceptions. Even though the reasons for imposition of the \n     1982 ban have all disappeared, the Cuban travel ban remains \n     in large measure unchanged. In June 1993, in response to the \n     Cuban Democracy Act, it was slightly eased. However, 6 weeks \n     ago, on August 26, 1994, it was tightened. Current \n     restrictions are more stringent than those imposed by \n     President Reagan.\n       When the current administration took office, the Cuban \n     embargo banned travel by all Americans, except professional \n     researchers ``with an established interest in Cuba,'' \n     journalists, people visiting close family relatives, and \n     persons whose travel was hosted by Cubans. Thus, American \n     journalists, professional researchers doing work on Cuba, and \n     Americans visiting their family were free to travel to \n     Cuba under a general license, meaning that they did not \n     have to ask the U.S. Government for permission to go. Of \n     course, if individuals went to Cuba, who did not come \n     within these categories, they would be guilty of \n     committing a federal felony. Tourist travel was banned. In \n     addition, since July 1993, persons could apply for special \n     permission to go for educational purposes, to travel on \n     behalf of human rights organizations, or for purposes of \n     importing informational materials, or for public \n     performance or exhibitions.\n       In practice, these restrictions have proved unworkable and \n     discriminatory, as set out in more detail below. However, \n     after passage of the congressional resolution in the Free \n     Trade in Ideas Act, we understood that the Administration was \n     working on changes to implement the congressional resolution \n     and to allow all travel except tourist travel.\n       We were extremely disappointed on August 26, when, instead \n     of making changes to implement the resolution, the \n     Administration issued new regulations, tightening instead of \n     loosening the travel restrictions. They did so, not in \n     response to any asserted national security threat, but \n     because record numbers of Cubans were fleeing Cuba for the \n     United States and as part of an effort to persuade Castro to \n     prevent more Cubans from leaving.\n       The new regulations ban all family travel, except in cases \n     of terminal illness or severe medical emergency. Even then, \n     you have to ask and wait for U.S. government permission to \n     visit your dying mother. Such an absurd restriction is not \n     only a violation of the right to travel, but also of the \n     fundamental liberty interests that protect family relations. \n     Congress clearly intended such travel to be protected when it \n     passed the non-binding resolution. While the congressional \n     resolution does not explicitly refer to ``family'' travel, it \n     instead refers to the broader category of travel for \n     ``humanitarian'' purposes. The resolution was meant to cover \n     all travel except tourist travel, and did not explicitly \n     refer to ``family'' travel only because no one ever thought \n     that the administration would reverse this decade old policy.\n       The new regulations no longer permit travel by free-lance \n     journalists or documentary film-makers: the general license \n     for journalists is now restricted to those ``regularly \n     employed in that capacity by a news reporting organization'' \n     when the regulations had included a general license for \n     ``persons who are traveling for the purpose of gathering \n     news, making news or documentary films,'' 31 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 515.560(a)(1)(ii).\n       The new regulations require professional researchers to \n     individually apply for permission to go, when they were \n     previously free to travel under a general license.\n       The new regulations no longer permit travel ``for purposes \n     of public performances, public exhibitions or similar \n     activities'', when specific licenses for such purposes have \n     been available since last June, and travel for this purpose \n     was specifically referred to in the congressional \n     resolution.\n       The new regulations contain no safeguards to ensure that \n     even people coming within these limited categories will \n     receive timely approval of their travel requests or that the \n     Treasury Department will cease arbitrarily denying such \n     licenses as it was doing prior to the passage of the \n     Congressional resolution.\\6\\\n       Since August, Administration policy has been unclear. While \n     Anthony Lake stated that ``the President remains firmly \n     committed to the free exchange of ideas and information,'' \n     that commitment evidently extends only to persons who can \n     demonstrate ``genuine educational or research needs'' to the \n     satisfaction of the Treasury Department.\\7\\ Although Lake \n     also announced that ``travel for educational or research \n     purposes will continue to be permitted under the same \n     standards as before'' in practice that has not turned out to \n     be the case.\n       Since the August tightening of restrictions, groups of \n     academics seeking to attend academic conferences who would \n     previously have been free to travel under the general license \n     for professional researchers have been forced to submit \n     extensive information about themselves and their scholarly \n     pursuits. They needed a lawyer to obtain permission. Dan \n     Walsh of Liberation Graphics, an importer of Cuban political \n     posters, has been unable to get his specific license renewed, \n     even though Treasury Department employees told him he was in \n     full compliance and entitled to renewal of this license. \n     Treasury Department employees have also said that while they \n     have been directed to first process requests for permission \n     from Cuban-Americans seeking to visit family members in \n     emergencies, they do not have the staff to do so.\n       In general there is great confusion about who is entitled \n     to go under the regulations and no written guidance from the \n     Treasury Department. For example, while the regulations state \n     that only persons ``regularly employed . . . by a news \n     reporting organization,'' travel under the general license, \n     Treasury has informed some people that it interprets this to \n     include free-lance journalists. As a result, Americans \n     seeking to exercise their constitutional rights must find a \n     lawyer to advise them whether they face jail for doing so.\n       Even before the August charges, the regulatory scheme had \n     proved unworkable and discriminatory. Some persons, including \n     a group of mathematicians who should have been entitled to a \n     specific license for educational travel were denied licenses. \n     The government threatened to criminally prosecute a group of \n     travelers who were clearly entitled to a specific license for \n     an educational trip, but chose as a matter of principle not \n     to apply for a license. In October, 1993 and again in June, \n     1994, the group called the Freedom to Travel Campaign \n     organized an educational trip to Cuba, but did not apply \n     for a specific license because they believed the \n     regulations to be unconstitutional. The 175 travelers on \n     the October trip were professionals, free-lance \n     journalists, and others with an established interest in \n     Cuba. They came from around the country and included \n     doctors, teachers, engineers, priests, and blue collar \n     workers, ranging in age from 4 to 89. They spent a week in \n     Cuba with a full-time schedule of educational, research, \n     and journalistic activities, including visiting day care \n     centers, health clinics, and agricultural cooperatives. \n     They met and had extensive discussions with government \n     officials, experts on Cuban affairs, and ordinary \n     citizens. Upon their return, many were questioned and \n     harassed by Customs agents. The travelers were then \n     referred to the Department of Justice for possible \n     criminal prosecution under the Trading with the Enemy Act \n     and the matter has not been resolved. The group organized \n     a second trip in June and right before the trip, the \n     Treasury Department blocked the group's bank account on \n     the grounds that they intended to violate the law. The \n     group went anyway and has filed a lawsuit seeking return \n     of their money and challenging the Cuba travel \n     regulations. The lawsuit is now pending and the group is \n     at this moment in Cuba on a third trip.\n       All of these examples illustrate the grave constitutional \n     problems which arise under a regulatory scheme which picks \n     and chooses which Americans may exercise their constitutional \n     rights and then makes those rights subject to bureaucratic \n     regulations. Indeed, as far as we can determine, the \n     government threatened with prosecution and froze the bank \n     account of the Freedom to Travel campaign without any high \n     level policy review of whether the government interest at \n     stake is the ``weightiest national security interest'' \n     necessary to restrict these constitutional rights. Indicting \n     Americans for simply exercising their First and Fifth \n     Amendment rights would be unprecedented in recent history. \n     Before the government even considers doing so, the Secretary \n     of State and the Attorney General personally should determine \n     that doing so is essential to the national security. We do \n     not believe that determination can be made in good faith.\n       Moreover, a regulatory scheme such as this, which gives \n     Treasury officials unbounded discretion to grant or deny a \n     permit application, violates the First Amendment on that \n     ground as well. See 31 C.F.R. Sec. 515.560(b) (allowing OFAC \n     to grant licenses ``in appropriate cases'' without defining \n     such cases). ``[I]n the area of free expression a licensing \n     statute placing unbridled discretion in the hands of a \n     government official or agency constitutes a prior restraint \n     and may result in censorship.'' Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Pub. \n     Co., 486 U.S. 750, 757 (1988).\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       None of the national security considerations found by the \n     Supreme Court to justify the Cuban travel ban in 1982, apply \n     today. Recognizing these changed circumstances, the Executive \n     no longer attempts to justify the travel restrictions as \n     necessary to our national defense. Instead, the \n     restrictions are justified as helpful to the U.S. foreign \n     policy objective of promoting democracy and human rights \n     in Cuba.\\8\\ The most recent tightening of the restrictions \n     was done in response to the increased flow of refugees \n     permitted by Cuban Premier Castro. But there is no support \n     for the proposition that fundamental rights of Americans \n     may legitimately be sacrificed to promote human rights in \n     Cuba.\n       While our constitutional history is replete with instances \n     in which fundamental rights have been subordinated to real or \n     asserted threats to the national security, never have such \n     rights been sacrificed for the reasons that now underlie the \n     present restrictions on travel to Cuba. Although those \n     reasons may be sufficient to prevent Americans from \n     purchasing cigars, rum, or sugar, they are not sufficient to \n     restrict the exchange of ideas and information via the right \n     to travel. Moreover, we suggest that it is paradoxical at the \n     very least to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba \n     through a policy that limits constitutional rights here.\n       Congress should now act to protect the constitutional right \n     to travel so that the Executive Branch may not sacrifice that \n     right whenever it deems it expedient to do so.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\See Regan v.

Howard L. Berman,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on International Operations, Committee \n         on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in regard to the ``Free \n     Trade in Ideas Act of 1993'', which is contained in Title II, \n     Part E, of your legislation to authorize appropriations for \n     FY 1994 and 1995 for the Department of State.\n       I am pleased to take this opportunity to affirm the \n     Administration's commitment to the dissemination of \n     information and ideas as a significant element in the \n     promotion of democracy, a central tenet of our foreign \n     policy. If conducted in a manner which safeguards national \n     security, and which does not merely constitute an \n     informational pretext for evasion of the larger financial \n     purposes of economic embargoes, the free flow of ideas and \n     information is also consistent with the maintenance and \n     enforcement of economic embargoes. Indeed, the free flow of \n     information can advance rather than hinder the foreign policy \n     goals which embargoes seek to accomplish.\n       Accordingly, the Department endorses the underlying \n     objectives of the Free Trade in Ideas Act. Nonetheless, like \n     you, we believe the Administration should retain the \n     authority to control information flow for non-prolife action, \n     anti-terrorism, export control and other highly compelling \n     foreign policy or national security purposes. We also believe \n     that the objectives of your legislation, for the most part, \n     can be achieved through regulation although some statutory \n     clarification of these matters may be useful.\n       I propose that the Department conduct, on an expedited \n     basis, an inter-agency review of our existing sanctions \n     programs, policies, and legislation to ensure they properly \n     reflect our mutual commitment to the dissemination of \n     information and ideas. We will consult closely with you and \n     your staff during this review. In return, I ask that you \n     agree to withdraw this Title from the bill when it comes \n     before the full committee.\n       I hope this proposal will be satisfactory to you. I look \n     forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Warren Christopher.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1994.\n     Audrey Chapman,\n     Program Director, American Association for the Advancement of \n         Science,\n     1333 H Street, N.W., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Chapman: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     United States policy toward Cuba. The decisions announced by \n     the President on August 20, 1994, and subsequently \n     implemented by the Department of the Treasury, are consistent \n     with our long-standing goal of seeking a peaceful transition \n     to democracy in Cuba. The careful application of sanctions is \n     designed to pressure the Cuban government and cut off the \n     supply of foreign currency it uses to support its failed \n     economy.\n       I can assure you that the President remains firmly \n     committed to the free exchange of ideas and information. \n     Travel for educational or research purposes will continue to \n     be permitted under the same standards as before. This will \n     ensure that people with genuine educational or research needs \n     will still be permitted to travel to Cuba.\n       I appreciate your concerns and assure you that the \n     President and I share your goal of moving toward a democratic \n     Cuba and resuming normal relations with a freely elected \n     Cuban government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Anthony Lake,\n     National Security Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                          THE RIGHT TO TRAVEL\n\tMr. SIMON. Mr. President, on Wednesday, October 5, I held a hearing in my capacity as chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee on the Constitutional Right to International Travel. The hearing focused on the derivation of this well-established constitutional right, on the circumstances under which the right can be restricted, and on the wisdom as a policy matter of restricting the ability of Americans to visit nations with whom we may have political differences.\n\tIn the course of this hearing, it became clear to me that there are limited instances in which the right of Americans to travel abroad should be restricted--namely, instances where international travel endangers the safety of the traveler or implicates national security concerns. Otherwise, as a matter of both constitutional law (the First and Fifth Amendments as well as other constitutional provisions) and policy, the right to a free trade in ideas and to investigations into other nations and cultures should be not only left untrammelled, but encouraged.\n\tDuring the course of this hearing, it also became clear to me that this Administration, as well as past Administrations, has been less protective or supportive of the right to travel as I think the Constitution requires. Administrations both past and present have on several occasions restricted travel to nations that pose absolutely no security risk either to the United States or to those who travel to that nation, relying on the Executive's foreign policy authority to effect these restrictions. This is true even though we have managed to achieve the greatest foreign policy successes in those very areas that we have left open to American travelers.\n\tOn several occasions, Congress has not stood idly by while restrictions have been placed on international travel, and has often undertaken efforts to protect the right to travel from inappropriate and unwise restrictions. More needs to be done, however; currently travel restrictions are in place with respect to a number of countries that pose no risk to our nation's or citizens' security. I intend to look at this issue closely in the next session, and probably to introduce legislation to address both present and future travel restrictions. I hope to work closely with my colleagues in both Houses of Congress who agree with me as to the necessity of protecting this important right.\n\tIn the meantime, I would like to place in the record the written statement from the October 5 hearing of Kate Martin, Executive Director of the ACLU's National Security Project. This statement explains the history of the constitutional right to travel, the ways in which Congress may inject itself into this debate, notwithstanding claims that congressional involvement in the travel issue impinges on the President's foreign affairs authority. It is a thoughtful and thorough discussion of the travel issue, and one that suggests the need for reform in this area in the very near future.\n\tThe statement follows:\n\n   Statement of Kate Martin, Director, Center for National Security Studies, American Civil Liberties Union on the Constitutional Right To \n                                 Travel\n\n       Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee: I am very pleased \n     to have this opportunity to testify on behalf of the Center \n     for National Security Studies of the American Civil Liberties \n     Union on the constitutional right to travel. The ACLU is a \n     non-profit, non-partisan organization, with over 275,000 \n     members, dedicated to the protection of civil liberties and \n     the democratic process. The ACLU takes no position on \n     substantive matters of U.S. foreign policy, including the \n     Cuban embargo, except to the extent that such policies \n     violate individual liberties or the democratic process.\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       The right to travel is a fundamental aspect of individual \n     liberty protected by both international law and the \n     Constitution. It is also essential to the exercise of First \n     Amendment freedoms. The Supreme Court recognizes that right, \n     and the Congress has acted repeatedly to protect the right \n     against infringement by Executive branch actions.\n       The current travel ban on travel to Cuba imposed under the \n     Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA), violates this fundamental \n     right. Bureaucratic enforcement of the current restrictions \n     has been arbitrary and involved improper government inquiries \n     and censorship. Moreover, the administration's most recent \n     actions tightening the Cuban travel restrictions also violate \n     its commitments made to Congress earlier this year.\n       The 1982 Supreme Count case, Regan v. Wald, which rejected \n     a challenge to the Cuba travel ban then in effect, is no \n     authority for the continuation of the present restrictions in \n     this post-Cold War world. The opinion in that case, written \n     by Justice Rehnquist for a narrow 5-4 majority did not hold \n     that there was no constitutional right to travel. Nor did it \n     hold that the government may restrict travel whenever it \n     deems such restrictions useful. To the contrary, Regan held \n     only that when the government asserts the weightiest of \n     national security reasons, important to the military defense \n     of the United States, for restricting travel, the court will \n     defer to such reasons. The reasons found sufficient in that \n     case--all related to the existence of the Cold War--no longer \n     exist. The current justification proffered for the travel \n     ban--to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba--does not \n     as a matter of law or common sense justify restricting the \n     human rights of Americans.\n       The events of the last fifteen months demonstrate that \n     protection of this constitutional right will never be secure \n     so long as it can be held hostage to the political or foreign \n     policy objectives of the moment. Congress should act now to \n     protect this right, by prohibiting all travel restrictions \n     imposed under economic embargoes.\n\n\n             The Constitution Protects the Right to Travel\n\n       Most Americans do not realize that it is a crime for them \n     to travel to Cuba and would be shocked to find out that is \n     the case. They instinctively understand that the right to \n     travel freely is part of the basic liberty which our \n     democratic government was established to protect. Indeed, the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Art, 13, recognizes \n     the right to travel both inside one's country and \n     internationally. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized \n     that the right to travel is protected under the Fifth \n     Amendment as a liberty interest that cannot be deprived \n     without due process of law.\\1\\ Indeed, even the Executive \n     Branch concedes that ``the right to travel--both domestically \n     and internationally--is constitutionally protected,'' \n     although it violates this principle in action. Report of the \n     United States of America Under the International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, (ICCPR Report) July 28, 1994, \n     Art. 12, p. 99.---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\Footnotes at end of article.---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Moreover, restrictions on the right to travel must be \n     judged against the central principle of the First Amendment: \n     ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech,'' means that every person is free to speak her mind \n     about the actions of the government and to participate in the \n     debate about the great issues of the day. To participate \n     effectively in this process, private persons must have access \n     to information. To participate in debate about foreign policy \n     questions, they must have access to information about events \n     taking place in the world. It would seem beyond debate that, \n     except in the most compelling circumstances, the government \n     may not interfere with the ability of private citizens to \n     find out for themselves what is going on around the world and \n     to use that information to influence public debate.\n       As the Supreme Court has explained:\n       ``. . . . In Anglo-Saxon law that right [to travel] was \n     emerging at least as early as the Magna Carta. Chafee, Three \n     Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787 (1956), 171-181, 187 \n     et seq., shows how deeply engrained in our history this \n     freedom of movement is. Freedom of movement across frontiers \n     in either direction, . . . was a part of our heritage. Travel \n     abroad, like travel within the country, may be necessary for \n     a livelihood. It may be as close to the heart of the \n     individual as the choice of what he eats, or wears, or reads. \n     Freedom of movement is basic in our scheme of values. . . . \n     ``Our nation,'' wrote Chafee, ``has thrived on the principle \n     that, outside areas of plainly harmful conduct, every \n     American is left to shape his own life as he thinks best, do \n     what he pleases, go where he pleases.''\n       ``Freedom of movement also has large social values. As \n     Chafee put it:\n       ``Foreign correspondents and lectures on public affairs \n     need firsthand information. Scientists and scholars gain \n     greatly from consultations with colleagues in other \n     countries. Students equip themselves for more fruitful \n     careers in the United States by instruction in foreign \n     universities. Then there are reasons close to the core of \n     personal life--marriage, reuniting families, spending hours \n     with old friends. Finally, travel abroad . . . helps them to \n     be well-informed on public issues. An American who has \n     crossed the ocean is not obliged to form his opinions about \n     our foreign policy merely from what he is told by \n     officials of our government or by a few correspondents of \n     American newspapers. Moreover, his views on domestic \n     questions are enriched by seeing how foreigners are trying \n     to solve similar problems. In many different ways direct \n     contact with other countries contributes to sounder \n     decisions at home.''\n\n     (Citations and footnotes omitted.) Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. \n     at 126-127.\n       Nevertheless, there is a long history of efforts to abridge \n     Americans' right to travel, usually in the name of some \n     foreign policy goal, such as fighting communism or promoting \n     democracy, sometimes, to punish Americans holding minority \n     political views. Each political branch has at different \n     times, acted both to protect and to restrict the right, \n     depending on the prevailing political winds. At times, the \n     Supreme Court has wavered in its commitment to this \n     fundamental right. However, history demonstrates a growing \n     and inexorable recognition that the sharing of information \n     and ideas by travel and otherwise is a cornerstone of \n     individual liberty, and essential to the building of \n     democracy.\n       It has become increasingly clear that banning travel by \n     Americans to foreign dictatorships has never resulted in the \n     avowed goal of undermining that dictatorship. Indeed the \n     current Administration no longer even attempts to justify the \n     Cuban travel ban on that basis. They, like all serious \n     observers, recognize the positive benefits democratic forces \n     derive from the sharing of information and ideas. Thus, they \n     are driven to pretend that in banning travel, they are not \n     banning the sharing of information and ideas, but only \n     implementing currency regulations. Testimony of Alexander \n     Watson, Assistant Secretary of State, Joint Hearing on U.S. \n     Policy and the Future of Cuba, Subcommittees on Economic \n     Policy, Trade, and Environment; Western Hemisphere Affairs; \n     and International Operations; of the Committee on Foreign \n     Affairs of the House of Representatives, Nov. 18, 1993, p 19.\n       In recent years, protection of the right to travel and to \n     share information and ideas has fallen mainly to the \n     Congress. In particular, Congressman Howard Berman has been \n     instrumental in passing Free Trade In Ideas legislation, \n     first in 1988, then in 1991, and again this year. The recent \n     tightening of the Cuban travel ban demonstrates the necessity \n     for Congress to act again.\n\n\n                     history of the right to travel\n\n       Historically, Americans' right to travel was regulated \n     under the Passport Act, not the economic embargo laws. For \n     the first hundred years of travel regulations, travel was \n     restricted only during time of war. Although Congress passed \n     the first Passport Act in 1856, it did not make it illegal to \n     travel without a passport until 1918. The 1918 statute \n     delegated to the President the right during time of war, to \n     impose by proclamation, a requirement that U.S. citizens use \n     a passport when entering or leaving the country. In 1918 and \n     again in 1941, the President issued such proclamations. In \n     1952, as part of the McCarren-Walter Act, the Congress again \n     delegated power to the President to proclaim a national \n     emergency during which use of a passport would be required \n     and in 1953, President Truman declared the situation in North \n     Korea to be a national emergency. Immigration and \n     Nationality Act Sec. 215. Only in 1978, when Congress \n     otherwise restricted the President's authority, did it \n     permit him to always require a passport for entering or \n     leaving the country. 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1185(b).\n       During the McCarthy era, the government also sought to deny \n     the right to travel to certain Americans based on their \n     political beliefs. That practice was not finally outlawed \n     until 1991 when Congress amended the Passport Act. In 1952, \n     the Secretary of State declared pursuant to the delegation \n     provision in the 1926 Passport Act that passports were not to \n     be issued to members of the Communist Party for reasons of \n     national security. This prohibition was challenged as \n     unconstitutional and unauthorized and in 1958, the Supreme \n     Court struck it down on the ground that Congress had not \n     authorized it. Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116 (1958).\n       Six years later, the Court again considered the issue of \n     revocation of passports of Communists and this time held a \n     statute specifically authorizing such revocation \n     unconstitutional. Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U.S. \n     500 (1964). In this case, the Subversive Activities Control \n     Act specifically provided that members of the Communist party \n     should have their passports revoked. There being no issue \n     whether the Executive had authority to revoke the passports, \n     the Court was forced to reach the constitutional issue and \n     struck down the law as overly broad and indiscriminate. \n     Justice Douglas declared that absent war, the government had \n     no power to keep a citizen from traveling unless there was \n     power to detain him or her.\n       Nevertheless, as late as 1981, the Executive Branch \n     continued to assert that the President's foreign policy \n     powers include the right to revoke an American's passport in \n     order to prevent her from denouncing U.S. policy abroad. See \n     Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280 (1981). In 1991, Congress amended \n     the Passport Act to prohibit revocation of passports on the \n     basis of activities protected by the First Amendment.\n       The Executive Branch also sought to restrict the travel \n     rights of Americans by putting area restrictions on the use \n     of passports. In Zemel v. Rusk, 381 U.S. 1 (1965) the Supreme \n     Court decided that the statutory language, which had been \n     held not to authorize the President to refuse passports to \n     Communists, did authorize the President to refuse to validate \n     passports for travel to Cuba. The court went on to find the \n     passport restriction on travel to Cuba to be constitutional, \n     because it was supported by the ``weightiest considerations \n     of national security.''\n       However, even as the Supreme Court deferred to the \n     Executive concerning passport controls, the Congress became \n     increasingly active in protecting that right against \n     executive limitation. In 1978, Congress rejected the result \n     in Zemel and explicitly prohibited the President from \n     imposing geographic restrictions on the use of passports \n     under the Passport Act except ``where armed hostilities are \n     in progress, or where there is imminent danger to the public \n     health or the physical safety of United States \n     travellers.'' 22 U.S.C. Sec. 211a. In our judgment, this \n     provision of the Passport Act includes all circumstances, \n     in which the government may legitimately ban travel.\n       Indeed, in the late 1970's, Americans' right to travel and \n     in particular their right to travel to Cuba was for a time \n     secure. Although the trade embargo of Cuba first declared in \n     1963 under the TWEA, included restrictions on travel by \n     Americans, in 1977, President Carter lifted the ban to permit \n     all Americans to travel to Cuba, for any purpose. Thereafter, \n     Congress amended the Trading with the Enemy Act to restrict \n     its invocation by the President to times of war, although it \n     grandfathered existing restrictions. When Congress also \n     amended the Passport Act in 1978 to prohibit the Executive \n     from imposing geographic restrictions on the use of U.S. \n     passports except in narrowly limited circumstances, it \n     appeared that the right to travel had been protected.\n       However, in 1982, President Reagan found a way around the \n     limitation in the Passport Act by using the trade embargo \n     statute to impose currency restrictions on travel to Cuba. \n     President Reagan prohibited all travel to Cuba except by \n     journalists, professional researchers, and persons visiting \n     close relatives, or where Cuba hosted the travel. Americans \n     seeking to travel to Cuba brought suit challenging the \n     reimposition of the ban on the grounds that the President did \n     not have the authority to impose it under the TWEA. They \n     argued that when Congress repealed the President's national \n     emergency powers under TWEA, the grandfather clause \n     preserving ``the authorities'' ``which were being exercised \n     with respect to a country on July 1, 1977'' did not include \n     authority to impose a travel ban not in effect in July, 1977.\n       The appeals court struck down the travel ban as \n     unauthorized, based on earlier Supreme Court decisions \n     requiring a narrow construction of delegated presidential \n     powers restricting the right to travel.\\2\\ The appeals court \n     also reasoned that the 1978 Passport Act amendment \n     prohibiting geographic restrictions on the use of passports \n     would be meaningless if the President could achieve the same \n     result by imposing currency restrictions under the trade \n     embargo laws.\n       The Supreme Court, with Justice Rehnquist writing the \n     opinion, reversed. Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222 (1984). Taking \n     an expansive view of the President's powers in areas \n     affecting foreign policy, the Supreme Court read the \n     grandfather clause broadly to authorize the subsequent travel \n     restrictions. The Court did not explain how its conclusion \n     could be reconciled with Congress' explicit prohibition of \n     the imposition of geographic restrictions on the right to \n     travel. It upheld the travel restrictions, by a 5-4 vote, \n     because of the overriding national security concerns asserted \n     by the government. Specifically, the Court relied on State \n     Department assertions that the influx of hard currency from \n     beach tourism and other travel to Cuba posed a threat to \n     the national security of the United States because Cuba \n     was allied with the Soviet Union, was supporting armed \n     insurrection in the Western Hemisphere, and had 40,000 \n     troops stationed in Africa and the Middle East in support \n     of objectives inimical to U.S. national security \n     interests. 468 U.S. at 243.\\3\\\n       Of course, none of these national security concerns exist \n     today. The Soviet Union no longer exists. Cuba poses no \n     threat to the national defense of United States. It no longer \n     has troops stationed in Africa or elsewhere and is no longer \n     providing support for violence in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\n           current developments: 1994 Free Trade in Ideas Act\n\n       After the end of the Cold War, Congress again took up the \n     issue of travel restrictions. In 1993, Rep. Howard Berman \n     introduced H.R. 1579, the ``Free Trade in Ideas Act of 1993'' \n     to prohibit trade embargo restrictions on the free exchange \n     of information and to protect the right to travel.\n       In June, 1993, Secretary of State Warren Christopher wrote \n     Mr. Berman a letter asking him to withdraw the provision in \n     exchange for regulatory reform and ``an inter-agency review \n     of our existing sanctions programs, policies, and legislation \n     to ensure they properly reflect our mutual commitment to the \n     dissemination of information and ideas.''\\4\\ Secretary \n     Christopher also affirmed ``the Administration's commitment \n     to the dissemination of information and ideas as a \n     significant element in the promotion of democracy'' and \n     expressly endorsed ``the underlying objectives of the Free \n     Trade in Ideas Act.'' Id. In response, Congress deferred \n     further consideration of the bill.\n       When the Executive Branch review was not finished by the \n     spring of 1994, Congress enacted the 1994 Free Trade in Ideas \n     Act as part of the State Department Authorization Act. In \n     passing this bill, Congress explicitly recognized that \n     constitutional rights were at stake and acted to prohibit \n     travel bans being imposed as part of future embargoes. H. \n     Rept. 103-482, at 238. The Act amends the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to prohibit any \n     restrictions on travel (including currency restrictions) in \n     any future embargoes imposed pursuant to the IEEPA. The \n     provision exempts all current IEEPA embargoes from this \n     requirement, and it does not apply to embargoes under the \n     TWEA, such as Cuba and North Korea. The Clinton \n     Administration opposed this change. This is an important \n     protection for future embargoes, although it does not \n     explicitly apply to embargoes imposed by the United Nations \n     and implemented pursuant to the United Nations \n     Participation Act.\n       Based on its understanding of the Administration's \n     commitment to the principle of free trade in ideas and the \n     unfinished status of the inter-agency review, the Congress \n     did not pass binding legislation governing travel under \n     current embargoes. It did, however, pass a non-binding Sense \n     of the Congress resolution that ``the President should not \n     restrict travel or exchanges for informational, educational, \n     religious, cultural, or humanitarian purposes or for public \n     performances or exhibitions, between the United States and \n     any other country.'' The conference report accompanying the \n     final bill noted that ``[t]he committee of conference \n     understands that it is the policy of the executive branch to \n     now undertake to incorporate this principle through \n     regulatory and administrative changes, including issuance of \n     visas for these purposes, and removal of currency \n     restrictions for such activities, in all existing and future \n     embargoes.'' H. Rept. 103-482, at 239.\\5\\\n       Finally, the 1994 Act amends the TWEA and the IEEPA to \n     collect overly narrow Treasury Department interpretations of \n     1988 free trade in ideas legislation which prohibited \n     restrictions on the import or export of information and \n     informational materials. These changes make clear that all \n     information and informational materials are exempted from all \n     existing and future embargoes, regardless of the type, \n     format, or means of transmission (including electronic \n     information). Apparently in response to this provision, the \n     United Nations economic embargo to Haiti exempted information \n     from its coverage. See United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 917 (May 6, 1994).\n\n\n                 Current restrictions on travel to Cuba\n\n       For five years from 1977 to 1982, the government imposed no \n     restrictions on the right of Americans to travel to Cuba. See \n     42 Fed. Reg. 16621 (1977); 42 Fed. Reg. 25499 (1977). This \n     was the case despite ongoing Cold War hostilities and the \n     maintenance of the economic embargo. In 1982, however, \n     President Reagan reimposed the travel ban, with very limited \n     exceptions. Even though the reasons for imposition of the \n     1982 ban have all disappeared, the Cuban travel ban remains \n     in large measure unchanged. In June 1993, in response to the \n     Cuban Democracy Act, it was slightly eased. However, 6 weeks \n     ago, on August 26, 1994, it was tightened. Current \n     restrictions are more stringent than those imposed by \n     President Reagan.\n       When the current administration took office, the Cuban \n     embargo banned travel by all Americans, except professional \n     researchers ``with an established interest in Cuba,'' \n     journalists, people visiting close family relatives, and \n     persons whose travel was hosted by Cubans. Thus, American \n     journalists, professional researchers doing work on Cuba, and \n     Americans visiting their family were free to travel to \n     Cuba under a general license, meaning that they did not \n     have to ask the U.S. Government for permission to go. Of \n     course, if individuals went to Cuba, who did not come \n     within these categories, they would be guilty of \n     committing a federal felony. Tourist travel was banned. In \n     addition, since July 1993, persons could apply for special \n     permission to go for educational purposes, to travel on \n     behalf of human rights organizations, or for purposes of \n     importing informational materials, or for public \n     performance or exhibitions.\n       In practice, these restrictions have proved unworkable and \n     discriminatory, as set out in more detail below. However, \n     after passage of the congressional resolution in the Free \n     Trade in Ideas Act, we understood that the Administration was \n     working on changes to implement the congressional resolution \n     and to allow all travel except tourist travel.\n       We were extremely disappointed on August 26, when, instead \n     of making changes to implement the resolution, the \n     Administration issued new regulations, tightening instead of \n     loosening the travel restrictions. They did so, not in \n     response to any asserted national security threat, but \n     because record numbers of Cubans were fleeing Cuba for the \n     United States and as part of an effort to persuade Castro to \n     prevent more Cubans from leaving.\n       The new regulations ban all family travel, except in cases \n     of terminal illness or severe medical emergency. Even then, \n     you have to ask and wait for U.S. government permission to \n     visit your dying mother. Such an absurd restriction is not \n     only a violation of the right to travel, but also of the \n     fundamental liberty interests that protect family relations. \n     Congress clearly intended such travel to be protected when it \n     passed the non-binding resolution. While the congressional \n     resolution does not explicitly refer to ``family'' travel, it \n     instead refers to the broader category of travel for \n     ``humanitarian'' purposes. The resolution was meant to cover \n     all travel except tourist travel, and did not explicitly \n     refer to ``family'' travel only because no one ever thought \n     that the administration would reverse this decade old policy.\n       The new regulations no longer permit travel by free-lance \n     journalists or documentary film-makers: the general license \n     for journalists is now restricted to those ``regularly \n     employed in that capacity by a news reporting organization'' \n     when the regulations had included a general license for \n     ``persons who are traveling for the purpose of gathering \n     news, making news or documentary films,'' 31 C.F.R. \n     Sec. 515.560(a)(1)(ii).\n       The new regulations require professional researchers to \n     individually apply for permission to go, when they were \n     previously free to travel under a general license.\n       The new regulations no longer permit travel ``for purposes \n     of public performances, public exhibitions or similar \n     activities'', when specific licenses for such purposes have \n     been available since last June, and travel for this purpose \n     was specifically referred to in the congressional \n     resolution.\n       The new regulations contain no safeguards to ensure that \n     even people coming within these limited categories will \n     receive timely approval of their travel requests or that the \n     Treasury Department will cease arbitrarily denying such \n     licenses as it was doing prior to the passage of the \n     Congressional resolution.\\6\\\n       Since August, Administration policy has been unclear. While \n     Anthony Lake stated that ``the President remains firmly \n     committed to the free exchange of ideas and information,'' \n     that commitment evidently extends only to persons who can \n     demonstrate ``genuine educational or research needs'' to the \n     satisfaction of the Treasury Department.\\7\\ Although Lake \n     also announced that ``travel for educational or research \n     purposes will continue to be permitted under the same \n     standards as before'' in practice that has not turned out to \n     be the case.\n       Since the August tightening of restrictions, groups of \n     academics seeking to attend academic conferences who would \n     previously have been free to travel under the general license \n     for professional researchers have been forced to submit \n     extensive information about themselves and their scholarly \n     pursuits. They needed a lawyer to obtain permission. Dan \n     Walsh of Liberation Graphics, an importer of Cuban political \n     posters, has been unable to get his specific license renewed, \n     even though Treasury Department employees told him he was in \n     full compliance and entitled to renewal of this license. \n     Treasury Department employees have also said that while they \n     have been directed to first process requests for permission \n     from Cuban-Americans seeking to visit family members in \n     emergencies, they do not have the staff to do so.\n       In general there is great confusion about who is entitled \n     to go under the regulations and no written guidance from the \n     Treasury Department. For example, while the regulations state \n     that only persons ``regularly employed . . . by a news \n     reporting organization,'' travel under the general license, \n     Treasury has informed some people that it interprets this to \n     include free-lance journalists. As a result, Americans \n     seeking to exercise their constitutional rights must find a \n     lawyer to advise them whether they face jail for doing so.\n       Even before the August charges, the regulatory scheme had \n     proved unworkable and discriminatory. Some persons, including \n     a group of mathematicians who should have been entitled to a \n     specific license for educational travel were denied licenses. \n     The government threatened to criminally prosecute a group of \n     travelers who were clearly entitled to a specific license for \n     an educational trip, but chose as a matter of principle not \n     to apply for a license. In October, 1993 and again in June, \n     1994, the group called the Freedom to Travel Campaign \n     organized an educational trip to Cuba, but did not apply \n     for a specific license because they believed the \n     regulations to be unconstitutional. The 175 travelers on \n     the October trip were professionals, free-lance \n     journalists, and others with an established interest in \n     Cuba. They came from around the country and included \n     doctors, teachers, engineers, priests, and blue collar \n     workers, ranging in age from 4 to 89. They spent a week in \n     Cuba with a full-time schedule of educational, research, \n     and journalistic activities, including visiting day care \n     centers, health clinics, and agricultural cooperatives. \n     They met and had extensive discussions with government \n     officials, experts on Cuban affairs, and ordinary \n     citizens. Upon their return, many were questioned and \n     harassed by Customs agents. The travelers were then \n     referred to the Department of Justice for possible \n     criminal prosecution under the Trading with the Enemy Act \n     and the matter has not been resolved. The group organized \n     a second trip in June and right before the trip, the \n     Treasury Department blocked the group's bank account on \n     the grounds that they intended to violate the law. The \n     group went anyway and has filed a lawsuit seeking return \n     of their money and challenging the Cuba travel \n     regulations. The lawsuit is now pending and the group is \n     at this moment in Cuba on a third trip.\n       All of these examples illustrate the grave constitutional \n     problems which arise under a regulatory scheme which picks \n     and chooses which Americans may exercise their constitutional \n     rights and then makes those rights subject to bureaucratic \n     regulations. Indeed, as far as we can determine, the \n     government threatened with prosecution and froze the bank \n     account of the Freedom to Travel campaign without any high \n     level policy review of whether the government interest at \n     stake is the ``weightiest national security interest'' \n     necessary to restrict these constitutional rights. Indicting \n     Americans for simply exercising their First and Fifth \n     Amendment rights would be unprecedented in recent history. \n     Before the government even considers doing so, the Secretary \n     of State and the Attorney General personally should determine \n     that doing so is essential to the national security. We do \n     not believe that determination can be made in good faith.\n       Moreover, a regulatory scheme such as this, which gives \n     Treasury officials unbounded discretion to grant or deny a \n     permit application, violates the First Amendment on that \n     ground as well. See 31 C.F.R. Sec. 515.560(b) (allowing OFAC \n     to grant licenses ``in appropriate cases'' without defining \n     such cases). ``[I]n the area of free expression a licensing \n     statute placing unbridled discretion in the hands of a \n     government official or agency constitutes a prior restraint \n     and may result in censorship.'' Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Pub. \n     Co., 486 U.S. 750, 757 (1988).\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       None of the national security considerations found by the \n     Supreme Court to justify the Cuban travel ban in 1982, apply \n     today. Recognizing these changed circumstances, the Executive \n     no longer attempts to justify the travel restrictions as \n     necessary to our national defense. Instead, the \n     restrictions are justified as helpful to the U.S. foreign \n     policy objective of promoting democracy and human rights \n     in Cuba.\\8\\ The most recent tightening of the restrictions \n     was done in response to the increased flow of refugees \n     permitted by Cuban Premier Castro. But there is no support \n     for the proposition that fundamental rights of Americans \n     may legitimately be sacrificed to promote human rights in \n     Cuba.\n       While our constitutional history is replete with instances \n     in which fundamental rights have been subordinated to real or \n     asserted threats to the national security, never have such \n     rights been sacrificed for the reasons that now underlie the \n     present restrictions on travel to Cuba. Although those \n     reasons may be sufficient to prevent Americans from \n     purchasing cigars, rum, or sugar, they are not sufficient to \n     restrict the exchange of ideas and information via the right \n     to travel. Moreover, we suggest that it is paradoxical at the \n     very least to promote democracy and human rights in Cuba \n     through a policy that limits constitutional rights here.\n       Congress should now act to protect the constitutional right \n     to travel so that the Executive Branch may not sacrifice that \n     right whenever it deems it expedient to do so.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\See Regan v.

Howard L. Berman,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on International Operations, Committee \n         on Foreign Affairs, House of Representatives.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing in regard to the ``Free \n     Trade in Ideas Act of 1993'', which is contained in Title II, \n     Part E, of your legislation to authorize appropriations for \n     FY 1994 and 1995 for the Department of State.\n       I am pleased to take this opportunity to affirm the \n     Administration's commitment to the dissemination of \n     information and ideas as a significant element in the \n     promotion of democracy, a central tenet of our foreign \n     policy. If conducted in a manner which safeguards national \n     security, and which does not merely constitute an \n     informational pretext for evasion of the larger financial \n     purposes of economic embargoes, the free flow of ideas and \n     information is also consistent with the maintenance and \n     enforcement of economic embargoes. Indeed, the free flow of \n     information can advance rather than hinder the foreign policy \n     goals which embargoes seek to accomplish.\n       Accordingly, the Department endorses the underlying \n     objectives of the Free Trade in Ideas Act. Nonetheless, like \n     you, we believe the Administration should retain the \n     authority to control information flow for non-prolife action, \n     anti-terrorism, export control and other highly compelling \n     foreign policy or national security purposes. We also believe \n     that the objectives of your legislation, for the most part, \n     can be achieved through regulation although some statutory \n     clarification of these matters may be useful.\n       I propose that the Department conduct, on an expedited \n     basis, an inter-agency review of our existing sanctions \n     programs, policies, and legislation to ensure they properly \n     reflect our mutual commitment to the dissemination of \n     information and ideas. We will consult closely with you and \n     your staff during this review. In return, I ask that you \n     agree to withdraw this Title from the bill when it comes \n     before the full committee.\n       I hope this proposal will be satisfactory to you. I look \n     forward to hearing from you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Warren Christopher.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 1994.\n     Audrey Chapman,\n     Program Director, American Association for the Advancement of \n         Science,\n     1333 H Street, N.W., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Chapman: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     United States policy toward Cuba. The decisions announced by \n     the President on August 20, 1994, and subsequently \n     implemented by the Department of the Treasury, are consistent \n     with our long-standing goal of seeking a peaceful transition \n     to democracy in Cuba. The careful application of sanctions is \n     designed to pressure the Cuban government and cut off the \n     supply of foreign currency it uses to support its failed \n     economy.\n       I can assure you that the President remains firmly \n     committed to the free exchange of ideas and information. \n     Travel for educational or research purposes will continue to \n     be permitted under the same standards as before. This will \n     ensure that people with genuine educational or research needs \n     will still be permitted to travel to Cuba.\n       I appreciate your concerns and assure you that the \n     President and I share your goal of moving toward a democratic \n     Cuba and resuming normal relations with a freely elected \n     Cuban government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Anthony Lake,\n     National Security Affairs.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Paul Simon"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States Senate", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "140 Cong.

In 1986, while treating a \nemergency room patient, Barbara Fassbinder became infected with the HIV \nvirus. Barbara responded to her personal crises by working to raise \nAIDS awareness and educating all of us. She focused not on her own \nproblems but on how to help others. She worked to prevent others from \nbeing infected and sought to help those already living with AIDS. She \nexplained, ``If this can happen to me, it can happen to anybody. If \nwhat I'm doing prevents it from happening to just one other health care \nworker, then it means a lot to me.'' Because of the work and dedication \nof Barbara Fassbinder and other advocates, precautions are now taken to \nhelp protect health care professionals. Preventive measures, such as \nthe use of gloves and masks, are widely used to protect providers and \npatients from infection.\n  Barbara Fassbinder reflected upon her role in the fight against AIDS \nand remarked, ``Think of it this way. You're traveling down a mountain \nroad. You see a guard rail. How many people had to go over the edge \nbefore they put a guard rail up? We were a few of those people who had \nto go over the rail.'' Barbara is greatly missed by not only her \ncolleagues, friends and family in Iowa, but by all those who are \nworking to end the spread of AIDS. I had the pleasure of meeting with \nBarbara on a number of occasions and she was a valuable resource for me \nas well as my staff. She was a remarkable woman. I cannot begin to \nimagine the number of lives which have been touched and will continue \nto be touched by Barbara and her work. I can only express my deepest \ngratitude.\n  Emergency nurses, like Barbara Fassbinder, have improved the quality \nof medical care in our country.

Mr. President, This morning I returned from a trip to NATO \nheadquarters and London. While in Brussels, I met with the NATO \nSecretary General Willy Claes, our Supreme Allied Commander George \nJoulwan, the 16 Permanent Representatives to NATO, including our U.S. \nAmbassador to NATO, Robert Hunter, representatives of the countries \nparticipating in the Partnership For Peace, and the Russian Ambassador \nto NATO.\n  I went to Brussels because I am a strong supporter of NATO--I have \nbeen since the very beginning of the alliance. And, as a staunch \nsupporter of NATO I have been extremely concerned about the impact of \nthe situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina on the future of NATO. As I told \nthose I met with in Brussels, I would like to see NATO expand in the \nnear future--As NTO decided to do today. And I believe that there is an \nimportant role, for NATO in defending against potential instability in \nEurope and the former Soviet Union in the future. However, \nrealistically it will be difficult to make progress on these matters \nuntil we deal with Bosnia.\n  I carried the same message to London where I met with former Prime \nMinister, Lady Thatcher, Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, Defense \nMinister Rifkind, and Prime Minister Major. Moreover, I emphasized that \nas I see it, close ties between our Government and that of the United \nKingdom are as essential to NATO's success in the future, as they have \nbeen in the past. Our differences over Bosnia should not and will not \nchange that fact.\n  However, as I see it, NATO's failure to respond adequately to the war \nin Bosnia has undermined its credibility and raised serious questions \nabout NATO's continued relevance. It is not that NATO is unable, to act \ndecisively, it is that NATO has an unwilling partner--namely, the \nUnited Nations who can veto air strikes and limit NATO targets. Last \nApril, NATO decided ``* * * if any Bosnian Serb attacks involving heavy \nweapons are carried out on any U.N.-designated safe areas * * * these \nweapons and other Bosnian Serb military assets * * * will be subject to \nNATO air strikes.'' That's pretty clear. And it's pretty clear that \nnothing has happened. The bottom line is that because of the so-called \ndual key arrangement, NATO does not have control over its military \noperations in Bosnia--the U.N. protection forces do. In my view this \nU.N. veto over NATO actions sets a dangerous precedent. I recognize the \nneed for coordination, but not for subordination.\n  Mr. President, I raised these concerns in my meetings at NATO. No one \ndisputed the facts as I presented them. Everyone admitted that NATO's \nmilitary actions have not been ``robust,'' because of the U.N. \nstraitjacket. I was told however, that the decision had been made \nseveral years ago to go this route and so NATO was stuck with this \ndecision. It seems to me that the worst excuse for sticking with any \npolicy, is to say, well that is the way we've been doing it, so we must \ncontinue to do it this way.\n\n  President Clinton assumed office with a ``lift and strike'' policy. \nIn the spring of 1993, the White House held serious consultations with \nthe congressional leadership on this matter and I told the President I \nwould support him--it was the right thing to do. But, in May 1993, the \nadministration decided to abandon its push for ``lift and strike'' and \ngo along with the European approach of creating and protecting safe \nhavens in Bosnia and pursuing a ``negotiated settlement.'' At the U.N. \nSecurity Council request and pursuant to U.N. Security Council \nresolutions, NATO agreed to protect all six safe havens in Bosnia \nthrough this use of air power. But while U.N. Security Council members \nmake these bold decisions on paper, U.N. commanders block their \nimplementation.\n  As events in Bihac demonstrate, these U.N. resolutions and NATO \nauthorities are meaningless. And whether intentionally or not, the \nfailure of U.N. protection forces in Bosnia to permit militarily \neffective air strikes, against Serbian military targets--as decided \nupon by NATO in April of this year--is helping the Serb aggressors. The \nsituation all over Bosnia is deteriorating--food convoys are not \ngetting through; the U.N. airlift has been suspended; missile attacks \non Sarajevo are escalating; more peacekeepers have been kidnapped; and \nthe war in Bosnia has widened to include Serb forces from the Serb-\noccupied area of Croatia known as Krajina. Why is this happening? Is it \nbecause NATO put a few holes in a runway last week?\n  In my view the situation in Bosnia is deteriorating because United \nNations and NATO's passivity amount to a green light to the Serbs. Far \nfrom adding to the protection of U.N. peacekeepers, inaction in the \nface of Serbian defiance has made the U.N. peacekeepers more \nvulnerable.\n  As I told Prime Minister Major, I understand and appreciate the \nconcerns of the British and others who have peacekeepers on the ground. \nI respect the soldiers who are making sacrifices and taking real risks \non the ground in Bosnia. But, let's face it. The U.N. protection forces \nare unable to protect themselves, and they are even less able to \nprotect the Bosnians. So, the idea that the United States should send \npeacekeepers to Bosnia, in the same helpless position and unable to \neffectively carry out their mandate, in order to have a say in Bosnia \npolicy is ridiculous. We have done our share in the former Yugoslavia, \njust as we have done our share elsewhere around the globe. This \nargument distracts from the real issue--which is whether or not this \npolicy has been a success.\n  The European approach was designed to do two things: protect Bosnian \ncivilians and bring about a negotiated settlement. We know that it has \nnot achieved the first objective, and despite the Bosnian Government's \nsignature on the Vance/Owen plan and the Contact Group plan last July, \nthere is no peace. There are only two ways to achieve a settlement: by \npressuring the Serbs, or by making further concessions to them. \nUnfortunately, the international community, and this administration, \nhave only been prepared to do the latter.\n  Apparently half of Bosnia is not enough for the Serbs to sign up to \nthe Contact Group plan. But, it is not only land the Bosnian Serbs \nwants--they want to join Serbia in a ``Greater Serbia.'' And, the \nFrench have a proposal that may make this a reality. The French want to \nallow the Bosnian Serbs to confederate with Serbia--after all, they \nsay, the Bosnians and the Croats have that option now through the \nagreements signed in Washington last spring. The French say this \nproposal provides for ``equality of rights''--equality of rights for \nthe aggressors. What about equality of rights for the more than 2 \nmillion people who have lost their homes? What about equality of rights \nfor those who were tortured and maimed in concentration camps?\n  Mr. President, this policy has failed not only the moral test, but \nhas failed by its own standards. British officials say that the war has \nbeen ``contained.'' Serbs from the U.N. protected areas in Croatia are \nnow involved. Furthermore, I don't understand how we contain Serbian \naggression by legitimizing the results. If Bosnia, as a member state of \nthe United Nations, is denied its basic rights--such as the right to \nself-defense--how does this deter Serbian repression of the 2 million \nAlbanians in Kosova who do not have the rights accorded to a state? In \nmy view, it doesn't. It gives another green light.\n  During my meeting in London with Lady Thatcher I discussed NATO and \nU.N. policy toward Bosnia. Lady Thatcher agrees with me not only in \npronouncing the president policy a miserable failure, but in the \noutlines for a new policy. It is time to return to President Clinton's \noriginal idea of ``lift and strike'' although it will probably have to \nbe ``strike and lift.''\n  The Bosnians have the inherent right to self defense--which is \nrecognized in article 51 of the U.N. Charter. The U.N. arms embargo was \nimposed on the former Yugoslavia and extending it to Bosnia is not only \nunjust, but illegal. One way to avoid the issue of illegality of \ndenying Bosnia the ability to defend itself in the face of aggression, \nis to redefine the Bosnian War as a ``civil war''--which the Europeans \nhave done and the Clinton administration has joined in doing. If the \nwar in Bosnia is a civil war, why are Secretary Christopher and the \nBritish and French Foreign Ministers considering traveling to Belgrade \nthis weekend to offer Serbian President Milosevic more concessions? If \nthis is a civil war, why were sanctions imposed on Serbia? By \nredefining this war, the United States, its allies, and the United \nNations, hope to limit their responsibility for the course of the war \nthese past 3 years.\n  Lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia is legally and morally right. The \npractical difficulties of doing so are not to be minimized--the risks \nare there; they were outlined to me by Prime Minister Major quite \neloquently. But, Bosnia is bleeding right now, despite the presence of \nthousands of peacekeepers. And, in the absence of NATO and U.N. \nresolve, the only alternative to the Bosnians continuing their struggle \nis a disguised surrender. Maybe the Bosnian Government will agree to a \nGreater Serbia. I don't know. They have had few options as they sit at \nthe negotiating table with a Serb gun to their head and international \nmediators pressing for a signature at their side.\n  However, if the Bosnians do not agree to sign up to a greater Serbia, \nif they want to continue their struggle for survival, those of us in \nthe United States Senate who have supported their efforts, such as \nmyself and Senator Lieberman will be back in January to work to lift \nthe arms embargo. I will ask the Foreign Relations Committee, the Armed \nServices Committee, and the Intelligence Committee to hold hearings on \nall aspects of U.S. policy towards Bosnia and on options for lifting \nthe arms embargo.\n  I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues, a most \ncompelling editorial by Morton Abramowitz, the president of the \nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace, who writes in today's \nWashington Post about the risks of writing Bosnia off. And I quote, \n``Wouldn't assisted suicide be best for everybody, Bosnia most of all? \nWe're practically there already. . . .''\n  He continues, ``Should Bosnia disappear from the map or be left a \nmisshapen shadow of itself, its dismembered ghost would haunt the \nregion . . . for years to come.'' What then would be the fate of \nmultiethnic Macedonia? . . . of Belgrade-oppressed Kosova, with its 95-\npercent Albanian population? . . . The more we try to put the partition \nof Bosnia behind us the larger it looms ahead.\n  ``Some prefer to think of Bosnia as a terminal case. But Bosnia is \nfighting for its life. It is we, in the west, who are inert and \ninsensible. Whose life is it anyway.'' I ask unanimous consent that the \nentire article be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 1, 1994]\n\n                          Bosnia: Last Chance\n\n                         (By Morton Abramowitz)\n\n       Do we really want to wake up someday and read this obituary \n     in the morning paper? ``Poor Bosnia--we didn't know her well. \n     Once a multiethnic state in the Balkans, now gone--\n     partitioned, annexed, absorbed, confederated--a casualty of \n     post-Cold War ethnic conflict. . . .

In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the \n     Save NATO Fund.''\n       If we and our allies are too quick to write Bosnia off, we \n     may end up burying other things besides.\n       For more than two years, an increasingly divided West has \n     watched Bosnia bleed. Frustration has mounted because the \n     victim hasn't done us the courtesy of going fast or gently, \n     and we have grown weary of our vigil. No one shows any will \n     to save Bosnia, and no one will help Bosnia try to save \n     itself.\n       Lacking a consensus on anything from lifting or not lifting \n     the arms embargo to delivering punishing air strikes or \n     pinpricks, the West has been left with a non-strategy of wait \n     and see and hope that something will turn up. Something \n     always has: Sarajevo market bombings, Gorazde, Bihac. Always \n     more refugees. Yesterday's papers even featured pictures of \n     Serbs forcing Muslims to wear the fez, like Jews forced by \n     the Nazis to wear the Star of David.\n       The only thing worse than no consensus is a bad consensus. \n     And this week, a consensus worthy of Dr. Kevorkian has begun \n     to form. Whether it is being reached with agonized \n     reluctance, as in the U.S. case, or harsh realism, as in the \n     British and French, matters little. The effect on Bosnia \n     would be the same: pulling the plug.\n       Wouldn't assisted suicide be best for everybody, Bosnia \n     most of all? We're practically there already. A big ``no \n     aggressive measures'' sign long has hung on Bosnia's door, \n     despite all the reassurances to the patient that we will use \n     ``all necessary means.'' Last summer, the five-nation contact \n     group persuaded Bosnia to sign the consent form for an ethnic \n     split of territory one step shy of partition: ``So you lose a \n     limb or two--or three--dismemberment's better than death. \n     Besides, we'll make the Serbs agree--or else.''\n       Of course, the ``else'' never occurred. Instead, we relied \n     on Serbian President Milosevic turning against his arch \n     rival, the Bosnian Serb leader Karadzic. But Karadzic was \n     unimpressed by Milosevic's hollow sticks and ours. So now, \n     we're trying to entice him with juicy carrots.\n       Meanwhile, Bosnia has the temerity to keep fighting for its \n     own existence. Only a month ago, the media marveled at the \n     success that the Bosnian army was having in the Bihac pocket, \n     regaining home ground lost to Serbian ethnic cleansing. Now, \n     as resurgent Bosnian Serb and Croatian Serb forces converge \n     on the Bihac ``safe area,'' cleansing and burning as they go, \n     the Bosnian army is castigated for having had the nerve to \n     try to take back its own territory.\n       The Bihac ``safe zone,'' swelled with refugees from both \n     the prior and current Serb campaigns, reportedly is being hit \n     at a rate of six shells a minute. The unchecked Serb attack \n     on Bihac is also destroying the Bosnian-Croat Federation. \n     Though the West thus far has prevented Zabreb from re-\n     entering the war, Croatia now sees that only force, and not \n     the West's intercession, will get back the Krajina.\n       There is still time--very little--for the West and the \n     international community to act, not only to preserve Bosnia \n     but also to restore some respect for international \n     institutions, for principles and for something called the \n     Western alliance. That will not come from pressuring Bosnia \n     to surrender--it won't--or agreeing to a Greater Serbia. We \n     and our allies should:\n       Recognize that UNPROFOR--now more than ever clearly a \n     hostage--has become more of a hindrance than a help. Withdraw \n     it.\n       Since UNPROFOR's withdrawal inevitably giving up the \n     enclaves, evacuate their civilian inhabitants to other, less-\n     exposed areas.\n       Put the Bosnian Serbs on notice that any interference with \n     the U.N. and civilian withdrawals will be met with massive \n     NATO air attacks.\n       Focus on consolidating the Bosnian government and its \n     position in central Bosnia.\n       Once UNPROFOR is gone, open up the arms spigot to Bosnia.\n       Tell the Bosnian Serbs that if they continue to attack \n     civilian populations, prevent the delivery of humanitarian \n     supplies or fail to engage in any serious negotiations, we \n     will use air power against arms dumps, oil depots and \n     military targets throughout the territory they occupy.\n       This is not a great proposal. It has uncertainties and \n     difficulties, particularly with relief supplies. None of the \n     above can work unless we and our NATO allies are prepared to \n     use robust, sustained air power, and even if we are, the \n     desired results are not guaranteed. The Bosnian government \n     may balk at some of it. Civilian populations would have to be \n     moved--safely--en masse. NATO must be persuaded. But it is \n     better in the long term than Western capitulation to Serb \n     aggression.\n       Critics will argue that doing the above will only prolong \n     the misery and expand the war. They have said that for three \n     years while Bosnia has hemorrhaged. They have constantly \n     proposed straw-man military options for the infusion of large \n     numbers of ground troops that are not options but excuses for \n     inaction. They do not explain how a Bosnia-less Balkans, or \n     its equivalent, can produce a stable peace.\n       Should Bosnia disappear from the map or be left a misshapen \n     shadow of itself, its dismembered ghost would haunt the \n     region and cause the West even bigger headaches--for years to \n     come. What then would be the fate of multiethnic Macedonia? \n     Of the volatile Krajina? Of Belgrade-oppressed Kosovo, with \n     its 95 percent Albanian population? If the Serbs get their \n     Greater Serbia, wouldn't the Albanians of Kosovo be entitled \n     to a Greater Albania? The more we try to put the partition of \n     Bosnia behind us, the larger it looms ahead.\n       Some prefer to think of Bosnia as a terminal case. But \n     Bosnia is fighting for its life. It is we in the West who are \n     inert and insensible. Whose life is it anyway?\n\n  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, finally, Mr. President, I would like to call \nattention to a letter I received from Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of \nPakistan who supports our efforts to lift the arms embargo. Pakistan is \none of many countries who would be willing and able to assist Bosnia if \nthe arms embargo were lifted. The United States would not be alone. \nRecently, 96 countries in the U.N. General Assembly voiced their \nsupport for lifting the arms embargo. I ask unanimous consent that the \nPrime Minister's letter to me be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Prime Minister,\n\n                                      Pakistan, November 29, 1994.\n     Senator Robert Dole,\n     Embassy of the United States,\n     London.\n       My Dear Senator Dole: I had hoped we would be able to meet \n     during your visit to London and I would be able to offer \n     personally my felicitations on the remarkable victory \n     achieved by the Republican Party in the recent elections and \n     your own elevation in the new Congress to the position of \n     Senate majority leader. Unfortunately it appears that our \n     schedules make this difficult and I must therefore be content \n     with congratulating you through this note.\n       I recall with great pleasure our meeting during my visit to \n     the United States in 1989 and the clear manifestation of your \n     views on America's foreign policy and what it objectives \n     should be. Under your guidance the Senate will now move \n     purposefully to mould and promote these objectives. A matter \n     of immediate concern in Bosnia. Like you I have been deeply \n     concerned about the situation in Bihac. The United States, \n     Pakistan and other like-minded countries must work together \n     to ensure that Serbian aggression is not rewarded and the \n     dismemberment of a member state of the United Nations is not \n     tolerated. The consequences of temerity, particularly the \n     repercussions in other parts of the world, are too horrible \n     to contemplate and must weigh heavily with all of us.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                   Benazir Bhutto.\n\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[Congressional Record: December 1, 1994]From the Congressional Record Online via GPO Access [wais.access.gpo.gov]\n\n \n                                 BOSNIA\n\n\tMr. DOLE. Mr. President, This morning I returned from a trip to NATO headquarters and London. While in Brussels, I met with the NATO Secretary General Willy Claes, our Supreme Allied Commander George Joulwan, the 16 Permanent Representatives to NATO, including our U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Robert Hunter, representatives of the countries participating in the Partnership For Peace, and the Russian Ambassador to NATO.\n\tI went to Brussels because I am a strong supporter of NATO--I have been since the very beginning of the alliance. And, as a staunch supporter of NATO I have been extremely concerned about the impact of the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina on the future of NATO. As I told those I met with in Brussels, I would like to see NATO expand in the near future--As NTO decided to do today. And I believe that there is an important role, for NATO in defending against potential instability in Europe and the former Soviet Union in the future. However, realistically it will be difficult to make progress on these matters until we deal with Bosnia.\n\tI carried the same message to London where I met with former Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, Defense Minister Rifkind, and Prime Minister Major. Moreover, I emphasized that as I see it, close ties between our Government and that of the United Kingdom are as essential to NATO's success in the future, as they have been in the past. Our differences over Bosnia should not and will not change that fact.\n\tHowever, as I see it, NATO's failure to respond adequately to the war in Bosnia has undermined its credibility and raised serious questions about NATO's continued relevance. It is not that NATO is unable, to act decisively, it is that NATO has an unwilling partner--namely, the United Nations who can veto air strikes and limit NATO targets. Last April, NATO decided ``* * * if any Bosnian Serb attacks involving heavy weapons are carried out on any U.N.-designated safe areas * * * these weapons and other Bosnian Serb military assets * * * will be subject to NATO air strikes.'' That's pretty clear. And it's pretty clear that nothing has happened. The bottom line is that because of the so-called dual key arrangement, NATO does not have control over its military operations in Bosnia--the U.N. protection forces do. In my view this U.N. veto over NATO actions sets a dangerous precedent. I recognize the need for coordination, but not for subordination.\n\tMr. President, I raised these concerns in my meetings at NATO. No one disputed the facts as I presented them. Everyone admitted that NATO's military actions have not been ``robust,'' because of the U.N. straitjacket. I was told however, that the decision had been made several years ago to go this route and so NATO was stuck with this decision. It seems to me that the worst excuse for sticking with any policy, is to say, well that is the way we've been doing it, so we must continue to do it this way.\n\n\tPresident Clinton assumed office with a ``lift and strike'' policy. In the spring of 1993, the White House held serious consultations with the congressional leadership on this matter and I told the President I would support him--it was the right thing to do. But, in May 1993, the administration decided to abandon its push for ``lift and strike'' and go along with the European approach of creating and protecting safe havens in Bosnia and pursuing a ``negotiated settlement.'' At the U.N. Security Council request and pursuant to U.N. Security Council resolutions, NATO agreed to protect all six safe havens in Bosnia through this use of air power. But while U.N. Security Council members make these bold decisions on paper, U.N. commanders block their implementation.\n\tAs events in Bihac demonstrate, these U.N. resolutions and NATO authorities are meaningless. And whether intentionally or not, the failure of U.N. protection forces in Bosnia to permit militarily effective air strikes, against Serbian military targets--as decided upon by NATO in April of this year--is helping the Serb aggressors. The situation all over Bosnia is deteriorating--food convoys are not getting through; the U.N. airlift has been suspended; missile attacks on Sarajevo are escalating; more peacekeepers have been kidnapped; and the war in Bosnia has widened to include Serb forces from the Serb-occupied area of Croatia known as Krajina. Why is this happening? Is it because NATO put a few holes in a runway last week?\n\tIn my view the situation in Bosnia is deteriorating because United Nations and NATO's passivity amount to a green light to the Serbs. Far from adding to the protection of U.N. peacekeepers, inaction in the face of Serbian defiance has made the U.N. peacekeepers more vulnerable.\n\tAs I told Prime Minister Major, I understand and appreciate the concerns of the British and others who have peacekeepers on the ground. I respect the soldiers who are making sacrifices and taking real risks on the ground in Bosnia. But, let's face it. The U.N. protection forces are unable to protect themselves, and they are even less able to protect the Bosnians. So, the idea that the United States should send peacekeepers to Bosnia, in the same helpless position and unable to effectively carry out their mandate, in order to have a say in Bosnia policy is ridiculous. We have done our share in the former Yugoslavia, just as we have done our share elsewhere around the globe. This argument distracts from the real issue--which is whether or not this policy has been a success.\n\tThe European approach was designed to do two things: protect Bosnian civilians and bring about a negotiated settlement. We know that it has not achieved the first objective, and despite the Bosnian Government's signature on the Vance/Owen plan and the Contact Group plan last July, there is no peace. There are only two ways to achieve a settlement: by pressuring the Serbs, or by making further concessions to them. Unfortunately, the international community, and this administration, have only been prepared to do the latter.\n\tApparently half of Bosnia is not enough for the Serbs to sign up to the Contact Group plan. But, it is not only land the Bosnian Serbs wants--they want to join Serbia in a ``Greater Serbia.'' And, the French have a proposal that may make this a reality. The French want to allow the Bosnian Serbs to confederate with Serbia--after all, they say, the Bosnians and the Croats have that option now through the agreements signed in Washington last spring. The French say this proposal provides for ``equality of rights''--equality of rights for the aggressors. What about equality of rights for the more than 2 million people who have lost their homes? What about equality of rights for those who were tortured and maimed in concentration camps?\n\tMr. President, this policy has failed not only the moral test, but has failed by its own standards. British officials say that the war has been ``contained.'' Serbs from the U.N. protected areas in Croatia are now involved. Furthermore, I don't understand how we contain Serbian aggression by legitimizing the results. If Bosnia, as a member state of the United Nations, is denied its basic rights--such as the right to self-defense--how does this deter Serbian repression of the 2 million Albanians in Kosova who do not have the rights accorded to a state? In my view, it doesn't. It gives another green light.\n\tDuring my meeting in London with Lady Thatcher I discussed NATO and U.N. policy toward Bosnia. Lady Thatcher agrees with me not only in pronouncing the president policy a miserable failure, but in the outlines for a new policy. It is time to return to President Clinton's original idea of ``lift and strike'' although it will probably have to be ``strike and lift.''\n\tThe Bosnians have the inherent right to self defense--which is recognized in article 51 of the U.N. Charter. The U.N. arms embargo was imposed on the former Yugoslavia and extending it to Bosnia is not only unjust, but illegal. One way to avoid the issue of illegality of denying Bosnia the ability to defend itself in the face of aggression, is to redefine the Bosnian War as a ``civil war''--which the Europeans have done and the Clinton administration has joined in doing. If the war in Bosnia is a civil war, why are Secretary Christopher and the British and French Foreign Ministers considering traveling to Belgrade this weekend to offer Serbian President Milosevic more concessions? If this is a civil war, why were sanctions imposed on Serbia? By redefining this war, the United States, its allies, and the United Nations, hope to limit their responsibility for the course of the war these past 3 years.\n\tLifting the arms embargo on Bosnia is legally and morally right. The practical difficulties of doing so are not to be minimized--the risks are there; they were outlined to me by Prime Minister Major quite eloquently. But, Bosnia is bleeding right now, despite the presence of thousands of peacekeepers. And, in the absence of NATO and U.N. resolve, the only alternative to the Bosnians continuing their struggle is a disguised surrender. Maybe the Bosnian Government will agree to a Greater Serbia. I don't know. They have had few options as they sit at the negotiating table with a Serb gun to their head and international mediators pressing for a signature at their side.\n\tHowever, if the Bosnians do not agree to sign up to a greater Serbia, if they want to continue their struggle for survival, those of us in the United States Senate who have supported their efforts, such as myself and Senator Lieberman will be back in January to work to lift the arms embargo.

Withdraw \n     it.\n       Since UNPROFOR's withdrawal inevitably giving up the \n     enclaves, evacuate their civilian inhabitants to other, less-\n     exposed areas.\n       Put the Bosnian Serbs on notice that any interference with \n     the U.N. and civilian withdrawals will be met with massive \n     NATO air attacks.\n       Focus on consolidating the Bosnian government and its \n     position in central Bosnia.\n       Once UNPROFOR is gone, open up the arms spigot to Bosnia.\n       Tell the Bosnian Serbs that if they continue to attack \n     civilian populations, prevent the delivery of humanitarian \n     supplies or fail to engage in any serious negotiations, we \n     will use air power against arms dumps, oil depots and \n     military targets throughout the territory they occupy.\n       This is not a great proposal. It has uncertainties and \n     difficulties, particularly with relief supplies. None of the \n     above can work unless we and our NATO allies are prepared to \n     use robust, sustained air power, and even if we are, the \n     desired results are not guaranteed. The Bosnian government \n     may balk at some of it. Civilian populations would have to be \n     moved--safely--en masse. NATO must be persuaded. But it is \n     better in the long term than Western capitulation to Serb \n     aggression.\n       Critics will argue that doing the above will only prolong \n     the misery and expand the war. They have said that for three \n     years while Bosnia has hemorrhaged. They have constantly \n     proposed straw-man military options for the infusion of large \n     numbers of ground troops that are not options but excuses for \n     inaction. They do not explain how a Bosnia-less Balkans, or \n     its equivalent, can produce a stable peace.\n       Should Bosnia disappear from the map or be left a misshapen \n     shadow of itself, its dismembered ghost would haunt the \n     region and cause the West even bigger headaches--for years to \n     come. What then would be the fate of multiethnic Macedonia? \n     Of the volatile Krajina? Of Belgrade-oppressed Kosovo, with \n     its 95 percent Albanian population? If the Serbs get their \n     Greater Serbia, wouldn't the Albanians of Kosovo be entitled \n     to a Greater Albania? The more we try to put the partition of \n     Bosnia behind us, the larger it looms ahead.\n       Some prefer to think of Bosnia as a terminal case. But \n     Bosnia is fighting for its life. It is we in the West who are \n     inert and insensible. Whose life is it anyway?\n\n\tMr. DOLE. Mr. President, finally, Mr. President, I would like to call attention to a letter I received from Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan who supports our efforts to lift the arms embargo. Pakistan is one of many countries who would be willing and able to assist Bosnia if the arms embargo were lifted. The United States would not be alone. Recently, 96 countries in the U.N. General Assembly voiced their support for lifting the arms embargo. I ask unanimous consent that the Prime Minister's letter to me be included in the Record.\n\tThere being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Prime Minister,\n\n                                      Pakistan, November 29, 1994.\n     Senator Robert Dole,\n     Embassy of the United States,\n     London.\n       My Dear Senator Dole: I had hoped we would be able to meet \n     during your visit to London and I would be able to offer \n     personally my felicitations on the remarkable victory \n     achieved by the Republican Party in the recent elections and \n     your own elevation in the new Congress to the position of \n     Senate majority leader. Unfortunately it appears that our \n     schedules make this difficult and I must therefore be content \n     with congratulating you through this note.\n       I recall with great pleasure our meeting during my visit to \n     the United States in 1989 and the clear manifestation of your \n     views on America's foreign policy and what it objectives \n     should be. Under your guidance the Senate will now move \n     purposefully to mould and promote these objectives. A matter \n     of immediate concern in Bosnia. Like you I have been deeply \n     concerned about the situation in Bihac. The United States, \n     Pakistan and other like-minded countries must work together \n     to ensure that Serbian aggression is not rewarded and the \n     dismemberment of a member state of the United Nations is not \n     tolerated. The consequences of temerity, particularly the \n     repercussions in other parts of the world, are too horrible \n     to contemplate and must weigh heavily with all of us.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                   Benazir Bhutto.\n\n\tMr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Robert J. Dole", "George J.
