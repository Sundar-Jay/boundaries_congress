Mr. Speaker, I wish to address a concern that was raised \nat the last minute that this bill may somehow affect protection for \nwetlands. Under the current pipeline safety laws, in section 60109 of \ntitle 49, the Office of Pipeline Safety at the Department of \nTransportation is required to identify unusually sensitive \nenvironmental areas. Once these areas have been identified, DOT is to \npromulgate rules to minimize the chances of a liquid pipeline accident \nin those areas. DOT is currently in the process of implementing these \nlaws.\n  Currently, subsection (b) of section 60109 does not specify which \nareas should be identified as unusually environmentally sensitive; \nrather, it identifies several types of areas that DOT should consider \nwhen making its determination. In fact, current law does not even \nidentify wetlands as one of the areas DOT should look at when \nidentifying areas that should be classified as unusually \nenvironmentally sensitive. That is why the Congress in S. 1505 directed \nDOT to include critical wetlands in the types of areas that it should \nconsider when it determines areas that are unusually environmentally \nsensitive.\n  Apparently, at the last minute, the use of the term ``critical'' has \nraised a question as to whether the Congress is somehow attempting to \ncreate a new category of wetlands that might undermine other wetlands \nprotection programs carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency \nor the Corps of Engineers. This is not true.\n  The language in S. 1505 that amends section 60109(b) of title 49 is \nsimply intended to give direction to DOT as to what type of areas \nshould be considered when it determines what areas are unusually \nenvironmentally sensitive. In no way is this provision intended to have \nany application or precedent with respect to any other statute or any \nother Federal agency. This provision is not intended to diminish the \nrole of DOT to protect the environment and the public's safety in and \naround pipelines. Rather, this language is intended to strengthen the \npipeline safety program's protection of people and the environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ACCOUNTABLE PIPELINE SAFETY AND PARTNERSHIP ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               speech of\n\n                            HON.

He \nhas been an impressive figure of California's central coast and a \nstrong leader in his home town of Monterey. It is with sadness that I \nannounce that Sam Karas will soon be retiring from the Monterey County \nBoard of Supervisors.\n  Sam's long tradition of public service began in 1943 when he moved to \nMonterey as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. It was at this time \nthat he also married the lovely Edith James. The Karas' have been \nblessed with three daughters, all of whom graduated from the Monterey \nPeninsula Unified School District, and four granddaughters.\n  When not doting on his family, Sam Karas has long been involved in \ncommunity service. Employed in the wholesale meat industry for 35 \nyears, Sam always found time to involve himself in a variety of \nactivities and humanitarian causes, donating his time and talent as a \nfund raiser. He was one of the original board members of the Human \nRights Commission, which led the fight against California's proposition \n14, a discriminatory housing initiative. He has received awards for the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the League \nof United Latin American Citizens and the Japanese American Citizens \nLeague for his outstanding work. Sam also served as an organizer and \nboard member of the Monterey Peninsula Visitor and Convention Bureau.\n  Additionally, Sam Karas served as board member for the Monterey \nPeninsula Visitor and Convention Bureau, and on the board of trustees \nof the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District from 1973 to 1980. \nDuring this time his contributions included fighting for a Magnet \nSchool Program and advocating for the integration of students, staff, \nand teachers. In 1984, Sam was elected to the Monterey County Board of \nSupervisors and has served Monterey County in that capacity ever since. \nHe was elected chair of the board of supervisors in 1986 and again in \n1991. In his role as county supervisor, I have had the honor of \ncochairing the Big Sur Multi-Agency Advisory Council with him where he \nalways provides a fresh outlook and a candid perspective.\n  Among Sam's many accomplishments is the work he has done on behalf of \nthe farm worker community and in support of decent and affordable \nhousing in Monterey County. In addition to this, Sam Karas created the \nCarmel River Task Force which successfully rebuilt community bridges \nand neighborhoods after two devastating floods in the winter of 1995. \nSam also helped to protect the environment by coauthoring a countywide \nballot measure to prevent offshore oil and gas development in the \nMonterey Bay--now part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.\n  Sam's contributions to the area have stretched far beyond the average \ncapacity, adding to the artistic richness of the community as well. He \nhas appeared in many local theater productions, including being asked \nby his friend Clint Eastwood to play a role in the Academy Award \nwinning film ``Unforgiven.'' Sam helped to organize the famous Monterey \nPop Festival, served as an original member of the board of directors of \nthe Monterey Jazz Festival, and is currently on the board of directors \nof the Monterey Bay Blues Festival. He has received many honors \nrecognizing his extensive talents.\n  Sam's devotion to community service is exemplary. It has been an \nhonor and a pleasure to work with him for the benefit of Monterey \nCounty. Sam has offered us concern, compassion, realism, and a spunk \nthat we will miss greatly. I know and I am speaking for all residents \nof Monterey County when I say that we will be sad to see Sam Karas \nretire from the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, but wish him all \nthe very best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "[[Page E1922]]\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SAM KARAS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             HON.

It has been an honor and a pleasure to work with him for the benefit of Monterey County. Sam has offered us concern, compassion, realism, and a spunk that we will miss greatly. I know and I am speaking for all residents of Monterey County when I say that we will be sad to see Sam Karas retire from the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, but wish him all the very best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Sam Farr"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "142 Cong.

A few years later, when I ran for the House of Representatives, he \nwas elected to that assembly seat where he has served with distinction \never since.\n  Due to term limits in the California Assembly, Tom is retiring at the \nend of this year. But for many years, he has worked as a quiet, \neffective assemblyman, playing a central role in the most important \nissues confronting California, chief among them budget, education \nreform, agriculture, and transportation.\n  Tom Hannigan has been instrumental in easing the commuter crunch \naround Sacramento's transportation arteries, such as the Interstate 80 \ncorridor. He has pushed for increased passenger train service between \nthe State capital and the Bay Area.\n  Tom has also played a major role regarding California's largest \nindustry--agriculture. He is the author of legislation strengthening \nthe Williamson Act farm preservation law. His legislation also created \nthe California Center for Cooperatives at UC-Davis, providing research \nand support for agricultural co-ops and other rural development \ninitiatives.\n  Tom has deep roots in Solano County. He was first elected to the \nCalifornia Assembly in 1978 after years of active service at the local \nlevel--as a successful businessman, as mayor of Fairfield, and as \nchairman of the Solano County Board of Supervisors. In the assembly, \namong other positions, he served as Democratic Majority Leader.\n  He is a native Californian, born in Vallejo, and he stayed loyal to \nhis State by attending college at Santa Clara University, receiving his \ndegree in business administration. After college, Tom served his \ncountry as a U.S. Marine Corps officer and saw service in Vietnam.\n  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Tom was a successful \nassemblyman only because Fairfield is close enough to Sacramento for \nhim to get home to his family every night. His commitment to his family \nalways ranked first on his priority list. Term limits may be forcing \nhis retirement from the assembly, but perhaps not that much sooner than \nthe strong call of grandchildren would have required.\n  Tom's retirement from the California Assembly is a real loss, not \nonly for his constituents, but for the assembly and for California \nitself. He retires with a record of achievement for his district and \nhis State. I wish him continued success, and I extend my \ncongratulations to him, his wife Jan, and their children and \ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "TRIBUTE TO ASSEMBLYMAN THOMAS M.

Given the process that unfolded, Members and others may find \nhelpful a few remarks to clarify the bill's legislative history.\n  H.R. 4283 is the text of H.R. 3217--as passed the House on September \n24, 1996--with four additional provisions requested by Senators from \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee and the Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation Committee. These amendments modify the bill's safety \nexclusion and restriction on ballast water discharges into harbors, \nauthorize research funding in Narragansett Bay, require a study of \nshoreside ballast water facilities, and clarify authority to fund \nregional research. The House passed H.R. 4283 on September 28, 1996.\n  This broadly supported, bipartisan legislation--introduced and \nchampioned by Representative Steve LaTourette--builds upon the 1990 Act \nthat addressed zebra mussels and other invasive species in the Great \nLakes.\n  H.R. 4283 is national in scope, extending a voluntary, incentive-\nbased approach to all coasts and regions at risk.\n  Whether you call them invasive, exotic, or nonindigenous, these \nspecies of plants, animals, and invertebrates can wreak havoc on \ninfrastructure, commerce, recreation and tourism, and the environment.\n  H.R. 4283 coordinates agencies, research institutions, and others to \nprevent and control the introduction and spread of invasive species--\nprimarily through voluntary ballast water exchange and management, \neducation, and research.\n  The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's report on H.R. 3217 \n(Rept. 104-815) provides a detailed description of the bill and our \ncommittee's intent.\n  For a description of the changes made to the reported bill, I would \nrefer my colleagues to the floor debate on H.R. 3217 on September 24, \n1996.\n  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not thank some of the Members and \ncommittees instrumental in moving this important legislation.\n  More than anyone else, Representative Steve LaTourette is responsible \nfor this bill and its movement through the House. He has worked with \nall interests to build broadly supported legislation. He has also \nworked closely with his colleague from Ohio and in the other body, \nSenator Glenn, who worked on the 1990 law and S. 1660, the Senate \nversion of the National Invasive Species Act of 1996.\n  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members should also be \ncongratulated for their efforts, particularly the ranking Democrat of \nthe committee, Jim Oberstar, the chairman and ranking Democrat of the \nWater Resources and Environment Subcommittee, Sherry Boehlert and \nRobert Borski, and the chairman and ranking Democrat of the Coast Guard \nand Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, Howard Coble and Bob Clement.\n  Other committees have been helpful as well--particularly the \nCommittees on Resources, Science, House Oversight, International \nRelations, National Security and Agriculture.\n  Senate colleagues, including the chairmen and members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, should also be commended.

Argentina acted in direct violation of its \nobligations under the GATT and WTO--where it had committed to \nmaintaining tariffs on footwear and apparel at no more than 35 percent. \nEven this level was quite high. In the U.S., import tariffs on footwear \nare in the 8 to 10 percent range. However, Argentina suddenly imposed \nfootwear duties up to 150 percent, violating their agreements under the \nGATT and WTO.

And proud \nwe are, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me briefly mention some of the major \naccomplishments. Welfare as we have known it is no longer a guarantee \nof assistance, workers who change jobs will be assured of continued \nhealth coverage, mothers will no longer be forced out of hospitals \nafter they bring new life into this world as they were in the past, we \nhave relieved small businesses of excessive tax burdens while \nincreasing the minimum wage to enable millions of American workers to \nbring home more pay. Mr. Speaker, this Congress promised to get tough \non crime and we did just that. For example, crimes committed against \nour elderly and children are no longer tolerated; environmental \nprotection acts like the Safe Drinking Water Act, along with \nlegislation to overhaul pesticide regulations. I could go on and on, \nMr. Speaker.\n  The 104th Congress has done such a great job, 7 items of our Contract \nof America have been signed into law by President Clinton. And this is \nnothing new, Mr. Speaker. The President has been campaigning on our \nissues and beliefs all year now. You see, Mr. Speaker, President \nClinton figures if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.\n  At this time I commend to you an article that appeared in the Albany \nTimes-Union about the achievements of this Congress.\n\n                       104th Congress Is History\n\n                         (By Elaine S. Povich)\n\n       Washington.--The Senate approved an important aviation \n     safety and spending bill Thursday, breaking a Democratic-led \n     filibuster over a labor issue, and wrapped up business of the \n     watershed 104th Congress for the fall campaigns.\n       The Congress, the first in 40 years to be controlled by \n     Republicans, ended as it began: with partisan wrangling. The \n     immediate battle was over a Federal Aviation Administration \n     bill that Democrats, led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., \n     said contained a special provision making it more difficult \n     for Federal Express employees to unionize. After the \n     filibuster was broken with a 66-31 vote (six more than the \n     number needed), the bill passed easily, 92-2.\n       ``This is special-interest legislation that never would \n     have been passed by a Democratic House and a Democratic \n     Senate,'' Kennedy maintained. ``We look forward today to the \n     next vote for working families, which is Nov. 5 (Election \n     Day).''\n       But the provision for Federal Express, which would require \n     its employees to organize nationally rather than locally, was \n     supported both by Democrats and Republicans. Sen. Ernest \n     Hollings, D-S.C., the provision's main champion, said Kennedy \n     was trying to give the bill the ``bum's rush.''\n       The urgency of many senators to get home to campaign, along \n     with the fact that the bill contained millions for airport \n     construction projects, contributed to the lopsided vote.\n       The White House had notified the senators that President \n     Clinton opposed the Federal Express provision. Thursday, \n     however, aides indicated that Clinton would sign the bill, \n     which the House approved last week.\n       ``Because of this legislation, criminal-background checks \n     can now be conducted on airport personnel, new explosives-\n     detection technology can be deployed, baggage will be checked \n     in more thoroughly, passenger profiling will be instituted, \n     and the families who lose a loved one in an accident will be \n     able to get the help they need.'' Clinton said in a \n     statement.\n       The bill includes several anti-terrorism provisions for \n     airports, including stepped-up security. Some of the \n     requirements include background checks on airport-security \n     personnel and provisions aimed at dealing more humanely with \n     families of air-crash victims.\n       The bill also streamlines the FAA, beefing up the \n     regulatory aspects of the agency and phasing out the air-\n     travel promotional functions.\n       Also on the Senate's last-minute agenda was a major federal \n     parks bill that passed on a voice vote after days of \n     wrangling over boundary lines in 100 individual federal \n     parks.\n       Legislation to increase penalties for misuse of the so-\n     called ``date-rape drug'' cleared the Senate and was \n     virtually certain to win final congressional approval.\n       The Senate acted by voice vote to control use of Rohypnol. \n     The bill, sponsored by Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-Queensbury), \n     must return to the House, where a slightly different version \n     was approved last week, 421-1.\n       Rohypnol is a tranquilizer that has no taste, order or \n     color when dissolved in a drink and is 10 to 20 times more \n     powerful than Valium. In ``roone rape,'' victims who are \n     slipped the drug become dizzy and disoriented and have \n     trouble moving their arms and legs. Ultimately, they pass out \n     and have little or no memory.\n       After clearing up the last-minute items, Senate Majority \n     Leader Trent Lott, R-Mass., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     D-S.D., made the traditional telephone call to Clinton to \n     announce that this session of Congress had concluded its \n     business.\n       ``We've got good news for you,'' Lott told Clinton. They \n     discussed bills Congress had passed over the past few weeks.\n       ``You guys did such a great job,'' Clinton said. ``It's \n     amazing how much you've got done in the last few weeks. You \n     should really be proud.''\n                                  ____\n                                  \n\n\n                            key legislation\n\n       Some of the major bills passed by the 104th Congress:\n       Welfare: The longstanding federal guarantee of assistance \n     to every person who qualifies will end, to be replaced by \n     state programs financed partially by federal grants. \n     Eligibility for welfare generally will be limited to five \n     years. Food stamps, aid to legal immigrants will be scaled \n     back considerably.\n       Health: Workers who change jobs will be assured continued \n     health coverage without a waiting period for pre-existing \n     conditions. Insurers will have to pay for at least 48 hours' \n     hospital care for newborns and their mothers and provide \n     higher benefits for mental-health care.\n       Taxes: No across-the-board tax reduction, although targeted \n     cuts were approved for adoption expenses, long-term health \n     care, helping small businesses bear the cost of raising the \n     minimum wage and helping the self-employed buy health \n     insurance.\n       Minimum wage: The $4.25-an-hour federal minimum wage will \n     rise in two steps to $5.15.\n       Speed limit: The 55 mph federal speed limit was repealed.\n       Crime: More money for police on the street. Limitation of \n     appeals in death-penalty cases. Tougher penalties for crimes \n     against the elderly and children. Interstate stalking was \n     made a federal crime.\n       Environment: A new standard restricts cancer-causing \n     pesticides in fresh and processed foods and also targets \n     residues that raise the risk of birth defects. A new Safe \n     Drinking Water Act zeros in on pollutants posing the greatest \n     risk to health.\n       Telecommunications: A major overhaul allows local telephone \n     companies to enter the long-distance business; big gas and \n     electric companies will be able to offer telecommunications \n     services. A ``V-chip'' eventually will screen TV programs for \n     violence and adult-oriented content.\n       Gay marriages: States will be allowed to refuse to \n     recognize same-sex marriages. No federal spousal benefits \n     will be available in such marriages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "EVEN PRESIDENT CLINTON PRAISES 104TH CONGRESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        HON.

After the \n     filibuster was broken with a 66-31 vote (six more than the \n     number needed), the bill passed easily, 92-2.\n       ``This is special-interest legislation that never would \n     have been passed by a Democratic House and a Democratic \n     Senate,'' Kennedy maintained. ``We look forward today to the \n     next vote for working families, which is Nov. 5 (Election \n     Day).''\n       But the provision for Federal Express, which would require \n     its employees to organize nationally rather than locally, was \n     supported both by Democrats and Republicans. Sen. Ernest \n     Hollings, D-S.C., the provision's main champion, said Kennedy \n     was trying to give the bill the ``bum's rush.''\n       The urgency of many senators to get home to campaign, along \n     with the fact that the bill contained millions for airport \n     construction projects, contributed to the lopsided vote.\n       The White House had notified the senators that President \n     Clinton opposed the Federal Express provision. Thursday, \n     however, aides indicated that Clinton would sign the bill, \n     which the House approved last week.\n       ``Because of this legislation, criminal-background checks \n     can now be conducted on airport personnel, new explosives-\n     detection technology can be deployed, baggage will be checked \n     in more thoroughly, passenger profiling will be instituted, \n     and the families who lose a loved one in an accident will be \n     able to get the help they need.'' Clinton said in a \n     statement.\n       The bill includes several anti-terrorism provisions for \n     airports, including stepped-up security. Some of the \n     requirements include background checks on airport-security \n     personnel and provisions aimed at dealing more humanely with \n     families of air-crash victims.\n       The bill also streamlines the FAA, beefing up the \n     regulatory aspects of the agency and phasing out the air-\n     travel promotional functions.\n       Also on the Senate's last-minute agenda was a major federal \n     parks bill that passed on a voice vote after days of \n     wrangling over boundary lines in 100 individual federal \n     parks.\n       Legislation to increase penalties for misuse of the so-\n     called ``date-rape drug'' cleared the Senate and was \n     virtually certain to win final congressional approval.\n       The Senate acted by voice vote to control use of Rohypnol. \n     The bill, sponsored by Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-Queensbury), \n     must return to the House, where a slightly different version \n     was approved last week, 421-1.\n       Rohypnol is a tranquilizer that has no taste, order or \n     color when dissolved in a drink and is 10 to 20 times more \n     powerful than Valium. In ``roone rape,'' victims who are \n     slipped the drug become dizzy and disoriented and have \n     trouble moving their arms and legs. Ultimately, they pass out \n     and have little or no memory.\n       After clearing up the last-minute items, Senate Majority \n     Leader Trent Lott, R-Mass., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     D-S.D., made the traditional telephone call to Clinton to \n     announce that this session of Congress had concluded its \n     business.\n       ``We've got good news for you,'' Lott told Clinton. They \n     discussed bills Congress had passed over the past few weeks.\n       ``You guys did such a great job,'' Clinton said. ``It's \n     amazing how much you've got done in the last few weeks. You \n     should really be proud.''\n                                  ____\n                                  \n\n\n                            key legislation\n\n       Some of the major bills passed by the 104th Congress:\n       Welfare: The longstanding federal guarantee of assistance \n     to every person who qualifies will end, to be replaced by \n     state programs financed partially by federal grants. \n     Eligibility for welfare generally will be limited to five \n     years. Food stamps, aid to legal immigrants will be scaled \n     back considerably.\n       Health: Workers who change jobs will be assured continued \n     health coverage without a waiting period for pre-existing \n     conditions. Insurers will have to pay for at least 48 hours' \n     hospital care for newborns and their mothers and provide \n     higher benefits for mental-health care.\n       Taxes: No across-the-board tax reduction, although targeted \n     cuts were approved for adoption expenses, long-term health \n     care, helping small businesses bear the cost of raising the \n     minimum wage and helping the self-employed buy health \n     insurance.\n       Minimum wage: The $4.25-an-hour federal minimum wage will \n     rise in two steps to $5.15.\n       Speed limit: The 55 mph federal speed limit was repealed.\n       Crime: More money for police on the street. Limitation of \n     appeals in death-penalty cases. Tougher penalties for crimes \n     against the elderly and children. Interstate stalking was \n     made a federal crime.\n       Environment: A new standard restricts cancer-causing \n     pesticides in fresh and processed foods and also targets \n     residues that raise the risk of birth defects. A new Safe \n     Drinking Water Act zeros in on pollutants posing the greatest \n     risk to health.\n       Telecommunications: A major overhaul allows local telephone \n     companies to enter the long-distance business; big gas and \n     electric companies will be able to offer telecommunications \n     services. A ``V-chip'' eventually will screen TV programs for \n     violence and adult-oriented content.\n       Gay marriages: States will be allowed to refuse to \n     recognize same-sex marriages. No federal spousal benefits \n     will be available in such marriages.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Gerald B. H.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the provision of the bill \nthat I had introduced and that the House passed last year--H.R. 632--\nhas finally also been passed and returned to the House by the other \nbody. At long last, small investors will be guaranteed fair, \nreasonable, and entire compensation when they are required to defend \ntheir patents rights when appropriated by the Government.\n  When the bill was pending in the other body, we received some \nquestions whether the legislation was intended actually to provide full \ncoverage of costs as it states, or whether some cap on costs might \nappropriately be added by the Congress as has been done in some other \ncontexts.\n  The short answer is that the legislation means just what it says. It \nintends that all costs are to be reimbursed, with the only limitation \nbeing reasonableness, and the determination of reasonableness by a \ncourt is to be realistic, not miserly. If the patent holder's actual \ncosts are within the realm of reason under the circumstance, they are \nto be fully compensated.\n  A patent holder whose invention is taken by the Government can obtain \ncompensation only by bringing a case in the Court of Federal Claims \nunder Section 1498 (a) of Title 28, United States Code. A case brought \nunder that Section differs substantially not only from the usual cases \nbrought in Federal courts, but also from other eminent domain cases. \nThere is no procedure for an offer by the Government to be submitted to \na patent holder for its taking of his patent rights. There is no \nadministrative or other simple procedure for resolution of differences \nand settlement. There is no prominent single-issue such as valuation as \nin real estate condemnation cases, but instead a series of issues of \nunusual complexity. The patent holder must initiate a lawsuit, and must \nmarshall professional assistance capable of establishing the validity \nof the patent, the infringement of the patent, and the proper valuation \nof the damages stemming from the infringement. Such lawsuits are \nexceedingly difficult and time-consuming to prepare and present to the \ncourt. They require extensive review, research, analysis, and \npresentation by capable professionals in the fields of law, \nengineering, science, accounting, and licensing. The time of such \nprofessionals is not inexpensive. Yet a patent holder has no choice but \nto engage such competent assistance, and to incur such costs, if he is \nto defend his patent right against the Government's taking.\n  It is our intent and our expectation that the court bear in mind \nthese unique characteristics of Section 1498(a) lawsuits in the course \nof judging the reasonableness of the patent owner's costs during the \ninvestigation, preparation, liability, and accounting phases of such a \ncase. It is also our intent and expectation that the court base its \ndetermination on a realistic view not only of the kinds of costs that \nit is reasonable to incur in such cases, but also of the reasonableness \nof the amounts of those costs. With respect to the kinds of costs that \nit would be reasonable to incur, apart from the costs of professional \nassistance, we have in mind such court costs as may be taxed under \nSection 1920 of 28 United States Code, as well as reasonable out-of-\npocket expenses charged to the patent owner by expert witnesses and \nattorneys for such items as computerized research, communications, \ntravel, hotels, and meals. With regard to the reasonableness of the \namounts to be reimbursed, we note that suits under section 1498(a) are \nnot elective ones such as prompted the Congress in the past to impose \narbitrary limits on attorney's fees as in 28 United States Code, \nSection 2412(d)(2)(A), and on expert witnesses fees as in 28 United \nStates Code, Section 1821(b). Thus, the touchstone for the court is \nsimply a realistic appraisal of what is reasonable under the \ncircumstances. Certainly, when a small patent holder's economic \nsurvival may be threatened by the cost of responding to an unwelcome \ngovernmental taking, the concerned patent holder cannot be limited to \nbargain-basement professional assistance if he is to receive ``just'' \ncompensation as required by the Constitution. In such a situation, as \nwell as in less dire circumstances, the intended test of reasonableness \nof professional fees actually incurred by the patent holder is whether \nthey are within the range commonly charged by competent professionals \nin the same locality, in cases of similar complexity and similar \nimportance to the patent holder.\n  In short, we intend that the Court of Federal Claims at last be \nempowered to do complete justice in such cases, and we believe that \ncomplete justice requires realism and practicality in the assessment of \nthe reasonableness of the patent holder's costs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "PATENT HOLDER COMPENSATION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           HON.

Thus, the touchstone for the court is simply a realistic appraisal of what is reasonable under the circumstances. Certainly, when a small patent holder's economic survival may be threatened by the cost of responding to an unwelcome governmental taking, the concerned patent holder cannot be limited to bargain-basement professional assistance if he is to receive ``just'' compensation as required by the Constitution. In such a situation, as well as in less dire circumstances, the intended test of reasonableness of professional fees actually incurred by the patent holder is whether they are within the range commonly charged by competent professionals in the same locality, in cases of similar complexity and similar importance to the patent holder.\n\tIn short, we intend that the Court of Federal Claims at last be empowered to do complete justice in such cases, and we believe that complete justice requires realism and practicality in the assessment of the reasonableness of the patent holder's costs.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Martin Frost"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "142 Cong.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform my colleagues that \nsince the beginning of the Congressional Biomedical Research Caucus in \n1990, until the last briefing of this Congress on September 25, there \nhave been 50 briefing sessions for Members of Congress and their staffs \non the latest cutting edge developments in biomedical research.\n  Over the 6-year period, the Biomedical Research Caucus has developed \na working relationship with the five scientific societies: American \nSociety for Cell Biology, American Society for Biochemistry and \nMolecular Biology, Biophysical Society, Genetics Society of America, \nAmerican Association of Anatomists and the Association of Anatomy, Cell \nBiology and Neurobiology Chairpersons, which compose the Joint Steering \nCommittee for Public Policy [JSC]. JSC under the leadership of Dr. Marc \nKirschner, chairman of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School and with \nthe scientific resources of the member societies established a \ncommittee, chaired by Nobel Prize winner Dr. Harold Varmus, the current \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health, to develop a biomedical \nresearch briefing program for the Congress. I am proud of the quality \nof the programs and the new opportunities in health care that are \npresented at the caucus briefings. Since Dr. Varmus assumed his duties \nat the NIH, we have been fortunate to have Dr. Michael Bishop, \nUniversity of California, San Francisco, his former colleague and co-\nprize winner of the Nobel award advise us on appropriate topics and \nspeakers for the caucus briefings. This past year in 1996, Dr. Bishop \nsuggested the caucus learn about issues involving: genetic testing, \nantibiotic resistance, mad cow disease, and us, how vision wires our \nbrains and the potential for learning, the latest in new drug therapy \nthat may prevent the HIV virus from becoming full blown AIDS and allow \nindividuals to live productive lives, and how H Pylori is involved in \nulcers and stomach cancer. We look forward to his suggestions for next \nyear.\n  This December, 1996, the American Society for Cell Biology at its \nannual meeting in San Francisco will give its Public Policy Award to \nDr. Marc Kirschner, the first research scientist to receive the award. \nPrevious recipients of the Public Policy award have been the Senator \nfrom Iowa [Mr. Harkin] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Porter] for \ntheir contributions to the field of biomedical research. I think it is \nfitting that scientific societies begin to recognize and reward the \nservice and contributions that their members make to the public arena \non behalf of biomedical research. Dr. Kirschner has served the Congress \nwell in beginning the briefing series and bringing all his colleagues, \nspecifically Dr. Varmus and Dr. Bishop to our attention. Once again, \nDr. Kirschner has served the Congress well in securing a replacement \nfor his leadership of the JSC societies, Dr. Eric Linder, Director of \nthe Whitehead Institute Genome Center at MIT. For the last year Dr. \nLander, a member of the Genetics Society of America, has succeeded Dr. \nKirschner, as chair of the efforts of the five societies of the Joint \nSteering Committee, which continue to provide us excellent advice and \nguidance on the latest developments in biomedical research. Over the \nyears the caucus briefing series has developed a reputation for \nexcellence and an audience among the Congress from the Congressional \nResearch Service analysts to professional staff of the health and \nrelated Committees of the Congress. Two years ago the caucus hosted a \nbriefing presentation by NASA, which was beginning its biology research \non the Space Lab and in attendance was astronaut Shannon Lucid, the \ncurrent American with the longest flight in space and her replacement \nin space John Blaha. We are able to bring these issues to the Congress \nby using the noon hour for briefing meetings because of the \ncontribution of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental \nBiology, which cooperates with the Joint Steering Committee in this \nservice.\n  We look forward to working with Dr. Lander, who was recently featured \nin a New York Times profile of a scientist at work, ``Love Of Numbers \nLeads To Chromosome 17''. Dr. Lander is an amiable adviser who brings \nthe unique perspective of a mathematician to the work of genetics and \nbiology. I commend the attached article about Dr. Lander for your \nreading and inspiration:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 10, 1996]\n\n                 Love of Numbers Leads To Chromosome 17\n\n                          (By Philip J. Hilts)\n\n       Cambridge, Mass.--In the career of Dr. Eric Steven Lander, \n     as in the new branch of biology known as genomics, the life \n     of numbers and the numbers in life have come together.\n       Dr. Lander, director of the Whitehead Institute/M.I.T. \n     Genome Center here, is a leader in constructing a complete \n     catalogue of the human DNA code or genome. But he did not \n     arrive at this position in the traditional way--for example \n     with a degree in biology. Only when past 30 did this curly \n     haired and energetic figure first crack a book in biology.\n       Rather, he grew up in the thrall of numbers. As a high \n     school mathematics whiz, he was on the United States high \n     school team that came in a close second to the Soviet team in \n     the world mathematics Olympiad in 1974. He later trained as a \n     pure mathematician at Princeton University. Only then did he \n     fall in love with biology, as he spent hours talking with his \n     brother, Arthur, a neurologist.\n       Biology itself has also been undergoing change in recent \n     years. The old style of academic biology is now admitting a \n     brash new branch of inquiry, one that is information-heavy, \n     computer-driven and closely allied to business. And for Dr. \n     Lander, that has been perfect. When he emerged from his \n     personal transformation, there he was, at the leading edge of \n     molecular biology.\n       He established his credentials in biology by tackling \n     subjects that could only be approached by someone with a \n     strong background in mathematics, like how to analyze \n     statistically whether a disease may be caused by one or many \n     genes, and how to ferret out the different contributing \n     genes.\n       In August, a team led by Dr. Lander found a gene that \n     contributes to type 2 diabetes, a disease caused by many \n     genes, each with many variants. Dr. Lander's strategy began \n     with the calculation that elusive genes are easier to \n     identify in isolated populations, where people are descended \n     from only a few founders and have not accumulated the many \n     genetic variations of more cosmopolitan groups. He searched \n     for the diabetes gene among a group of people in the Bothnia \n     region of western Finland where few outsiders have migrated \n     in the last 1,000 years.\n       When biologists began to consider the task of making a \n     complete catalogue of the entire three billion letters in the \n     human body's DNA code, Dr. Lander's work made him a natural \n     candidate to lead one of the several teams of DNA sequencers.\n       Craig Venter, head of the Institute for Genetics Research, \n     a private concern in Rockville, Md., a competitor of Dr. \n     Lander in the race to sequence genomes, said: ``In sequencing \n     whole genomes the breakthrough has been mathematics, applied \n     math and new algorithms. These are the kind of things Eric is \n     good at.''\n       At the Whitehead Institute/M.I.T. Genome Center, Dr. \n     Lander's group has produced the first genetic maps of the \n     human and mouse genomes, a necessary step toward working out \n     the complete DNA sequence. His laboratory is one of several \n     that are financed by the National Center for Human Genome \n     Research in Bethesda, Md. The consortium of laboratories had \n     planned to complete the full DNA sequence of the human genome \n     by the year 2005 at a cost of $3 billion, but is already two \n     years ahead of schedule and below budget. The project has \n     already identified many genes of medical interest and \n     prompted investments by several companies.\n       Dr. Lander, 39, was born and raised in Brooklyn in a family \n     of lawyers. As student at Stuyvesant High School in \n     Manhattan, he was sent one summer to participate in an elite \n     mathematics program, where the students decided that 17 was \n     the most interesting of all numbers. They formed a 17 club \n     and made up a T-shirt emblazoned with amazing facts about the \n     number 17. Dr. Lander can still quote examples: ``Many \n     multisided figures are stable when set down any one of their \n     sides, for example, a pyramid. But did you know that a 17-\n     sided figure is the only one that is stable on one side \n     only?''\n       Recently, the number 17 has sneaked back into his life. The \n     Whitehead genome center has chosen human chromosome No. 17 as \n     the one it will sequence as its contribution to the Human \n     Genome Project.\n       ``Someone suggested I had picked chromosome 17 because of \n     my fascination with that number,'' Dr. Lander said. ``That's \n     not really true, but I am thinking of taking the old T-shirt \n     out of the closest. I still have it.''\n       As Dr. Lander followed his instincts, his career took some \n     sharp turns, from pure mathematics at Princeton and Oxford, \n     to managerial economics at the Harvard Business School. Then, \n     while teaching mathematically oriented business classes by \n     day, at night he crossed the Charles River to hang out in \n     biology laboratories.\n       He had begun to see that beneath the surface of the two \n     very different disciplines of mathematics and biology there \n     lay some\n\n[[Page E1927]]\n\n     links of possible importance. Biology, however chaotic it \n     might appear, had regions that he felt would yield to the \n     firepower of mathematical methods. His first few papers \n     exploring mathematical approaches to biology were \n     sufficiently remarkable that he won a MacArthur Fellowship, \n     the so-called ``genius'' award. ``That grant was crucial for \n     me,'' he said. ``I was struggling to establish myself at the \n     interface of math and molecular biology. Why should anyone \n     take me seriously? The MacArthur gave me that essential \n     credibility.''\n       The $250,000 grant helped finance travel to the far-flung \n     and isolated human populations where he knew gene-hunting \n     would be easier.\n       Dr. Lander soon started to make an impact in molecular \n     biology, creating the mathematical tools to tease out a major \n     gene in asthma, and a ``modifer'' gene that can suppress \n     colon cancer. But eventually he tired of hunting down genes \n     in the genetic jungle, one by one. ``That time is over,'' he \n     said. He is now laying plans for the next era in biology, in \n     which he foresees that the entire set of human genes and \n     their functions will be available on one CD-ROM disk, so \n     there will be no more Stanley-and-Livingston searching.\n       ``Now, suddenly, biology is finite,'' he said.\n       ``The genome project is wholly analogous to the creation of \n     the periodic table in chemistry,'' Dr. Lander said. Just as \n     Mendeleev's arrangement of the chemical elements in the \n     periodic table made coherent a previously unrelated mass of \n     data, so Dr. Lander believes that the tens of thousands of \n     genes in present-day organisms will all turn out to be made \n     from combinations of a much smaller number of simpler genetic \n     modules or elements, the primordial genes, so to speak. He \n     theorizes that these modules helped carry on life in the most \n     primitive cells living on the planet three billion years ago. \n     The basic functions of the life carried out by the first \n     genes must all have been formed very early in evolution, Dr. \n     Lander surmises. Most present-day genes are variations on \n     these few original themes, he said.\n       ``The point is that the 100,000 human genes shouldn't be \n     thought of as 100,000 completely different genes,'' Dr. \n     Lander said. ``They should be thought of as maybe a couple \n     hundred families that carry on essentially all of life.''\n       Making such a periodic table for families of genes will \n     define a new direction for biology, in Dr. Lander's view. The \n     completed table would mark the end of structural genomics, \n     the analysis of the structure of genes. ``When you get the \n     last base of the genome, driven in like the golden spike in \n     the transcontinental railroad, we'll maybe have a big \n     ceremony,'' he said. ``But when it's done, it's done.''\n       Then comes what Dr. Lander calls functional genomics, or \n     making practical use of the table. For example, Dr. Lander \n     says, biologists may learn to read human DNA so effectively \n     that laboratories will quickly be able to tell patients all \n     the important variations they have in their entire gene set, \n     or genome. Further, it should be possible to tell which of \n     those genes are turned off or on at a given moment, thus \n     getting a picture of whether the cells of the body are up to \n     snuff.\n       ``So here's the manifesto for the era of functional \n     genomics,'' Dr. Lander said.\n       ``One. At the DNA level we want the ability to re-sequence \n     an entire genome--anybody's genome--in a regular medical \n     setting, to find all the variations. Because you and I differ \n     in one-tenth of 1 percent of our bases, and that accounts for \n     our differences.\n       ``Most genes will have two, three or four major variants, \n     If you have 100,000 genes, that means there will only be \n     about 300,000 major variants. It's a finite number. We can \n     then take that list, and then correlate all the different \n     variations with health outcomes. You could take the \n     Framingham Heart Study and find the rate of each disease \n     associated with each of the 300,000 variants of genes.''\n       That would allow each person to get a full list of what \n     disease they are most at risk for, based on their \n     inheritance.\n       With a mix of hope and skepticism, he said: ``In principle, \n     that would allow us to have personalized health care and \n     personal health care strategies. In practice, of course, \n     whether we do that will depend on what we as a society want \n     to pay for, and how much we can protect our privacy, and so \n     on.''\n       ``Two,'' he said, holding up fingers to signal the next \n     item on his manifesto. ``We want to be able to monitor gene \n     expression.'' Finding out which of an individual's genes are \n     active at any time would help indicate a body's response to \n     drugs, dieting, exercise and other factors.\n       ``All this is not so crazy as it sounds,'' Dr. Lander said. \n     ``Less crazy, in fact, than the genome project itself. There \n     are already genetic `chips' that can make these things \n     possible.''\n       He was referring to one of his favorite new technologies, \n     which has put human genes on microchips. Genes in a blood \n     sample can be matched against the standard ones on the chip \n     to see if there are any important abnormalities.\n       So far, one company making ``gene chips,'' Affymetric Inc. \n     of Santa Clara, Calif., has succeeded in putting all the \n     genes of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, on a chip for \n     such comparison. The company has plans to put 30 to 40 human \n     genes on one chip, and ``in principle at least,'' said Robert \n     Lipschutz of Affymetrix, ``we should be able to put all human \n     genes on a chip.''\n       Dr. Lander has a piece of that company, as well as a major \n     financial interest in Millennium, a company that intends to \n     make use of the data from the genome project to design \n     diagnostics and treatments of disease.\n       If there is a danger sighted ahead in the ``new biology,'' \n     some critics suggest, it is that businesses may be too close \n     to science, and may even sometimes be in the driver's seat. \n     Scientific judgments may too often yield under pressure from \n     business needs.\n       Dr. Lander, an avid businessman, takes these problems more \n     seriously than most people in science, said Dr. Francis \n     Collins, director of the Federal genome project. Dr. Collins \n     credits Dr. Lander with leading the way to help solve at \n     least one of the problems--that of hoarding data to gain \n     business advantages.\n       The Whitehead genome center, at Dr. Lander's direction, \n     puts out on the Internet all the data it produces on DNA \n     markers and sequences, which are freely available to anyone \n     who wants to copy the material.\n       At first the M.I.T. laboratory's data were posted every few \n     months, and soon they will be disseminated almost daily, Dr. \n     Lander said. ``This work is paid for with public money and \n     it's got to be made public as fast as we can,'' he said. \n     ``That means breaking with tradition and getting it out there \n     long before it can be published in scientific journals.''\n       The effect he says, is highly stimulating for biologists. \n     ``We get 50,000 to 100,000 hits on our database per week. \n     People need this data.''\n       The Federal genome project office has begun to follow his \n     lead, and those receiving grants must now make their data \n     available at least every six months.\n       The task over the next few years for those leading \n     molecular biology will be to get biologists away from their \n     traditional tools--pipettes, gels and flasks--and into \n     analyzing gene function with computers.\n       ``In the next one to three years, we have to figure out how \n     to get humans out of the loop,'' he said. ``Then we can \n     really get to work thinking about biology and what's going on \n     in life.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "CONGRESSIONAL BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH CAUCUS CELEBRATES 50 BRIEFING \n                                SESSIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HON. GEORGE W. GEKAS\n\n                            of pennsylvania\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                        Friday, October 4, 1996\n\n\tMr. GEKAS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to inform my colleagues that since the beginning of the Congressional Biomedical Research Caucus in 1990, until the last briefing of this Congress on September 25, there have been 50 briefing sessions for Members of Congress and their staffs on the latest cutting edge developments in biomedical research.\n\tOver the 6-year period, the Biomedical Research Caucus has developed a working relationship with the five scientific societies: American Society for Cell Biology, American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biophysical Society, Genetics Society of America, American Association of Anatomists and the Association of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Neurobiology Chairpersons, which compose the Joint Steering Committee for Public Policy [JSC]. JSC under the leadership of Dr. Marc Kirschner, chairman of Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School and with the scientific resources of the member societies established a committee, chaired by Nobel Prize winner Dr. Harold Varmus, the current Director of the National Institutes of Health, to develop a biomedical research briefing program for the Congress. I am proud of the quality of the programs and the new opportunities in health care that are presented at the caucus briefings. Since Dr. Varmus assumed his duties at the NIH, we have been fortunate to have Dr. Michael Bishop, University of California, San Francisco, his former colleague and co-prize winner of the Nobel award advise us on appropriate topics and speakers for the caucus briefings. This past year in 1996, Dr. Bishop suggested the caucus learn about issues involving: genetic testing, antibiotic resistance, mad cow disease, and us, how vision wires our brains and the potential for learning, the latest in new drug therapy that may prevent the HIV virus from becoming full blown AIDS and allow individuals to live productive lives, and how H Pylori is involved in ulcers and stomach cancer. We look forward to his suggestions for next year.\n\tThis December, 1996, the American Society for Cell Biology at its annual meeting in San Francisco will give its Public Policy Award to Dr. Marc Kirschner, the first research scientist to receive the award. Previous recipients of the Public Policy award have been the Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Porter] for their contributions to the field of biomedical research. I think it is fitting that scientific societies begin to recognize and reward the service and contributions that their members make to the public arena on behalf of biomedical research. Dr. Kirschner has served the Congress well in beginning the briefing series and bringing all his colleagues, specifically Dr. Varmus and Dr. Bishop to our attention. Once again, Dr. Kirschner has served the Congress well in securing a replacement for his leadership of the JSC societies, Dr. Eric Linder, Director of the Whitehead Institute Genome Center at MIT. For the last year Dr. Lander, a member of the Genetics Society of America, has succeeded Dr. Kirschner, as chair of the efforts of the five societies of the Joint Steering Committee, which continue to provide us excellent advice and guidance on the latest developments in biomedical research. Over the years the caucus briefing series has developed a reputation for excellence and an audience among the Congress from the Congressional Research Service analysts to professional staff of the health and related Committees of the Congress. Two years ago the caucus hosted a briefing presentation by NASA, which was beginning its biology research on the Space Lab and in attendance was astronaut Shannon Lucid, the current American with the longest flight in space and her replacement in space John Blaha. We are able to bring these issues to the Congress by using the noon hour for briefing meetings because of the contribution of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, which cooperates with the Joint Steering Committee in this service.\n\tWe look forward to working with Dr. Lander, who was recently featured in a New York Times profile of a scientist at work, ``Love Of Numbers Leads To Chromosome 17''. Dr. Lander is an amiable adviser who brings the unique perspective of a mathematician to the work of genetics and biology. I commend the attached article about Dr. Lander for your reading and inspiration:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 10, 1996]\n\n                 Love of Numbers Leads To Chromosome 17\n\n                          (By Philip J. Hilts)\n\n       Cambridge, Mass.--In the career of Dr. Eric Steven Lander, \n     as in the new branch of biology known as genomics, the life \n     of numbers and the numbers in life have come together.\n       Dr. Lander, director of the Whitehead Institute/M.I.T. \n     Genome Center here, is a leader in constructing a complete \n     catalogue of the human DNA code or genome. But he did not \n     arrive at this position in the traditional way--for example \n     with a degree in biology. Only when past 30 did this curly \n     haired and energetic figure first crack a book in biology.\n       Rather, he grew up in the thrall of numbers. As a high \n     school mathematics whiz, he was on the United States high \n     school team that came in a close second to the Soviet team in \n     the world mathematics Olympiad in 1974. He later trained as a \n     pure mathematician at Princeton University. Only then did he \n     fall in love with biology, as he spent hours talking with his \n     brother, Arthur, a neurologist.\n       Biology itself has also been undergoing change in recent \n     years. The old style of academic biology is now admitting a \n     brash new branch of inquiry, one that is information-heavy, \n     computer-driven and closely allied to business. And for Dr. \n     Lander, that has been perfect. When he emerged from his \n     personal transformation, there he was, at the leading edge of \n     molecular biology.\n       He established his credentials in biology by tackling \n     subjects that could only be approached by someone with a \n     strong background in mathematics, like how to analyze \n     statistically whether a disease may be caused by one or many \n     genes, and how to ferret out the different contributing \n     genes.\n       In August, a team led by Dr. Lander found a gene that \n     contributes to type 2 diabetes, a disease caused by many \n     genes, each with many variants. Dr. Lander's strategy began \n     with the calculation that elusive genes are easier to \n     identify in isolated populations, where people are descended \n     from only a few founders and have not accumulated the many \n     genetic variations of more cosmopolitan groups. He searched \n     for the diabetes gene among a group of people in the Bothnia \n     region of western Finland where few outsiders have migrated \n     in the last 1,000 years.\n       When biologists began to consider the task of making a \n     complete catalogue of the entire three billion letters in the \n     human body's DNA code, Dr. Lander's work made him a natural \n     candidate to lead one of the several teams of DNA sequencers.\n       Craig Venter, head of the Institute for Genetics Research, \n     a private concern in Rockville, Md., a competitor of Dr. \n     Lander in the race to sequence genomes, said: ``In sequencing \n     whole genomes the breakthrough has been mathematics, applied \n     math and new algorithms. These are the kind of things Eric is \n     good at.''\n       At the Whitehead Institute/M.I.T. Genome Center, Dr. \n     Lander's group has produced the first genetic maps of the \n     human and mouse genomes, a necessary step toward working out \n     the complete DNA sequence. His laboratory is one of several \n     that are financed by the National Center for Human Genome \n     Research in Bethesda, Md. The consortium of laboratories had \n     planned to complete the full DNA sequence of the human genome \n     by the year 2005 at a cost of $3 billion, but is already two \n     years ahead of schedule and below budget. The project has \n     already identified many genes of medical interest and \n     prompted investments by several companies.\n       Dr. Lander, 39, was born and raised in Brooklyn in a family \n     of lawyers. As student at Stuyvesant High School in \n     Manhattan, he was sent one summer to participate in an elite \n     mathematics program, where the students decided that 17 was \n     the most interesting of all numbers. They formed a 17 club \n     and made up a T-shirt emblazoned with amazing facts about the \n     number 17. Dr. Lander can still quote examples: ``Many \n     multisided figures are stable when set down any one of their \n     sides, for example, a pyramid. But did you know that a 17-\n     sided figure is the only one that is stable on one side \n     only?''\n       Recently, the number 17 has sneaked back into his life. The \n     Whitehead genome center has chosen human chromosome No. 17 as \n     the one it will sequence as its contribution to the Human \n     Genome Project.\n       ``Someone suggested I had picked chromosome 17 because of \n     my fascination with that number,'' Dr. Lander said. ``That's \n     not really true, but I am thinking of taking the old T-shirt \n     out of the closest. I still have it.''\n       As Dr. Lander followed his instincts, his career took some \n     sharp turns, from pure mathematics at Princeton and Oxford, \n     to managerial economics at the Harvard Business School. Then, \n     while teaching mathematically oriented business classes by \n     day, at night he crossed the Charles River to hang out in \n     biology laboratories.\n       He had begun to see that beneath the surface of the two \n     very different disciplines of mathematics and biology there \n     lay some\n[[Page E1927]]\n\n     links of possible importance. Biology, however chaotic it \n     might appear, had regions that he felt would yield to the \n     firepower of mathematical methods. His first few papers \n     exploring mathematical approaches to biology were \n     sufficiently remarkable that he won a MacArthur Fellowship, \n     the so-called ``genius'' award. ``That grant was crucial for \n     me,'' he said. ``I was struggling to establish myself at the \n     interface of math and molecular biology. Why should anyone \n     take me seriously? The MacArthur gave me that essential \n     credibility.''\n       The $250,000 grant helped finance travel to the far-flung \n     and isolated human populations where he knew gene-hunting \n     would be easier.\n       Dr. Lander soon started to make an impact in molecular \n     biology, creating the mathematical tools to tease out a major \n     gene in asthma, and a ``modifer'' gene that can suppress \n     colon cancer. But eventually he tired of hunting down genes \n     in the genetic jungle, one by one. ``That time is over,'' he \n     said. He is now laying plans for the next era in biology, in \n     which he foresees that the entire set of human genes and \n     their functions will be available on one CD-ROM disk, so \n     there will be no more Stanley-and-Livingston searching.\n       ``Now, suddenly, biology is finite,'' he said.\n       ``The genome project is wholly analogous to the creation of \n     the periodic table in chemistry,'' Dr. Lander said. Just as \n     Mendeleev's arrangement of the chemical elements in the \n     periodic table made coherent a previously unrelated mass of \n     data, so Dr. Lander believes that the tens of thousands of \n     genes in present-day organisms will all turn out to be made \n     from combinations of a much smaller number of simpler genetic \n     modules or elements, the primordial genes, so to speak. He \n     theorizes that these modules helped carry on life in the most \n     primitive cells living on the planet three billion years ago. \n     The basic functions of the life carried out by the first \n     genes must all have been formed very early in evolution, Dr. \n     Lander surmises. Most present-day genes are variations on \n     these few original themes, he said.\n       ``The point is that the 100,000 human genes shouldn't be \n     thought of as 100,000 completely different genes,'' Dr. \n     Lander said. ``They should be thought of as maybe a couple \n     hundred families that carry on essentially all of life.''\n       Making such a periodic table for families of genes will \n     define a new direction for biology, in Dr. Lander's view. The \n     completed table would mark the end of structural genomics, \n     the analysis of the structure of genes. ``When you get the \n     last base of the genome, driven in like the golden spike in \n     the transcontinental railroad, we'll maybe have a big \n     ceremony,'' he said. ``But when it's done, it's done.''\n       Then comes what Dr. Lander calls functional genomics, or \n     making practical use of the table. For example, Dr. Lander \n     says, biologists may learn to read human DNA so effectively \n     that laboratories will quickly be able to tell patients all \n     the important variations they have in their entire gene set, \n     or genome. Further, it should be possible to tell which of \n     those genes are turned off or on at a given moment, thus \n     getting a picture of whether the cells of the body are up to \n     snuff.\n       ``So here's the manifesto for the era of functional \n     genomics,'' Dr. Lander said.\n       ``One. At the DNA level we want the ability to re-sequence \n     an entire genome--anybody's genome--in a regular medical \n     setting, to find all the variations. Because you and I differ \n     in one-tenth of 1 percent of our bases, and that accounts for \n     our differences.\n       ``Most genes will have two, three or four major variants, \n     If you have 100,000 genes, that means there will only be \n     about 300,000 major variants. It's a finite number. We can \n     then take that list, and then correlate all the different \n     variations with health outcomes. You could take the \n     Framingham Heart Study and find the rate of each disease \n     associated with each of the 300,000 variants of genes.''\n       That would allow each person to get a full list of what \n     disease they are most at risk for, based on their \n     inheritance.\n       With a mix of hope and skepticism, he said: ``In principle, \n     that would allow us to have personalized health care and \n     personal health care strategies. In practice, of course, \n     whether we do that will depend on what we as a society want \n     to pay for, and how much we can protect our privacy, and so \n     on.''\n       ``Two,'' he said, holding up fingers to signal the next \n     item on his manifesto. ``We want to be able to monitor gene \n     expression.'' Finding out which of an individual's genes are \n     active at any time would help indicate a body's response to \n     drugs, dieting, exercise and other factors.\n       ``All this is not so crazy as it sounds,'' Dr. Lander said. \n     ``Less crazy, in fact, than the genome project itself. There \n     are already genetic `chips' that can make these things \n     possible.''\n       He was referring to one of his favorite new technologies, \n     which has put human genes on microchips. Genes in a blood \n     sample can be matched against the standard ones on the chip \n     to see if there are any important abnormalities.\n       So far, one company making ``gene chips,'' Affymetric Inc. \n     of Santa Clara, Calif., has succeeded in putting all the \n     genes of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, on a chip for \n     such comparison.

I would like to include for the Record Mr. de la Garza's remarks \nat the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 19th Annual Gala.\n\n  Partial Transcript of Congressman Kika de la Garza's Remarks at the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 19th Annual Gala, Wednesday, \n                           September 25, 1996\n\n       This is a great night for me, of course for the tribute, \n     but more important for who we are, and what we do, and what \n     we celebrate here, beyond me. The odyssey began a thousand \n     years ago, in a little corner of Europe called the Iberian \n     peninsula. And then, some 500 years ago, it crossed a vast \n     ocean to a new world. Those galleons were manned by \n     Spaniards, Hispanics. And then they came and explored the \n     coast of the Carolinas, Newfoundland, what we now know as \n     North and South America and began settlements. So the odyssey \n     continued--Spanish, Mexican and Texan, and Confederate and \n     U.S. and we never moved from the same ranch.\n       . . . people out of the United States, how not to educate \n     children because their parents might be illegal or . . . that \n     to me was a sad occasion that a child, you know, the Master \n     said, ``Suffer the children to come unto me.'' He didn't say \n     if they were Palestinians or Nazaranians, he said, ``the \n     children, come unto me.'' And here we're saying, ``No, you're \n     not going to teach this child. You're going to throw him out \n     on the street. We don't care if he's educated because his \n     parents are illegal or because he's illegal. That's not \n     right. That's not what America is all about. (Applause) Thank \n     you. (Applause)\n       Some of us have been more fortunate than others. I have \n     been more fortunate. But I come to you saying that, to those \n     who receive much, have more to repay, and this is something \n     that we have to look at, and that's been my thrust all along. \n     That we have a . . . When they said life, liberty, and the \n     pursuit of happiness, that's what it means, having a \n     youngster be educated, have a youngster the ability to help \n     themself. If no one else will help them, at least he'll help \n     himself. And I had, throughout my life, the best educators, \n     teachers, since my very first nun, Sister Mary Teresita, and \n     my very first scout master, and following that my first high \n     school coach. We followed them, and we were able to achieve. \n     And my friends, I stand here tonight as part of that oddessy \n     that began long time ago, thank to those who have touched my \n     life along the way. Family, my wife, my kids. I regret that \n     my kids could not be here. One, Mike, is out in the middle \n     of the Mediterranean, the task force with the Enterprise, \n     Lieutenant Commander Mike de la Garza. We're very proud of \n     him. Our daughter Angela works for Jay Morwin (??) in \n     Austin with the Gulf of Mexico initiative. And our heart \n     surgeon George, we're\n\n[[Page E1928]]\n\n     very proud of him. He's there at home and he's the one \n     that we see more often. But that's the family, that's the \n     evolution, but we're family, all of us Hispanics. That's \n     what our life has been about. Family. Unity. Any primo can \n     find a place . . . we don't have any homeless among the \n     Hispanic community. There's always a relative to go and \n     take them in. (Applause) There are many people in Texas \n     who got me where I am tonight. (Applause)\n       (Break in recording)\n       . . . When my wife and I go there and they can't hug me \n     much more above my waist, but they come and hug me and all of \n     them are so happy that we're there. I'm . . . That's the only \n     school named after someone that's not dead. So they're glad \n     to see me, ``Yes, that's Kika de la Garza, yes, oh boy.'' \n     (Laughter) But they're learning and that's the future. That's \n     who we're working for. Those of you who are in the corporate \n     world, those of you who help us with the interns and the \n     fellows. I just got a call today from a former fellow of the \n     Hispanic Institute who is a dean at Cornell University. \n     (Applause) And that, my friends, is what it's all about. That \n     we include la familia . . . Unfortunately we're having hard \n     times in this country, and there's no perfect country. We're \n     probably the closest one to perfection, with all our faults, \n     of all the countries in the world. And what we have from \n     Mexico all the way to Chile and Argentina and through the \n     Caribbean, that's the extended family. That's la familia. But \n     because of an accident of history, many of us became American \n     citizens and let me tell you that when we became American \n     citizens we transferred the loyalty. We transferred all of \n     our interest and we have pledged allegiance to the flag of \n     the United States of America. But I respect the Mexican flag \n     because that was part of my family history in the beginning. \n     And that's something that (Applause) . . . that some people \n     would not understand, but we served. I served in the navy. I \n     served in the army. And this is something that . . . ``We \n     can't spend our money on the youngsters because he's \n     illegal.'' There is an illegal dead marine whose family has \n     the Congressional Medal of Honor at home. That, my friends, . \n     . . (Applause) . . . And we served. We have some \n     Congressional Medal of Honor winners here. I saw the winner, \n     Mr. Rojo. Where are you? Will you take a bow? (Applause) . . \n     . And from Mission, Texas, we had Sergeant Lopez and we're \n     going, October the 12th, we're going to commission the U.S.S. \n     Freddy Gonzalez, a new cruiser, and Freddy died in Vietnam. \n     And got the Congressional Medal of Honor, which his mother \n     has, and my uncle Bobby, my mother's youngest brother, died \n     in World War II. And for those that may doubt, let me tell \n     you, I grew up in el barrio en el escuela Catolica. We all \n     lived around the Catholic school. Let me tell you. Joaquin \n     Castro, buried somewhere in the Pacific ocean, only the good \n     Lord knows where he is at, Roberto Gonzalez, killed after 65 \n     missions as an aerial gunner, came and died in an accident, \n     his plane fell in Utah. Around the corner, Ricardo Alaniz, \n     Cayo we called him, died in the Battle of the Bulge. Next to \n     him Daniel Garcia, somewhere in the bowels of the Pacific \n     ocean, only the good Lord knows where he's at. My uncle Bobby \n     that lived with us for some time after my grandmother died. \n     Around the corner Merced Salinas, 28 years in the army \n     waiting for thirty, dead in Vietnam. And Panchito Bentania, \n     18 years old, dead in Vietnam. My friend, this is our family, \n     this is our neighborhood--el barrio y la escuela Catolica--\n     that's our contribution: everyone served. (Applause) And so I \n     truthfully tell you we don't want any handouts, we just want \n     to be treated as every other American should be treated. And \n     hopefully we will get the same respect and treatment as \n     everyone else. And we'll work. Because Lyndon Johnson came to \n     my district once after he'd left the Presidency for something \n     they had for me and he was asked by the media ``What has been \n     your philosophy of life? What have you tried to do in \n     politics as president?'' He said, ``Very simple--a job for \n     every person able to work, a decent home for his family, and \n     a good school for his children. Beyond that, they can take \n     care of themselves.'' And that's what I have tried to do my \n     friends.\n       We are la familia. We are la familia. We have been able to \n     garner a coalition to stop legislation--not to pass--but we \n     can garner our coalition to stop almost any bit of \n     legislation if we can get that coalition going. And we have \n     passed some good legislation. So let me say that as we \n     celebrate Hispanic month, as we look around us at la \n     familia--who the Hispanics are--whatever color, whatever \n     shade of face or hair or how much hair, we know that we have \n     worked together, we know that we have the love that every \n     family has for their children and want to see their children \n     achieve and prosper and succeed in life. We want to see \n     that every child becomes your child--that every child \n     becomes my child--and that together we gather that family \n     and we work to see that the doctor, lawyer, or engineer. \n     It was so great the other night to see in the baseball, in \n     the arts, in education, those that were recognized as \n     having been leaders and having achieved beyond the norm \n     the greatness of these individuals. In my area you know, \n     our brethren and our brothers in the Black College Fund \n     have a saying that a mind is such a terrible thing to \n     waste. My friends, this is true. I grew up--Don Baltisario \n     Guzman could play 5 musical instruments, could write \n     poetry. He was photographer at funerals and weddings if \n     there wasn't anybody to delivery the speech he would be \n     there. This man who was a genius never went to school. Can \n     you imagine had he had a formal education what he could \n     have achieved beyond what he did? And this is what we're \n     talking about. That everyone be able to fulfill their \n     good-given ability and this is . . . Don Baltisario was to \n     me was one of my heroes. There was a scientist, Ben \n     Villalone, and he tamed the wild jalapeno. No one had been \n     able to do that. He's a research scientist at Weslaco and \n     head of that Texas A&M experiment station in Doctor Jose \n     Amador who is here with us tonight and we're very proud of \n     him, that he's here with us.\n       And so, let me just put it all together, my friends, that \n     as we achieve, we shouldn't disregard . . . there's a saying \n     ``No see me olvida de donde vine ni quien me puso donde \n     estoy.--I don't want to forget where I came from nor who \n     placed me where I'm at.'' And this is it. I brought them with \n     me tonight. (Applause) I brought them with me tonight. The \n     Freddy Gonzalez, and the Cayo Alaniz, the migrant who worked \n     in the fields, the sailors in those galleons that came across \n     the vast ocean to begin what we celebrate tonight. The \n     mothers who worked in the fields and reared the children, the \n     teachers who worked for free in the neighborhood, the \n     priests, the nuns, the preachers, all of those that came to \n     people of low economic resources. I bring them all with me \n     tonight and any tributes that you give me, really belongs to \n     them. They're here. (Applause)\n       They are here, my friends, and I hope that you can \n     visualize that they're here, my friends from the migrants, my \n     friends the campesinos, my friends who worked and toiled, my \n     friends who are able to say ``I never went to school but all \n     my kids have graduated from college.'' That's what it's all \n     about. (Applause) And so let me say, you're saying what is \n     this guy doing? (Laughter) I'm waiting for the President to \n     come. (Laughter) (Applause) May I can tell the submarine \n     story.\n       So let me just end with this, my friends. A long time ago, \n     when the explorers were going to the North (Laughter) they \n     stopped in the evening near a big mountain. And one of the \n     soldiers said ``I wonder if anybody will ever know we came \n     this way.'' And his commander said ``Well, I'm going to take \n     care of that for me.'' So he got his saber and he carved his \n     name on the side of the rock and put the date and below it \n     put ``Paso por aqui.'' So my friends I contributed my little \n     grain of sand to the vast ocean of what is the legislative \n     field, but I wanted you to know that hopefully someday \n     somehow the world and our friends and especially my Hispanic \n     family will know that someone named Eligio de le Garza, \n     otherwise known as Kika paso por aqui. Thank you.

Mr. Speaker, on Monday, September 30, 1996, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. de la Garza, addressed the House for the last time. I would like to include for the Record Mr. de la Garza's remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 19th Annual Gala.\n\n\tPartial Transcript of Congressman Kika de la Garza's Remarks at the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute's 19th Annual Gala, Wednesday, \n                           September 25, 1996\n\n       This is a great night for me, of course for the tribute, \n     but more important for who we are, and what we do, and what \n     we celebrate here, beyond me. The odyssey began a thousand \n     years ago, in a little corner of Europe called the Iberian \n     peninsula. And then, some 500 years ago, it crossed a vast \n     ocean to a new world. Those galleons were manned by \n     Spaniards, Hispanics. And then they came and explored the \n     coast of the Carolinas, Newfoundland, what we now know as \n     North and South America and began settlements. So the odyssey \n     continued--Spanish, Mexican and Texan, and Confederate and \n     U.S. and we never moved from the same ranch.\n       . . . people out of the United States, how not to educate \n     children because their parents might be illegal or . . . that \n     to me was a sad occasion that a child, you know, the Master \n     said, ``Suffer the children to come unto me.'' He didn't say \n     if they were Palestinians or Nazaranians, he said, ``the \n     children, come unto me.'' And here we're saying, ``No, you're \n     not going to teach this child. You're going to throw him out \n     on the street. We don't care if he's educated because his \n     parents are illegal or because he's illegal. That's not \n     right. That's not what America is all about. (Applause) Thank \n     you. (Applause)\n       Some of us have been more fortunate than others. I have \n     been more fortunate. But I come to you saying that, to those \n     who receive much, have more to repay, and this is something \n     that we have to look at, and that's been my thrust all along. \n     That we have a . . . When they said life, liberty, and the \n     pursuit of happiness, that's what it means, having a \n     youngster be educated, have a youngster the ability to help \n     themself. If no one else will help them, at least he'll help \n     himself. And I had, throughout my life, the best educators, \n     teachers, since my very first nun, Sister Mary Teresita, and \n     my very first scout master, and following that my first high \n     school coach. We followed them, and we were able to achieve. \n     And my friends, I stand here tonight as part of that oddessy \n     that began long time ago, thank to those who have touched my \n     life along the way. Family, my wife, my kids. I regret that \n     my kids could not be here. One, Mike, is out in the middle \n     of the Mediterranean, the task force with the Enterprise, \n     Lieutenant Commander Mike de la Garza. We're very proud of \n     him. Our daughter Angela works for Jay Morwin (??) in \n     Austin with the Gulf of Mexico initiative. And our heart \n     surgeon George, we're\n[[Page E1928]]\n\n     very proud of him. He's there at home and he's the one \n     that we see more often. But that's the family, that's the \n     evolution, but we're family, all of us Hispanics. That's \n     what our life has been about. Family. Unity. Any primo can \n     find a place . . . we don't have any homeless among the \n     Hispanic community. There's always a relative to go and \n     take them in. (Applause) There are many people in Texas \n     who got me where I am tonight. (Applause)\n       (Break in recording)\n       . . .

THOMAS J. BLILEY, JR.\n\n                              of virginia\n\n                    in the house of representatives\n\n                      Saturday, September 28, 1996\n\n  Mr. BLILEY. Mr. Speaker, in connection with the historic passage in \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate of the National Securities \nMarkets Improvement Act of 1996, I offer the following remarks to \nclarify the congressional intent underlying certain provisions in the \nact.\n\n\n         preemption of state authority over securities issuers\n\n  Section 102 of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of \n1996 eliminates State regulation of securities offerings by a variety \nof securities issuers, while preserving State authority to police \nagainst fraud and to require notice filings and fees. The legislation's \nexpress preservation of State authority to require securities issuers \nto file documents with the States for notice purposes only is intended \nto allow States access to information that is routinely filed with the \nCommission and is not intended to extend to documents that are not \nfiled with the Commission. This would not, however, preclude a State \nthat, consistent with the legislation, has legitimate cause to commence \nan investigation pursuant to its antifraud authority from requesting \nsuch documents as it might be entitled to pursuant to such authority.\n  The preemption effected by section 102 also extends to securities \nthat are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock \nExchange, or the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market. \nThis preemption is intended to apply to securities that are nationally \ntraded and list or have been authorized for listing on any of these \nthree markets. In the past, disparate regulatory treatment of these \nmarkets by State laws has unnecessarily hindered the competition that \nimproves the markets for investors. This legislation is designed to \nprovide a level playing field for those markets by eliminating \nduplicative or unnecessary State regulation equally for securities that \nare listed or authorized for listing on any of the New York Stock \nExchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the National Market System of \nthe Nasdaq Stock Market.\n\n[[Page E1929]]\n\nFurthermore, the preemption effected by the act applies to a security \nthat is a ``covered security'' or will be a ``covered security'' upon \ncompletion of the transaction. Thus, for example, the preemption \neffected by section 102 applies to initial public offerings that are \nauthorized for listing on the National Market System of the Nasdaq \nStock Market and are sold in advance of the effective date of their \nregistration statements.\n  Generally, States regulate securities offerings through laws \nadministered by State securities administrators or, in certain cases, \nState insurance regulators. The preemption provided in section 102 of \nthe act applies to any State authority, whether a securities \nadministrator or an insurance regulator.\n\n\n        Exceptions from the definition of ``investment company''\n\n  Section 209 of the act provides a new exception from the Investment \nCompany Act for investment pools that sell their shares only to \n``qualified purchasers''--qualified purchaser pools. This section \nprovides a grandfather provision enabling private investment companies \nthat qualify for the exception from the definition of ``investment \ncompany'' in section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act--``Section \n3(c)(1) pools''--to qualify under the qualified purchaser pool \nprovision notwithstanding that such a section 3(c)(1) pool might have \ninvestors that are not ``qualified purchasers'' under the provision, so \nlong as the pool complies with certain requirements, including \nproviding notice to its beneficial owners of its intent to use the \nqualified purchaser pool exception.\n  Section 209 includes a requirement that the Securities and Exchange \nCommission prescribe rules defining the term ``beneficial owner'' for \npurposes of this notice requirement. I would expect the Commission to \npromulgate rules pursuant to this provision that will ensure that this \nnotice requirement is not unnecessarily burdensome, especially for \nsection 3(c)(1) pools that have shareholders that are themselves \nsection 3(c)(1) pools, investment companies, or other institutional \nshareholders. The notice requirement was intended to ensure that direct \nshareholders of section 3(c)(1) pools seeking to convert to qualified \npurchaser pool status would be notified of the imminent change in their \ninvestment. The notice requirement was not intended to cause a section \n3(c)(1) pool seeking to convert to qualified purchaser pool status to \nhave to provide notice of the impending change to the underlying \nshareholders of the converting pool's institutional shareholders, such \nas shareholders that are section 3(c)(1) pools, investment companies, \nor other companies, so long as those institutional shareholders are not \nunder common control or controlled by the converting pool. The purpose \nof this notice is to ensure that the investor in the converting pool is \naware of the imminent change in the nature of the pool so that the \ninvestor may choose whether to divest from the pool or not. Thus, \nnotice to the person making the investment decisions for an \ninstitutional shareholder should suffice to carry out this \ncongressional intent. In the event the institutional shareholders of a \nconverting section 3(c)(1) pool are under common control or controlled \nby the converting pool, it might be appropriate to require the \nconverting fund to provide notice of its intent to the underlying \nshareholders. I would expect the Commission to act expediently to \npromulgate rules to implement this congressional intent with respect to \nthe notice requirement.\n  In addition, the Commission should act as soon as practicable to \npromulgate the rules defining ``investments'' under section 209 of the \nact in order to expedite the effective date of that section.\n\n\n                        SEC exemptive authority\n\n  This act grants the Securities and Exchange Commission the authority \nto issue exemptions from the provisions of the securities laws. We \nintend that the Commission use this exemptive authority responsibly and \nflexibly. We are certain that the Commission will not use the exemptive \nauthority to undermine the basic goals of the federal securities laws. \nHowever, in the past, Congress tied the hands of the Commission: for \nexample, it limited the Commission's ability to decide when a \nprospectus should be delivered. I expect that the Commission will use \nthe exemptive authority granted by this legislation to provide for \ngreater flexibility in the administration of the securities laws. The \nCommission has used its existing exemptive authority, such as its \nauthority under section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to \ndefine deceptive or manipulative conduct, to further the Federal \nsecurities laws by creating exemptions and safe harbors in order to \nmake the letter of the law consistent with the spirit of the law. \nSimilarly, in section 21A(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \nCongress granted the Commission authority to exempt, in whole or in \npart, either unconditionally or upon specific terms and conditions, any \nperson or transaction or class of persons or transactions from the \nprovisions allowing the Commission to seek certain civil penalties for \ninsider trading.\n  The exemptive provisions in this legislation are intended to expand \nsuch existing exemptive authority, so that the Commission will be able \nto create exemptions from any provision of the securities laws where \nthe Commission finds it appropriate to do so, consistent with this \nprovision. The Commission will have the ability to adapt rules to the \nneeds of all types of issuers, investors, and broker-dealers. The \nprovisions will afford the Commission the ability to tailor rules to \nnew technology, evolving products, and differing investor needs. We \nfurther intend that this exemptive authority will be used for the \nprotection of investors and the public, as well as to promote \nefficiency, competition, and capital formation.\n\n", "cleaned_text": "CONFERENCE REPORT ON H.R. 3005, NATIONAL SECURITIES MARKETS IMPROVEMENT \n                              ACT OF 1996\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               speech of\n\n                       HON.

Mr. Speaker, in connection with the historic passage in the House of Representatives and the Senate of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, I offer the following remarks to clarify the congressional intent underlying certain provisions in the act.\n\n\n         preemption of state authority over securities issuers\n\n\tSection 102 of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 eliminates State regulation of securities offerings by a variety of securities issuers, while preserving State authority to police against fraud and to require notice filings and fees. The legislation's express preservation of State authority to require securities issuers to file documents with the States for notice purposes only is intended to allow States access to information that is routinely filed with the Commission and is not intended to extend to documents that are not filed with the Commission. This would not, however, preclude a State that, consistent with the legislation, has legitimate cause to commence an investigation pursuant to its antifraud authority from requesting such documents as it might be entitled to pursuant to such authority.\n\tThe preemption effected by section 102 also extends to securities that are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market. This preemption is intended to apply to securities that are nationally traded and list or have been authorized for listing on any of these three markets. In the past, disparate regulatory treatment of these markets by State laws has unnecessarily hindered the competition that improves the markets for investors. This legislation is designed to provide a level playing field for those markets by eliminating duplicative or unnecessary State regulation equally for securities that are listed or authorized for listing on any of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, or the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market.\n[[Page E1929]]\nFurthermore, the preemption effected by the act applies to a security that is a ``covered security'' or will be a ``covered security'' upon completion of the transaction. Thus, for example, the preemption effected by section 102 applies to initial public offerings that are authorized for listing on the National Market System of the Nasdaq Stock Market and are sold in advance of the effective date of their registration statements.\n\tGenerally, States regulate securities offerings through laws administered by State securities administrators or, in certain cases, State insurance regulators. The preemption provided in section 102 of the act applies to any State authority, whether a securities administrator or an insurance regulator.\n\n\n        Exceptions from the definition of ``investment company''\n\n\tSection 209 of the act provides a new exception from the Investment Company Act for investment pools that sell their shares only to ``qualified purchasers''--qualified purchaser pools. This section provides a grandfather provision enabling private investment companies that qualify for the exception from the definition of ``investment company'' in section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act--``Section 3(c)(1) pools''--to qualify under the qualified purchaser pool provision notwithstanding that such a section 3(c)(1) pool might have investors that are not ``qualified purchasers'' under the provision, so long as the pool complies with certain requirements, including providing notice to its beneficial owners of its intent to use the qualified purchaser pool exception.\n\tSection 209 includes a requirement that the Securities and Exchange Commission prescribe rules defining the term ``beneficial owner'' for purposes of this notice requirement. I would expect the Commission to promulgate rules pursuant to this provision that will ensure that this notice requirement is not unnecessarily burdensome, especially for section 3(c)(1) pools that have shareholders that are themselves section 3(c)(1) pools, investment companies, or other institutional shareholders. The notice requirement was intended to ensure that direct shareholders of section 3(c)(1) pools seeking to convert to qualified purchaser pool status would be notified of the imminent change in their investment. The notice requirement was not intended to cause a section 3(c)(1) pool seeking to convert to qualified purchaser pool status to have to provide notice of the impending change to the underlying shareholders of the converting pool's institutional shareholders, such as shareholders that are section 3(c)(1) pools, investment companies, or other companies, so long as those institutional shareholders are not under common control or controlled by the converting pool.

Thus, notice to the person making the investment decisions for an institutional shareholder should suffice to carry out this congressional intent.

Is there objection to the original request \nof the gentleman from New York?\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. Speaker, I yield \nto the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] to further explain the \nbill.\n  (Mr. SOLOMON asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the gentlewoman and I \nwill say one more time, this will be the\n\n[[Page H12276]]\n\nlast day that she will participate in a session on this floor. She has \nbeen here longer than I have and she is certainly one of the most \noutstanding and respected Members of this body, even though we have had \nour differences over the years. But we wish her well in her new \nendeavors, she and her family.\n  Mr. Speaker, the amendments made in the Senate are reasonable and \nthey do strengthen the bill. I readily accept the amendments and urge \nHouse approval of the amended bill.\n  In response to the growing use of date rape drugs and the use of \nother drugs in violent sex crimes against women, this bill before us \ntoday increases the penalty for anyone who possesses a drug with the \nintent to commit a crime of violence, including sexual battery. The \nbill comes not a moment too soon. Recently in the San Francisco \nChronicle they reported how a 17-year-old young woman who played \nvarsity volleyball died after someone slipped a date rape drug into her \ndrink.\n  The additional penalties in this bill will fight crimes just like \nthis one. It will for the first time ever make using a drug to commit \nthe crime of rape as a weapon a minimum sentence felony.

Recently, the San Francisco \nChronicle reported how a 17-year-old young woman who played varsity \nvolleyball died after someone slipped a date rape drug into her drink. \nThe additional penalties in this bill will fight crimes just like this \none.\n  This is a commonsense, tough response by Congress to protect the \nsafety of our young people.\n  Now that Congress has responded to the issue of the date rape drug, \nit is up to the President to make this important public safety \nlegislation into law.\n  I include the following for the Record:\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Sept. 11, 1996]\n\n               Date Rape Drug Linked to Mysterious Death\n\n       La Porte, TX.--A high school student who died mysteriously \n     last month was killed by an illegal ``date rape drug'' that \n     was slipped into her soft drink, police said.\n       Hillory Farias, 17, a varsity volleyball player, was found \n     unconscious and not breathing the morning of August 4 after a \n     night out with girlfriends.\n       Authorities at first were puzzled by her death because \n     tests showed no drugs or alcohol in her body; but they ruled \n     the death a homicide Monday after finding gamma y-\n     hydroxybutyrate, also known as GHB, which--like the better-\n     known date-rape drug Rohypnol--is odorless and almost \n     tasteless.\n       Date rape drugs, which cause dizziness, drowsiness and \n     memory loss, sometimes are used to incapacitate women so they \n     can more easily be sexually assaulted.\n\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER.

Is there objection to the original request \nof the gentleman from New York?\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. Speaker, I would \nlike to ask the gentleman from New York a question.\n  I would like to ask the gentleman, am I correct that this bill does \nnot authorize an agency to require a party to submit to binding \narbitration as a condition of employment or to require a party to \nrelinquish rights that they have under title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964?\n  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. I yield to the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentlewoman, it is my \nunderstanding that she is correct, that H.R. 4194 does not change \ncurrent law at this point at all.\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. I thank the gentleman for his response. Based upon \nthat, I will not object. I thank the gentleman for bringing this up.\n  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4194, the \nAdministrative Dispute Resolution Act, as amended by the other body. I \nwould like to focus my remarks on section 12 of this bill, which was \nadded by the Senate and concerns the so-called Scanwell jurisdiction. \nThis section will be a great benefit to small businesses in New York, \nand across the Nation.\n  The conference report on H.R. 2977, the Administrative Dispute \nResolution Act, which was on the suspension calendar for floor action \nSeptember 27, 1996, was pulled at the last minute--to the benefit of \nall our constituents. Provisions in that measure would have eliminated \nFederal district court jurisdiction for bid protests of Government \ncontracts, leaving only two other possible forums, both located in \nWashington, DC.\n  Federal district court jurisdiction, commonly known as Scanwell \njurisdiction, has been an important safeguard to our constituents back \nhome, ensuring that they have a local forum to appeal decisions on \nGovernment contracts. Eliminating Scanwell would have put burdens on \nour businesses, both large and small, to litigate their claims long-\ndistance. This provision was included in the bill, although no hearings \non this subject were held in the House. A compromise was later reached \nthat creates equal forums in the Federal district courts and in the \nCourt of Federal Claims--and requires both courts to use the \nAdministrative Procedure Act as the standard of review. The procedure \nwill be in effect for 4 years.\n  This makes sense. It gives our constituents the benefit of either \nforum for a full evidentiary hearing and allows a practical test of \nwhether both forums are needed. Such common sense approaches are just \ngood Government. This provision will enable actual experience over the \nnext 4 years and a GAO study, after 2 years to provide the data \nnecessary for Congress to make an informed decision regarding something \nas important as how far the courthouse door will be from home. I am \ncertain that we would not allow the post offices to be closed in our \ntowns and cities, so why should we close the Federal district \ncourthouse door for claims concerning the $200 billion spent annually \nby the Government for goods and services. This bill protects our \nconstituents, and I am happy that these good provisions will not be \nlost.\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request \nof the gentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "ADMINISTRATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION ACT OF 1996\n\n\tMr. SOLOMON.

The savings provisions in \n     subsection (e) shall apply if the bid protest jurisdiction of \n     the district courts of the United States terminates under \n     this subsection.\n       (e) Savings Provisions.--\n       (1) Orders.--A termination under subsection (d) shall not \n     terminate the effectiveness of orders that have been issued \n     by a court in connection with an action within the \n     jurisdiction of that court on or before December 31, 2000. \n     Such orders shall continue in effect according to their \n     terms until modified, terminated, superseded, set aside, \n     or revoked by a court of competent jurisdiction or by \n     operation of law.\n       (2) Proceedings and applications.--(A) a termination under \n     subsection (d) shall not affect the jurisdiction of a court \n     of the United States to continue with any proceeding that is \n     pending before the court on December 31, 2000.\n       (B) Orders may be issued in any such proceeding, appeals \n     may be taken therefrom, and payments may be made pursuant to \n     such orders, as if such termination had not occurred. An \n     order issued in any such proceeding shall continue in effect \n     until modified, terminated, superseded, set aside, or revoked \n     by a court of competent jurisdiction or by operation of law.\n       (C) Nothing in this paragraph prohibits the discontinuance \n     or modification of any such proceeding under the same terms \n     and conditions and to the same extent that proceeding could \n     have been discontinued or modified absent such termination.\n       (f) Nonexclusivity of GAO Remedies.--In the event that the \n     bid protest jurisdiction of the district courts of the United \n     States is terminated pursuant to subsection (d), then section \n     3556 of title 31, United States Code, shall be amended by \n     striking ``a court of the United States or'' in the first \n     sentence.\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (during the reading). Without objection, the Senate amendment is considered as read and printed in the Record.\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from New York?\n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. Reserving the right to object, Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the gentleman from New York a question.\n\tI would like to ask the gentleman, am I correct that this bill does not authorize an agency to require a party to submit to binding arbitration as a condition of employment or to require a party to relinquish rights that they have under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964?\n\tMr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, will the gentlewoman yield?\n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. I yield to the gentleman from New York.\n\tMr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I would say to the gentlewoman, it is my understanding that she is correct, that H.R. 4194 does not change current law at this point at all.\n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. I thank the gentleman for his response. Based upon that, I will not object. I thank the gentleman for bringing this up.\n\tMrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4194, the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, as amended by the other body. I would like to focus my remarks on section 12 of this bill, which was added by the Senate and concerns the so-called Scanwell jurisdiction. This section will be a great benefit to small businesses in New York, and across the Nation.\n\tThe conference report on H.R. 2977, the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act, which was on the suspension calendar for floor action September 27, 1996, was pulled at the last minute--to the benefit of all our constituents. Provisions in that measure would have eliminated Federal district court jurisdiction for bid protests of Government contracts, leaving only two other possible forums, both located in Washington, DC.\n\tFederal district court jurisdiction, commonly known as Scanwell jurisdiction, has been an important safeguard to our constituents back home, ensuring that they have a local forum to appeal decisions on Government contracts. Eliminating Scanwell would have put burdens on our businesses, both large and small, to litigate their claims long-distance. This provision was included in the bill, although no hearings on this subject were held in the House. A compromise was later reached that creates equal forums in the Federal district courts and in the Court of Federal Claims--and requires both courts to use the Administrative Procedure Act as the standard of review. The procedure will be in effect for 4 years.\n\tThis makes sense. It gives our constituents the benefit of either forum for a full evidentiary hearing and allows a practical test of whether both forums are needed. Such common sense approaches are just good Government. This provision will enable actual experience over the next 4 years and a GAO study, after 2 years to provide the data necessary for Congress to make an informed decision regarding something as important as how far the courthouse door will be from home. I am certain that we would not allow the post offices to be closed in our towns and cities, so why should we close the Federal district courthouse door for claims concerning the $200 billion spent annually by the Government for goods and services. This bill protects our constituents, and I am happy that these good provisions will not be lost.\n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the original request of the gentleman from New York?\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tA motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Gerald B.

CALVIN COOLIDGE MEMORIAL FOUNDATION GRANT.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Foundation.--The term ``Foundation'' means the Calvin \n     Coolidge Memorial Foundation.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Education.\n       (b) Grant Authorized.--The Secretary is authorized to made \n     a grant in the amount of $1,000,000 in accordance with the \n     provisions of this section to the Foundation.\n       (c) Grant Conditions.--\n       (1) Application.--No payment may be made under this section \n     except upon an application at such time, in such manner, and \n     containing or accompanied by such information as the \n     Secretary may require.\n       (2) Use of grant funds.--Funds received under this section \n     may be used for any of the following purposes:\n       (A) To increase the endowment of the Foundation.\n       (B) To conduct educational, archival, or preservation \n     activities of the Foundation.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary $1,000,000, without \n     fiscal year limitation, to carry out the provisions of this \n     section.\n       (e) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on \n     October 1, 1996.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. (during the reading). Without objection, the \nSenate amendments are considered as read and printed in the Record.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of \nthe gentleman from New Jersey?\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to ask my good friend and colleague from New Jersey to explain to \nme the provisions in this bill concerning abortion and what protections \nwe would have against, let us say, in China, for example, where there \nare forced abortions?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, \nthe language in this legislation that dealt with coercive abortion was \nstripped in the Senate. The issue was already covered by the CR, which \nhad an identical provision. We are concurring with the Senate in taking \nthat language out of the bill, so there is nothing in the bill on that \nsubject.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, continuing my reservation of objection, \nsome people were concerned that anyone who wanted to immigrate from \nChina would just get pregnant and come back over here.\n  The second thing is, what groups are protected by this act? I \nunderstand this gives certain immigration treatment to certain groups.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield \nfurther, the language of the bill extends to Russian Jews, \nevangelicals, and to some of the people in Southeast Asia a very basic \namount of protection for 1 year. As a matter of fact, this too mirrors \nexactly the human rights and refugee provisions in the CR, and because \nthis had broad bipartisan support, it was kept in.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, further reserving the right to object, \nI would ask the gentleman, is there a cap on this?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. No, there is not.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. How many people would be affected by this?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. It is unclear.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Is it possible we are talking about more than \n100,000 people?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. No, not at all. As a matter of fact, the \nannual cap negotiated between the administration and Congress is far \nless than 100,000 in its totality.\n  Mr. Speaker, this act consists of several human rights refugee and \neducation provisions. I am proud to sponsor this legislation along with \nHouse International Relations Committee Chairman Ben Gilman and Ranking \nDemocratic Member Lee Hamilton, as well as Tom Lantos, Howard Berman, \nHenry Hyde, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Bill Goodling. The administration \ndoes not oppose the legislation.\n  H.R. 4036 extends the authority of USIA to include Tibetan and \nBurmese exiles in its scholarship programs, and requires USIA to take \nappropriate steps to involve prodemocracy and human rights leaders in \nexchange programs with countries whose people do not fully enjoy \nfreedom and democracy. It also requires that the State Department's \nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices include reports on each \ncountry's votes on resolutions before the U.N. Human Rights Commission, \nas well as its treatment of refugees. The latter provision is designed \nto enhance efforts to persuade other countries in the Western \nHemisphere and elsewhere to accept their fair share of the world's \nrefugee population, rather than leaving the brunt of the burden on the \nUnited States and a few other nations.\n  The act extends for 1 year an extremely important policy relating to \nrefugees in certain high-risk categories, such as Jews and evangelical \nChristians from the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asians who have \nsuffered persecution for their wartime associations with the United \nStates.\n  Also, the act provides that the United States should not give foreign \nassistance, other than humanitarian assistance, to Mauritania unless \nthat country rigorously enforces its laws against human chattel \nslavery.\n  H.R. 4036 also authorizes the Secretary of Education to make grants \nfor the Pell Institute, the Bush Fellowships, the Muskie Foundation, \nand the Coolidge Memorial Foundation. A Pell amendment deleted section \n102, providing for reports on the Cuban Government's methods of \nenforcing its 1994 and 1995 immigration agreements with the United \nStates.\n  The administration opposed an earlier version of this provision on \nthe ground that it already provides such reports. We are agreeing to \ndrop this provision only because we have been assured that these \nreports will continue to be provided. Originally, the agreement \nnegotiated with the Senate was that a reference to the Cuba human \nrights reports would be placed in report language rather than in the \ntext of the bill itself. Because the procedure under which this law is \nenacted does not provide for committee reports, it is important to \nplace in the Record the continued expectation of the Subcommittee on \nInternational Operations and Human Rights that our Government will \ncontinue to monitor and report to Congress on the treatment of people \nagainst whom the Castro regime enforces these two agreements. The \nreports are an important manifestation of congressional concern about \nthe human rights of persons against whom enforcement measures are \ntaken.\n  I would like to extend my deep gratitude to Senator Helms and his \nstaff, who shepherded this important human rights bill through the \nSenate. In particular, Chief Counsel Tom Kleine of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee has demonstrated his willingness and ability to \nwork effectively with people representing a wide range of viewpoints in \norder to ensure that our law reflects the right answers to important \nquestions of public policy. Senator Lott and Senator Nickles and their \nrespective staffs have also been extremely helpful. I also thank the \nDemocratic staff of the Foreign Relations Committee for working with us \non this bipartisan effort.\n  Mr. BALDACCI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4036. \nIncluded in this legislation are provisions to create the Edmund S. \nMuskie Foundation. We were all deeply saddened earlier this year when \nSenator Muskie passed away. This legislation provides a worthy tribute \nto one of the Nation's greatest statesmen and legislators.\n  As part of its work, the Muskie Foundation will make environmental \nstewardship awards. Senator Muskie played a crucial role in the \ndrafting and adoption of every major piece of environmental legislation \nthat was signed into law during his tenure in the Senate. He was one of \nthe first to recognize the tremendous harm that humans were doing to \ntheir environment. He educated his colleagues in the Congress, as well \nas the American people, and helped them to understand that we needed to \nchange our ways. The result of his efforts was landmark legislation to \nclean up our Nation's air and water. The Muskie Foundation's \nenvironmental stewardship awards will help to ensure that Senator \nMuskie's legacy will live on.\n\n[[Page H12283]]\n\n  The Muskie Foundation will also assist the Muskie Archives at Bates \nCollege in Lewiston, ME, to ensure that future generations will have \naccess to Senator Muskie's papers. The foundation will work with the \nMuskie Institute for Public Policy at the University of Southern Maine \nto promote the study of policy development. And the foundation will \nengage in other programs and activities in which Senator Muskie had an \nabiding interest.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a freshman Member of Congress from the State of \nMaine, I was privileged to be able to turn to Senator Muskie for \nencouragement and advice. He was a mentor to me, and to countless \nothers of my generation. I am pleased that we are honoring him today, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of \nthe gentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED HUMAN RIGHTS, \n                  REFUGEE, AND OTHER FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n\tMr. SMITH of New Jersey.

Without objection, the \nSenate amendments are considered as read and printed in the Record.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of \nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania?\n\n[[Page H12286]]\n\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to ask the distinguished chairman several questions about this \nbill.\n  Mr. Speaker, my understanding is this is to parallel the \nCongressional Accountability Act, and I know that the House has decided \nnot to allow unions for legislative employees. What are we doing in \nthis bill then vis-a-vis executive branch employees?\n  Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman will yield, my \nunderstanding is this bill tracks the Congressional Accountability Act. \nI am advised there is no provision in this bill with regard to union \nrepresentation.\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I \nthank the gentleman for that. The second question I have is about the \ninspector general. There were folks saying that the inspector general \nin the White House is given more authority than the inspector general \nhas under the congressional accountability laws.\n  Mr. CLINGER. If the gentlewoman would yield further, I would advise \nthe gentlewoman that the provision with regard to inspector general, as \nwell as the provision with regard to chief financial officer which were \nincluded in the House-passed version of the bill, were stricken by the \nSenate and are not included in this unanimous-consent request.\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. I see. So basically this is as close a mirror to what \nthe Congressional Accountability Act was, and the areas that we have \nblocked by just not implementing them, would the White House be allowed \nto do the same?\n  Mr. CLINGER. I am sorry, would the gentlewoman repeat the question?\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. As the gentleman knows, there have been parts of the \nCongressional Accountability Act that we have not implemented fully \nhere. Would the White House be allowed that same leeway, to not \nimplement in the areas where the House is not implementing?\n  Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman would yield further, as \nI would suggest to the gentlewoman, I think since the act is designed \nto track the congressional version, obviously if portions of it have \nnot been implemented in the House, they would be deferred in the \nexecutive branch as well.\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I \nthank the gentleman. I am one of the people who really thinks both \nshould be fully under the laws we pass for other people, but in my \nentire 24 years here we tend to pass it and then exempt all sorts of \nthings. I want to be sure that we have not done that vis-a-vis \nourselves, but turned around and done it to the executive branch. I \nthink we ought to be treating both the same. I think we both ought to \nget rid of all roadblocks and be under the laws that everybody else is \nunder. What the gentleman is assuring me is that his intent is to treat \nthe executive branch exactly the same way he has treated us through \nthis House.\n  Mr. CLINGER. If the gentlewoman would yield further, precisely the \nsame way as we are dealt with here in the House.\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of \nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I think \nthe veterans preference that was passed under the Mica bill is not in \nthis bill we are considering now.\n  Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, the gentleman \nis correct. It is not included in this measure.\n  Mr. MONTGOMERY. The Senate did drop the provisions on the veterans \nprovision.\n  Mr. CLINGER. The gentleman is correct.\n  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3452, the \nPresidential and Executive Office Accountability Act, as amended by the \nother body. The basic principle behind this legislation is that the \nFederal Government should be subject to the same laws and regulations \nas the private sector. Congress has already passed the Congressional \nAccountability Act, and there is no good reason why the Executive \nOffice of the President should not also be subject to the same laws as \nCongress and the private sector.\n  The other body has improved this bill by deleting two controversial \nprovisions from the House-passed version--one called for a compliance \nboard and the other for establishing an inspector general in the White \nHouse. The compliance board would have been unnecessary and overly \nbureaucratic, as White House employees already have recourse to the \nMerit Systems Protection Board. The provision establishing an inspector \ngeneral in the White House was, in my view, costly, unnecessary, and of \ndubious constitutionality. I am glad that we will have an opportunity \nfor full and open debate on this issue in the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3452 is a good bill, and I want to thank \nRepresentative Horn and Chairman Clinger for their willingness to work \nwith the minority as it made its way through the legislative process.\n  Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n  Mr. SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of \nthe gentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "PRESIDENTIAL AND EXECUTIVE OFFICE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n\tMr. CLINGER.

Without objection, the Senate amendments are considered as read and printed in the Record.\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania? \n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I would like to ask the distinguished chairman several questions about this bill.\n\tMr. Speaker, my understanding is this is to parallel the Congressional Accountability Act, and I know that the House has decided not to allow unions for legislative employees. What are we doing in this bill then vis-a-vis executive branch employees?\n\tMr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman will yield, my understanding is this bill tracks the Congressional Accountability Act. I am advised there is no provision in this bill with regard to union representation.\n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I thank the gentleman for that. The second question I have is about the inspector general. There were folks saying that the inspector general in the White House is given more authority than the inspector general has under the congressional accountability laws.\n\tMr. CLINGER. If the gentlewoman would yield further, I would advise the gentlewoman that the provision with regard to inspector general, as well as the provision with regard to chief financial officer which were included in the House-passed version of the bill, were stricken by the Senate and are not included in this unanimous-consent request.\n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. I see. So basically this is as close a mirror to what the Congressional Accountability Act was, and the areas that we have blocked by just not implementing them, would the White House be allowed to do the same?\n\tMr. CLINGER. I am sorry, would the gentlewoman repeat the question?\n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. As the gentleman knows, there have been parts of the Congressional Accountability Act that we have not implemented fully here. Would the White House be allowed that same leeway, to not implement in the areas where the House is not implementing?\n\tMr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman would yield further, as I would suggest to the gentlewoman, I think since the act is designed to track the congressional version, obviously if portions of it have not been implemented in the House, they would be deferred in the executive branch as well.\n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I thank the gentleman. I am one of the people who really thinks both should be fully under the laws we pass for other people, but in my entire 24 years here we tend to pass it and then exempt all sorts of things. I want to be sure that we have not done that vis-a-vis ourselves, but turned around and done it to the executive branch. I think we ought to be treating both the same. I think we both ought to get rid of all roadblocks and be under the laws that everybody else is under. What the gentleman is assuring me is that his intent is to treat the executive branch exactly the same way he has treated us through this House.\n\tMr. CLINGER. If the gentlewoman would yield further, precisely the same way as we are dealt with here in the House.\n\tMrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania?\n\tMr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I think the veterans preference that was passed under the Mica bill is not in this bill we are considering now.\n\tMr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, the gentleman is correct. It is not included in this measure.\n\tMr. MONTGOMERY. The Senate did drop the provisions on the veterans provision.\n\tMr. CLINGER. The gentleman is correct.\n\tMrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3452, the Presidential and Executive Office Accountability Act, as amended by the other body. The basic principle behind this legislation is that the Federal Government should be subject to the same laws and regulations as the private sector. Congress has already passed the Congressional Accountability Act, and there is no good reason why the Executive Office of the President should not also be subject to the same laws as Congress and the private sector.\n\tThe other body has improved this bill by deleting two controversial provisions from the House-passed version--one called for a compliance board and the other for establishing an inspector general in the White House. The compliance board would have been unnecessary and overly bureaucratic, as White House employees already have recourse to the Merit Systems Protection Board. The provision establishing an inspector general in the White House was, in my view, costly, unnecessary, and of dubious constitutionality. I am glad that we will have an opportunity for full and open debate on this issue in the future.\n\tMr. Speaker, H.R. 3452 is a good bill, and I want to thank Representative Horn and Chairman Clinger for their willingness to work with the minority as it made its way through the legislative process.\n\tMr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n\tMr. SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of the gentleman from Pennsylvania?\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tA motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["William F.

STUDY.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall by June 1, \n     1997 complete a study of the feasibility of a circulating \n     commemorative coin program to commemorate each of the 50 \n     States. The study shall assess likely public acceptance of \n     and consumer demand for different coins that might be issued \n     in connection with such a program (taking into consideration \n     the pace of issuance of coins and the length of such a \n     program), a comparison of the costs of producing coins issued \n     under the program and the revenue that the program would \n     generate, the impact on coin distribution systems, the \n     advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to \n     selecting designs for coins in such a program, and such other \n     factors as the Secretary considers appropriate in deciding \n     upon the feasibility of such a program. No steps taken in \n     order to gather information for this study shall be \n     considered a collection of information within the meaning of \n     section 3502 of title 44, United States Code.\n       (b) Report.--The Secretary shall submit the study required \n     in subsection (a) above, to the Committee on Banking and \n     Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs of the \n     Senate, simultaneously on its receipt by the Secretary.\n       (c) 50-State Commemorative Coin Program.--The Secretary \n     shall determine by August 1, 1997 whether the results of the \n     study authorized by subsection (a) justify such a program. If \n     the Secretary determines that such a program is justified, \n     then he shall by January 1, 1999, notwithstanding the fourth \n     sentence of subsection (d)(1) and subsection (d)(2) of \n     section 5112, title 31, United States Code, commence a \n     commemorative coin program consisting of the minting and \n     issuance of quarter dollar coins bearing designs, selected in \n     accordance with paragraph (4) of this subsection, which are \n     emblematic of the 50 States. If the Secretary determines that \n     such a commemorative coin program is justified but that it is \n     not practicable to commence the program by January 1, 1999, \n     then he shall notify the Committee on Banking and Financial \n     Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate of such \n     impracticability and of the date on which the program will \n     commence.\n       (1) Design.--The design for each quarter dollar issued \n     under the program shall be emblematic of 1 of the 50 States. \n     The designs for quarter dollar coins issued during each year \n     of the program shall be emblematic of States which have not \n     previously been commemorated under the program.\n       (2) Order of issuance.--Each State will be honored by a \n     coin in the order of that State's admission to the United \n     States.\n       (3) Number of coins.--Of the quarter dollar coins issued \n     during each year of the program, the Secretary shall \n     prescribe, on the basis of such factors as the Secretary \n     determines to be appropriate, the number of quarter dollar \n     coins which shall be issued with each of the designs selected \n     for such year.\n       (4) Selection of design.--Each of the 50 designs required \n     for quarter dollars issued under the program shall be--\n       (A) selected pursuant to a process, decided upon by the \n     Secretary, on the basis of the study conducted pursuant to \n     subsection (a), which process shall involve, among other \n     things, consultation with appropriate officials of the State \n     being commemorated with such design; and\n       (B) reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory \n     Committee and the Commission of Fine Arts.\n       (5) Treatment as numismatic items.--For purposes of \n     sections 5134 and 5136 of title 31, United States Code, all \n     coins minted under this section shall be considered to be \n     numismatic items.\n       (6) Numismatic items.--\n       (A) Quality of coins.--The Secretary may mint and issue \n     such number of quarter dollars of each design selected under \n     paragraph (4) of this subsection in uncirculated and proof \n     qualities as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.\n       (B) Silver coins.--Notwithstanding the provisions of \n     subsection 5112(b) of title 31, United States Code, the \n     Secretary may mint and issue such number of quarter dollars \n     of each design selected under paragraph (4) of this \n     subsection as the Secretary determines to be appropriate with \n     a content of 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper.\n       (C) Sources of bullion.--The Secretary may obtain silver \n     for minting coins under paragraph (6)(B) from stockpiles \n     established under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock \n     Piling Act.\n       (d) Funding.--Funds used to complete this study shall be \n     offset from funds from the Department of the Treasury.\n\n[[Page H12289]]\n\n     SEC. 303. FIXED TERMS FOR MEMBERS OF THE CITIZENS \n                   COMMEMORATIVE COIN ADVISORY COMMITTEE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5135(a)(4) of title 31, United \n     States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(4) Terms.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Each individual appointed to the \n     Advisory Committee under clause (i) or (iii) of paragraph \n     (3)(A) shall be appointed for a term of 4 years.\n       ``(B) Interim appointments.--Any member appointed to fill a \n     vacancy occurring before the expiration of the term for which \n     such member's predecessor was appointed shall be appointed \n     only for the remainder of such term.\n       ``(C) Continuation of service.--Each member appointed under \n     clause (i) or (iii) of paragraph (3)(A) may continue to serve \n     after the expiration of the term to which such member was \n     appointed until a successor has been appointed and \n     qualified.''.\n       (b) Staggered Terms.--Of the members appointed to the \n     Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee under clause \n     (i) or (iii) of section 5135(a)(3)(A) of title 31, United \n     States Code, who are serving on the Advisory Committee as of \n     the date of the enactment of this Act--\n       (1) 1 member appointed under clause (i) and 1 member \n     appointed under clause (iii), as designated by the Secretary, \n     shall be deemed to have been appointed to a term which ends \n     on December 31, 1997;\n       (2) 1 member appointed under clause (i) and 1 member \n     appointed under clause (iii), as designated by the Secretary, \n     shall be deemed to have been appointed to a term which ends \n     on December 31, 1998; and\n       (3) 1 member appointed under clause (i) and 1 member \n     appointed under clause (iii), as designated by the Secretary, \n     shall be deemed to have been appointed to a term which ends \n     on December 31, 1999.\n       (c) Status of Members.--The members appointed to the \n     Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee under clause \n     (i) or (iii) of section 5135(a)(3)(A) of title 31, United \n     States Code, shall not be treated as special Government \n     employees.\n\n     SEC. 304. MINT MANAGERIAL STAFFING REFORM.\n\n       Section 5131 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (c); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (c).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (during the reading). Without objection, the \nSenate amendments are considered as read and printed in the Record.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1776, an omnibus \ncommemorative coin act that has been negotiated with the Senate. This \nbill contains seven surcharged commemorative coin programs and the \npromise of a new circulating program. For the first time, the taxpayer \nand the Mint will be insulated from any failure of these programs to \nsell their authorized mintage amounts. That is because the protections \nfrom our earlier reform legislation H.R. 2614, have been signed into \nlaw earlier this week.\n  The beneficiaries of the respective coins are as follows--for 1997: \nthe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, 100,000 $5 gold coins \nauthorized, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \n500,000 silver dollars authorized, and the Jackie Robinson Foundation, \n100,000 $5 gold coins authorized and 200,000 silver dollars authorized. \nIn 1999, Yellowstone National Park is scheduled to be commemorated, \nwith 500,000 silver $1 coins authorized.\n  In addition, we are moving toward the first circulating commemorative \ncoin program since the bicentennial quarter. Providing a Treasury \nfeasibility study is positive, the program will honor the 50 States of \nthe United States of America by producing a series of circulating \nquarter dollar coins that commemorate each State in the order that they \nentered the Union.\n  The bill also provides coins for the three programs that observed \nHouse Banking Committee rules and proceeded through the difficult \nprocess of obtaining two thirds co-sponsorship, through hearings, mark-\nup and passage through this House in regular order. They are: The Black \nRevolutionary War Patriots Memorial for 1998, 500,000 silver dollars, \nthe Dolley Madison coin for the benefit of Montpelier in 1999, 500,000 \nsilver dollars, and the George Washington coin to benefit Mount Vernon \nalso in 1999, 100,000 gold $5 pieces.\n  This bill protects the taxpayer from the abuses common to many \nearlier coin programs and still benefits these most worthy causes.\n  I urge its immediate adoption.\n  Mr. FRANKS of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the \nSenate amendments to H.R. 1776. Included in them is a bill I introduced \nwith Congressman Floyd Flake which would commemorate the 50th \nanniversary of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color barrier in major \nleague baseball. Our bill, entitled the ``Jackie Robinson Commemorative \nCoin Act'' (H.R. 4148) currently has 158 cosponsors.\n  Our bill would authorize the minting of $1 coins to commemorate this \nimportant event in American history. Sales of the coin would benefit \nthe Jackie Robinson Foundation, which provides college scholarships to \nhundreds of underprivileged students. An important feature of this bill \nis that it requires the Treasury Department to recover its full costs \nbefore any funds go to the Foundation.\n  Jackie Robinson was a great and courageous American. Many Americans \ntoday would be unable to comprehend the virulent racism Jackie Robinson \nexperienced when he became America's first African-American major \nleague baseball player.\n  It is truly amazing that any human being could have withstood the \nendless abuse and degrading racial epithets that were hurled at Jackie \nRobinson during the 1947 baseball season. Yet, he never let racial \nslurs get the best of him. Instead, Jackie Robinson conducted himself \nwith the utmost grace and dignity. On the field, he proved to his \ndetractors that the color of one's skin is irrelevant to one's athletic \nability.\n  In fact, he was such an incredible ballplayer that he won the Rookie \nof the Year award that year.\n  Mr. Speaker, Jackie Robinson was a talented hitter and fielder, but \nto many, his athletic prowess was most apparent as a base runner. he \nled the National League in stolen bases in 1947 and 1949. Perhaps his \nmost exciting play was stealing home. As any baseball fan knows, \nstealing home is one of the most difficult plays in baseball to \nexecute--yet it was Jackie Robinson's specialty.\n  I remember watching old newsreels of Brooklyn Dodger games and seeing \nJackie on third base, with a big lead, taunting the pitcher. Then he \nwould explode down the base path in a flash and slide into home before \nthe catcher could apply the tag. No play in baseball is more exciting \nto watch.\n  Of course, stealing home, like being the first black major league \nball player, take guts, supreme confidence, and a steely \ndetermination--qualities Jackie Robinson had both on and off the field.\n  Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1776, an omnibus \ncommemorative coin act that has been negotiated with the Senate. This \nbill contains seven surcharged coin programs that, as usual, benefit \nworthy causes. I still believe that there are too many coin programs \nbeing ordered to be minted in 1997 for them all to be successful. \nHowever, for the first time, the taxpayer and the mint will be \ninsulated from any failure of these programs to sell their authorized \nmintage amounts. That is because the protections from our reform \nlegislation H.R. 2614, have been signed into law earlier this week.\n  The beneficiaries of the respective coins are as follows--for 1997: \nthe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, 100,000 $5 gold coins \nauthorized, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \n500,000 silver dollars authorized, and the Jackie Robinson Foundation, \n100,000 $5 gold coins authorized and 200,000 silver dollars authorized. \nIn 1999 Yellowstone National Park will be commemorated, 500,000 silver \ncoins authorized. Under the Commemorative Coin Reform Act signed into \nlaw on September 30, 1996, only two programs per year are permitted. \nEarly in the 105th Congress we will address this conflict in a mutually \nagreeable fashion.\n  The bill also includes something for the collectors who support all \nof these programs by actually purchasing the resulting coins. Beginning \nafter 1999, mintages will be limited and as stated, only two programs \nper year will be permitted. In addition, we are moving toward the first \ncirculating commemorative coin program since the bicentennial quarter. \nProviding a Treasury feasibility study is positive, the program will \nhonor the 50 States of the United States of America by producing a \nseries of circulating quarter dollar coins that commemorate each State \nin the order that they entered the Union.\n  Each year, until every State has been honored, five unique designs, \neach representing an individual State, will be issued at intervals of \nabout 2 months. The completed set will represent the diverse history \nand culture of the States of the Union.\n  There will be no private surcharges added to the cost of these coins. \nNevertheless, the estimated earnings from the silver coins alone is \nover $100 million over the course of the program. This sum is scorable \nfor budgetary purposes.\n  The mint's production schedule is demand driven. Increased \nproduction, estimated for this circulating commemorative program at an \nadditional 50 percent over baseline projections, will produce \nanticipated earnings on the order of over $3 billion for the total \nprogram. By Congressional Budget Office scoring convention, these \nearnings are off-budget and thus are not available to be spent by \nCongress. Instead, they will be applied directly to replace borrowing \notherwise necessary to fund the national debt, saving taxpayers over $1 \nbillion in interest payments over the first 10 years of the program.\n  The bill also provides coins for the three programs that observed \nHouse Banking Committee rules and proceeded through the difficult \nprocess of obtaining two-thirds cosponsorship, through hearings, markup \nand passage through this House in regular order.\n\n[[Page H12290]]\n\nThey are: The Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial for 1998, \n500,000 silver dollars, the Dolley Madison coin for the benefit of \nMontpelier in 1999, 500,000 silver dollars, and the George Washington \ncoin to benefit Mount Vernon also in 1999, 100,000 gold $5 pieces.\n  Among its other virtues, this program will introduce a younger and \nmore diverse population to the fascinating hobby of coin collecting. \nThis bill will also protect the taxpayer from the abuses common to many \nearlier coin programs and still benefit a number of worthy causes.\n  I urge its immediate adoption.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of \nthe gentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "BLACK REVOLUTIONARY WAR PATRIOTS COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n\tMr. DAVIS.

MINT MANAGERIAL STAFFING REFORM.\n\n       Section 5131 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (c); and\n       (2) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (c).\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore (during the reading). Without objection, the Senate amendments are considered as read and printed in the Record.\n\tThere was no objection.\n\tMr. DAVIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1776, an omnibus commemorative coin act that has been negotiated with the Senate. This bill contains seven surcharged commemorative coin programs and the promise of a new circulating program. For the first time, the taxpayer and the Mint will be insulated from any failure of these programs to sell their authorized mintage amounts. That is because the protections from our earlier reform legislation H.R. 2614, have been signed into law earlier this week.\n\tThe beneficiaries of the respective coins are as follows--for 1997: the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, 100,000 $5 gold coins authorized, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 500,000 silver dollars authorized, and the Jackie Robinson Foundation, 100,000 $5 gold coins authorized and 200,000 silver dollars authorized. In 1999, Yellowstone National Park is scheduled to be commemorated, with 500,000 silver $1 coins authorized.\n\tIn addition, we are moving toward the first circulating commemorative coin program since the bicentennial quarter. Providing a Treasury feasibility study is positive, the program will honor the 50 States of the United States of America by producing a series of circulating quarter dollar coins that commemorate each State in the order that they entered the Union.\n\tThe bill also provides coins for the three programs that observed House Banking Committee rules and proceeded through the difficult process of obtaining two thirds co-sponsorship, through hearings, mark-up and passage through this House in regular order. They are: The Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial for 1998, 500,000 silver dollars, the Dolley Madison coin for the benefit of Montpelier in 1999, 500,000 silver dollars, and the George Washington coin to benefit Mount Vernon also in 1999, 100,000 gold $5 pieces.\n\tThis bill protects the taxpayer from the abuses common to many earlier coin programs and still benefits these most worthy causes.\n\tI urge its immediate adoption.\n\tMr. FRANKS of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Senate amendments to H.R. 1776. Included in them is a bill I introduced with Congressman Floyd Flake which would commemorate the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color barrier in major league baseball. Our bill, entitled the ``Jackie Robinson Commemorative Coin Act'' (H.R. 4148) currently has 158 cosponsors.\n\tOur bill would authorize the minting of $1 coins to commemorate this important event in American history. Sales of the coin would benefit the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which provides college scholarships to hundreds of underprivileged students. An important feature of this bill is that it requires the Treasury Department to recover its full costs before any funds go to the Foundation.\n\tJackie Robinson was a great and courageous American. Many Americans today would be unable to comprehend the virulent racism Jackie Robinson experienced when he became America's first African-American major league baseball player.\n\tIt is truly amazing that any human being could have withstood the endless abuse and degrading racial epithets that were hurled at Jackie Robinson during the 1947 baseball season. Yet, he never let racial slurs get the best of him. Instead, Jackie Robinson conducted himself with the utmost grace and dignity. On the field, he proved to his detractors that the color of one's skin is irrelevant to one's athletic ability.\n\tIn fact, he was such an incredible ballplayer that he won the Rookie of the Year award that year.\n\tMr. Speaker, Jackie Robinson was a talented hitter and fielder, but to many, his athletic prowess was most apparent as a base runner. he led the National League in stolen bases in 1947 and 1949. Perhaps his most exciting play was stealing home. As any baseball fan knows, stealing home is one of the most difficult plays in baseball to execute--yet it was Jackie Robinson's specialty.\n\tI remember watching old newsreels of Brooklyn Dodger games and seeing Jackie on third base, with a big lead, taunting the pitcher. Then he would explode down the base path in a flash and slide into home before the catcher could apply the tag. No play in baseball is more exciting to watch.\n\tOf course, stealing home, like being the first black major league ball player, take guts, supreme confidence, and a steely determination--qualities Jackie Robinson had both on and off the field.\n\tMr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1776, an omnibus commemorative coin act that has been negotiated with the Senate. This bill contains seven surcharged coin programs that, as usual, benefit worthy causes. I still believe that there are too many coin programs being ordered to be minted in 1997 for them all to be successful. However, for the first time, the taxpayer and the mint will be insulated from any failure of these programs to sell their authorized mintage amounts. That is because the protections from our reform legislation H.R. 2614, have been signed into law earlier this week.\n\tThe beneficiaries of the respective coins are as follows--for 1997: the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, 100,000 $5 gold coins authorized, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 500,000 silver dollars authorized, and the Jackie Robinson Foundation, 100,000 $5 gold coins authorized and 200,000 silver dollars authorized. In 1999 Yellowstone National Park will be commemorated, 500,000 silver coins authorized. Under the Commemorative Coin Reform Act signed into law on September 30, 1996, only two programs per year are permitted. Early in the 105th Congress we will address this conflict in a mutually agreeable fashion.\n\tThe bill also includes something for the collectors who support all of these programs by actually purchasing the resulting coins. Beginning after 1999, mintages will be limited and as stated, only two programs per year will be permitted. In addition, we are moving toward the first circulating commemorative coin program since the bicentennial quarter. Providing a Treasury feasibility study is positive, the program will honor the 50 States of the United States of America by producing a series of circulating quarter dollar coins that commemorate each State in the order that they entered the Union.\n\tEach year, until every State has been honored, five unique designs, each representing an individual State, will be issued at intervals of about 2 months. The completed set will represent the diverse history and culture of the States of the Union.\n\tThere will be no private surcharges added to the cost of these coins. Nevertheless, the estimated earnings from the silver coins alone is over $100 million over the course of the program. This sum is scorable for budgetary purposes.\n\tThe mint's production schedule is demand driven. Increased production, estimated for this circulating commemorative program at an additional 50 percent over baseline projections, will produce anticipated earnings on the order of over $3 billion for the total program. By Congressional Budget Office scoring convention, these earnings are off-budget and thus are not available to be spent by Congress. Instead, they will be applied directly to replace borrowing otherwise necessary to fund the national debt, saving taxpayers over $1 billion in interest payments over the first 10 years of the program.\n\tThe bill also provides coins for the three programs that observed House Banking Committee rules and proceeded through the difficult process of obtaining two-thirds cosponsorship, through hearings, markup and passage through this House in regular order. They are: The Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial for 1998, 500,000 silver dollars, the Dolley Madison coin for the benefit of Montpelier in 1999, 500,000 silver dollars, and the George Washington coin to benefit Mount Vernon also in 1999, 100,000 gold $5 pieces.\n\tAmong its other virtues, this program will introduce a younger and more diverse population to the fascinating hobby of coin collecting. This bill will also protect the taxpayer from the abuses common to many earlier coin programs and still benefit a number of worthy causes.\n\tI urge its immediate adoption.\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support \nof the Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act of 1996, a bipartisan \nbill that I introduced in the House and Senator Bingaman introduced in \nthe Senate.\n  This bill authorizes the Department of Defense to sell excess \nmilitary aircraft to private contractors that provide fire fighting \nservices to the Federal Government.\n  The powerful wildfires that spread throughout the West this past year \nhave highlighted the need for an improved, modernized and expanded \nfleet of airtankers to help the U.S. Forest Service and the Department \nof Interior to fight wildfires.\n  The current fleet of World War II and Korean War vintage aircraft \nneeds to be replaced with modern, turbine powered aircraft that are \nmore efficient and safe.\n  The only reliable source of these aircraft is excess military \naircraft available from the Department of Defense that can be converted \nto deliver fire retardant.\n  This legislation would provide the authority to the Secretary of \nDefense to sell appropriate aircraft to qualified airtanker operators \nsolely for use in fighting wildfires.\n  In New Mexico, many communities were threatened by wildfires this \npast summer including the community of Lama. The wildfires were burning \non very steep slopes, with high fuel loads, strong wind gusts and \nunseasonably hot and dry weather.\n  For this reason, the firefighters need as much assistance as \npossible. By upgrading our airtanker fleets, we will have a better \nchance of protecting and saving our lives, property, and forests.\n  Because of the nearly 150,000 acres of forest and grasslands that \nwere burned when wildfires ravaged New Mexico, and the many more \nwildfires that burned throughout the West this past year, it is \nessential that we give firefighters the necessary tools that they need. \nThis bill provides the necessary equipment to assist firefighters.\n  I want to thank Senator Bingaman for all his hard work on this \nlegislation, and I also want to thank the Members on both sides of the \naisle who worked to pass this important piece of legislation.\n  Mrs. SCHROEDER.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the \nSpeaker's table the Senate bill (S. 2197) to extend the authorized \nperiod of stay within the United States for certain nurses, and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I am \nconcerned that we in fact are extending the stay in this country of \nprobably thousands of nurses who come from another country, at a time \nwhen we do not necessarily have a nursing shortage in America.\n  However, I am informed by one of my colleagues, who spent an enormous \namount of time and effort, from North Carolina, that in his area and in \nseveral areas of the United States they have a nursing shortage that \nwould be exacerbated tremendously if we did not pass this legislation.\n  My concern, and I do intend to withdraw my objection, is that these \nnurses are put on notice and those hospitals and nursing homes that are \nusing these services are put on notice that this is a one-time \nextension; that we are not granting these nurses that are in question \nin this legislation something that is going to be extended to them \nagain and again; and next year when this comes up, it is going to be \nmore difficult, because the time when they are legally supposed to \nleave this country will be all at the same day, because this bill \nsuggests that their visas are then going to expire, every one of these \nnurses will expire on the same day. But, for the record, I am stating \nthat we will make sure and we should ensure that is not the intent of \nthis legislation, to extend in perpetuity their right to stay in this \ncountry.\n  Again, I will be withdrawing my reservation, but with the \nunderstanding that we are not going to just do this every year, and \ntheir employers and the nurses are on notice that they should use this \ntime to start preparing themselves, No. 1, to go back to their home \ncountry, and, No. 2, to find Americans who can work as nurses in these \nareas in rural North Carolina, as well as in Chicago and elsewhere \nwhere there are, as I say, spot shortages of nurses.\n  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, the \ngentleman's statement certainly speaks to the point. The gentleman is \nabsolutely correct. That will be the legislative intent.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have become aware of an apparent \ntechnical error in two provisions of the Illegal Immigration Reform and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Title III of the act, based on \nthe House-passed version of H.R. 2202, includes a comprehensive reform \nof the procedures for apprehending, adjudicating, and removing illegal \naliens from the United States. Section 306 of title III overhauls the \nrules regarding judicial review from orders of removal. It was the \nclear intent of the conferees that, as a general matter, the full \npackage of changes made by this part of title III effect those cases \nfiled in court after the enactment of the new law, leaving cases \nalready pending before the courts to continue under existing law.\n  The conferees also intended, however, to accelerate the \nimplementation of certain of the reforms in title III. This intent is \nclearly spelled out in section 309 of the act. Specifically, section \n309(c)(4) calls for accelerated implementation of some of the reforms \nmade in section 306 regarding judicial review, but does not call for \nimmediate implementation of all of these reforms. This intent is \nmanifest not only in the plain language of section 309(c)(4), but also \nin the statement of managers accompanying the conference report on H.R. \n2202, at pages 222 and 223--Report No. 104-828.\n  Unfortunately, a cross-reference in section 309(c)(4) could be read \nto suggest that implementation of the transitional changes in judicial \nreview should be delayed until after title III's general effective \ndate. This error occurred through adoption of an effective date \nprovision from the Senate-passed version of H.R. 2202. In light of the \nspecific provisions of section 306(c), the reference in section \n309(c)(4) to cases ``described in paragraph (1)'' should not have been \nincluded in the conference report. In addition, there is a need to \nclarify the scope of section 306(c) to ensure that it does not conflict \nwith section 309(c)(4).\n  Section 2 of S. 2197 includes technical corrections to reflect this \nintent.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under a previous order of the House, the \ngentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher] is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H12298]]\n\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I just thought that it would be apropos \nfor us to take a look at what the accomplishments of this particular \nCongress and the changes in the world are bringing to the American \npeople. Today I hope that those people who are reading these remarks in \nthe Congressional Record and those people who are watching on C-SPAN \nrecognize that over the past 2 years we have indeed seen a revolution \nin Washington, DC.\n  The word ``revolution'' really means a turnaround. It means not \nnecessarily that great strides have taken place going in one direction \nor the other but, instead, that the direction has changed. Over these \nlast 2 years, we have changed the direction of Government in the United \nStates of America. I am very proud to have been part of Newt Gingrich's \nteam, the new team in the House of Representatives, and what we have \ndone to try to bring control to the uncontrolled increase in taxation \nand spending that threatened the very well-being of the American \npeople. We have also come to grips with other issues that in the past \nhave been unattended when the other party controlled the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  One of the issues that is of most concern to me, Mr. Speaker, and of \nmost concern to Californians is the flood of immigration, especially \nillegal immigration, that is flowing into California that is destroying \nsome of our basic institutions and our social infrastructure.\n  Today in California, many Americans who have spent their entire life \npaying their taxes, living honestly, trying to raise their family, \ntrying to be good citizens in their community, are finding that the \nsocial infrastructure that they have come to rely upon is being \ndestroyed because people from other countries are coming to our State \nillegally and flooding into the schools, into our hospitals, they are \ncrowding our jails and preventing the judicial system from functioning \nand the other social services systems from functioning as they were set \nup.\n  For the first time Congress has come to grips with this problem. I am \nvery proud that although the President of the United States, who \nclaimed that he was going to try to do everything he could to help us \nwith this flood of immigration, that the President of the United States \ninstead did everything he could to drag his feet and to prevent us from \npassing a meaningful immigration bill, but despite this, we were able \nto pass an immigration bill that turned the country around.\n  There is still very much to do, and next year we will accomplish more \non the issue of immigration reform. But we can be proud that instead of \naiming at policies that made the situation worse, we have now turned \nthis Government toward solving the problem and confronting the \nchallenge to the American people.\n  One area of concern to me, and I believe that our people should be \nalerted to this, is that this year this administration decided to speed \nup the process of naturalization of people who are in this country \nlegally. However, many of those people who have been sworn in and \nbecome citizens of the United States were people who entered the United \nStates illegally and were granted amnesty back in 1986. What we have \nhad in the last year is a speedup of the naturalization process so that \n1.3 million legal immigrants now have basically become citizens. That \nis three times the number that were normalized just 2 years ago.\n  Of that 1.3 million, this administration was in such a rush to grant \nthem citizenship that thousands upon thousands of individuals who \nshould have been screened out because they were convicted felons have \nbeen granted U.S. citizenship and turned loose among us.\n  This cannot be tolerated. I would hope that the American people note \nwho is trying to solve the problem and who is not trying to solve the \nproblem, who is trying to come to grips with the ever increasing load \nof taxation and spending that we have seen from Washington, who is \ntrying could to come to grips with this threat of a massive flood of \nillegal immigration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have served in this Congress, a Congress \nthat has at last come to grips with some of these problems and \nchallenges to our country's well-being.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "CONGRESSIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher] is recognized for 5 minutes. \n\tMr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I just thought that it would be apropos for us to take a look at what the accomplishments of this particular Congress and the changes in the world are bringing to the American people. Today I hope that those people who are reading these remarks in the Congressional Record and those people who are watching on C-SPAN recognize that over the past 2 years we have indeed seen a revolution in Washington, DC.\n\tThe word ``revolution'' really means a turnaround. It means not necessarily that great strides have taken place going in one direction or the other but, instead, that the direction has changed. Over these last 2 years, we have changed the direction of Government in the United States of America. I am very proud to have been part of Newt Gingrich's team, the new team in the House of Representatives, and what we have done to try to bring control to the uncontrolled increase in taxation and spending that threatened the very well-being of the American people. We have also come to grips with other issues that in the past have been unattended when the other party controlled the House of Representatives.\n\tOne of the issues that is of most concern to me, Mr. Speaker, and of most concern to Californians is the flood of immigration, especially illegal immigration, that is flowing into California that is destroying some of our basic institutions and our social infrastructure.\n\tToday in California, many Americans who have spent their entire life paying their taxes, living honestly, trying to raise their family, trying to be good citizens in their community, are finding that the social infrastructure that they have come to rely upon is being destroyed because people from other countries are coming to our State illegally and flooding into the schools, into our hospitals, they are crowding our jails and preventing the judicial system from functioning and the other social services systems from functioning as they were set up.\n\tFor the first time Congress has come to grips with this problem. I am very proud that although the President of the United States, who claimed that he was going to try to do everything he could to help us with this flood of immigration, that the President of the United States instead did everything he could to drag his feet and to prevent us from passing a meaningful immigration bill, but despite this, we were able to pass an immigration bill that turned the country around.\n\tThere is still very much to do, and next year we will accomplish more on the issue of immigration reform.

Under a previous order of the House, the \ngentleman from New York [Mr. Engel] is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to take this opportunity to comment \non a couple of things that have been said over the course of the past \nfew days. First of all, I want to comment on the ridiculous and \nintemperate remarks made by Governor Bush of Texas with regard to the \nYankees and Bronx, NY, which I am proud to represent.\n  When asked if he would be coming to Yankee Stadium to see the Yankees \nplay, he made a remark about if he came he would have to carry his gun. \nI think that that is a remark that ill behooves a Governor of a great \nState and, quite frankly, if Governor Bush had cared as much about \ntaking guns out of the hands of criminals and perhaps controlling, \nhaving some kind of gun control instead of signing legislation that \nallows people to carry concealed weapons, perhaps the streets would be \nsafer for all of us.\n  I would invite him to come to the Bronx, where crime has dropped \ntremendously; in fact, as the mayor of New York, who is a Republican, \nhas pointed out, that New York City has led the way. There has been a \nreduction in crime across the country. I think President Clinton \ndeserves credit, Congress deserves credit, and local officials deserve \ncredit. But New York City has led the way in the drop in crime, and so \nhas Bronx, NY. And so I just think that Governors ought to think about \nwhat they say before they go shooting their mouths off and making \nintemperate remarks.\n  I also wanted to comment on some of the remarks made by Senator Dole \nthe past couple of days where he has been very critical of President \nClinton's foreign policy. I want to say that I think that the \nPresident, certainly over the past couple of years, has shown great \nleadership in terms of foreign policy. One only needs to look around \nthe world.\n  One needs to look at Bosnia, where ethnic cleansing was going along \nuntil the United States stepped in firmly and stopped it. Has \neverything been a 100 percent success? Nothing is 100 percent success, \nbut we know under President Clinton's leadership we have ended most of \nthe killing in Bosnia and the United States has shown leadership and \nonly the United States can show that type of leadership.\n  In the Middle East, we saw the accords signed and we saw a potential \nunraveling of the peace accords in the\n\n[[Page H12299]]\n\nMiddle East. It took a great courage, in my opinion, for President \nClinton to have called Mr. Arafat and Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu \nand King Hussein to the White House to try to get calmer heads to \nprevail, to try to start a dialog, to try to ensure that the peace \nprocess is put back on track. That was done 5 weeks before his \nreelection. I think that took an inordinate amount of courage for him \nto do it.\n  As Prime Minister Netanyahu said, what else do you expect the \nPresident of the United States to do? He tried to bring the parties \ntogether. That is what he has done in terms of his leadership.\n  In Iraq, I was one of those Democrats that broke with my party and \nsupported President Bush on the Persian Gulf war. Frankly, if President \nBush's administration had done the job it was supposed to do, we would \nhave been rid of Saddam Hussein. Many of us could not understand why he \nwas allowed to stay in power after American triumphs in the Persian \nGulf war.\n  And so now I think it ill behooves Senator Dole and others to point \nfingers and criticize when, quite frankly, during those days leading up \nto the Persian Gulf war, when this House had the great courage and the \nSenate did as well to pass my resolution declaring Jerusalem the \nundivided capital of Israel, it was Senator Dole back in those days of \n1990 who criticized it, said he had been to Arab capitals and all the \nArab leaders wanted to talk about was this terrible resolution which \nshould not have been passed. One of the so-called Arab leaders that he \nspoke with in those days traveled to Baghdad and spoke with Saddam \nHussein and was very concerned about what Saddam Hussein thought.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  And then several months later we were battling him in the Persian \nGulf; so frankly I do not think that Bob Dole is in any kind of \nposition to criticize President Clinton in that regard.\n  Northern Ireland; we can go on and on. The President has tried very, \nvery hard to say that the United States needs to play a leadership \nrole, I think in world affairs. And again Senator Dole when he was here \nwas cutting back foreign aid, cutting back American involvement \noverseas.\n  I think we make a terrible mistake if we move back to the \nisolationist policies, as friends of my friends on the Republican side \nof the aisle seem to think, moving back 100 years ago. When communism \ncollapsed, suddenly many of my friends on the other side of the aisle \ndid not think the United States ought to play a role, a major role, in \nworld affairs. I think we need to be engaged if we are the leaders of \nthe world, the leaders of the free world and the leaders of the world \nas we are. Then with leadership comes responsibility. No one anointed \nus the leader of the world; we claim that mantle, and we ought to act \nthat way.\n  So I think we ought to be helping these countries, we ought to be \ndoing what we can. We cannot be the policemen of the world, but we need \nto pick and choose and show American determination and American \nleadership, and that is what this President has done, and that is why I \nsupport him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n", "cleaned_text": "FOREIGN POLICY\n\n\tThe SPEAKER pro tempore.

I think they think they are paying them to do something in an entirely different nonpartisan way.\n\tSo I hope these lines do not ever get blurred again. We have seen a tremendous blurring of them, and we have seen the Defense Department stonewalling and defending them and defending their right to do it. But as I leave here, I certainly hope somebody picks this up and we put this to bed.\n\n                          ____________________", "Speakers": ["Patricia Schroeder"], "Speaker Affiliation": "United States House of Representatives", "Speaker Role": "speaking", "citation": "142 Cong.
