                            VOTE EXPLANATION

  Mr. BIDEN: Mr. President, I arrived in Washington this morning after 
the vote to invoke cloture on the nomination of Julia Smith Gibbons, to 
be United States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit.
  It was my intention to be here in time to vote in favor of this 
cloture motion.
  Unfortunately, the catenary wire providing power for Amtrak was 
knocked down in Elkton, MD. This delayed the train on which I was 
traveling and regrettably prevented me from being present to vote.
