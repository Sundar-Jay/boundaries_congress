 SENATE RESOLUTION 309--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT BOSNIA 
AND HERZEGOVINA SHOULD BE CONGRATULATED ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS 
                    RECOGNITION BY THE UNITED STATES

  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. McCain, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted the 
following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign 
Relations:

                              S. Res. 309

       Whereas the United States reaffirms its support for the 
     sovereignty, legal continuity, and territorial integrity of 
     Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized 
     borders and also reaffirms its support for the equality of 
     the three constituent peoples and others in Bosnia and 
     Herzegovina in a united multiethnic country, according to the 
     General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and 
     Herzegovina;
       Whereas, during the 10 years since its recognition, Bosnia 
     and Herzegovina has made significant progress in overcoming 
     the legacy of the internecine conflict of 1992-1995 
     instigated by ultranationalist forces hostile to a 
     multiethnic society, and has persevered in building a 
     multiethnic democracy based on the rule of law, respect for 
     human rights, and a free market economy, as shown by the 
     results of the elections held in November 2000;
       Whereas most citizens and the national authorities of 
     Bosnia and Herzegovina share the democratic values of the 
     international community and feel the responsibility to uphold 
     them;
       Whereas the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is 
     committed to international security and democratic stability 
     and in that spirit has begun the process of qualifying for 
     membership in the Partnership for Peace; and
       Whereas, after the attacks of September 11, 2001 on the 
     United States, Bosnia and Herzegovina, as a reliable friend 
     of the United States, immediately positioned itself within 
     the anti-terrorism coalition of nations, sharing the common 
     interests and values of the free and democratic world: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) commends Bosnia and Herzegovina for the significant 
     progress it has made during the past decade on the 
     implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement and on the 
     implementation of the Constituent Peoples' Decision of the 
     Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina;
       (2) applauds the democratic orientation of Bosnia and 
     Herzegovina and urges the further strengthening by its 
     government and people of respect for human rights, of the 
     rule of law, and of its free market economy;
       (3) urges Bosnia and Herzegovina as rapidly as possible to 
     make fully operational all national institutions and state-
     level governmental bodies mandated by the Dayton Peace 
     Agreement;
       (4) welcomes and supports the aspiration of Bosnia and 
     Herzegovina to become a member of the Partnership for Peace 
     and, pursuant thereto, underscores the importance of creating 
     a joint military command as soon as possible;
       (5) urges the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to 
     accelerate the return of refugees and displaced persons and 
     to intensify its cooperation with the International Criminal 
     Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague, in 
     particular with regard to surrendering to the Court 
     individuals indicted for war crimes;
       (6) reaffirms the importance for the future of Bosnia and 
     Herzegovina of that country's participation in the European 
     integration process and, in that context, welcomes the 
     notable improvement in mutual cooperation among the successor 
     states of the former Yugoslavia and the strengthening of 
     cooperation within the region as a whole, developments which 
     are essential for long-lasting peace and stability in 
     Southeastern Europe; and
       (7) recognizes the important role of the Bosnian-
     Herzegovinian-American community in the further improving of 
     bilateral relations between the United States and Bosnia and 
     Herzegovina.
  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Resolution 
congratulating Bosnia and Herzegovina on the tenth anniversary of its 
recognition by the United States.
  During the decade since its recognition, Bosnia and Herzegovina has 
made significant progress in overcoming the legacy of the bloody 
conflict of 1992-95, which was instigated by ultra-nationalist forces 
and claimed more than two hundred thousand lives and made millions more 
homeless.
  The NATO-led peacekeeping force, known originally as IFOR, now as 
SFOR, has provided the security umbrella that has allowed the slow, 
difficult process of reconciliation and democracy-building to take 
place.
  The international community under the direction of a resident High 
Representative, the United Nations, the Organization for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe, the European Union, and many individual 
countries have joined the United States in providing and delivering 
economic and technical assistance to the citizens of Bosnia and 
Herzegovina.
  Last year for the first time democratic, non-nationalist parties 
gained control of the national and Federation governments, and the 
government of the Republika Srpska is considerably more democratic than 
it was under the infamous Radovan Karadzic.
  Elections will be held this coming October, which will determine 
whether the country will continue on a democratic, multi-ethnic, and 
free market path. Obviously, it is in the interest of the people of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats, and others, that it do 
so. Equally obviously, it is in the interest of the United States that 
Bosnia and Herzegovina become a normal, peaceful, democratic country.
  My Resolution commends Bosnia and Herzegovina for the progress it has 
made and urges it to take several steps to continue the process. They 
include: further strengthening of respect for human rights, of the rule 
of law, and of its free market economy; as rapidly as possible making 
fully operational all national institutions and state-level 
governmental bodies mandated by the Dayton Peace Agreement; creating a 
joint military command as soon as possible; accelerating the return of 
refugees and displaced persons; and intensifying its cooperation with 
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The 
Hague, in particular surrendering to the Court individuals indicted for 
war crimes.
  The stability of the Balkans is essential for European stability. And 
stability in Europe is of fundamental importance to the United States 
of America. A peaceful, democratic, multi-ethnic Bosnia and Herzegovina 
can be an important element in the new Balkans.
  I urge my colleagues to vote for this Resolution, which makes clear 
our support for just such a Bosnia and Herzegovina.
