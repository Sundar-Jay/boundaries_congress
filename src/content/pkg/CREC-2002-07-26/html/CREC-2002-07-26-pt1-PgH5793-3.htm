                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Daniel P. Coughlin, offered the following 
prayer:
  Created in Your image and likeness, Lord God, we are endowed with 
noble rights and held to certain responsibilities. As this 107th 
Congress engages in decision-making, which will affect this Nation and 
the world internationally, help all Members reflect Your image and 
respect Your likeness in others.
  Today we pray for all Americans with disabilities. Bless them with 
peace and strength. May their efforts to create independent lives for 
themselves be rewarded as they find their rightful place in the 
mainstream of American life.
  As their brothers and sisters, may all Americans prove to be helpful 
citizens to those with disabilities and seize every opportunity to 
protect their rights to access and enjoy their fullest potential in 
places of worship, of work and learning, as well as on the streets and 
the public places of this Nation.
  We are Yours, one people. We are Your people now and forever. Amen.
