               MEASURE PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 4965

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that H.R. 4965 is at 
the desk and due for its second reading.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. As in legislative session, the clerk will read 
the bill by title for the second time.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 4965) to prohibit the procedure commonly known 
     as partial-birth abortion.

  Mr. REID. I object to any further proceedings at this time.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection having been heard, the bill will 
be placed on the calendar.

                          ____________________
