        REVISED ALLOCATION TO SUBCOMMITTEES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003

  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Thursday, June 27, the Senate Committee 
on Appropriations, by a unanimous rollcall vote of 29 to 0, approved 
the allocation to subcommittees for fiscal year 2003.
  On Wednesday, July 24--just this past Wednesday--Congress adopted the 
conference report to accompany H.R. 4775, the fiscal year 2002 
supplemental appropriations bill.
  Today, I submit a revised allocation which has been modified, 
primarily, to conform outlays for each subcommittee with the outcome on 
the supplemental.
  These revised allocations were prepared in consultation with my 
colleague, Senator Stevens, the distinguished ranking member of the 
committee, who stands with me committee to presenting bills to the 
Senate consistent with the allocations.
  Furthermore, we stand committed to oppose any amendments that would 
breach the allocations.
  I ask unanimous consent that a table setting forth the revised 
allocation to subcommittees be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:
