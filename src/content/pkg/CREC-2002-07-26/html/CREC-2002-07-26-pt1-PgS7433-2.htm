SENATE RESOLUTION 308--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE 
         ``ONCE-A-DAY'' PROGRAM TO PROMOTE LOCAL FARM PRODUCTS

  Mrs. CLINTON submitted the following resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:

                              S. Res. 308

       Whereas agriculture is a major industry in the United 
     States, contributing $82,000,000,000 to the gross domestic 
     product of the United States in 2000;
       Whereas the farmers in every State produce a wide variety 
     of local foods;
       Whereas locally-grown, seasonal foods are fresh and 
     wholesome, with superior taste and nutrition;
       Whereas eating fresh foods in season is vital to a healthy 
     diet, promotes health, and supports an active lifestyle;
       Whereas reduced time from field to table allows farmers to 
     harvest fully-ripened produce;
       Whereas this flavorful produce can be prepared with less 
     fat, sugar, and salt;
       Whereas during the months of August, September, and October 
     there is a tremendous selection of fresh, locally-grown 
     produce;
       Whereas local farms provide jobs, attract tourists, and 
     recirculate dollars into the local economy of our Nation;
       Whereas local produce can be found at many locations such 
     as farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture farms, 
     farm stands, local stores, and restaurants;
       Whereas if citizens of the United States would eat 1 item 
     of local produce each day, every dollar spent on the produce 
     would support independent family farms that contribute to the 
     economic health of the United States; and
       Whereas Dutchess County, New York, has already begun a 
     ``Once-a-Day'' program to encourage local residents to buy 
     local produce in support of their local farmers and their own 
     health: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--

[[Page S7434]]

       (1) all Americans are encouraged to buy local farm 
     products; and
       (2) anyone selling local agricultural products is 
     encouraged to promote the products as ``Once-a-Day'' to 
     support the local economy and the health of our Nation.
