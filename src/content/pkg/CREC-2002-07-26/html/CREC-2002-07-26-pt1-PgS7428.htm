                          THE OREGON RED CROSS

<bullet> Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as I am sure many of my 
colleagues are aware, as I speak here today on the floor, fire 
continues to rage across the state of Oregon. At last count, there were 
no fewer than fifteen fires burning throughout the state, leaving 
behind hundreds of thousands of charred acres and a sobering path of 
destruction. As such, I stand here to salute and pay tribute to the 
benevolent Oregonians of the Red Cross who, throughout this tragedy, 
have responded with remarkable compassion and service to their 
communities.
  When fire first broke out near my own home in Pendleton, OR, the 
Umatilla Chapter of the Red Cross was there and opened an emergency 
shelter for residents of fire threatened homes. More than twenty paid 
and volunteer staff enlisted for what fortunately became a substantial 
``cold start'' exercise.
  In Lake County, Oregon, where the Winter, Toolbox Complex, and 
Grizzly Complex fires have combined to form a 115,000 acre inferno, the 
Red Cross has been on the ground, organizing local residents and 
setting up a shelter to disseminate information and to provide aid to 
affected families. That shelter remains on standby status today, 
pending containment of the fire, which is not expected for another 
week.
  There are similar examples throughout the state and throughout the 
country of local Red Cross chapters responding to help friends and 
neighbors in need. For as tragic as this fire season has been to date, 
the staff and volunteers of the Red Cross have responded with an equal 
level of kindness and selflessness.
  This has been a very emotionally charged past few months. As a U.S. 
Senator and as an Oregonian, I am deeply proud of how the people in my 
state have responded to life-threatening crises. The generosity shown 
by so many truly reaffirms one's faith in the goodness of people. 
Today, I salute the workers and the volunteers who gave and continue to 
give of themselves to help our communities in need.<bullet>
