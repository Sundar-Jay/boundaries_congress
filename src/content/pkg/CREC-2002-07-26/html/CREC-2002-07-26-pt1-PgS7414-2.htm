                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.
  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask to speak on another subject.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time would be charged against the time 
remaining on this side for debate on the amendment. There are 32 
minutes remaining. I suggest the Senator speak as in morning business 
but we continue to charge the time against the time remaining on the 
pending amendment.
  Mr. CORZINE. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business and 
that the time I use be charged against the time allocated for debate on 
the amendment. I expect to use up to 15 minutes.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
