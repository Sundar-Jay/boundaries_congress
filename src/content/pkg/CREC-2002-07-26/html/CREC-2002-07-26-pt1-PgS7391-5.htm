                                SCHEDULE

  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to vote in just a minute on the 
nomination of Julia S. Gibbons to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth 
Circuit. There was some question as to whether there would be a vote 
following that. There will not be. That will be done by voice vote. 
This will be the first and last vote of today.
  Following this vote, we will resume consideration of the prescription 
drug bill. The minority has an amendment that they are going to offer.

                          ____________________
