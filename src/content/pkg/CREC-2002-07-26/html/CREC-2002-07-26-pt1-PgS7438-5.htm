  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the 
consideration of S. Res. 310, submitted earlier today by Senators 
Harkin, Hatch, Kennedy, and Gregg.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. Res. 310) honoring Justin W. Dart, as a champion 
     of the rights of individuals with disabilities.

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the

  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on Saturday, June 22, our Nation lost one 
of its great heroes: My good friend, Justin Dart, Jr. Today, my 
colleagues Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, and Senator Gregg, and I are 
introducing a bipartisan resolution to honor Justin Dart. His memorial 
service will occur tomorrow, July 26, the 12th anniversary of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act.
  Justin Dart was the godfather of the disability rights movement. For 
30 years he fought to end prejudice against people with disabilities, 
to strengthen the disabilities right movement, to protect the rights of 
people with disabilities. Millions of Americans with disabilities never 
knew his name but they owe him so much.
  Justin was instrumental to the passage of the ADA and many other 
policies of interest to individuals with disabilities. When President 
Bush signed the Americans With Disabilities Act, he gave the first pen 
to Justin Dart. He truly was the one who brought us together and give 
the inspiration and guidance to get this wonderful, magnificent bill 
through. I was proud to be at his side when he received the Medal of 
Freedom from President Clinton. Today we are proud to introduce this 
resolution to honor him and commemorate his tremendous contribution to 
the lives of Americans with disabilities across this country.
  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and 
preamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon 
the table, and any statements related thereto be printed in the Record 
at the appropriate place.
