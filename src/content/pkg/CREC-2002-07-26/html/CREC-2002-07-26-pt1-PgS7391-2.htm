                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie, offered the following prayer:
  Dear God, You have promised leaders who trust You the gift of 
discernment. We claim that gift today. Give the Senators x-ray 
penetration into the deeper issues in each decision they must make. 
Remind them that You are ready to give them the discernment for what is 
not only good, but Your best, not only expedient, but excellent. Help 
them to know that the need before them will bring forth the gift of 
discernment You have inspired within them. You have done this for the 
great leaders of our history and we claim nothing less today. You are 
our Lord and Saviour. Amen.
