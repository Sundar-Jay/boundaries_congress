                              THE CALENDAR

  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have a number of matters to address 
prior to the time we adjourn for the day.
  All of these matters have been reviewed by the distinguished 
Republican leader. He is here, and he is now in a position to express 
himself if he has any additional comments. But I will begin.
