  HONORING GUNNERY SERGEANT STEPHANIE K. MURPHY, UNITED STATES MARINE 
 CORPS, ON BECOMING THE FIRST FEMALE DRILL INSTRUCTOR AT NAVAL OFFICER 
                            CANDIDATE SCHOOL

<bullet> Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, at this time of great challenge 
to our Nation, it is with immense pride that we take a moment to 
recognize the efforts of the men and women in our armed forces. I rise 
today to honor one woman in particular who will be making history next 
week. On Friday, August 2, 2002, the United States Navy's Officer 
Candidate School will graduate its first class trained by a female 
drill instructor. Although women have played a vital role in our armed 
forces, and specifically in the Navy and Marine Corps, for many years, 
Gunnery Sergeant Stephanie K. Murphy is the first Class Drill 
Instructor to train future Naval officers.
  A native of Pine Bluff, AR, Gunnery Sergeant Murphy has served in the 
Marine Corps since 1988. In 1996, Murphy graduated from Drill 
Instructor School in Parris Island, SC where she completed six cycles 
training Marine enlisted recruits. After receiving an accelerated 
promotion to Gunnery Sergeant, Murphy requested to go to Pensacola, FL 
in September 2001 to train Naval Officer Candidates.
  Gunnery Sergeant Murphy follows in the proud tradition of trail-
blazing women in the military, women such as Opha Mae Johnson, who 
became one of the first 305 women accepted for duty in the Marine Corps 
Reserve on August 12, 1918. During World War II, women returned to the 
Corps to ``free a man to fight.'' By the end of World War II, a total 
of 23,145 officer and enlisted women reservists served in the Marine 
Corps. Unlike their predecessors, women Marines in World War II 
performed over 200 military assignments. In addition to clerical work, 
their numbers included parachute riggers, mechanics, radio operators, 
map makers, motor transport support, and welders. Women Marines became 
a permanent part of the regular Marine Corps on June 12, 1948 when 
Congress passed the Women's Armed Services Integration Act.
  Today, women account for over four percent of all Marine officers and 
over five percent of the active duty enlisted force. Like their 
distinguished predecessors, women in the Marine Corps today continue to 
serve proudly and capably in whatever capacity their country and Corps 
require.
  Marine Corps drill instructors have helped train Naval Officer 
Candidates since the days of the Navy's World War II Pre-Flight 
Training Schools. This link was reaffirmed following World War II to 
strengthen the bond that connects the Navy/Marine Corps Team.
  In an uncertain world, Americans know that we can count on our men 
and women in uniform. It is with overwhelming pride that we recognize 
their tremendous sacrifice and determination. We ask that you join us 
today in honoring Gunnery Sergeant Stephanie Murphy and all the 
courageous individuals serving in the military.<bullet>
