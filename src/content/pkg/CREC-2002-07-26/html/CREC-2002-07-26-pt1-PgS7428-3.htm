                         TRIBUTE TO TONY TURNER

<bullet> Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to 
my dear friend, the late Tony Turner. On June 30, 2002, Tony passed 
away after succumbing to injuries suffered in a tragic car accident. He 
was only 40 years old.
  I want to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt condolences to 
his wife Geraldine, his two children, Courtney and Cameron, and the 
rest of his family and friends. Tony made it easy for people to 
remember him, leaving behind a legacy as a loving husband and father, 
loyal friend, successful broadcaster, and community leader. He was a 
spirited individual who cherished life and enjoyed helping others. He 
was

famous for his self-deprecating sense of humor and brightened the lives 
of many people with his light-hearted jokes. Tony will be remembered 
for many reasons, not the least of which is his dedication to his 
family and friends.
  Born and raised in eastern Kentucky, Tony was a widely respected 
broadcaster. Over the course of his 26-year career, he worked his way 
from the position of radio disc jockey to television news anchor and 
station manager. Tony's passion for broadcasting developed at an early 
age. He landed his first job at WFSR radio in Harlan, and was general 
manager of that station from 1976 to 1986. After 10 years in radio, 
Tony moved to television and worked as a reporter and general 
assignment editor at WYMT-TV in Hazard. Tony was an outstanding 
journalist and had the ability to connect with just about everyone. His 
unique skills were quickly realized and he went on to become the 
station's news director and 6 p.m. news anchor. In 2001, he was named 
general manager and vice president of WYMT-TV.
  Anyone who knows Tony can attest to the fact that he absolutely loved 
politics. His fair and balanced approach to the subject was widely 
respected in eastern Kentucky and he often was asked to moderate 
political debates. During his 16 years at WYMT-TV, he anchored a number 
of highly acclaimed political talk shows, including ``Issues and 
Answers . . . The Mountain Edition'' and ``Point Counterpoint.'' I had 
the pleasure of appearing on Tony's shows a number of times, and I 
always enjoyed talking politics with him. Tony was an engaging 
interviewer and never shied away from asking tough questions. At the 
same time, he was always honest and fair. Tony Turner was a one-of-a-
kind journalist and he will be sorely missed.
  As much as he is recognized for his professional life, Tony is also 
well known for his kind heart and commitment to public service. He was 
involved in a variety of good causes and actively used his high profile 
to better the lives of others. Tony was a longtime supporter and cohost 
of the annual Children's Miracle Network Telethon, which helped raise 
money for the University of Kentucky's Children's Hospital. He also was 
chairman of the board of directors of the Pride Program, and served on 
the boards of the Center for Rural Development and the Eastern Kentucky 
Leadership Foundation. Additionally, he was an active member of the 
Loyall First Baptist Church.
  At times like these, I am reminded of the frailty of life and the 
importance of friends and family. Tony understood and valued these 
things and has left a legacy of excellence for all to remember. 
Although his passing leaves a great void in the hearts of many, I hope 
it will be a comfort to his family and friends to know that he was 
loved and admired by countless people in his community and throughout 
the State of Kentucky. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, we offer 
our deepest condolences to his loved ones and express our gratitude for 
his many contributions.<bullet>
