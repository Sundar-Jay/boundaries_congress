                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001

  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate 
crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last 
year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to 
current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any 
kind is unacceptable in our society.
  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 14, 1994 
in National City, CA. A gay man was beaten

[[Page S7423]]

by four men who yelled anti-gay slurs. The assailants, Juan Gonzales 
and Maico Amon, both 20, were charged in connection with the incident.
  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to 
defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law 
Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become 
substance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing 
current law, we can change hearts and minds as well.
