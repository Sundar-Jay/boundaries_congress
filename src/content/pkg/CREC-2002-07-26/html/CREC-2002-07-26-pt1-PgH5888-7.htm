     will be recalled by the firm from which the separation 
     occurred.

     exempt a worker from requirements relating to the 
     availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to 
     accept work under Federal or State unemployment compensation 
     laws.
       ``(E) Enrollment unavailable.--The first available 
     enrollment date for the approved training of the worker is 
     within 60 days after the date of the determination made under 
     this paragraph, or, if later, there are extenuating 
     circumstances for the delay in enrollment, as determined 
     pursuant to guidelines issued by the Secretary.

     Secretary is not reasonably available to the worker from 
     either governmental agencies or private sources (which may 
     include area vocational education schools, as defined in 
     section 3 of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical 
     Education Act of 1998 (20 U.S.C. 2302), and employers), no

     SEC. 343. MANDATORY ADVANCED ELECTRONIC INFORMATION FOR CARGO 
                   AND OTHER IMPROVED CUSTOMS REPORTING 
                   PROCEDURES.

       (a) Cargo Information.--
       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), not 
     later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, 
     the Secretary shall promulgate regulations providing for the 
     transmission to the Customs Service, through an electronic 
     data interchange system, of information pertaining to cargo 
     destined for importation into the United States or 
     exportation from the United States, prior to such importation 
     or exportation.
       (2) Information required.--The information required by the 
     regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (1) under the 
     parameters set forth in paragraph (3) shall be such 
     information as the Secretary determines to be reasonably 
     necessary to ensure aviation, maritime, and surface 
     transportation safety and security pursuant to those laws 
     enforced and administered by the Customs Service.
       (3) Parameters.--In developing regulations pursuant to 
     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adhere to the following 
     parameters:
       (A) The Secretary shall solicit comments from and consult 
     with a broad range of parties likely to be affected by the 
     regulations, including importers, exporters, carriers, 
     customs brokers, and freight forwarders, among other 
     interested parties.
       (B) In general, the requirement to provide particular 
     information shall be imposed on the party most likely to have 
     direct knowledge of that information. Where requiring 
     information from the party with direct knowledge of that 
     information is not practicable, the regulations shall take 
     into account how, under ordinary commercial practices, 
     information is acquired by the party on which the requirement 
     is imposed, and whether and how such party is able to verify 
     the information. Where information is not reasonably 
     verifiable by the party on which a requirement is imposed, 
     the regulations shall permit that party to transmit 
     information on the basis of what it reasonably believes to be 
     true.
       (C) The Secretary shall take into account the existence of 
     competitive relationships among the parties on which 
     requirements to provide particular information are imposed.
       (D) Where the regulations impose requirements on carriers 
     of cargo, they shall take into account differences among 
     different modes of transportation, including differences in 
     commercial practices, operational characteristics, and 
     technological capacity to collect and transmit information 
     electronically.
       (E) The regulations shall take into account the extent to 
     which the technology necessary for parties to transmit and 
     the Customs Service to receive and analyze data in a timely 
     fashion is available. To the extent that the Secretary 
     determines that the necessary technology will not be widely 
     available to particular modes of transportation or other 
     affected parties until after promulgation of the regulations, 
     the regulations shall provide interim requirements 
     appropriate for the technology that is available at the time 
     of promulgation.
       (F) The information collected pursuant to the regulations 
     shall be used exclusively for ensuring aviation, maritime, 
     and surface transportation safety and security, and shall not 
     be used for determining entry or for any other commercial 
     enforcement purposes.
       (G) The regulations shall protect the privacy of business 
     proprietary and any other confidential information provided 
     to the Customs Service. However, this parameter does not 
     repeal, amend, or otherwise modify other provisions of law 
     relating to the public disclosure of information transmitted 
     to the Customs Service.
       (H) In determining the timing for transmittal of any 
     information, the Secretary shall balance likely impact on 
     flow of commerce with impact on aviation, maritime, and 
     surface transportation safety and security. With respect to 
     requirements that may be imposed on carriers of cargo, the 
     timing for transmittal of information shall take into account 
     differences among different modes of transportation, as 
     described in subparagraph (D).
       (I) Where practicable, the regulations shall avoid imposing 
     requirements that are redundant with one another or that are 
     redundant with requirements in other provisions of law.
       (J) The Secretary shall determine whether it is appropriate 
     to provide transition periods between promulgation of the 
     regulations and the effective date of the regulations and 
     shall prescribe such transition periods in the regulations, 
     as appropriate. The Secretary may determine that different 
     transition periods are appropriate for different classes of 
     affected parties.
       (K) With respect to requirements imposed on carriers, the 
     Secretary, in consultation with the Postmaster General, shall 
     determine whether it is appropriate to impose the same or 
     similar requirements on shipments by the United States Postal 
     Service. If the Secretary determines that such requirements 
     are appropriate, then they shall be set forth in the 
     regulations.
       (L) Not later than 15 days prior to promulgation of the 
     regulations, the Secretary shall transmit to the Committees 
     on Finance and Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the 
     Senate and the Committees on Ways and Means and 
     Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of 
     Representatives a report setting forth--
       (i) the proposed regulations;
       (ii) an explanation of how particular requirements in the 
     proposed regulations meet the needs of aviation, maritime, 
     and surface transportation safety and security;
       (iii) an explanation of how the Secretary expects the 
     proposed regulations to affect the commercial practices of 
     affected parties; and
       (iv) an explanation of how the proposed regulations address 
     particular comments received from interested parties.
       (b) Documentation of Waterborne Cargo.--Part II of title IV 
     of the Tariff Act of 1930 is amended by inserting after 
     section 431 the following new section:

     ``SEC. 431A. DOCUMENTATION OF WATERBORNE CARGO.

       ``(a) Applicability.--This section shall apply to all cargo 
     to be exported that is moved by a vessel carrier from a port 
     in the United States.
       ``(b) Documentation Required.--(1) No shipper of cargo 
     subject to this section (including an ocean transportation 
     intermediary that is a non-vessel-operating common carrier 
     (as defined in section 3(17)(B) of the Shipping Act of 1984 
     (46 U.S.C. App. 1702(17)(B)) may tender or cause to be 
     tendered to a vessel carrier cargo subject to this section 
     for loading on a vessel in a United States port, unless such 
     cargo is properly documented pursuant to this subsection.
       ``(2) For the purposes of this subsection, cargo shall be 
     considered properly documented if the shipper submits to the 
     vessel carrier or its agent a complete set of shipping 
     documents no later than 24 hours after the cargo is delivered 
     to the marine terminal operator, but under no circumstances 
     later than 24 hours prior to departure of the vessel.
       ``(3) A complete set of shipping documents shall include--
       ``(A) for shipments for which a shipper's export 
     declaration is required, a copy of the export declaration or, 
     if the shipper files such declarations electronically in the 
     Automated Export System, the complete bill of lading, and the 
     master or equivalent shipping instructions, including the 
     Internal Transaction Number (ITN); or
       ``(B) for shipments for which a shipper's export 
     declaration is not required, a shipper's export declaration 
     exemption statement and such other documents or information 
     as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe.
       ``(4) The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe the time, 
     manner, and form by which shippers shall transmit documents 
     or information required under this subsection to the Customs 
     Service.
       ``(c) Loading Undocumented Cargo Prohibited.--
       ``(1) No marine terminal operator (as defined in section 
     3(14) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. App. 1702(14))) 
     may load, or cause to be loaded, any cargo subject to this 
     section on a vessel unless instructed by the vessel carrier 
     operating the vessel that such cargo has been properly 
     documented in accordance with this section.
       ``(2) When cargo is booked by 1 vessel carrier to be 
     transported on the vessel of another vessel carrier, the 
     booking carrier shall notify the operator of the vessel that 
     the cargo has been properly documented in accordance with 
     this section. The operator of the vessel may rely on such 
     notification in releasing the cargo for loading aboard the 
     vessel.
       ``(d) Reporting of Undocumented Cargo.--A vessel carrier 
     shall notify the Customs Service of any cargo tendered to 
     such carrier that is not properly documented pursuant to this 
     section

[[Page H5902]]

     and that has remained in the marine terminal for more than 48 
     hours after being delivered to the marine terminal, and the 
     location of the cargo in the marine terminal. For vessel 
     carriers that are members of vessel sharing agreements (or 
     any other arrangement whereby a carrier moves cargo on 
     another carrier's vessel), the vessel carrier accepting 
     the booking shall be responsible for reporting 
     undocumented cargo, without regard to whether it operates 
     the vessel on which the transportation is to be made.
       ``(e) Assessment of Penalties.--Whoever is found to have 
     violated subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to 
     the United States for civil penalties in a monetary amount up 
     to the value of the cargo, or the actual cost of the 
     transportation, whichever is greater.
       ``(f) Seizure of Undocumented Cargo.--
       ``(1) Any cargo that is not properly documented pursuant to 
     this section and has remained in the marine terminal for more 
     than 48 hours after being delivered to the marine terminal 
     operator shall be subject to search, seizure, and forfeiture.
       ``(2) The shipper of any such cargo is liable to the marine 
     terminal operator and to the ocean carrier for demurrage and 
     other applicable charges for any undocumented cargo which has 
     been notified to or searched or seized by the Customs Service 
     for the entire period the cargo remains under the order and 
     direction of the Customs Service. Unless the cargo is seized 
     by the Customs Service and forfeited, the marine terminal 
     operator and the ocean carrier shall have a lien on the cargo 
     for the amount of the demurrage and other charges.
       ``(g) Effect on Other Provisions.--Nothing in this section 
     shall be construed, interpreted, or applied to relieve or 
     excuse any party from compliance with any obligation or 
     requirement arising under any other law, regulation, or order 
     with regard to the documentation or carriage of cargo.''.
       (c) Secretary.--For purposes of this section, the term 
     ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the Treasury. If, at the 
     time the regulations required by subsection (a)(1) are 
     promulgated, the Customs Service is no longer located in the 
     Department of the Treasury, then the Secretary of the 
     Treasury shall exercise the authority under subsection (a) 
     jointly with the Secretary of the Department in which the 
     Customs Service is located.

     officials that the Secretary deems appropriate. The task 
     force shall establish a program to evaluate and certify 
     secure systems of international intermodal transport no later 
     than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act. The task 
     force shall solicit and consider input from a broad range of 
     interested parties.
       (b) Program Requirements.--At a minimum the program 
     referred to in subsection (a) shall require certified systems 
     of international intermodal transport to be significantly 
     more secure than existing transportation programs, and the 
     program shall--
       (1) establish standards and a process for screening and 
     evaluating cargo prior to import into or export from the 
     United States;
       (2) establish standards and a process for a system of 
     securing cargo and monitoring it while in transit;
       (3) establish standards and a process for allowing the 
     United States Government to ensure and validate compliance 
     with the program elements; and
       (4) include any other elements that the task force deems 
     necessary to ensure the security and integrity of the 
     international intermodal transport movements.
       (c) Recognition of Certified Systems.--
       (1) Secretary of the Treasury.--The Secretary of the 
     Treasury shall recognize certified systems of intermodal 
     transport in the requirements of a national security plan for 
     United States seaports, and in the provisions requiring 
     planning to reopen United States ports for commerce.
       (2) Commissioner of Customs.--The Commissioner of Customs 
     shall recognize certified systems of intermodal transport in 
     the evaluation of cargo risk for purposes of United States

     subsection (a) is implemented, the Secretary of the Treasury 
     shall transmit a report to the Committees on Commerce, 
     Science, and Transportation and Finance of the Senate and the 
     Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure and Ways and 
     Means of the House of Representatives that--
       (1) evaluates the program and its requirements;

     procedure, system, or technology evaluated as part of the 
     program offers a higher level of security than under existing 
     procedures;
       (3) states the Secretary's views as to the integrity of the 
     procedures, technology, or systems evaluated as part of the 
     program; and
       (4) makes a recommendation with respect to whether the 
     program, or any procedure, system, or technology should be 
     incorporated in a nationwide system for certified systems of 
     intermodal transport.

            DIVISION B--BIPARTISAN TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY

                  TITLE XXI--TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY

     SEC. 2101. SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.

       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the 
     ``Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002''.
       (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the 
     national security of the United States. Trade is critical to 
     the economic growth and strength of the United States and to 
     its leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships 
     promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve 
     the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold 
     War, binding nations together through a series of mutual 
     rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in 
     international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and 
     peace throughout the world.
       (2) The national security of the United States depends on 
     its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a 
     vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been 
     the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize 
     opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of 
     the economy of the United States, such as information 
     technology, telecommunications and other leading 
     technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical 
     equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, 
     and intellectual property. Trade will create new 
     opportunities for the United States and preserve the 
     unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, 
     political, and military affairs. The United States, secured 
     by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the 
     challenges of the twenty-first century.
       (3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that 
     dispute settlement procedures under international trade 
     agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations 
     provided in such agreements. Therefore--
       (A) the recent pattern of decisions by dispute settlement 
     panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body to impose 
     obligations and restrictions on the use of antidumping, 
     countervailing, and safeguard measures by WTO members under 
     the Antidumping Agreement, the Agreement on Subsidies and 
     Countervailing Measures, and the Agreement on Safeguards has 
     raised concerns; and
       (B) the Congress is concerned that dispute settlement 
     panels of the WTO and the Appellate Body appropriately apply 
     the standard of review contained in Article 17.6 of the 
     Antidumping Agreement, to provide deference to a permissible 
     interpretation by a WTO member of provisions of that 
     Agreement, and to the evaluation by a WTO member of the facts 
     where that evaluation is unbiased and objective and the 
     establishment of the facts is proper.

     SEC. 2102. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES.

       (a) Overall Trade Negotiating Objectives.--The overall 
     trade negotiating objectives of the United States for 
     agreements subject to the provisions of section 2103 are--
       (1) to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market 
     access;
       (2) to obtain the reduction or elimination of barriers and 
     distortions that are directly related to trade and that 
     decrease market opportunities for United States exports or 
     otherwise distort United States trade;
       (3) to further strengthen the system of international 
     trading disciplines and procedures, including dispute 
     settlement;
       (4) to foster economic growth, raise living standards, and 
     promote full employment in the United States and to enhance 
     the global economy;
       (5) to ensure that trade and environmental policies are 
     mutually supportive and to seek to protect and preserve the 
     environment and enhance the international means of doing so, 
     while optimizing the use of the world's resources;
       (6) to promote respect for worker rights and the rights of 
     children consistent with core labor standards of the ILO (as 
     defined in section 2113(6)) and an understanding of the 
     relationship between trade and worker rights;
       (7) to seek provisions in trade agreements under which 
     parties to those agreements strive to ensure that they do not 
     weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic 
     environmental and labor laws as an encouragement for trade;
       (8) to ensure that trade agreements afford small businesses 
     equal access to international markets, equitable trade 
     benefits, and expanded export market opportunities, and 
     provide for the reduction or elimination of trade barriers 
     that disproportionately impact small businesses; and
       (9) to promote universal ratification and full compliance 
     with ILO Convention No. 182 Concerning the Prohibition and 
     Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of 
     Child Labor.
       (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--
       (1) Trade barriers and distortions.--The principal 
     negotiating objectives of the United States regarding trade 
     barriers and other trade distortions are--
       (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for United 
     States exports and to obtain fairer and more open conditions 
     of trade by reducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff 
     barriers and policies and practices of foreign governments 
     directly related to trade that decrease market opportunities 
     for United States exports or otherwise distort United States 
     trade; and
       (B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier 
     elimination agreements, with particular attention to those 
     tariff categories covered in section 111(b) of the Uruguay 
     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).
       (2) Trade in services.--The principal negotiating objective 
     of the United States regarding trade in services is to reduce 
     or eliminate barriers to international trade in services, 
     including regulatory and other barriers that deny national 
     treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict the 
     establishment or operations of service suppliers.
       (3) Foreign investment.--Recognizing that United States law 
     on the whole provides a high level of protection for 
     investment, consistent with or greater than the level 
     required by international law, the principal negotiating 
     objectives of the United States regarding foreign investment 
     are to reduce or eliminate artificial or trade-distorting 
     barriers to foreign investment, while ensuring that foreign 
     investors in the United States are not accorded greater 
     substantive rights with respect to investment protections 
     than United States investors in the United States, and to 
     secure for investors important rights comparable to those 
     that would be available under United States legal principles 
     and practice, by--
       (A) reducing or eliminating exceptions to the principle of 
     national treatment;
       (B) freeing the transfer of funds relating to investments;
       (C) reducing or eliminating performance requirements, 
     forced technology transfers, and other unreasonable barriers 
     to the establishment and operation of investments;
       (D) seeking to establish standards for expropriation and 
     compensation for expropriation, consistent with United States 
     legal principles and practice;
       (E) seeking to establish standards for fair and equitable 
     treatment consistent with United States legal principles and 
     practice, including the principle of due process;
       (F) providing meaningful procedures for resolving 
     investment disputes;
       (G) seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes 
     between an investor and a government through--
       (i) mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims and to deter 
     the filing of frivolous claims;
       (ii) procedures to ensure the efficient selection of 
     arbitrators and the expeditious disposition of claims;
       (iii) procedures to enhance opportunities for public input 
     into the formulation of government positions; and
       (iv) providing for an appellate body or similar mechanism 
     to provide coherence to the interpretations of investment 
     provisions in trade agreements; and
       (H) ensuring the fullest measure of transparency in the 
     dispute settlement mechanism, to the extent consistent with 
     the need to protect information that is classified or 
     business confidential, by--
       (i) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement are 
     promptly made public;
       (ii) ensuring that--

       (I) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions 
     are promptly made public; and
       (II) all hearings are open to the public; and

       (iii) establishing a mechanism for acceptance of amicus 
     curiae submissions from businesses, unions, and 
     nongovernmental organizations.
       (4) Intellectual property.--The principal negotiating

     Organization on duties on electronic transmissions.
       (10) Reciprocal trade in agriculture.--(A) The principal 
     negotiating objective of the United States with respect to 
     agriculture is to obtain competitive opportunities for United 
     States exports of agricultural commodities in foreign markets 
     substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities 
     afforded foreign exports in United States markets and to 
     achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade in bulk, 
     specialty crop, and value-added commodities by--
       (i) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or 
     other charges that decrease market opportunities for United 
     States exports--
       (I) giving priority to those products that are subject to 
     significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major 
     producing countries; and

     States import-sensitive products, in close consultation with 
     the Congress on such products before initiating tariff 
     reduction negotiations;
       (ii) reducing tariffs to levels that are the same as or 
     lower than those in the United States;
       (iii) reducing or eliminating subsidies that decrease 
     market opportunities for United States exports or unfairly 
     distort agriculture markets to the detriment of the United 
     States;
       (iv) allowing the preservation of programs that support 
     family farms and rural communities but do not distort trade;
       (v) developing disciplines for domestic support programs, 
     so that production that is in excess of domestic food 
     security needs is sold at world prices;
       (vi) eliminating government policies that create price-
     depressing surpluses;
       (vii) eliminating state trading enterprises whenever 
     possible;
       (viii) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules and 
     effective dispute settlement mechanisms to eliminate 
     practices that unfairly decrease United States market access 
     opportunities or distort agricultural markets to the 
     detriment of the United States, particularly with respect to 
     import-sensitive products, including--
       (I) unfair or trade-distorting activities of state trading 
     enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, with 
     emphasis on requiring price transparency in the operation of 
     state trading enterprises and such other mechanisms in order 
     to end cross subsidization, price discrimination, and price 
     undercutting;
       (II) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial 
     requirements, such as labeling, that affect new technologies, 
     including biotechnology;
       (III) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, 
     including those not based on scientific principles in 
     contravention of the Uruguay Round Agreements;
       (IV) other unjustified technical barriers to trade; and
       (V) restrictive rules in the administration of tariff rate 
     quotas;
       (ix) eliminating practices that adversely affect trade in 
     perishable or cyclical products, while improving import 
     relief mechanisms to recognize the unique characteristics of 
     perishable and cyclical agriculture;
       (x) ensuring that import relief mechanisms for perishable 
     and cyclical agriculture are as accessible and timely to 
     growers in the United States as those mechanisms that are 
     used by other countries;
       (xi) taking into account whether a party to the 
     negotiations has failed to adhere to the provisions of 
     already existing trade agreements with the United States or 
     has circumvented obligations under those agreements;
       (xii) taking into account whether a product is subject to 
     market distortions by reason of a failure of a major 
     producing country to adhere to the provisions of already 
     existing trade agreements with the United States or by the 
     circumvention by that country of its obligations under those 
     agreements;
       (xiii) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the 
     World Trade Organization have made meaningful market 
     liberalization commitments in agriculture;
       (xiv) taking into account the impact that agreements 
     covering agriculture to which the United States is a party, 
     including the North American Free Trade Agreement, have on 
     the United States agricultural industry;
       (xv) maintaining bona fide food assistance programs and 
     preserving United States market development and export credit 
     programs; and
       (xvi) striving to complete a general multilateral round in 
     the World Trade Organization by January 1, 2005, and seeking 
     the broadest market access possible in multilateral, 
     regional, and bilateral negotiations, recognizing the effect 
     that simultaneous sets of negotiations may have on United 
     States import-sensitive commodities (including those subject 
     to tariff-rate quotas).
       (B)(i) Before commencing negotiations with respect to 
     agriculture, the United States Trade Representative, in 
     consultation with the Congress, shall seek to develop a 
     position on the treatment of seasonal and perishable 
     agricultural products to be employed in the negotiations in 
     order to develop an international consensus on the treatment 
     of seasonal or perishable agricultural products in 
     investigations relating to dumping and safeguards and in any 
     other relevant area.
       (ii) During any negotiations on agricultural subsidies, the 
     United States Trade Representative shall seek to establish 
     the common base year for calculating the Aggregated 
     Measurement of Support (as defined in the Agreement on 
     Agriculture) as the end of each country's Uruguay Round 
     implementation period, as reported in each country's Uruguay 
     Round market access schedule.

[[Page H5906]]

       (iii) The negotiating objective provided in subparagraph 
     (A) applies with respect to agricultural matters to be 
     addressed in any trade agreement entered into under section 
     2103(a) or (b), including any trade agreement entered into 
     under section 2103(a) or (b) that provides for accession to a 
     trade agreement to which the United States is already a 
     party, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement and 
     the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement.
       (11) Labor and the environment.--The principal negotiating 
     objectives of the United States with respect to labor and the 
     environment are--
       (A) to ensure that a party to a trade agreement with the 
     United States does not fail to effectively enforce its 
     environmental or labor laws, through a sustained or recurring 
     course of action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade 
     between the United States and that party after entry into 
     force of a trade agreement between those countries;
       (B) to recognize that parties to a trade agreement retain 
     the right to exercise discretion with respect to 
     investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance 
     matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation of 
     resources to enforcement with respect to other labor or 
     environmental matters determined to have higher priorities, 
     and to recognize that a country is effectively enforcing its 
     laws if a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable 
     exercise of such discretion, or results from a bona fide 
     decision regarding the allocation of resources, and no 
     retaliation may be authorized based on the exercise of these 
     rights or the right to establish domestic labor standards and 
     levels of environmental protection;
       (C) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading 
     partners to promote respect for core labor standards (as 
     defined in section 2113(6));
       (D) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading 
     partners to protect the environment through the promotion of 
     sustainable development;
       (E) to reduce or eliminate government practices or policies 
     that unduly threaten sustainable development;
       (F) to seek market access, through the elimination of 
     tariffs and nontariff barriers, for United States 
     environmental technologies, goods, and services; and
       (G) to ensure that labor, environmental, health, or safety 
     policies and practices of the parties to trade agreements 
     with the United States do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably 
     discriminate against United States exports or serve as 
     disguised barriers to trade.
       (12) Dispute settlement and enforcement.--The principal 
     negotiating objectives of the United States with respect to 
     dispute settlement and enforcement of trade agreements are--
       (A) to seek provisions in trade agreements providing for 
     resolution of disputes between governments under those trade 
     agreements in an effective, timely, transparent, equitable, 
     and reasoned manner, requiring determinations based on facts 
     and the principles of the agreements, with the goal of 
     increasing compliance with the agreements;
       (B) to seek to strengthen the capacity of the Trade Policy 
     Review Mechanism of the World Trade Organization to review 
     compliance with commitments;
       (C) to seek adherence by panels convened under the Dispute 
     Settlement Understanding and by the Appellate Body to the 
     standard of review applicable under the Uruguay Round 
     Agreement involved in the dispute, including greater 
     deference, where appropriate, to the fact-finding and 
     technical expertise of national investigating authorities;
       (D) to seek provisions encouraging the early identification 
     and settlement of disputes through consultation;
       (E) to seek provisions to encourage the provision of trade-
     expanding compensation if a party to a dispute under the 
     agreement does not come into compliance with its obligations 
     under the agreement;
       (F) to seek provisions to impose a penalty upon a party to 
     a dispute under the agreement that--
       (i) encourages compliance with the obligations of the 
     agreement;
       (ii) is appropriate to the parties, nature, subject matter, 
     and scope of the violation; and
       (iii) has the aim of not adversely affecting parties or 
     interests not party to the dispute while maintaining the 
     effectiveness of the enforcement mechanism; and
       (G) to seek provisions that treat United States principal 
     negotiating objectives equally with respect to--
       (i) the ability to resort to dispute settlement under the 
     applicable agreement;
       (ii) the availability of equivalent dispute settlement 
     procedures; and
       (iii) the availability of equivalent remedies.
       (13) WTO extended negotiations.--The principal negotiating 
     objectives of the United States regarding trade in civil 
     aircraft are those set forth in section 135(c) of the Uruguay 
     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3355(c)) and regarding rules 
     of origin are the conclusion of an agreement described in 
     section 132 of that Act (19 U.S.C. 3552).
       (14) Trade remedy laws.--The principal negotiating 
     objectives of the United States with respect to trade remedy 
     laws are--
       (A) to preserve the ability of the United States to enforce 
     rigorously its trade laws, including the antidumping, 
     countervailing duty, and safeguard laws, and avoid agreements 
     that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international 
     disciplines on unfair trade, especially dumping and 
     subsidies, or that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and 
     international safeguard provisions, in order to ensure that 
     United States workers, agricultural producers, and firms can 
     compete fully on fair terms and enjoy the benefits of 
     reciprocal trade concessions; and
       (B) to address and remedy market distortions that lead to 
     dumping and subsidization, including overcapacity, 
     cartelization, and market-access barriers.
       (15) Border taxes.--The principal negotiating objective of 
     the United States regarding border taxes is to obtain a 
     revision of the WTO rules with respect to the treatment of 
     border adjustments for internal taxes to redress the 
     disadvantage to countries relying primarily on direct taxes 
     for revenue rather than indirect taxes.
       (16) Textile Negotiations.--The principal negotiating 
     objectives of the United States with respect to trade in 
     textiles and apparel articles are to obtain competitive 
     opportunities for United States exports of textiles and 
     apparel in foreign markets substantially equivalent to the 
     competitive opportunities afforded foreign exports in United 
     States markets and to achieve fairer and more open conditions 
     of trade in textiles and apparel.
       (17) Worst Forms of Child Labor.--The principal negotiating 
     objective of the United States with respect to the trade-
     related aspects of the worst forms of child labor are to seek 
     commitments by parties to trade agreements to vigorously 
     enforce their own laws prohibiting the worst forms of child 
     labor.
       (c) Promotion of Certain Priorities.--In order to address 
     and maintain United States competitiveness in the global 
     economy, the President shall--
       (1) seek greater cooperation between the WTO and the ILO;
       (2) seek to establish consultative mechanisms among parties 
     to trade agreements to strengthen the capacity of United 
     States trading partners to promote respect for core labor 
     standards (as defined in section 2113(6)) and to promote 
     compliance with ILO Convention No. 182 Concerning the 
     Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the 
     Worst Forms of Child Labor, and report to the Committee on 
     Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate on the content and 
     operation of such mechanisms;
       (3) seek to establish consultative mechanisms among parties 
     to trade agreements to strengthen the capacity of United 
     States trading partners to develop and implement standards 
     for the protection of the environment and human health based 
     on sound science, and report to the Committee on Ways and 
     Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
     Finance of the Senate on the content and operation of such 
     mechanisms;
       (4) conduct environmental reviews of future trade and 
     investment agreements, consistent with Executive Order 13141 
     of November 16, 1999, and its relevant guidelines, and report 
     to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on 
     such reviews;
       (5) review the impact of future trade agreements on United 
     States employment, including labor markets, modeled after 
     Executive Order 13141 to the extent appropriate in 
     establishing procedures and criteria, report to the Committee 
     on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate on such review, and make 
     that report available to the public;
       (6) take into account other legitimate United States 
     domestic objectives including, but not limited to, the 
     protection of legitimate health or safety, essential 
     security, and consumer interests and the law and regulations 
     related thereto;
       (7) direct the Secretary of Labor to consult with any 
     country seeking a trade agreement with the United States 
     concerning that country's labor laws and provide technical 
     assistance to that country if needed;
       (8) in connection with any trade negotiations entered into 
     under this Act, submit to the Committee on Ways and Means of 
     the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of 
     the Senate a meaningful labor rights report of the country,

     section 2107(b)(2)(E);
       (9) with respect to any trade agreement which the President

     exceptions under Article XX of the GATT 1994;
       (11) report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House 
     of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the 
     Senate, not later than 12 months after the imposition of a 
     penalty or remedy by the United States permitted by a trade 
     agreement to which this title applies, on the effectiveness 
     of the penalty or remedy applied under United States law in 
     enforcing United States rights under the trade agreement; and
       (12) seek to establish consultative mechanisms among 
     parties to trade agreements to examine the trade consequences 
     of significant and unanticipated currency movements and to

     advantage in international trade.

     The report under paragraph (11) shall address whether the 
     penalty or remedy was effective in changing the behavior of

     SEC. 2103. TRADE AGREEMENTS AUTHORITY.

       (a) Agreements Regarding Tariff Barriers.--
       (1) In general.--Whenever the President determines that one 
     or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any 
     foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and 
     restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that 
     the purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of this 
     title will be promoted thereby, the President--
       (A) may enter into trade agreements with foreign countries 
     before--
       (i) June 1, 2005; or
       (ii) June 1, 2007, if trade authorities procedures are 
     extended under subsection (c); and

       (i) such modification or continuance of any existing duty,
       (ii) such continuance of existing duty-free or excise 
     treatment, or
       (iii) such additional duties,
     as the President determines to be required or appropriate to 
     carry out any such trade agreement.

     The President shall notify the Congress of the President's 
     intention to enter into an agreement under this subsection.
       (2) Limitations.--No proclamation may be made under 
     paragraph (1) that--
       (A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty 
     that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on the date of the 
     enactment of this Act) to a rate of duty which is less than

     effect on such day if--
       (i) a reduction of 3 percent ad valorem or a reduction of 
     one-tenth of the total reduction, whichever is greater, had

     this paragraph and the next lower whole number; or
       (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.
       (5) Other limitations.--A rate of duty reduction that may

     negotiations the subject matter of which is directly related 
     to the subject matter under section 2102(b)(10)(A)(i) with 
     any country, the President shall assess whether United States 
     tariffs on agricultural products that were bound under the 
     Uruguay Round Agreements are lower than the tariffs bound by 
     that country. In addition, the President shall consider 
     whether the tariff levels bound and applied throughout the 
     world with respect to imports from the United States are 
     higher than United States tariffs and whether the negotiation 
     provides an opportunity to address any such disparity. The 
     President shall consult with the Committee on Ways and Means 
     and the Committee on Agriculture of the House of 
     Representatives and the Committee on Finance and the 
     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the 
     Senate concerning the results of the assessment, whether it 
     is appropriate for the United States to agree to further 
     tariff reductions based on the conclusions reached in the 
     assessment, and how all applicable negotiating objectives 
     will be met.
       (2) Special consultations on import sensitive products.--

     a rate which was not less than 97.5 percent of the rate of 
     duty that applied to such article on December 31, 1994;
       (ii) consult with the Committee on Ways and Means and the 
     Committee on Agriculture of the House of Representatives and 
     the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Agriculture, 
     Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate concerning--
       (I) whether any further tariff reductions on the products 
     identified under clause (i) should be appropriate, taking 
     into account the impact of any such tariff reduction on the 
     United States industry producing the product concerned;
       (II) whether the products so identified face unjustified 
     sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, including those not 
     based on scientific principles in contravention of the 
     Uruguay Round Agreements; and
       (III) whether the countries participating in the 
     negotiations maintain export subsidies or other programs, 
     policies, or practices that distort world trade in such 
     products and the impact of such programs, policies, and 
     practices on United States producers of the products;
       (iii) request that the International Trade Commission 
     prepare an assessment of the probable economic effects of any 
     such tariff reduction on the United States industry producing 
     the product concerned and on the United States economy as a 
     whole; and
       (iv) upon complying with clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), 
     notify the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on 
     Agriculture of the House of Representatives and the Committee 
     on Finance and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
     Forestry of the Senate of those products identified under 
     clause (i) for which the Trade Representative intends to seek 
     tariff liberalization in the negotiations and the reasons for 
     seeking such tariff liberalization.
       (B) If, after negotiations described in subparagraph (A) 
     are commenced--
       (i) the United States Trade Representative identifies any 
     additional agricultural product described in subparagraph

     notification under subparagraph (A)(iv), or
       (ii) any additional agricultural product described in 
     subparagraph (A)(i) is the subject of a request for tariff 
     reductions by a party to the negotiations,

     the Trade Representative shall, as soon as practicable, 
     notify the committees referred to in subparagraph (A)(iv) of 
     those products and the reasons for seeking such tariff 
     reductions.
       (3) Negotiations regarding the fishing industry.--Before 
     initiating, or continuing, negotiations which directly relate 
     to fish or shellfish trade with any country, the President 
     shall consult with the Committee on Ways and Means and the 
     Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives, and 
     the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Commerce, 
     Science, and Transportation of the Senate, and shall keep the 
     Committees apprised of negotiations on an ongoing and timely 
     basis.
       (c) Negotiations Regarding Textiles.--Before initiating or 
     continuing negotiations the subject matter of which is 
     directly related to textiles and apparel products with any 
     country, the President shall assess whether United States 
     tariffs on textile and apparel products that were bound under 
     the Uruguay Round Agreements are lower than the tariffs bound 
     by that country and whether the negotiation provides an 
     opportunity to address any such disparity. The President 
     shall consult with the Committee on Ways and Means of the 
     House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the 
     Senate concerning the results of the assessment, whether it 
     is appropriate for the United States to agree to further 
     tariff reductions based on the conclusions reached in the 
     assessment, and how all applicable negotiating objectives 
     will be met.

     President submits to the Congress a description of those 
     changes to existing laws that the President considers would 
     be required in order to bring the United States into 
     compliance with the agreement;
       (C) after entering into the agreement, the President

     SEC. 2109. COMMITTEE STAFF.

       The grant of trade promotion authority under this title is 
     likely to increase the activities of the primary committees 
     of jurisdiction in the area of international trade. In 
     addition, the creation of the Congressional Oversight Group 
     under section 2107 will increase the participation of a 
     broader number of Members of Congress in the formulation of 
     United States trade policy and oversight of the international 
     trade agenda for the United States. The primary committees of 
     jurisdiction should have adequate staff to accommodate these 
     increases in activities.

                DIVISION C--ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT

                  TITLE XXXI--ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE

     SEC. 3101. SHORT TITLE.

       This title may be cited as the ``Andean Trade Promotion and 
     Drug Eradication Act''.

     SEC. 3102. FINDINGS.

       Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act was enacted in 
     1991, it has had a positive impact on United States trade 
     with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Two-way trade has 
     doubled, with the United States serving as the leading source 
     of imports and leading export market

[[Page H5912]]

     for each of the Andean beneficiary countries. This has 
     resulted in increased jobs and expanded export opportunities 
     in both the United States and the Andean region.
       (2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element 
     in the United States counternarcotics strategy in the Andean 
     region, promoting export diversification and broad-based 
     economic development that provides sustainable economic 
     alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the 
     legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable 
     alternatives to illicit trade in coca.
       (3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade 
     Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by 
     political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable 
     to the consequences of the drug war and fierce global 
     competition for its legitimate trade.
       (4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a 
     threat to the security interests of the United States and the 
     world. This problem has been partially addressed through 
     foreign aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in 
     2000. However, foreign aid alone is not sufficient. 
     Enhancement of legitimate trade with the United States 
     provides an alternative means for reviving and stabilizing 
     the economies in the Andean region.
       (5) The Andean Trade Preference Act constitutes a tangible 
     commitment by the United States to the promotion of 
     prosperity, stability, and democracy in the beneficiary 
     countries.
       (6) Renewal and enhancement of the Andean Trade Preference 
     Act will bolster the confidence of domestic private 
     enterprise and foreign investors in the economic prospects of 
     the region, ensuring that legitimate private enterprise can 
     be the engine of economic development and political stability 
     in the region.
       (7) Each of the Andean beneficiary countries is committed 
     to conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas 
     by the year 2005, as a means of enhancing the economic 
     security of the region.
       (8) Temporarily enhancing trade benefits for Andean 
     beneficiary countries will promote the growth of free 
     enterprise and economic opportunity in these countries and 
     serve the security interests of the United States, the 
     region, and the world.

       The managers on the part of the House and the Senate at the 
     conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses on the 
     amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 3009), to extend

              TITLE I--TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

          Subtitle A--Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers


  sec. 111--reauthorization of the trade adjustment assistance program

     Present law
       Current section 245 authorizes to be appropriated to the 
     Department of Labor such sums as may be necessary to carry 
     out the purposes of the TAA and NAFTA-TAA for workers 
     programs for the period October 1, 1998 through September 30, 
     2001. Current section 285 provides for termination of all 
     Trade Adjustment Assistance programs on September 30, 2001, 
     but provides that workers, and firms eligible to receive 
     benefits on or before that date shall continue to be eligible 
     to receive such benefits as though the programs were in 
     effect.
     House amendment
     Senate amendment
       Section III of the Senate bill creates a new section 248 of 
     the Trade Act of 1974 which authorizes to be appropriated to 
     the Department of Labor such sums as may be necessary to 
     carry out the purposes of the Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     workers program for the period October 1, 2001, through 
     September 30, 2007. Section 701 of the Senate bill amends 
     current section 285 to provide for termination of all Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance programs on September 30, 2007, but 
     provides that workers, and firms, communities, farmers, and 
     fishermen eligible to receive benefits on or before that date 
     shall continue to be eligible to receive such benefits as 
     though the programs were in effect.
     Conference agreement
       Conferees agree to extend the authorization of the Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance programs through September 30, 2007, 
     and to consolidate the NAFTA-TAA program with the regular TAA 
     program.


     sec. 112--filing of petitions and provision of rapid response 
    assistance; expedited review of petitions by secretary of labor

     Present law
       Current sections 221 and 250 set forth requirements 
     concerning who may file a petition for certification of 
     eligibility to apply for TAA and NAFTA-TAA assistance, 
     respectively. Under both programs, petitions may be filed by 
     a group of workers or by their certified or recognized union 
     or other duly authorized representative. TAA petitions are 
     filed with the Secretary of Labor. NAFTA-TAA petitions are 
     filed with the Governor of the relevant State and forwarded 
     by him to the Secretary of Labor. Under section 223, the 
     Secretary of Labor must rule on eligibility within 60 days 
     after a TAA petition is filed. Under section 250, the 
     Governor must make a preliminary eligibility determination 
     within 10 days after a NAFTA-TAA petition is filed, and the 
     Secretary of Labor must make a final eligibility 
     determination within the next 30 days. Section 221 also sets 
     forth notice and hearing obligations of the Secretary of 
     Labor upon receipt of a TAA petition. Section 250 provides 
     that, in the event of preliminary certification of 
     eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA benefits, the Governor 
     immediately provide the affected workers with certain rapid 
     response services.
     House amendment
       The House Amendment provided for a shortened period for the 
     Secretary of Labor to consider petitions from 60 days to 40 
     days

[[Page H5919]]

     and for other rapid response assistance to workers.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate bill creates a new section 231 of 
     the Trade Act of 1974, which consolidates the TAA and NAFTA-
     TAA programs by establishing a single program with a single 
     set of group eligibility criteria and a single set of 
     procedures and standards for filing and reviewing petitions, 
     certifying eligibility, and terminating certifications of 
     eligibility.
       Section 231 expands the list of entities that may file a 
     petition for group certification of eligibility to include 
     employers, one-stop operators or one-stop partners, State 
     employment agencies, and any entity to which notice of a 
     plant closing or mass layoff must be given under section 3 of 
     the Worker Adjustment and Retaining Notification Act. Section 
     231 also provides that the President, or the Committee on 
     Finance of the Senate or the Committee on Ways and Means of 
     the House of Representatives (by resolution), may direct the 
     Secretary of Labor to initiate a certification process under 
     this chapter to determine the eligibility for Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance of a group of workers.
       Section 231 creates a single process for filing and 
     reviewing petitions for Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     workers, under which all petitions are filed with both the 
     Secretary of Labor and the Governor of the State. Upon filing 
     of the petition, the Governor is required to fulfill the 
     requirements of any agreement entered into with the 
     Department of Labor under section 222, to provide certain 
     rapid response services, and to notify workers on whose 
     behalf a petition has been filed of their potential 
     eligibility for certain existing federal health care, child 
     care, transportation, and other assistance programs. Upon 
     filing the petition, the Secretary of Labor must make his 
     certification determination within 40 days and provide the 
     notice required.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House with a change providing for 
     simultaneous filing of petitions with the Secretary of Labor 
     and State Governor.


                sec. 113--group eligibility requirements

     Present law
       Current law sections 222 and 250 of Title II of the Trade 
     Act of 1974 set forth group eligibility criteria. Under TAA, 
     the Secretary must certify a group of workers as eligible to 
     apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance if he determines (1) 
     that a significant number or proportion of the workers in 
     such workers' firm have become or are threatened to become 
     totally or partially separated; (2) sales or production of 
     such firm have decreased absolutely; and (3) imports of 
     articles like or directly competitive with articles produced 
     by such workers' firm contributed importantly to the total or 
     partial separation or threat thereof, and to the decline in 
     sales or production. Under NAFTA-TAA, group eligibility may 
     be based on the same criteria set forth in section 222, but 
     section 250 also provides for NAFTA-TAA eligibility where 
     there has been a shift in production by the workers' firm to 
     Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive 
     with articles which are produced by the firm. Section 222 
     also includes special eligibility provisions with respect to 
     oil and natural gas producers.
     House amendment
       The House Amendment at Section 113 expanded the Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance programs to secondary workers that are 
     suppliers to firms that were certified and which satisfied 
     certain conditions.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment creates a new section 
     231 under which the eligibility criteria are revised. First, 
     workers are eligible for TAA if the value or volume of 
     imports of articles like or directly competitive with 
     articles produced by that firm have increased and the 
     increase in the value or volume of imports contributed 
     importantly to the workers' separation or threat of 
     separation. Second, eligibility is extended to workers who 
     are separated due to shifts in production to any country, 
     rather than only when the shift in production is to Mexico or 
     Canada. Third, eligibility is extended to adversely affected 
     secondary workers. Eligible secondary workers include workers 
     in supplier firms and, with respect to trade with NAFTA 
     countries, downstream firms. Fourth, a new special 
     eligibility provision is added with respect to taconite 
     pellets.
     Conference agreement
       The Conferees agree to extend coverage of Trade Adjustment 
     Assistance to new categories of workers: 1) secondary workers 
     that supply directly to another firm component parts for 
     articles that were the basis for a certification of 
     eligibility, 2) downstream workers that were affected by 
     trade with Mexico or Canada, and 3) certain workers that have 
     been laid off because their firm has shifted its production 
     to another country that has a free trade agreement with the 
     United States, that has a unilaterally preferential trading 
     arrangement with the United States, or when there has been or 
     is likely to be an increase in imports of the relevant 
     articles.


  sec. 114--qualifying requirements for trade readjustment allowances

     Present law
       Current section 231 establishes qualifying requirements 
     that must be met in order for an individual worker within a 
     certified group to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance. In 
     order to receive trade readjustment allowances, a certified 
     worker must have been separated on or after the eligibility 
     date established in the certification but within 2 years of 
     the date of the certification determination; been employed 
     for at least 26 of the 52 weeks preceding the separation at 
     wages of $30 or more a week; be eligible for and have 
     exhausted unemployment insurance benefits; not be 
     disqualified for extended compensation payable under the 
     Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 
     by reason of the work acceptance and job search requirements 
     in section 202(a)(3) of that Act; and be enrolled in a 
     training program approved by the Secretary of Labor or have 
     received a training waiver.
     House amendment
       The House Amendment at Section 114 provided for 
     requirements and deadlines for workers to enroll in training.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new section 235 
     which maintains the individual eligibility requirements in 
     current law, with the exception of revisions to provisions 
     governing bases for granting training waivers.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House, with a change to adopt a 
     training enrollment deadline of 16 weeks after separation.


               sec. 115--waivers of training requirements

     Present law
       Section 231 sets forth permissible bases for granting a 
     training waiver. Pursuant to section 250(d), training waivers 
     are not available in the NAFTA-TAA program.
     House amendment
       The House Amendment provides that all workers who are 
     eligible to apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance may be 
     considered for training waivers and codifies several bases on 
     which the Secretary may grant a waiver.
     Senate Amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new section 235 
     which provides that all workers who are eligible to apply for 
     Trade Adjustment Assistance may be considered for training 
     waivers and codifies several bases on which the Secretary may 
     grant a waiver.
     Conference agreement
       The House receded to the Senate with a change to delete the 
     Senate provision giving the Secretary discretion to grant 
     waivers for ``other'' reasons.


  sec. 116--amendments to limitations on trade readjustment allowances

     Present law
       Current section 233 provides that each certified worker may 
     receive trade readjustment allowances for a maximum of 52 
     weeks. Current law also provides that, in most circumstances, 
     a worker is treated as participating in training during any 
     week which is part of a break in training that does not 
     exceed 14 days.
     House amendment
       Section 116 of the House Amendment would add 26 weeks of 
     trade adjustment allowances for those workers who were in 
     training and required the extension of benefits for the 
     purpose of completing training.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new section 23 7 
     which increases the maximum time period during which a worker 
     may receive trade adjustment allowances to 78 weeks, extends 
     the permissible duration of a break in training to 30 days, 
     and provides for an additional 26 weeks of income support for 
     workers requiring remedial education. Section 237 also 
     clarifies that the requirement that a worker exhaust 
     unemployment insurance benefits prior to receiving trade 
     adjustment allowances does not apply to any extension of 
     unemployment insurance by a State using its own funds that 
     extends beyond either the 26 week period mandated by Federal 
     law or any additional period provided for under the Federal-
     State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 (26 
     U.S.C. 3304 note).
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.


         sec. 117--annual total amount of payments for training

     Present law

     under which training is available to eligible workers; 
     permits the Secretary of Labor to approve certain 
     specified types of training programs and to pay the costs 
     of approved training and certain supplemental costs, 
     including subsistence and transportation costs, for 
     eligible workers; and caps total annual funding for 
     training under the TAA for workers program at $80 million. 
     Section 250 separately caps training expenditures under 
     the NAFTA-TAA program at $30 million annually.
     House amendment
       The House provided $30 million additional funds for the 
     Trade Adjustment Assistance program. Combined with NAFTA 
     Trade Adjustment Assistance, the total training funds 
     available were $140 million.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new section 240 
     which sets the total funds available for training 
     expenditures under the unified TAA for workers program to 
     $300 million annually.

     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new section 240 
     which revises the list of training programs which the 
     Secretary may approve to include customized training. It also 
     adds a new section 237, which clarifies that the prohibition 
     on payment of trade adjustment allowances to a worker 
     receiving on-the-job training does not apply to a worker 
     enrolled in a non-paid customized training program.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.

                      ASSISTANCE FOR OLDER WORKERS

     Present law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new section 243 
     which directs the Secretary of Labor, within one year of 
     enactment, to establish a two-year wage insurance pilot 
     program under which a State uses the funds provided to the 
     State for Trade Adjustment allowances to pay to an adversely 
     affected worker certified under section 231, for a period not 
     to exceed two years, a wage subsidy of up to 50 percent of 
     the difference between the wages received by the adversely 
     affected worker from reemployment and the wages received by 
     the adversely affected worker at the time of separation. An 
     adversely affected worker may be eligible to receive a wage 
     subsidy if the worker obtains reemployment not more than 26 
     weeks after the date of separation from the adversely 
     affected employment, is at least 50 years of age, earns not 
     more than $50,000 a year in wages from reemployment, is 
     employed at least 30 hours a week in the reemployment, and 
     does not return to the employment from which the worker was 
     separated. The wage subsidy available to workers in the wage 
     insurance program is 50 percent of the difference between the 
     amount of the wages received by the worker from reemployment 
     and the amount of the wages received by the worker at the 
     time of separation, if the wages the worker receives from 
     reemployment are less than $40,000 a year. The wage subsidy 
     is 25 percent if the wages received by the worker from 
     reemployment are greater than $40,000 a year but not more 
     than $50,000 a year. Total payments made to an adversely 
     affected worker under the wage insurance program may not 
     exceed $5,000 in each year of the 2-year period. A worker 
     participating in the wage insurance program is not eligible 
     to receive any other Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits, 
     unless the Secretary of Labor determines that the worker has 
     shown circumstances that warrant eligibility for training 
     benefits under section 240.
     Conference agreement
       The Conferees agree to create a new alternative Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance program for older workers.


          SEC. 125--DECLARATIONS OF POLICY; SENSE OF CONGRESS

     Present law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       The House passed amendment included a declaration of policy 
     and Sense of the Congress related to the responsibility of 
     the Secretary of Labor to provide information to workers 
     related to benefits available to them under the TAA and other 
     federal programs.
     Senate amendment
       Although certain supportive services are available to 
     dislocated workers under WIA, current law makes no express 
     linkage between these services and Trade Adjustment 
     Assistance and TAA certified workers may not be able to 
     access them. Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new 
     section 243 which provides that States may apply for and the 
     Secretary of Labor may make available to adversely affected 
     workers certified under the Trade Adjustment Assistance 
     program supportive services available under WIA, including 
     transportation, child care, and dependent care, that are 
     necessary to enable a worker to participate in or complete 
     training. Section 243 requires the Comptroller General to 
     conduct a study of all assistance provided by the Federal 
     Government for workers facing job loss and economic distress; 
     to submit a report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate 
     and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
     Representatives on the study within one year of enactment of 
     this Act; and to distribute the report to all WIA one-stop 
     partners. Section 243 further provides that each State may 
     conduct a study of its assistance programs for workers facing 
     job loss and economic distress. Each State is eligible for a 
     grant from the Secretary of Labor, not to exceed $50,000, to 
     enable it to conduct the study. In the event that a grant is 
     awarded, the State must, within one year of receiving the 
     grant, provide its report to the Committee on Finance and the 
     Committee on Ways and Means and distribute its report to one-
     stop partners in the State.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.

           Subtitle B--Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms


    SEC. 131--REAUTHORIZATION OF TRADE ADJUSTMENT FOR FIRMS PROGRAM

     Present law
       The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms program provides 
     technical assistance to qualifying firms. Current Title II, 
     Chapter 3, section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides that 
     a firm is eligible to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance 
     under this program if (1) a significant number or proportion 
     of its workers have become or are threatened to become 
     totally or partially separated; (2) sales or production, or 
     both, have decreased absolutely; and (3) increases of imports 
     of articles like or directly competitive with articles which 
     are produced by such firms contributed importantly to the 
     total or partial separations or threat thereof.

[[Page H5921]]

       The authorization for the Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     Firms program expired on September 30, 2001. The TAA for 
     Firms program is currently subject to annual appropriations 
     and is funded as part of the budget of the Economic 
     Development Administration in the Department of Commerce.
     House amendment
       The House passed amendment included a 2 year 
     reauthorization for Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms.
     Senate amendment
       Section 201 of the Senate Amendment reauthorizes the Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance for Firms program for fiscal years 2002 
     through 2007; expands the definition of qualifying firms to 
     cover shifts in production; and authorizes appropriations to 
     the Department of Commerce in the amount of $16 million 
     annually for fiscal years 2002 through 2007 to carry out the 
     purposes of the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms 
     program.
     Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate on the issue of providing a 
     $16 million authorization for Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     Firms and reauthorizing the program through September 30, 
     2007.

       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       Section 401 of the Senate Amendment adds new sections 292-
     298 of the Trade Act of 1974 which create a Trade Adjustment 
     Assistance program for farmers and ranchers in the Department 
     of Agriculture. Under this section, a group of agricultural 
     commodity producers may petition the Secretary of Agriculture 
     for Trade Adjustment Assistance. The Secretary must certify 
     the group as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     farmers if it is determined that the national average price 
     in the most recent marketing year for the commodity produced 
     by the group is less than 80 percent of the national average 
     price in the preceding 5 marketing years and that increases 
     in imports of that commodity contributed importantly to the 
     decline in price.
     Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate with changes. The Conferees 
     agree to include limitations on eligibility based upon 
     adjusted gross income and counter-cyclical payment 
     limitations set forth in the Food Security Act of 1985.

     fishermen in the Department of Commerce. Under this program, 
     a group of fishermen may petition the Secretary of Commerce 
     for Trade Adjustment Assistance. The Secretary must certify 
     the group as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     fishermen if it is determined that the national average price 
     in the most recent marketing year for the fish produced by 
     the group is less than 80 percent of the national average 
     price in the proceeding five marketing years and that 
     increases in imports of that fish contributed importantly to 
     the decline in price.
     Conference agreement
       Conferees agree to drop Senate Amendment and authorize a 
     study by the Department of Labor to investigate applying TAA 
     to fisherman.

  TITLE II--CREDIT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS


 SEC. 201(a) AND 202. CREDIT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS OF INDIVIDUALS 
RECEIVING A TRADE READJUSTMENT ALLOWANCE OR A BENEFIT FROM THE PENSION 
  BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION; ADVANCE PAYMENT OF CREDIT FOR HEALTH 
                INSURANCE COSTS OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS

     Present Law
       Under present law, the tax treatment of health insurance 
     expenses depends on the individual's circumstances. In 
     general, employer contributions to an accident or health plan 
     are excludable from an employee's gross income (sec. 106).
       Self-employed individuals are entitled to deduct a portion 
     of the amount paid for health insurance expenses for the 
     individual and his or her spouse and dependents. The 
     percentage of deductible expenses is 70 percent in 2002 and 
     100 percent in 2003 and thereafter.
       Individuals other than self-employed individuals who 
     purchase their own health insurance and itemize deductions 
     may deduct their expenses to the extent that their total 
     medical expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
       Present law does not provide a tax credit for the purchase 
     of health insurance.
       The health care continuation rules (commonly referred to as 
     ``COBRA'' rules, after the Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
     Reconciliation Act of 1985 in which they were enacted) 
     require that employer-sponsored group health plans of 
     employers with 20 or more employees must offer certain 
     covered employees and their dependents (``qualified 
     beneficiaries'') the option of purchasing continued health 
     coverage in the event of loss of coverage resulting from 
     certain qualifying events. These qualifying events include: 
     termination or reduction in hours of employment, death, 
     divorce or legal separation, enrollment in Medicare, the 
     bankruptcy of the employer, or the end of a child's 
     dependency under a parent's health plan. In general, the 
     maximum period of COBRA coverage is 18 months. An employer is 
     permitted to charge qualified beneficiaries 102 percent of 
     the applicable premium for COBRA coverage.
       Under present law, individuals without access to COBRA are 
     able to purchase individual policies on a guaranteed issue 
     basis without exclusion of coverage for pre-existing 
     conditions if they had 18 months of creditable coverage 
     under an employer sponsored group health plan, 
     governmental plan, or a church plan. Those with access to 
     COBRA are required to exhaust their 18 months of COBRA 
     prior to obtaining a policy on a guaranteed issue basis 
     without exclusion of coverage for pre-existing conditions.
     House amendment
       The House bill provides a refundable tax credit for up to 
     60 percent of the expenses of an eligible individual for 
     qualified health insurance coverage of the eligible 
     individual and his or her spouse or dependents. Eligible 
     individuals are certain TAA eligible workers and PBGC pension 
     beneficiaries. In the case of TAA eligible workers, no more 
     than 12 months of coverage would be eligible for the credit. 
     The amount of the credit would be phased out for taxpayers 
     with modified adjusted gross income between $20,000 and 
     $40,000 for single taxpayers ($40,000 and $80,000 for married 
     taxpayers filing a joint return). The credit would be 
     available on an advance basis pursuant to a program to be 
     established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Insurance that 
     qualifies for the credit includes certain COBRA coverage and 
     certain individual market options.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment provides a refundable credit for 70 
     percent of qualified health insurance expenses. The credit is 
     available with respect to certain TAA eligible workers. The 
     credit is payable on an advance basis pursuant to a program 
     to be established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Insurance 
     that qualifies for the credit includes certain COBRA 
     coverage, certain State-based options, and individual health 
     insurance if certain requirements are satisfied.
     Conference agreement
       Refundable health insurance credit: in general
       In the case of taxpayers who are eligible individuals, the 
     conference agreement provides a refundable tax credit for 65 
     percent of the taxpayer's expenses for qualified health 
     insurance of the taxpayer and qualifying family members for 
     each eligible coverage month beginning in the taxable year. 
     The credit is available only with respect to amounts paid by 
     the taxpayer.
       Qualifying family members are the taxpayer's spouse and any 
     dependent of the taxpayer with respect to whom the taxpayer 
     is entitled to claim a dependency exemption.\1\ Any 
     individual who has other specified coverage is not a 
     qualifying family member.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ Present law allows the custodial parent to release the 
     right to claim the dependency exemption for a child to the 
     noncustodial parent. In addition, if certain requirements are 
     met, the parents may decide by ageement that the noncustodial 
     parent is entitled to the dependency exemption with respect 
     to a child. In such cases, the provision would treat the 
     child as the dependent of the custodial parent for purposes 
     of the credit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Persons eligible for the credit
       Eligibility for the credit is determined on a monthly 
     basis. In general, an eligible coverage month is any month 
     if, as of the first

[[Page H5922]]

     day of the month, the taxpayer (1) is an eligible individual, 
     (2) is covered by qualified health insurance, (3) does not 
     have other specified coverage, and (4) is not imprisoned 
     under Federal, State, or local authority. In the case of a 
     joint return, the eligibility requirements are met if at 
     least one spouse satisfies the requirements. An eligible 
     month must begin more than 90 days after the date of 
     enactment.
       An eligible individual is (1) an eligible TAA recipient, 
     (2) an eligible alternative TAA recipient, and (3) an 
     eligible PBGC pension recipient.
       An individual is an eligible TAA recipient during any month 
     if the individual (1) is receiving for any day of such month 
     a trade adjustment allowance \2\ or who would be eligible to 
     receive such an allowance but for the requirement that the 
     individual exhaust unemployment benefits before being 
     eligible to receive an allowance and (2) with respect to such 
     allowance, is covered under a certification issued under 
     subchapter A or D of chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act 
     of 1974. An individual is treated as an eligible TAA 
     recipient during the first month that such individual would 
     otherwise cease to be an eligible TAA recipient.

     \2\ Part I of subchapter B, or subchapter D, of chapter 2 of 
     title II of the Trade Act of 1974.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       An individual is an eligible alternative TAA recipient 
     during any month if the individual (1) is a worker described 
     in section 246(a)(3)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974 who is 
     participating in the program established under section 
     246(a)(1) of such Act, and (2) is receiving a benefit for 
     such month under section 246(a)(2) of such Act. An individual 
     is treated as an eligible alternative TAA recipient during 
     the first month that such individual would otherwise cease to 
     be an eligible TAA recipient.
       An individual is a PBGC pension recipient for any month if 
     he or she (1) is age 55 or over as of the first day of the 
     month, and (2) is receiving a benefit any portion of which is 
     paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC).
       An otherwise eligible taxpayer is not eligible for the 
     credit for a month if, as of the first day of the month the 
     individual has other specified coverage. Specified coverage 
     would be (1) coverage under any insurance which constitutes 
     medical care (expect for insurance substantially all of the 
     coverage of which is for excepted benefits) \3\ if at least 
     50 percent of the cost of the coverage is paid by an employer 
     \4\ (or former employer) of the individual or his or her 
     spouse or (2) coverage under certain governmental health 
     programs.\5\ A rule aggregating plans of the same employer 
     applies in determining whether the employer pays at least 50 
     percent of the cost of coverage. A person is not an eligible 
     individual if he or she may be claimed as a dependent on 
     another person's tax return. A special rule applies with 
     respect to alternative TAA recipients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ Excepted benefits are: (1) coverage only for accident or 
     disability income or any combination thereof, (2) coverage 
     issued as a supplement to liability insurance; (3) liability 
     insurance, including general liability insurance and 
     automobile liability insurance; (4) worker's compensation or 
     similar insurance; (5) automobile medical payment insurance; 
     (6) credit-only insurance; (7) coverage for on-site medical 
     clinics; (8) other insurance coverage similar to the 
     coverages in (1)-(7) specified in regulations under which 
     benefits for medical care are secondary or incidental to 
     other insurance benefits; (9) limited scope dental or vision 
     benefits; (10) benefits for long-term care, nursing home 
     care, home health care, community-based care, or any 
     combination thereof. and (11) other benefits similar to those 
     in (9) and (10) as specified in regulations. (12) coverage 
     only for a specified disease or illness; (13) hospital 
     indemnity or other fixed indemnity insurance; and (14) 
     Medicare supplemental insurance.
     \4\ An amount would be considered paid by the employer if it 
     is excludable from income. Thus. for example, amounts paid 
     for health coverage on a salary reduction basis under an 
     employer plan are considered paid by the employer.
     \5\ Specifically, an individual would not be eligible for the 
     credit if, as of the first day of the month, the individual 
     is (1) entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A, enrolled 
     in Medicare Part B, or enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP, (2) 
     enrolled in a health benefits plan under the Federal 
     Employees Health Benefit Plan, or (3) entitled to receive 
     benefits under chapter 55 of title 10 of the United States 
     Code (relating to military personnel). An individual is not 
     considered to be enrolled in Medicaid solely by reason of 
     receiving immunizations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Qualified health insurance
       Qualified health insurance eligible for the credit is: (1) 
     COBRA continuation coverage; (2) State based continuation 
     coverage provided by the State under a State law that 
     requires such coverage; (3) coverage offered through a 
     qualified State high risk pool; (4) coverage under a health 
     insurance program offered to State employees or a comparable 
     program; (5) coverage through an arrangement entered into by 
     the State and a group health plan, an issuer of health 
     insurance coverage, an administrator, or an employer; (6) 
     coverage offered through a State arrangement with a private 
     sector health care coverage purchasing pool; (7) coverage 
     under a State-operated health plan that does not receive any 
     Federal financial participation; (8) coverage under a group 
     health plan that is available through the employment of the 
     eligible individual's spouse; and (9) coverage under 
     individual health insurance if the eligible individual was 
     covered under individual health insurance during the entire 
     30-day period that ends on the date the individual became 
     separated from the employment which qualified the individual 
     for the TAA allowance, the benefit for an eligible 
     alternative TAA recipient, or a pension benefit from the 
     PBGC, whichever applies.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \6\ For this purpose, ``individual health insurance'' means 
     any insurance which constitutes medical care offered to 
     individuals other than in connection with a group health 
     plan. Such term does not include Federal- or State-based 
     health insurance coverage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Qualified health insurance does not include any State-based 
     coverage (i.e., coverage described in (2)-(8) in the 
     preceding paragraph), unless the State has elected to have 
     such coverage treated as qualified health insurance and such 
     coverage meets certain requirements. Such State coverage must 
     provide that each qualifying individual is guaranteed 
     enrollment if the individual pays the premium for enrollment 
     or provides a qualified health insurance costs eligibility 
     certificate and pays the remainder of the premium. In 
     addition, the State-based coverage cannot impose any pre-
     existing condition limitation with respect to qualifying 
     individuals. State-based coverage cannot require a qualifying 
     individual to pay a premium or contribution that is greater 
     than the premium or contribution for a similarly situated 
     individual who is not a qualified individual. Finally, 
     benefits under the State-based coverage must the same as (or 
     substantially similar to) benefits provided to similarly 
     situated individuals who are not a qualified individuals. A 
     qualifying *individual is an eligible 'individual who seeks 
     to enroll in the State-based coverage and who has aggregate 
     periods of creditable coverage \7\ of three months or longer, 
     does not have other specified coverage, and who is not 
     imprisoned. A qualifying individual also includes qualified 
     family members of such an eligible individual.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \7\ Creditable coverage is determined under the Health Care 
     Portability and Accountability Act (Code sec. 9801 (c)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Qualified health insurance does not include coverage under 
     a flexible spending or similar arrangement or any insurance 
     if substantially all of the coverage is of excepted benefits.
       Other rules
       Amounts taken into account in determining the credit could 
     not be taken into account in determining the amount allowable 
     under the itemized deduction for medical expenses or the 
     deduction for health insurance expenses of self-employed 
     individuals. Amounts distributed from a medical savings 
     account would not be eligible for the credit. The amount of 
     the credit is reduced by any credit received on an advance 
     basis. Married taxpayers filing separate returns are eligible 
     for the credit; however, if both spouses are eligible 
     individuals and the spouses file a separate return, then the 
     spouse of the taxpayer is not a qualifying family member.
       The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to prescribe 
     such regulations and other guidance as may be necessary or 
     appropriate to carry out the provision.
       Advance payment of refundable health insurance credit; 
           reporting requirements
       The conference agreement provides for payment of the credit 
     on an advance basis (i.e., prior to the filing of the 
     taxpayer's return) pursuant to a program to be established by 
     the Secretary of the Treasury no later than August 1, 2003. 
     Such program is to provide for making payments on behalf of 
     certified individuals to providers of qualified health 
     insurance. In order to receive the credit on an advance 
     basis, a qualified health insurance costs credit eligibility 
     certificate would have to be in effect for the taxpayer. A 
     qualified health insurance costs credit eligibility 
     certificate is a written statement that an individual is an 
     eligible individual for purposes of the credit, provides such 
     information as the Secretary of the Treasury may require, and 
     is provided by the Secretary of Labor or the PBGC (as 
     appropriate) or such other person or entity designated by the 
     Secretary.
       The conference report permits the disclosure of return 
     information of certified individuals to providers of health 
     insurance information to the extent necessary to carry out 
     the advance payment mechanism.
       The conference report provides that any person who receives 
     payments during a calendar year for qualified health 
     insurance and claims a reimbursement for an advance credit 
     amount is to file an information return with respect to each 
     individual from whom such payments were received or for whom 
     such a reimbursement is claimed. The return is to be in such 
     form as the Secretary may prescribe and is to contain the 
     name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the 
     individual and any other individual on the same health 
     insurance policy, the aggregate of the advance credit amounts 
     provided, the number of months for which advance credit 
     amounts are provided, and such other information as the 
     Secretary may prescribe. The conference report requires that 
     similar information be provided to the individual no later 
     than January 31 of the year following the year for which the 
     information return is made.

                             Effective Date

       The provision is generally effective with respect to 
     taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. The 
     provision relating to the advance payment mechanism to be 
     developed by the Secretary would be effective on the date of 
     enactment.

SEC. 311--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR NONCOMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, 
         COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, AND AIR AND MARINE INTERDICTION

     Present law
       The statutory basis for authorization of appropriations for 
     Customs is section 301 (b)(1) of the Customs Procedural and 
     Simplification Act of 1978 (19 U.S.C. 2075(b)). That law, as 
     amended by section 8102 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
     Act of 1986 [P.L. 99-509], first outlined separate amounts 
     for non-commercial and commercial operations for the salaries 
     and expenses portion of the Customs authorization. Under 19 
     U.S.C. 2075, Congress has adopted a two-year authorization 
     process to provide Customs with guidance as it plans its 
     budget, as well as guidance from the Committee for the 
     appropriation process.
       The most recent authorization of appropriations for Customs 
     (under section 101 of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 [P.L. 
     101 382]) provided $118,238,000 for salaries and expenses and 
     $143,047,000 for air and marine interdiction program for FY 
     1991, and $1,247,884,000 for salaries and expenses and

     the Customs Service. It also authorizes $1,642,602,000 for FY 
     2003 and $1,683,667,050 for FY 2004 for commercial operations 
     of the Customs Service. Of the amounts authorized for 
     commercial operations, $308,000,000 is authorized for the 
     automated commercial environment computer system for each 
     fiscal year. The provisions require that the Customs Service 
     provide the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on 
     Finance of the Senate with a report demonstrating that the 
     computer system is being built in a cost-effective manner. In 
     addition, the provisions authorizes $170,829,000 for FY 2003 
     and $175,099,725 for FY 2004 for air and marine interdiction 
     operations of the Customs Service. The provision requires 
     submission of out-of-year budget projections to the Ways and 
     Means and Finance Committees.
     Senate amendment
       This provision authorizes $886,513,000 for FY 2003 and

     Customs Service. It also authorizes $1,603,482,000 for FY 
     2003 and $1,645,009,000 for FY 2004 for commercial operations 
     of the Customs Service. Of the amounts authorized for 
     commercial operations, $308,000,000 is authorized for the 
     automated commercial environment computer system for each 
     fiscal year. The provisions require that the Customs Service 
     provide the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on 
     Finance of the Senate with a report demonstrating that the

     addition, the provisions authorizes $181,860,000 for FY 2003 
     and $186,570,000 for FY 2004 for air and marine interdiction 
     operations of the Customs Service. The provision requires 
     submission of out-of-year budget projections to the Ways and 
     Means and Finance Committees.

     and would allow for the acquisition of new updated technology 
     not anticipated when this bill was drafted. Nothing in the 
     language of the bill is intended to prevent the Commissioner 
     of Customs from dedicating resources to specific ports not 
     identified in the bill.

     immunity in civil suits brought by persons, who were searched 
     upon arrival in the United States. Qualified immunity 
     protects officers from liability if they can establish that 
     their actions did not violate any clearly established 
     constitutional or statutory rights.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would protect 
     Customs officers by providing them immunity from lawsuits 
     stemming from personal searches of people entering the 
     country so long as the officers conduct the searches in good 
     faith.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes to the House, but conferees qualify the 
     provision by adding that the means used to effectuate such 
     searches must be reasonable. To be covered by this immunity 
     provision, inspectors must follow Customs Service inspection 
     rules including the rule against profiling against race, 
     religions, or ethnic background.


SEC. 342--emergency adjustments to offices, ports of entry, or staffing 
                         of the customs service

     Present law
       Present law places numerous restrictions on and, in some 
     instances, precludes the Secretary of the Treasury or Customs 
     from making any adjustments to ports and staff. 19 U.S.C. 
     1318 requires a Presidential proclamation of an emergency and 
     authorization to the Secretary of the Treasury only to extend 
     the time for performance of legally required acts during an 
     emergency. No other emergency powers statute for Customs 
     exists.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would permit 
     the Secretary of the Treasury, if the President declares a 
     national emergency or if necessary to address specific 
     threats to human life or national interests, to eliminate, 
     consolidate, or relocate Customs ports and offices and to 
     alter staffing levels, services rendered and hours of 
     operations at those locations. In addition, the amendment 
     would permit the Commissioner of Customs, when necessary to 
     address threats to human life or national interests, to close 
     temporarily any Customs office or port or take any other 
     lesser action necessary to respond to the specific threat. 
     The Secretary or the Commissioner would be required to notify 
     Congress of any action taken under this proposal within 72 
     hours.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House Amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


 SEC. 343 & 343A--mandatory advanced electronic information for cargo 
           and passengers; secure systems of transportation.

     Present law
       Currently, commercial carriers bringing passengers or cargo 
     into or out of the country have no obligation to provide 
     Customs with such information in advance.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would require 
     every air, land, or water-based commercial carrier to file an 
     electronic manifest describing all passengers with Customs 
     before entering or leaving the country. There is a similar 
     requirement for cargo entering the country. Specific 
     information required in the advanced manifest system would be 
     developed by Treasury in regulations.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is similar to the House Amendment. 
     However, with respect to cargo, the Senate Amendment applies 
     to out-bound as well as in-bound shipments.
     Conference agreement
       The conferees agree to direct the Secretary of the Treasury 
     to promulgate regulations pertaining to the electronic 
     transmission to the Customs Service of information relevant 
     to aviation, maritime, and surface transportation safety and 
     security prior to a cargo carrier's arrival in or departure 
     from the United States. The agreement sets forth parameters 
     for the Secretary to follow in developing these regulations. 
     For example, the parameters require that the regulations be 
     flexible with respect to the commercial and operational 
     aspects of different modes of transportation. They also 
     require that, in general, the Customs Service seek 
     information from parties most likely to have direct knowledge 
     of the information at issue. The conferees also agree to 
     amendment of the Tariff Act of 1930 to establish requirements 
     concerning proper documentation of ocean-bound cargo prior to 
     a vessel's departure. Finally, the conferees agree to direct 
     the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a task force to 
     evaluate, prototype and certify secure systems of 
     transportation.


 SEC. 344--border search authority for certain contraband in outbound 
                                 mail.

     Present law
       Although Customs currently searches all inbound mail, and 
     although it searches outbound mail sent via private carriers, 
     outbound mail carried by the Postal Service is not subject to 
     search.

[[Page H5925]]

     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would enable 
     Customs officers to search outbound U.S. mail for unreported 
     monetary instruments, weapons of mass destruction, firearms, 
     and other contraband used by terrorists. However, reading of 
     mail would not be authorized absent Customs officers 
     obtaining a search warrant or consent.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is the same as the House Amendment 
     with respect to mail weighing in excess of 16 ounces. 
     However, under the Senate Amendment, the Customs Service 
     would be required to obtain a warrant in order to search mail 
     weighing 16 ounces or less. The Senate Amendment also 
     requires the Secretary of State to determine whether it is 
     consistent with international law and U.S. treaty obligations 
     for the Customs Service to search mail transiting the United 
     States between two foreign countries. The Customs Service 
     would be authorized to search such mail only after the 
     Secretary of State determined that such measures are 
     consistent with international law and U.S. treaty 
     obligations.
     Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate.


   sec. 345--Authorization of appropriations for reestablishment of 
                  Customs operations in New York City

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House authorizes 
     funds to reestablish those operations.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.

              CHAPTER 5--TEXTILE TRANSSHIPMENT PROVISIONS


  sec. 351--gao audit of textile transshipment monitoring by customs 
                                service

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would direct 
     the Comptroller General to conduct an audit of the systems at 
     the Customs Service to monitor and enforce textile 
     transshipment. The Comptroller General would report on 
     recommendations for improvements.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


  sec. 352--authorization of appropriations for textile transshipment 
                         enforcement operations

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would 
     authorize $9,500,000 for FY 2002 to the Customs Service for 
     the purpose of enhancing its textile transshipment 
     enforcement operations. This amount would be in addition to 
     Customs Service's base authorization and the authorization to 
     reestablish the destroyed textile monitoring and enforcement 
     operations at the World Trade Center.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House, but the text is clarified 
     to provide that personnel will also conduct education and 
     outreach in addition to enforcement.


   sec. 353--implementation of the african growth and opportunity act

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would earmark 
     approximately $1.3 million within Customs' budget for 
     selected activities related to providing technical assistance 
     to help sub-Saharan African countries develop and implement 
     effective visa and anti-transshipment systems as required by 
     the African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 
     106-200).
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.

      Subtitle B--Office of the United States Trade Representative


               sec. 361--authorization of appropriations

     Present law
       The statutory authority for budget authorization for the 
     Office of the United States Trade Representative is section 
     141(g)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2171(g)(1)). 
     The most recent authorization of appropriations for USTR was 
     under section 101 of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 [P.L. 
     101-382]. Under 19 U.S.C. 2171, Congress has adopted a two-
     year authorization process to provide USTR with guidance as 
     it plans its budget as well as guidance from the Committee 
     for the appropriation process.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House authorizes 
     $32,300,000 for FY 2003 and $31,108,000 for FY 2004. The 
     provision requires submission of out-of-year budget 
     projections to the Ways and Means and Finance Committees. In 
     light of the substantial increase in trade negotiation work 
     to be conducted by USTR and the associated need for 
     consultations with Congress, this provision would authorize 
     the addition of two individuals to assist the office of 
     Congressional Affairs.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment authorizes $30,000,000 for FY 2003 and 
     $31,000,000 for FY 2004.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.

        Subtitle C--United States International Trade Commission


               sec. 371--authorization of appropriations

     Present law
       The statutory authority for budget authorization for the 
     International Trade Commission is section 330(e)(2)(A) of the 
     Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1330(e)(2)(A)). The most recent 
     authorization of appropriations for the ITC was under section 
     101 of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 [P.L. 101-382]. 
     Under 19 U.S.C. 1330, Congress has adopted a two-year 
     authorization process to provide the ITC with guidance as it 
     plans its budget as well as guidance from the Committees for 
     the appropriation process.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House authorizes 
     $54,000,000 for FY 2003 and $57,240,000 for FY 2004. The 
     provision requires submission of out-of-year budget 
     projections to the Ways and Means and Finance Committees.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment authorizes $51,400,000 for FY 2003 and 
     $53,400,000 for FY 2004.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.

                   Subtitle D--Other Trade Provisions


  sec. 381. increase in aggregate value of articles exempt from duty 
               acquired abroad by united states residents

     Present law
       The Harmonized Tariff Schedule at subheading 9804.00.65 
     currently provides a $400 duty exemption for travelers 
     returning from abroad.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would 
     increased the current $400 duty exemption to $800.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


                 sec. 382--regulatory audit procedures

     Present law
       Section 509 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1509) 
     provides the authority for Customs to audit persons making 
     entry of merchandise into the U.S. In the course of such 
     audit, Customs auditors may identify discrepancies, including 
     underpayments of duties. However, if there also are 
     overpayments, there is no requirement that such overpayments 
     be offset against the underpayments if the underlying entry 
     has been liquidated.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would require 
     that when conducting an audit, Customs must recognize and 
     offset overpayments and overdeclarations of duties, 
     quantities and values against underpayments and 
     underdeclarations. As an example, if during an audit Customs 
     finds that an importer has underpaid duties associated with 
     one entry of merchandise by $100 but has also overpaid duties 
     from another entry of merchandise by $25, then any assessment 
     by Customs must be the difference of $75.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


                  sec. 383--payment of duties and fees

     Present law
       Current law at 19 U.S.C. 1505 provides for the collection 
     of duties by the Secretary through regulatory process.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would require 
     duties to be paid within 10 working days without extension. 
     The bill also provides for the Customs Service to create a 
     monthly billing system upon the building of the Automated 
     Commercial Environment.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.

[[Page H5926]]

     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes to the House.

            DIVISION B--BIPARTISAN TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY

                  TITLE XXI--TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY


                  sec. 2101--short title and findings

     Present law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       The short title of the bill is the ``Bipartisan Trade 
     Promotion Authority Act of 2001.'' Section 2101 of the House 
     amendment to H.R. 3009 states that Congress finds the 
     expansion of international trade is vital to U.S. national 
     security and economic growth, as well as U.S. leadership. 
     Section 2101 also states that the recent pattern of decisions 
     by dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body of the 
     World Trade Organization to impose obligations and 
     restrictions on the use of antidumping and countervailing 
     measures by WTO members has raised concerns, and Congress is 
     concerned that such bodies appropriately apply the standard 
     of review contained in Article 17.6 of the Antidumping 
     Agreement, to provide deference to a permissible 
     interpretation by a WTO member and to the evaluation by a 
     member of the facts where that evaluation is unbiased and 
     objective and the establishment of the facts is proper.
     Senate amendment
       The short title of the bill is the ``Bipartisan Trade 
     Promotion Authority Act of 2002.'' Section 2101 of the Senate 
     amendment to H.R. 3009 states that Congress finds the 
     expansion of international trade is vital to U.S. national 
     security and economic growth, as well as U.S. leadership. 
     Section 2101 also states that support for continued trade 
     expansion requires that dispute settlement procedures under 
     international trade agreements not add to or diminish the 
     rights and obligations provided in such agreements. It goes 
     on to note a troubling pattern of cases before WTO dispute 
     settlement panels and the WTO Appellate Body that do 
     precisely that.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House with modifications. With 
     respect to the findings, the Conferees believe that, as 
     stated in section 2101(b) of the Conference agreement, 
     support for continued trade expansion requires that dispute 
     settlement procedures under international trade agreements 
     not add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in 
     such agreements. Therefore, the recent pattern of decisions 
     by dispute settlement panels and the WTO Appellate Body to 
     impose obligations and restrictions on the use of 
     antidumping, countervailing and safeguard measures by WTO 
     members has raised concerns, and Congress is concerned that 
     such bodies appropriately apply the standard of review 
     contained in Article 17.6 of the Antidumping Agreement, to 
     provide deference to a permissible interpretation by a WTO 
     member and to the evaluation by a member of the facts where 
     that evaluation is unbiased and objective and the 
     establishment of the facts is proper.


                sec. 2102--trade negotiating objectives

     Present/expired law
       Section 1101(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness 
     Act of 1988 (the 1988 Act) set forth overall negotiating 
     objectives for concluding trade agreements. These objectives 
     were to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market 
     access, the reduction or elimination of barriers and other 
     trade-distorting policies and practices, and a more effective 
     system of international trading disciplines and procedures. 
     Section 1102(b) set forth the following principal trade 
     negotiating objectives: dispute settlement, transparency, 
     developing countries, current account surpluses, trade and 
     monetary coordination, agriculture, unfair trade practices, 
     trade in services, intellectual property, foreign direct 
     investment, safeguards, specific barriers, worker rights, 
     access to high technology, and border taxes.
     House amendment
       Section 2102 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 would 
     establish the following overall negotiating objectives: 
     obtaining more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access; 
     obtaining the reduction or elimination of barriers and other 
     trade-distorting policies and practices; further 
     strengthening the system of international trading disciplines 
     and procedures, including dispute settlement; fostering 
     economic growth and full employment in the U.S. and the 
     global economy; ensuring that trade and environmental 
     policies are mutually supportive and seeking to protect and 
     preserve the environment and enhance the international means 
     of doing so, while optimizing the use of the world's 
     resources; promoting respect for worker rights and the rights 
     of children consistent with International Labor Organization 
     core labor standards, as defined in the bill; and seeking 
     provisions in trade agreements under which parties strive to 
     ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections 
     afforded in domestic environmental and labor laws as an 
     encouragement to trade.
       In addition, section 2102 would establish the principal 
     trade negotiating objectives for concluding trade agreements, 
     as follows:
       Trade barriers and distortions: expanding competitive 
     market opportunities for U.S. exports and obtaining fairer 
     and more open conditions of trade by reducing or eliminating 
     tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and practices of 
     foreign governments directly related to trade that decrease 
     market opportunities for U.S. exports and distort U.S. trade; 
     and obtaining reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier 
     elimination agreements, with particular attention to products 
     covered in section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements 
     Act.
       Services: to reduce or eliminate barriers to international 
     trade in services, including regulatory and other barriers, 
     that deny national treatment or unreasonably restrict the 
     establishment or operations of services suppliers.
       Foreign investment: to reduce or eliminate artificial or 
     trade-distorting barriers to trade-related foreign investment 
     and, recognizing that U.S. law on the whole provides a high 
     level of protection for investment, consistent with or 
     greater than the level required by international law, to 
     secure for investors important rights comparable to those 
     that would be available under U.S. legal principles and 
     practice, by:
       reducing or eliminating exceptions to the principle of 
     national treatment;
       freeing the transfer of funds relating to investments;
       reducing or eliminating performance requirements, forced 
     technology transfers, and other unreasonable barriers to the 
     establishment and operation of investments;
       seeking to establish standards for expropriation and 
     compensation for expropriation, consistent with United States 
     legal principles and practice;
       providing meaningful procedures for resolving investment 
     disputes including between an investor and a government;
       seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes 
     between an investor and a government through mechanisms to 
     eliminate frivolous claims and procedures to ensure the 
     efficient selection of arbitrators and the expeditious 
     disposition of claims;
       providing an appellate or similar review mechanism to 
     correct manifestly erroneous interpretations of law; and
       ensuring the fullest measure of transparency in investment 
     disputes by ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement 
     and all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions are 
     promptly made public;
       all hearings are open to the public; and
       establishing a mechanism for acceptance of amicus curiae 
     submissions.
       Intellectual property: including: promoting adequate and 
     effective protection of intellectual property rights through 
     ensuring accelerated and full implementation of the Agreement 
     on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, 
     including strong enforcement;
       providing stronger protection for new and emerging 
     technologies and new methods of transmitting and distributing 
     products embodying intellectual property; and
       ensuring that standards of protection and enforcement keep 
     pace with technological developments, and in particular 
     ensuring that Tight holders have the legal and technological 
     means to control the use of their works through the internet 
     and other global communication media.
       Transparency: to increase public access to information 
     regarding trade issues as well as the activities of 
     international trade institutions; to increase openness in 
     international trade fora, including the WTO, by increasing 
     public access to appropriate meetings, proceedings, and 
     submissions, including with regard to dispute settlement and 
     investment; and to increase timely public access to 
     notifications made by WTO member states and the supporting 
     documents.
       Anti-corruption: to obtain high standards and appropriate 
     enforcement mechanisms applicable to persons from all 
     countries participating in a trade agreement that prohibit 
     attempts to influence acts, decisions, or omissions of 
     foreign government; and to ensure that such standards do not 
     place U.S. persons at a competitive disadvantage in 
     international trade.
       Improvement of the WTO and multilateral trade agreements: 
     to achieve full implementation and extend the coverage of the 
     WTO and such agreements to products, sectors, and conditions 
     of trade not adequately covered; and to expand country 
     participation in and enhancement of the Information 
     Technology Agreement (ITA) and other trade agreements.
       Regulatory practices: to achieve increased transparency and 
     opportunity for the participation of affected parties in the 
     development of regulations; to require that proposed 
     regulations be based on sound science, cost-benefit analysis, 
     risk assessment, or other objective evidence; to establish 
     consultative mechanisms among parties to trade agreements to 
     promote increased transparency in developing guidelines, 
     rules, regulations, and laws for government procurement and 
     other regulatory regimes; and to achieve the elimination of 
     government measures such as price controls and reference 
     pricing which deny full market access for United States 
     products.
       Electronic commerce: to ensure that current obligations, 
     rules, disciplines, and commitments under the WTO apply to 
     electronic commerce; to ensure that electronically delivered 
     goods and services receive no less favorable treatment under 
     trade rules and commitments than like products delivered in 
     physical form; and the classification of such goods and 
     services ensures the most liberal trade treatment possible; 
     to ensure that governments refrain from implementing trade-
     related measures that impede electronic

[[Page H5927]]

     commerce; where legitimate policy objectives require domestic 
     regulations that affect electronic commerce, to obtain 
     commitments that any such regulations are the least 
     restrictive on trade, nondiscriminatory, and transparent, and 
     promote an open market environment; and to extend the 
     moratorium of the WTO on duties on electronic transmissions.
       Agriculture: to ensure that the U.S. trade negotiators duly 
     recognize the importance of agricultural issues; to obtain 
     competitive market opportunities for U.S. exports in foreign 
     markets substantially equivalent to the competitive 
     opportunities afforded foreign exports in U.S. markets and to 
     achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade; to reduce 
     or eliminate trade distorting subsidies; to impose 
     disciplines on the operations of state-trading enterprises or 
     similar administrative mechanisms; to eliminate unjustified 
     restrictions on products derived from biotechnology; to 
     eliminate sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions that 
     contravene the Uruguay Round Agreement as they are not based 
     on scientific principles and to improve import relief 
     mechanisms to accommodate the unique aspects of perishable 
     and cyclical agriculture.
       Labor and the environment: to ensure that a party does not 
     fail to effectively enforce its environmental or labor laws, 
     through a sustained or recurring course of action or 
     inaction, in a manner affecting trade between the United 
     States and that party; to recognize that a party to a trade 
     agreement is effectively enforcing its laws if a course of 
     inaction or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of 
     discretion or results from a bona fide decision regarding 
     allocation of resources and no retaliation may be authorized 
     based on the exercise of these rights or the right to 
     establish domestic labor standards and levels of 
     environmental protection; to strengthen the capacity of U.S. 
     trading partners to promote respect for core labor standards 
     and to protect the environment through the promotion of 
     sustainable development; to reduce or eliminate government 
     practices or policies that unduly threaten sustainable 
     development; to seek market access for U.S. environmental 
     technologies, goods, and services; and to ensure that labor, 
     environmental, health, or safety policies and practices of 
     parties to trade agreements do not arbitrarily or 
     unjustifiably discriminate against U.S. exports or serve as 
     disguised barriers to trade.
       Dispute settlement and enforcement: to seek provisions in 
     trade agreements providing for resolution of disputes between 
     governments in an effective, timely, transparent, equitable, 
     and reasoned manner requiring determinations based on facts 
     and the principles of the agreement, with the goal of 
     increasing compliance; seek to strengthen the capacity of the 
     WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism to review compliance; seek 
     provisions encouraging the early identification and 
     settlement of disputes through consultations; seek provisions 
     encouraging trade-expanding compensation; seek provisions to 
     impose a penalty that encourages compliance, is appropriate 
     to the parties, nature, subject matter, and scope of the 
     violation, and has the aim of not adversely affecting parties 
     or interests not party to the dispute while maintaining the 
     effectiveness of the enforcement mechanism; and seek 
     provisions that treat U.S. principal negotiating objectives 
     equally with respect to ability to resort to dispute 
     settlement and availability of equivalent procedures and 
     remedies.
       Extended WTO negotiations: concerning extended WTO 
     negotiations on financial services, civil aircraft, and rules 
     of origin.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is substantially similar to the House 
     Amendment, with the exception of several key provisions:
       Small Business: The Senate Amendment contains an overall 
     negotiating objective ``to ensure that trade agreements 
     afford small businesses equal access to international 
     markets, equitable trade benefits, expanded export market 
     opportunities, and provide for the reduction or elimination 
     of trade barriers that disproportionately impact small 
     businesses.''
       Trade in Motor Vehicles and Parts: The Senate Amendment 
     contains a principal negotiating objective on expanding 
     competitive opportunities for exports of U.S. motor vehicles 
     and parts.
       Foreign Investment: The Senate Amendment states as an 
     objective of the United States in the context of investor-
     state dispute settlement ``ensuring that foreign investors in 
     the United States are not accorded greater rights than United 
     States investors in the United States.'' The Senate 
     Amendment's objective with respect to investor-state dispute 
     settlement also differs from the House Amendment in the 
     following respects:
       It sets as an objective ``seeking to establish standards 
     for fair and equitable treatment consistent with United 
     States legal principles and practice, including the principle 
     of due process.''
       It sets deterrence of the filing of frivolous claims as an 
     objective, in addition to the prompt elimination of frivolous 
     claims.
       The Senate Amendment seeks to establish ``procedures to 
     enhance opportunities for public input into the formulation 
     of government positions.''
       The Senate Amendment seeks to establish a single appellate 
     body to review decisions by arbitration panels in investor-
     state dispute settlement cases. Also, unlike the House 
     Amendment, the Senate Amendment does not prescribe a standard 
     of review for an eventual appellate body.
       Intellectual Property: The Senate Amendment contains an 
     objective to respect the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement 
     and Public Health, adopted by the World Trade Organization at 
     the Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha, Qatar on November 
     14, 2001 ``
       Trade in Agriculture: The Senate Amendment's negotiating 
     objective on export subsidies differs from the House 
     Amendment, stating that an objective of the United States is 
     ``seeking to eliminate all export subsidies on agricultural 
     commodities while maintaining bona fide food aid and 
     preserving U.S. agriculture development and export credit 
     programs that allow the U.S. to compete with other foreign 
     export promotion efforts.'' The Senate Amendment also 
     provides that it is a negotiating objective of the United 
     States to ``strive to complete a general multilateral round 
     in the WTO by January 1, 2005, and seek the broadest market 
     access possible in multilateral, regional, and bilateral 
     negotiations, recognizing the effect that simultaneous sets 
     of negotiations may have on US import-sensitive commodities 
     (including those subject to tariff-rate quotas).''
       Human Rights and Democracy : The Senate Amendment contains 
     a negotiating objective ``to obtain provisions in trade 
     agreements that require parties to those agreements to strive 
     to protect internationally recognized civil, political, and 
     human rights.''
       Dispute Settlement: The Senate Amendment contains a 
     negotiating objective absent in the House Amendment ``to seek 
     improved adherence by panels convened under the WTO 
     Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the 
     Settlement of Disputes and by the WTO Appellate Body to the 
     standard of review applicable under the WTO Agreement 
     involved in the dispute, including greater deference, where 
     appropriate, to the fact finding and technical expertise of 
     national investigating authorities.''
       Border Taxes: The Senate Amendment contains an objective 
     absent from the House Amendment on border taxes. The 
     objective seeks ``to obtain a revision of the WTO rules with 
     respect to the treatment of border adjustments for internal 
     taxes to redress the disadvantage to countries relying 
     primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather than indirect 
     taxes.'' The objective is addressed to a decision by the WTO 
     Dispute Settlement Body holding the foreign sales corporation 
     provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to be inconsistent 
     with WTO rules.
       Textiles: The Senate Amendment contains an extensive 
     objective on opening foreign markets to U.S. textile exports. 
     There is no similar provision in the House Amendment.
       Worst Forms of Child Labor: The Senate Amendment contains a 
     negotiating objective to prevent distortions in the conduct 
     of international trade caused by the use of the worst forms 
     of child labor and to redress unfair and illegitimate 
     competition based upon the use of the worst forms of child 
     labor.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House with several modifications. 
     With respect to the overall negotiating objectives, the 
     Conferees agree to the overall negotiating objective 
     regarding small business in section 2101-(a)(8) of the Senate 
     amendment. Second, the Conferees agree to an overall 
     negotiating objective to promote universal compliance with 
     ILO Declaration 182 concerning the worst forms of child 
     labor.
       With respect to the principal negotiating objectives, the 
     Conferees agree to expand the negotiating objective on 
     intellectual property to respect the Declaration on the TRIPS 
     Agreement and Public Health, adopted by the WTO at Doha 
     (section 2102(b)(4)(c) of the Senate amendment).
       With respect to the principal negotiating objectives 
     regarding foreign investment, the Conferees believe that it 
     is a priority for negotiators to seek agreements protecting 
     the rights of U.S. investors abroad and ensuring the 
     existence of a neutral investor-state dispute settlement 
     mechanism. At the same time, these protections must be 
     balanced so that they do not come at the expense of making 
     Federal, State and local laws and regulations more vulnerable 
     to successful challenges by foreign investors than by 
     similarly situated U.S. investors.
       No Greater Rights: The House recedes to the Senate with a 
     technical modification to clarify that foreign investors in 
     the United States are not accorded greater substantive rights 
     with respect to investment protections than United States 
     investors in the United States. That is, the reciprocal 
     obligations regarding investment protections that the United 
     States undertakes in pursuing its goals should not result in 
     foreign investors being entitled to compensation for 
     government actions where a similarly situated U.S. investor 
     would not be entitled to any form of relief, while ensuring 
     that U.S. investors abroad can challenge host government 
     measures which violate the terms of the investment agreement. 
     Thus, this language expresses Congress' direction that the 
     substantive investment protections (e.g., expropriation, fair 
     and equitable treatment, and full protection and security) 
     should be consistent with United States legal principles and 
     practice and not provide greater rights to foreign investors 
     in the United States.

[[Page H5928]]

       This language applies to substantive protections only and 
     is not applicable to procedural issues, such as access to 
     investor-state dispute settlement. The Conferees recognize 
     that the procedures for resolving disputes between a foreign 
     investor and a government may differ from the procedures for 
     resolving disputes between a domestic investor and a 
     government and may be available at different times during the 
     dispute. Thus, the ``no greater rights'' direction does not, 
     for instance, apply to such issues as the dismissal of 
     frivolous claims, the exhaustion of remedies, access to 
     appellate procedures, or other similar issues.
       The Conferees also agree that negotiators should seek to 
     provide for an appellate body or similar mechanism to provide 
     coherence to the interpretations of investment provisions in 
     trade agreements.
       With respect to the principal negotiating objective on 
     agriculture, the Conferees agree to section 
     2102(b)(10)(A)(iii) and (xv) of the House amendment, in lieu 
     of section 2102(b)(10)(A)(iii) of the Senate amendment. The 
     Conferees also accept section 2102(b)(10)(A)(xvi) of the 
     Senate amendment on the timing and sequence of WTO 
     agriculture negotiations relative to other negotiations.
       The Conferees agree to section 2102(b)(13)(C) of the Senate 
     amendment, relating to dispute settlement in dumping, 
     subsidy, and safeguard cases, as modified, to seek adherence 
     by WTO panels to the applicable standard of review.
       The Conferees recognize the importance of preserving the 
     ability of the United States to enforce rigorously its trade 
     remedy laws, including the antidumping, countervailing duty 
     and safeguard laws. Because this issue is significant to many 
     Members of Congress in both the House and Senate, the 
     Conferees have made this priority a principal negotiating 
     objective. Negotiators must also avoid agreements that lessen 
     the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines 
     on unfair trade, as well as domestic and international 
     safeguard provisions. In addition, section 2102(b)(14)(B) 
     directs the President to address and remedy market 
     distortions that lead to dumping and subsidization, including 
     overcapacity, cartelization, and market-access barriers.
       The Conferees agree to section 2012(b)(14) of the Senate 
     amendment stating that the United States should seek a 
     revision of WTO rules on the treatment of border adjustments 
     for internal taxes to redress the disadvantage to countries 
     relying primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather than 
     indirect taxes. The Conferees agree that such a revision of 
     WTO rules is one among other options for the United States, 
     including domestic legislation, to redress such a 
     disadvantage.
       The Conferees agree to include as a principal negotiating 
     objective to obtain competitive market opportunities for U.S. 
     exports of textiles substantially equivalent to those for 
     foreign textiles in the United States.
       The Conferees agree to a principal negotiating objective 
     concerning the worst forms of child labor, to seek 
     commitments by trade agreement parties to vigorously enforce 
     their own laws prohibiting the worst forms of child labor.


             sec. 2102(c)--promotion of certain priorities

     Present/expired law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 2102(c) of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 sets 
     forth certain priorities for the President to address. These 
     provisions include seeking greater cooperation between WTO 
     and the ILO; seeking to establish consultative mechanisms 
     among parties to trade agreements to strengthen the capacity 
     of U.S. trading partners to promote respect for core labor 
     standards, seeking to seek to establish consultative 
     mechanisms among parties to trade agreements to strengthen 
     the capacity of U.S. trading partners to develop and 
     implement standards for environment and human health based 
     on sound science; conducting environmental reviews of 
     future trade and investment agreements, consistent with 
     Executive Order 13141 and its relevant guidelines; 
     reviewing the impact of future trade agreements on U.S. 
     employment, modeled after Executive Order 13141; taking 
     into account, in negotiating trade agreements, protection 
     of legitimate health or safety, essential security, and 
     consumer interests; requiring the Secretary of Labor to 
     consult with foreign parties to trade negotiations as to 
     their labor laws and providing technical assistance where 
     needed; reporting to Congress on the extent to which 
     parties to an agreement have in effect laws governing 
     exploitative child labor; preserving the ability of the 
     United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws, 
     including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, and 
     avoiding agreements which lessen their effectiveness; 
     ensuring that U.S. exports are not subject to the abusive 
     use of trade laws, including antidumping and 
     countervailing duty laws, by other countries; continuing 
     to promote consideration of Multilateral Environmental 
     Agreements (MEAs) and consulting with parties to such 
     agreements regarding the consistency of any MEA that 
     includes trade measures with existing environmental 
     exceptions under Article XX of the GATT.
       In addition, USTR, twelve months after the imposition of a 
     penalty or remedy by the United States permitted by an 
     agreement to which this Act applies, is to report to the 
     Committee on the effectiveness of remedies applied under U.S. 
     law to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements. USTR shall 
     address whether the remedy was effective in changing the 
     behavior of the targeted party and whether the remedy had any 
     adverse impact on parties or interests not party to the 
     dispute.
       Finally, section 2102(c) would direct the President to seek 
     to establish consultative mechanisms among parties to trade 
     agreements to examine the trade consequences of significant 
     and unanticipated currency movements and to scrutinize 
     whether a foreign government engaged in a pattern of 
     manipulating its currency to promote a competitive advantage 
     in international trade.
     Senate amendment
       With several notable exceptions, the priorities set forth 
     in section 2102(c) of the Senate Amendment are identical to 
     the priorities set forth in the House Amendment. The 
     exceptions are:
       With respect to the study that the President must perform 
     on the impact of future trade agreements on employment, the 
     Senate Amendment requires the President to examine particular 
     criteria, as follows: the impact on job security, the level 
     of compensation of new jobs and existing jobs, the 
     displacement of employment, and the regional distribution of 
     employment, utilizing experience from previous trade 
     agreements and alternative models of employment analysis. The 
     Senate Amendment also requires that the report be made 
     available to the public.
       The Senate Amendment requires that, in connection with new 
     trade agreement negotiations, the President shall ``submit to 
     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate a 
     meaningful labor rights report of the country, or countries, 
     with respect to which the President is negotiating.''
       The Senate Amendment adds to the House Amendment priority 
     on preserving the ability of the United States to enforce 
     vigorously its trade laws, by including U.S. ``safeguards'' 
     law in the list of laws at issue. This is the U.S. law 
     authorizing the President to provide relief to parties 
     seriously injured or threatened with serious injury due to 
     surges of imports. The priority in the Senate Amendment also 
     directs the President to remedy certain market distorting 
     measures that underlie unfair trade practices.
     Cconference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House amendment with several 
     modifications. With respect to the worst forms of child 
     labor, the Conferees agree to expand section 2102(c)(2) of 
     the House amendment to include the worst forms of child labor 
     within requirement to seek to establish consultative 
     mechanisms to strengthen the capacity of U.S. trading 
     partners to promote respect for core labor standards.
       The Conferees agree to modify section 2105(c)(5) of the 
     House amendment to require the President to report on impact 
     of future trade agreements on US employment, including on 
     labor markets, modeled after E.O. 13141 to the extent 
     appropriate in establishing procedures and criteria, and to 
     make the report public.
       With respect to the labor rights report in section 
     2102(c)(8) of both bills, the Conferees agree to the Senate 
     provision. Furthermore, the Conferees agree to section 
     2107(b)(2)(E) of the Senate amendment to require that 
     guidelines for the Congressional Oversight Group include the 
     time frame for submitting this report.


  sec. 2102(d)--consultations, adherence to obligations under uruguay 
                            round agreements

     Present/expired law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 2102(d) of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 
     requires that USTR consult closely and on a timely basis with 
     the Congressional Oversight Group appointed under section 
     2107. In addition, USTR would be required to consult 
     closely (including immediately before the initialing of an 
     agreement) with the congressional advisers on trade policy 
     and negotiations appointed under section 161 of the Trade 
     Act of 1974, as well as the House Committee on Ways and 
     Means, the Senate Committee on Finance, and the 
     Congressional Oversight Group. With regard to negotiations 
     concerning agriculture trade, USTR would also be required 
     to consult with the House and Senate Committees on 
     Agriculture.
       In determining whether to enter into negotiations with a 
     particular country, section 2102(e) would require the 
     President to take into account whether that country has 
     implemented its obligations under the Uruguay Round 
     Agreements.
     Senate amendment
       Section 2102(d) of the Senate amendment is identical to the 
     House provision in the House amendment to H.R. 3009.
     Conference agreement
       The Conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


                 SEC. 2103--TRADE AGREEMENTS AUTHORITY

     Present/expired law
       Tariff proclamation authority. Section 1102(a) of the 1988 
     Act provided authority to the President to proclaim 
     modifications in duties without the need for Congressional 
     approval, subject to certain limitations. Specifically, for 
     rates that exceed 5 percent ad

[[Page H5929]]

     valorem, the President could not reduce any rate of duty to a 
     rate less than 50 percent of the rate of duty applying on the 
     date of enactment. Rates at or below 5 percent could be 
     reduced to zero. Any duty reduction that exceeded 50 percent 
     of an existing duty higher than 5 percent or any tariff 
     increase had to be approved by Congress.
       Staging authority required that duty reductions on any 
     article could not exceed 3 percent per year, or one-tenth of 
     the total reduction, whichever is greater, except that 
     staging was not required if the International Trade 
     Commission determined there was no U.S. production of that 
     article.
       Negotiation of bilateral agreements. Section 1102(c) of the 
     1988 Act set forth three requirements for the negotiation of 
     a bilateral agreement:
       The foreign country must request the negotiation of the 
     bilateral agreement;
       The agreement must make progress in meeting applicable U.S. 
     trade negotiating objectives; and
       The President must provide written notice of the 
     negotiations to the Committee on Ways and Means and the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate and consult with these 
     committees.
       The negotiations could proceed unless either Committee 
     disapproved the negotiations within 60 days prior to the 90 
     calendar days advance notice required of entry into an 
     agreement (described below).
       Negotiation of multilateral non-tariff agreements. With 
     respect to multilateral agreements, section 1102(b) of the 
     1988 Act provided that whenever the President determines that 
     any barrier to, or other distortion of, international trade 
     unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United 
     States or adversely affects the U.S. economy, or the 
     imposition of any such barrier or distortion is likely to 
     result in such a burden, restriction, or effect, he may enter 
     into a trade agreement with the foreign countries involved. 
     The agreement must provide for the reduction or elimination 
     of such barrier or other distortion or prohibit or limit the 
     imposition of such a barrier or distortion.
       Provisions qualifying for fast track procedures. Section 
     1103(b)(1)(A) of the 1988 Act provided that fast track apply 
     to implementing bills submitted with respect to any trade 
     agreements entered into under the statute. Section 151(b)(1) 
     of the Trade Act of 1974 further defined ``implementing 
     bill'' as a bill containing provisions ``necessary or 
     appropriate'' to implement the trade agreement, as well as 
     provisions approving the agreement and the statement of 
     administrative action.
       Time period. The authority applied with respect to 
     agreements entered into before June 1, 1991, and until June 
     1, 1993 unless Congress passed an extension disapproval 
     resolution. The authority was then extended to April 15, 
     1994, to cover the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations 
     under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
     House amendment
       Section 2103 of the House amendment provides:
       Proclamation authority. Section 2103(a) would provide the 
     President the authority to proclaim, without Congressional 
     approval, certain duty modifications in a manner very similar 
     to the expired provision. Specifically, for rates that exceed 
     5 percent ad valorem, the President would not be authorized 
     to reduce any rate of duty to a rate less than 50 percent of 
     the rate of duty applying on the date of enactment. Rates 
     at or below 5 percent ad valorem could be reduced to zero. 
     Any duty reduction that exceeded 50 percent of an existing 
     duty higher than 5 percent or any tariff increase would 
     have to be approved by Congress.
       In addition, section 2103(a) would not allow the use of 
     tariff proclamation authority on import sensitive 
     agriculture.
       Staging authority would require that duty reductions on any 
     article could not exceed 3 percent per year, or one-tenth of 
     the total reduction, whichever is greater, except that 
     staging would not be required if the International Trade 
     Commission determined there is no U.S. production of that 
     article.
       These limitations would not apply to reciprocal agreements 
     to eliminate or harmonize duties negotiated under the 
     auspices of the World Trade Organization, such as so-called 
     ``zero-for-zero'' negotiations.
       Agreements on tariff and non-tariff barriers. Section 
     2103(b)(1) would authorize the President to enter into a 
     trade agreement with a foreign country whenever he determined 
     that any duty or other import restriction or any other 
     barrier to or distortion of international trade unduly 
     burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United States 
     or adversely affects the U.S. economy, or the imposition of 
     any such barrier or distortion is likely to result in such a 
     burden, restriction, or effect. The agreement must provide 
     for the reduction or elimination of such barrier or other 
     distortion or prohibit or limit the imposition of such a 
     barrier or distortion. No distinction would be made between 
     bilateral and multilateral agreements.
       Conditions. Section 2103(b)(2) would provide that the 
     special implementing bills procedures may be used only if the 
     agreement makes progress in meeting the applicable objectives 
     set forth in section 2102(a) and (b) and the President 
     satisfies the consultation requirements set forth in section 
     2104.
       Bills qualifying for trade authorities procedures. Section 
     2103(b)(3)(A) would provide that bills implementing trade 
     agreements may qualify for trade promotion authority TPA 
     procedures only if those bills consist solely of the 
     following provisions:
       Provisions approving the trade agreement and statement of 
     administrative action; and
       Provisions necessary or appropriate to implement the trade 
     agreement.
       Time period. Sections 2103(a)(1)(A) and 2103(b)(1)(C) would 
     extend trade promotion authority to agreements entered into 
     before June 1, 2005. An extension until June 1, 2007, would 
     be permitted unless Congress passed a disapproval resolution, 
     as described under section 2103(c).
     Senate amendment
       In most respects, section 2103 of the Senate Amendment is 
     identical to section 2103 of the House Amendment. However, 
     there are several key differences, as follows:
       The Senate Amendment limits the President's proclamation 
     authority with respect to ``import sensitive agricultural 
     products,'' a term defined in section 2113(5) of the Senate 
     Amendment. This limitation differs from the limitation in the 
     House Amendment, inasmuch as it includes certain products 
     subject to tariff rate quotas.
       The Senate Amendment contains a provision making a trade 
     agreement implementing bill ineligible for ``fast track'' 
     procedures if the bill modifies, amends, or requires 
     modification or amendment to certain trade remedy laws. A 
     bill that does modify, amend or require modification or 
     amendment to those laws is subject to a point of order in the 
     Senate, which may be waived by a majority vote.
       The Senate Amendment requires the U.S. International Trade 
     Commission to submit a report to Congress on negotiations 
     during the initial period for which the President is granted 
     trade promotion authority. This report would be made in 
     connection with a request by the President to have such 
     authority extended.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House amendment with several 
     modifications. The Conferees agree to the new definition of 
     import sensitive agriculture in section 2103(a)(2)(B), 
     2104(b)(2)(A)(i), and 2113(5) of the Senate amendment to 
     encompass products subject to tariff rate quotas, as well as 
     products subject to the lowest tariff reduction in the 
     Uruguay Round.
       The Conferees agree to section 2103(c)(3)(B) of the Senate 
     amendment, which requires the ITC to submit a report to 
     Congress by May 1, 2005 (if the President seeks extension of 
     TPA until June 2, 2007) analyzing the economic impact on the 
     United States of all trade agreements implemented between 
     enactment and the extension request.


                SEC. 2104--CONSULTATIONS AND ASSESSMENT

     Present/expired law
       Section 102 of the Trade Act of 1974 and sections 1102(d) 
     and 1103 of the 1988 Act set forth the fast track 
     requirements. These provisions required the President, before 
     entering into any trade agreement, to consult with Congress 
     as to the nature of the agreement, how and to what extent the 
     agreement will achieve applicable purposes, policies, and 
     objectives, and all matters relating to agreement 
     implementation. In addition, before entering into an 
     agreement, the President was required to give Congress at 
     least 90 calendar days advance notice of his intent. The 
     purpose of this period was to provide the Congressional 
     Committees of jurisdiction an opportunity to review the 
     proposed agreement before it was signed.
       Section 135(e) of the Trade Act of 1974 required that the 
     Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations meet at 
     the conclusion of negotiations for each trade agreement and 
     provide a report as to whether and to what extent the 
     agreement promotes the economic interests of the United 
     States and achieves the applicable overall and principal 
     negotiating objectives of section 1101 of the 1988 Act. The 
     report was due not later than the date on which the President 
     notified Congress of his intent to enter into an agreement. 
     With regard to the Uruguay Round, the report was due 30 days 
     after the date of notification.
     House amendment
       Section 2104 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 would 
     establish a number Of requirements that the President consult 
     with Congress. Specifically, section 2104(a)(1) would require 
     the President to provide written notice and consult with the 
     relevant committees at least 90 calendar days prior to 
     entering into negotiations. Section 2104(a)(c) also provides 
     that President shall meet with the Congressional Oversight 
     Group established under section 2107 upon a request of a 
     majority of its members. Trade promotion authority would not 
     apply to an implementing bill if both Houses separately agree 
     to a procedural disapproval resolution within any 60-day 
     period stating that the Administration has failed to notify 
     or consult with Congress.
       Section 2104(b)(1) would establish a special consultation 
     requirement for agriculture. Specifically, before initiating 
     negotiations concerning tariff reductions in agriculture, the 
     President is to assess whether U.S. tariffs on agriculture 
     products that were bound under the Uruguay Round Agreements 
     are lower than the tariffs bound by that country. In his 
     assessment, the President would also be required to consider 
     whether the tariff levels bound and applied throughout the 
     world with respect to imports from the United States are 
     higher than U.S. tariffs and whether the negotiation provides 
     an opportunity to address any such disparity. The

[[Page H5930]]

     President would be required to consult with the Committees on 
     Ways and Means and Agriculture of the House and the 
     Committees on Finance and Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry 
     of the Senate concerning the results of this assessment and 
     whether it is appropriate for the United States to agree to 
     further tariff reductions under such circumstances and how 
     all applicable negotiating objectives would be met.
       Section 2104(b)(2) provides special consultations on import 
     sensitive agriculture products. Specifically, before 
     initiating negotiations on agriculture and as soon as 
     practicable with respect to the Free Trade Area of the 
     Americas and WTO negotiations, USTR is to identify import 
     sensitive agriculture products and consult with the 
     Committees on Ways & Means and Agriculture of the House and 
     the Committees on Finance and Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
     Forestry in the Senate concerning whether any further tariff 
     reduction should be appropriate, and whether the identified 
     products face unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary barriers. 
     USTR is also to request that the International Trade 
     Commission prepare an assessment of the probable economic 
     effects of any such tariff reduction on the U.S. industry 
     producing the product and on the U.S. economy as a whole. 
     USTR is to then notify the Committees of those products for 
     which it intends to seek tariff liberalization as well as the 
     reasons. If USTR commences negotiations and then identifies 
     additional import sensitive agriculture products, or a party 
     to the negotiations requests tariff reductions on such a 
     product, then USTR shall notify the Committees as soon as 
     practicable of those products and the reasons for seeking 
     tariff reductions.
       Section 2104(c) would establish a special consultation 
     requirement for textiles. Specifically, before initiating 
     negotiations concerning tariff reductions in textiles and 
     apparel, the President is to assess whether U.S. tariffs on 
     textile and apparel products that were bound under the 
     Uruguay Round Agreements are lower than the tariffs bound by 
     that country. In his assessment, the President would also be 
     required to consider whether the tariff levels bound and 
     applied throughout the world with respect to imports from the 
     United States are higher than U.S. tariffs and whether the 
     negotiation provides an opportunity to address any such 
     disparity. The President would be required to consult with 
     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House and the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate concerning the results of 
     this assessment and whether it is appropriate for the United 
     States to agree to further tariff reductions under such 
     circumstances and how all applicable negotiating objectives 
     would be met.
       In addition, section 2104(d) would require the President, 
     before entering into any trade agreement, to consult with the 
     relevant Committees concerning the nature of the agreement, 
     how and to what extent the agreement will achieve the 
     applicable purposes, policies, and objectives set forth in 
     the House amendment to H.R. 3009 and all matters relating to 
     implementation under section 2105, including the general 
     effect of the agreement on U.S. laws.
       Section 2104(e) would require that the report of the 
     Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations under 
     section 135(e)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 be provided not 
     later than 30 days after the date on which the President 
     notifies Congress of his intent to enter into the agreement 
     under section 2105(a)(1)(A).
       Finally, section 2104(f) would require the President, at 
     least 90 days before entering into a trade agreement, to ask 
     the International Trade Commission to assess the agreement, 
     including the likely impact of the agreement on the U.S. 
     economy as a whole, specific industry sectors, and U.S. 
     consumers. That report would be due 90 days from the date 
     after the President enters into the agreement.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is substantially similar to the House 
     bill, with the following exceptions:
       Consultations on export subsidies and distorting policies. 
     Section 2104(b)(2)(A)(ii)(III) requires consultations on 
     whether nations producing identified products maintain export 
     subsidies or distorting policies that distort trade and 
     impact of policies on U.S. producers.
       Consultations relating to fishing trade. Section 2104(b)(3) 
     requires that for negotiations relating to fishing trade, the 
     Administration will keep fully apprised and on timely basis 
     consult with the House Resources Committee and the Senate 
     Commerce Committee.
       Special reporting requirements on U.S. trade remedy laws. 
     Section 2104(d) provides that the President, at least 90 
     calendar days before the President enters into a trade 
     agreement, shall notify the House Ways and Means Committee 
     and the Senate Finance Committee in writing any amendments to 
     U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws (title VII of 
     the Tariff Act of 1930) or U.S. safeguard provisions (chapter 
     1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974) that the President 
     proposes to include in the implementing legislation. On the 
     date that the President transmits the notification, the 
     President must also transmit to the Committees a report 
     explaining his reasons for believing that amendments to these 
     trade remedy laws are necessary to implement the trade 
     agreement and his reasons for believing that such amendments 
     are consistent with the negotiating objective on this issue. 
     Not later than 60 calendar days after the date on which the 
     President transmits notification to the relevant committees, 
     the Chairman and ranking members of the House Ways and Means 
     Committee and the Senate Finance Committees shall issue 
     reports stating whether the proposed amendments described in 
     the President's notification are consistent with the 
     negotiating objectives on trade laws.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House with several modifications. 
     The Conferees agree to section 2104(b)(2)(A)(11)(III) of the 
     Senate amendment, which requires consultations on whether 
     other nations producing identified products maintain export 
     subsidies or distorting policies that distort trade and 
     impact of policies on U.S. producers. In addition, the 
     Conferees agree to section 2104(b)(3) of the Senate 
     amendment, which requires that for negotiations relating to 
     fishing trade, the Administration will keep fully apprised 
     and on timely basis consult with the House Resources 
     Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee.
       Finally, the Conferees agree to include the notification 
     and report on changes to trade remedy laws in sections 
     2104(d)(3)(A) and (B) in the Senate amendment with 
     modifications. Given the priority that Conferees attach to 
     keeping U.S. trade remedy laws strong and ensuring that they 
     remain fully enforceable, the Conference agreement puts in 
     place a process requiring special scrutiny of any impact that 
     trade agreements may have on these laws. The process requires 
     the President, at least 180 calendar days before the day on 
     which he enters into a trade agreement, to report to the 
     Committees on Ways and Means and the Committee on Finance the 
     range of proposals advanced in trade negotiations and may be 
     in the final agreement that could require amendments to title 
     VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 or to chapter 1 of title II of 
     the Trade Act of 1974; and how these proposals relate to the 
     objectives described in section 2102(b)(14).
       The Conference agreement also provides a mechanism for any 
     Member in the House or Senate to introduce at any time after 
     the President's report is issued a nonbinding resolution 
     which states ``that the ________ finds that the proposed 
     changes to U.S. trade remedy laws contained in the report of 
     the President transmitted to the Congress on ________ under 
     section 2104(d)(3) of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion 
     Authority Act of 2002 with respect to ________, are 
     inconsistent with the negotiating objectives described in 
     section 2102(b)(14) of that Act.'', with the first blank 
     space being filled in with either the ``House of 
     Representatives'' or the ``Senate'', as the case may be, the 
     second blank space filled in with the appropriate date of the 
     report, and the third blank space being filled in with the 
     name of the country or countries involved.
       The resolution is referred to the Ways and Means and Rules 
     Committees in the House and the Finance Committee in the 
     Senate, and is privileged on the floor if it is reported by 
     the Committees. The Conference agreement allows only one 
     resolution (either a nonbinding resolution or a disapproval 
     resolution) per agreement to be eligible for the trade 
     promotion authority procedures contained in sections 152 (d) 
     and (e) of the Trade Act of 1974. The one resolution quota is 
     satisfied for the House only after the Ways and Means 
     Committee reports a resolution, and for the Senate only after 
     the Finance Committee reports a resolution.
       The Conference agreement states that, with respect to 
     agreements entered into with Chile and Singapore, the report 
     referenced in section 2104(d)(3)(A) shall be submitted by the 
     President at least 90 calendar days before the day on which 
     the President enters into a trade agreement with either 
     country.


             SEC. 2105--IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADE AGREEMENTS

     Present/expired law
       Before entering into the draft agreement, the President was 
     required to give Congress 90 days advance notice (120 days 
     for the Uruguay Round) to provide an opportunity for revision 
     before signature. After entering into the agreement, the 
     President was required to submit formally the draft 
     agreement, implementing legislation, and a statement of 
     administrative action. Once the bill was formally introduced, 
     there was no opportunity to amend any portion of the bill--
     whether on the floor or in committee. Consequently, before 
     the formal introduction took place, the committees of 
     jurisdiction would hold hearings, ``unofficial'' or 
     ``informal'' mark-up sessions and a ``mock conference'' with 
     the Senate committees of jurisdiction in order to develop a 
     draft implementing bill together with the Administration and 
     to make their concerns known to the Administration before it 
     introduced the legislation formally.
       After formal introduction of the implementing bill, the 
     House committees of jurisdiction had 45 legislative days to 
     report the bill, and the House was required to vote on the 
     bill within 15 legislative days after the measure was 
     reported or discharged from the committees. Fifteen 
     additional days were provided for Senate committee 
     consideration (assuming the implementing bill was a revenue 
     bill), and the Senate floor action was required within 15 
     additional days. Accordingly, the maximum period for 
     Congressional consideration of an implementing bill from the 
     date of introduction was 90 legislative days. Amendments to 
     the legislation were not permitted once the bill was 
     introduced; the committee and floor actions consisted of ``up 
     or down'' votes on the bill as introduced.

[[Page H5931]]

       Finally, section 1103(d) of the 1988 Act specified that the 
     fast track rules were enacted as an exercise of the 
     rulemaking power of the House and the Senate, with the 
     recognition of the right of either House to change the rules 
     at any time.
     House amendment
       Under Section 2105 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009, the 
     President would be required, at least 90 days before entering 
     into an agreement, to notify Congress of his intent to enter 
     into the agreement. Section 2105(a) also would establish a 
     new requirement that the President, within 60 days of signing 
     an agreement, submit to Congress a preliminary list of 
     existing laws that he considers would be required to bring 
     the United States into compliance with agreement.
       Section 2105(b) would provide that trade promotion 
     authority would not apply if both Houses separately agree to 
     a procedural disapproval resolution within any 60-day period 
     stating that the Administration failed to notify or consult 
     with Congress, which is defined as failing or refusing to 
     consult in accordance with section 2104 or 2105, failing to 
     develop or meet guidelines under section 2107(b), failure to 
     meet with the Congressional Oversight Group, or the agreement 
     fails to make progress in achieving the purposes. policies, 
     priorities, and objectives of the Act. In a change from the 
     expired law, such a resolution may be introduced by any 
     Member of the House or Senate. Only one such privileged 
     resolution would be permitted to be considered per trade 
     agreement per Congress.
       Most of the remaining provisions are identical to the 
     expired law. Specifically, section 2105(a) would require the 
     President, after entering into agreement, to submit formally 
     the draft agreement, the implementing legislation, and a 
     statement of administrative action to Congress, and there 
     would be no time limit to do so, but with the new requirement 
     that the submission be made on a date on which both Houses 
     are in session. The procedures of section 151 of the Trade 
     Act of 1974 would then apply. Specifically, on the same day 
     as the President formally submits the legislation, the bill 
     would be introduced (by request) by the Majority Leaders of 
     the House and the Senate. After formal introduction of the 
     legislation, the House Committees of jurisdiction would have 
     45 legislative days to report the bill. The House would be 
     required to vote on the bill within 15 legislative days after 
     the measure was reported or discharged from the Committees. 
     Fifteen additional days would be provided for Senate 
     Committee consideration (assuming the implementing bill was a 
     revenue bill), and Senate floor action would be required 
     within 15 additional days. Accordingly, the maximum period 
     for Congressional consideration of the implementing bill from 
     the date of introduction would be 90 legislative days.
       As with the expired provisions, once the bill has been 
     formally introduced, no amendments would be permitted either 
     in Committee or floor action, and a straight ``up or down'' 
     vote would be required. Of course, before formal 
     introduction, the bill could be developed by the Committees 
     of jurisdiction together with the Administration during the 
     informal Committee mark-up process.
       Finally, as with the expired provision, section 2105(c) 
     specifies that sections 2105(b) and 3(c) are enacted as an 
     exercise of the rulemaking power of the House and the Senate, 
     with the recognition of the right of either House to change 
     the rules at any time.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is substantially similar to the House 
     Bill, with the following exception:
       Reporting requirements. Section 2105(a)(1)(A)(ii) requires 
     the President to transmit to the House Ways and Means 
     Committee and the Senate Finance Committee the notification 
     and report described in section 2104(d)(3)(A) regarding 
     changes to U.S. trade remedy laws.
       Disclosure Requirements. Section 2105(a)(4) of the Senate 
     bill specifies that any trade agreement or understanding with 
     a foreign government (oral or written) not disclosed to 
     Congress will not be considered part of trade agreement 
     approved by Congress and shall have no effect under U.S. law 
     or in any dispute settlement body.
       Senate Procedures. Section 2105(b)(1)(C)(i)(II) provides 
     that any Member of the Senate may introduce a procedural 
     disapproval resolution, and that that resolution will be 
     referred to the Senate Finance Committee. Section 
     2105(b)(1)(C)(iv) provides that the Senate may not consider a 
     disapproval resolution that has not been reported by the 
     Senate Finance Committee.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House amendment with several 
     modifications. The Conferees agree to section 2105(a)(4) of 
     the Senate amendment, which specifies that any trade 
     agreement or understanding with a foreign government (oral or 
     written) not disclosed to Congress will not be considered 
     part of trade agreement approved by Congress and shall have 
     no effect under U.S. law or in any dispute settlement body, 
     the Conferees also agree to sections 2105(b)(1)(C)(i)(II) and 
     (b)(1)(C)(iv) of the Senate amendment, which applies the 
     same procedures for consideration of bills in the Senate 
     as for the House.
       Finally, the Conferees agree to section 2105(b)(2) of the 
     Senate amendment with modifications, which requires the 
     Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretaries 
     of State and Treasury, the Attorney General, and the United 
     States Trade Representative, to transmit to Congress a report 
     setting forth the strategy of the executive branch to address 
     concerns of Congress regarding whether dispute settlement 
     panels and the Appellate Body of the WTO have added to 
     obligations or diminished rights of the United States, as 
     described in section 2101(b)(3). Trade authorities procedures 
     shall not apply to any implementing bill with respect to an 
     agreement negotiated under the auspices of the WTO unless the 
     Secretary of Commerce has issued such report prior to 
     December 31, 2002.


            SEC. 2106--TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TRADE AGREEMENTS

     Present/expired law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 2106 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 exempts 
     agreements resulting from ongoing negotiations with Chile or 
     Singapore, an agreement establishing a Free Trade Area of the 
     Americas, and agreements concluded under the auspices of the 
     WTO from prenegotiation consultation requirements of section 
     2104(a) only. However, upon enactment of H.R. 3009, the 
     Administration is required to consult as to those elements 
     set forth in section 2104(a) as soon as feasible.
     Senate amendment
       Section 2106 of the Senate amendment is substantially 
     similar to the House bill.
     Conference agreement
       The Conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


                SEC. 2107--CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT GROUP

     Present/expired law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 2107 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 would 
     require the Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means and 
     the Chairman of the Committee on Finance to chair and 
     convene, sixty days after the effective date of this Act, the 
     Congressional Oversight Group. The Group would be comprised 
     of the following Members of the House: the Chairman and 
     Ranking Member of the Committee on Ways and Means and three 
     additional members of the Committee (not more than two of 
     whom are from the same party), and the Chairman and Ranking 
     Member of the Committees which would have, under the Rules of 
     the House, jurisdiction over provisions of law affected by a 
     trade negotiation. The Group would be comprised of the 
     following Members of the Senate: the Chairman and Ranking 
     Member of the Committee on Finance and three additional

     briefings, access to pertinent documents, and the closest 
     possible coordination at all critical periods during the 
     negotiations, including at negotiation sites.
       Finally, section 2107(c) provides that upon the request of 
     a majority of the Congressional Oversight Group, the

                          SEC. 3102--FINDINGS

     Present law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 1302 contains findings of Congress that:
       (1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act was enacted in 
     1991, it has had a positive impact on United States trade 
     with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Two-way trade has 
     doubled, with the United States serving as the leading source 
     of imports and leading export market for each of the Andean 
     beneficiary countries. This has resulted in increased jobs 
     and expanded export opportunities in both the United States 
     and the Andean region.
       (2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element 
     in the United States counter narcotics strategy in the Andean 
     region, promoting export diversification and broad-based 
     economic development that provide sustainable economic 
     alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the 
     legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable 
     alternatives to illicit trade in coca.
       (3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade 
     Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by 
     political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable 
     to the consequences of the drug war and fierce global 
     competition for its legitimate trade.
       (4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a 
     threat to the security interests of the United States and the 
     world. This problem has been partially addressed through 
     foreign aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in 
     2000. However, foreign aid alone is not sufficient. 
     Enhancement of legitimate trade with the United States 
     provides an alternative means for reviving and stabilizing 
     the economies in the Andean region.
       (5) The Andean Trade Preference Act constitutes a tangible 
     commitment by the United States to the promotion of 
     prosperity, stability, and democracy in the beneficiary 
     countries.
       (6) Renewal and enhancement of the Andean Trade Preference 
     Act will bolster the confidence of domestic private 
     enterprise and foreign investors in the economic prospects of 
     the region, ensuring that legitimate private enterprise can 
     be the engine of economic development and political stability 
     in the region.
       (7) Each of the Andean beneficiary countries is committed 
     to conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas 
     by the year 2005 as a means of enhancing the economic 
     security of the region.
       (8) Temporarily enhancing trade benefits for Andean 
     beneficiaries countries will promote the growth of free 
     enterprise and economic opportunity in these countries and 
     serve the security interests of the United States, the 
     region, and the world.
     Senate amendment
       Section 3101 is identical.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


        SEC. 3103--ARTICLES ELIGIBLE FOR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT

     Articles (Except Apparel) Eligible for Preferential Treatment

     Present law
       The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), enacted on December 
     4, 1991 as title II of Public Law 102-182, authorizes 
     preferential trade benefits for the Andean nations of 
     Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, similar to those 
     benefits granted to beneficiaries under the Caribbean Basin 
     Initiative program. The ATPA authorizes the President to 
     proclaim duty-free treatment for all eligible articles 
     from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru. This authority 
     applies only to normal column 1 rates of duty in the 
     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS); any 
     additional duties imposed under U.S. unfair trade practice 
     laws, such as the antidumping or countervailing duty laws, 
     are not affected by this authority.
       The ATPA contains a list of products that are ineligible 
     for duty-free treatment. More specifically, ATPA duty-free 
     treatment does not apply to textile and apparel articles that 
     are subject to textile agreements; petroleum and petroleum 
     products; footwear not eligible for duty-free treatment under 
     the Generalized System of Preferences; certain watches and 
     watch parts; certain leather products; and sugar, syrups and 
     molasses subject to over-quota rates of duty.
     House amendment
       Section 3103 (a) amends the Andean Trade Preference Act to 
     authorize the President to proclaim duty-free treatment for 
     any of the following articles which were previously excluded 
     from duty-free treatment under the ATPA, if the President 
     determines that the article is not import-sensitive in the 
     context of imports from beneficiary countries:
       (1) Footwear not designated at the time of the effective 
     date of this Act as eligible for the purposes of the 
     Generalized System of Preferences under title V of the Trade 
     Act of 1974;
       (2) Petroleum, or any product derived from petroleum, 
     provided for in headings 2709 and 2710 of the HTS;
       (3) Watches and watch parts (including cases, bracelets and 
     straps), of whatever type including. but not limited to, 
     mechanical, quartz digital or quartz analog, if such watches 
     or watch parts contain any material which is the product of 
     any country with respect to which HTS column 2 rates of duty 
     apply;
       (4) Handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather 
     wearing apparel that--(i) are the product of any beneficiary 
     country; and (ii) were not designated on August 5, 1983, as 
     eligible articles for purposes of the Generalized System of 
     Preferences under title V of the Trade Act of 1974.
       Under H.R. 3009, textiles subject to textile agreements; 
     sugar, syrups and molasses subject to over-quota tariffs; and 
     rum and tafia classified in subheading 2208.40.00 of the HTS 
     would continue to be ineligible for duty-free treatment, as 
     would apparel products other than those specifically 
     described below. Imports of tuna, prepared or preserved in 
     any manner, in airtight containers would receive immediate 
     duty-free treatment.
     Senate amendment
       Section 3102 of the bill replaces the list of excluded 
     products under section 204(b) of the current ATPA with a new 
     provision that extends duty preferences to most of those 
     products. The new preferences take the form of exceptions to 
     the general rule that the excluded products are not eligible 
     for duty-free treatment.
       The enhanced preferences are made available to ``ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries.''

[[Page H5933]]

     Paragraph (5) of section 204(b) of the ATPA as amended by the 
     present bill defines ATPEA beneficiary countries as those 
     countries previously designated by the President as 
     ``beneficiary countries'' (i.e., Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, 
     and Peru) which subsequently are designated by the President 
     as ``ATPEA beneficiary countries,'' based on the President's 
     consideration of additional eligibility criteria.
       In the event that the President did not designate a current 
     ``beneficiary country'' as an ``ATPEA beneficiary country,'' 
     that country would remain eligible for ATPA benefits under 
     the law as expired on December 4, 2001, but would not be 
     eligible for the enhanced benefits provided under the present 
     bill.
       Footwear not eligible for duty-free treatment under GSP 
     receives the same tariff treatment as like products from 
     Mexico, except that duties on articles in particular tariff 
     subheadings are to be reduced by 1/15 per year.
       The Senate Amendment provides special treatment for rum and 
     tafia, allowing them to receive the same tariff treatment as 
     like products from Mexico. The bill also allows certain 
     handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather 
     wearing apparel to receive the same tariff treatment as like 
     products from Mexico.
       Under the bill, the President is authorized to proclaim 
     duty-free treatment for tuna that is harvested by United 
     States or ATPEA vessels, subject to a quantitative yearly cap 
     of 20 percent of the domestic United States tuna pack in the 
     preceding year.
     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes on the authority of President to proclaim 
     duty-free treatment for particular articles which were 
     previously excluded from duty-free treatment under the ATPA, 
     if the President determines that the article is not import-
     sensitive in the context of imports from beneficiary 
     countries.
       Textiles subject to textile agreements; sugar, syrups and 
     molasses subject to over-quota tariffs; and rum and tafia 
     classified in subheading 2208.40.00 of the HTS would continue 
     to be ineligible for duty-free treatment, as would apparel 
     products other than those specifically described below.
       House recedes on the treatment of tuna with an amendment 
     to: 1) retain U.S. or Andean flagged vessel rule of origin 
     requirement in Senate amendment; 2) authorize the 
     President to grant duty-free treatment for Andean exports 
     of tuna packed in flexible (e.g., foil), airtight 
     containers weighing with their contents not more than 6.8 
     kg each; and 3) update calculation of current MFN tariff-
     rate quota to be an amount based on 4.8 percent of 
     apparent domestic consumption of tuna in airtight 
     containers rather than domestic production.

                       Eligible Apparel Articles

     Present law
       Under the ATPA, apparel articles are on the list of 
     products excluded from eligibility for duty-free treatment.
     House amendment
       Under Section 3103, the President may proclaim duty-free 
     and quota-free treatment for apparel articles sewn or 
     otherwise assembled in one or more beneficiary countries 
     exclusively from any one or any combination of the following:
       (1) Fabrics or fabric components formed, or components 
     knit-to-shape, in the United States (including fabrics not 
     formed from yarns, if such fabrics are classifiable under 
     heading 5602 or 5603 of the HTS and are formed in the United 
     States).
       (2) Fabrics or fabric components formed, or components 
     knit-to-shape, in one or more beneficiary countries, from 
     yarns formed in one or more beneficiary countries, if such 
     fabrics (including fabrics not formed from yarns, if such 
     fabrics are classifiable under heading 5602 or 5603 of the 
     HTS and are formed in one or more beneficiary countries) are 
     in chief weight of llama, or alpaca.
       (3) Fabrics or yarn not produced in the United States or in 
     the region, to the extent that apparel articles of such 
     fabrics or yarn would be eligible for preferential treatment, 
     without regard to the source of the fabrics or yarn, under 
     Annex 401 of the NAFTA (short supply provisions). Any 
     interested party may request the President to consider such 
     treatment for additional fabrics and yarns on the basis that 
     they cannot be supplied by the domestic industry in 
     commercial quantities in a timely manner, and the President 
     must make a determination within 60 calendar days of 
     receiving the request from the interested party.
       (4) Apparel articles sewn or otherwise assembled in one or 
     more beneficiary countries from fabrics or fabric components 
     formed or components knit-to-shape, in one or more 
     beneficiary countries, from yarns formed in the United States 
     or in one or more beneficiary countries (including fabrics 
     not formed from yarns, if such fabrics are classifiable under 
     heading 5602 or 5603 of the HTS and are formed in one or more 
     beneficiary countries), whether or not the apparel articles 
     are also made from any of the fabrics, fabric components 
     formed, or components knit-to-shape in the United States 
     described in paragraph 1. Imports of apparel made from 
     regional fabric and regional yarn would be capped at 3% of 
     U.S. imports growing to 6% of U.S. imports in 2006, measured 
     in square meter equivalents.
     Senate amendment
       Paragraph (2) of section 204(b) of the ATPA as amended by 
     section 3102 of the present bill extends duty-free treatment 
     to certain textile and apparel articles from ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries. The provision divides articles 
     eligible for this treatment into several different categories 
     and limits duty-free treatment to a period defined as the 
     transition period.'' The transition period is defined in 
     paragraph (5) of section 204(b) of the ATPA as amended to be 
     the period from enactment of the present bill through the 
     earlier of February 28, 2006 or establishment of a FTAA.
       In general, the different categories of textile and apparel 
     articles eligible for duty free treatment are defined 
     according to the origin of the yarn and fabric from which the 
     articles are made. Under the first category, apparel sewn or 
     otherwise assembled in one or more ATPEA beneficiary 
     countries is eligible for duty-free treatment if it is made 
     exclusively from one or a combination of several sub-
     categories of components, as follows:
       (1) United States fabric, fabric components, or knit-to-
     shape components, made from yarns wholly formed in the United 
     States;
       (2) A combination of both United States and ATPEA 
     beneficiary country components knit-to-shape from yarns 
     wholly formed in the United States;
       (3) ATPEA beneficiary country fabric, fabric components, or 
     knit-to-shape components, made from yarns wholly formed in 
     one or more ATPEA beneficiary countries, if the constituent 
     fibers are primarily llama or alpaca hair; and
       (4) Fabrics or yarns, regardless of origin, if such fabrics 
     or yarns have been deemed, under the North American Free 
     Trade Agreement, not to be widely available in commercial 
     quantities in the United States. A separate provision of 
     section 204(b) of the ATPA as amended by the present bill 
     sets forth a process for interested parties to petition the 
     President for inclusion of additional yarns and fabrics in 
     the ``short supply'' list. This process includes obtaining 
     advice from the United States International Trade Commission 
     and industry advisory groups, and consultation with the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways 
     and Means of the House of Representatives.
       A second category of apparel articles eligible for duty-
     free treatment is apparel articles knit-to-shape (except 
     socks) in one or more ATPEA beneficiary countries from yarns 
     wholly formed in the United States. To qualify under this 
     category, the entire article must be knit-to-shape--as 
     opposed to being assembled from components that are 
     themselves knit-to-shape.
       A third category of apparel articles eligible for duty-free 
     treatment is apparel articles wholly assembled in one or more 
     ATPEA beneficiary countries from fabric or fabric components 
     knit, or components knit-to-shape in one or more ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries from yarns wholly formed in the United 
     States. The quantity of apparel eligible for this benefit is 
     subject to an annual cap. The cap is set at 70 million square 
     meter equivalents for the one-year period beginning March 1, 
     2002. The cap will increase by 16 percent, compounded 
     annually, in each succeeding one-year period, through 
     February 28, 2006.
       Thus, the cap applied to this category in each year 
     following enactment will be as follows:
       70 million square meter equivalents (SME) in the year 
     beginning March 1, 2002;
       81.2 million SME in the year beginning March 1, 2003;
       94.19 million SME in the year beginning March 1, 2004; and
       109.26 million SME in the year beginning March 1, 2005.
       A separate provision makes clear that goods otherwise 
     qualifying under the latter category will not be disqualified 
     if they happen to contain United States fabric made from 
     United States yarn.
       A fourth category of apparel eligible for duty-free 
     treatment under the Senate bill is brassieres that are cut or 
     sewn, or otherwise assembled, in one or more ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries, or in such countries and the United 
     States. This separate category requires that, in the 
     aggregate, brassieres manufactured by a given producer 
     claiming duty-free treatment for such products contain 
     certain quantities of United States fabric.
       A fifth category of textile and apparel eligible for duty-
     free treatment is handloomed, handmade, and folklore 
     articles.
       A final category of textile and apparel goods eligible for 
     duty-free treatment is textile luggage assembled in an ATPEA 
     beneficiary country from fabric and yarns formed in the 
     United States.
       In addition to the foregoing categories, the bill sets 
     forth special rules for determining whether particular 
     textile and apparel articles qualify for duty-free treatment.
     Conference agreement
       In general the conferees agreed to follow the House 
     amendment on apparel provisions with the exception that the 
     House receded to the Senate on the treatment of textile 
     luggage. With respect to category 2 in the House bill 
     relating to fabrics or fabric components formed, or 
     components knit-to-shape, in one or more beneficiary 
     countries, from yarns formed in one or more beneficiary 
     countries, if such fabrics are in chief weight of llama, or 
     alpaca, conferees agreed to include vicuna and calculate 
     product eligibility based on chief value instead of chief 
     weight. Also, conferees agreed to cap imports of apparel

[[Page H5934]]

     made from regional fabric and regional yarn (category 4 in 
     the House bill) at 2% of U.S. imports growing to 5% of U.S. 
     imports in 2006, measured in square meter equivalents.
       It is the intention of the conferees that in cases where 
     fabrics or yarns determined by the President to be in short 
     supply impart the essential character to an article, the 
     remaining textile components may be constructed of fabrics or 
     yarns regardless of origin, as in Annex 401 of the NAFTA. In 
     cases where the fabrics or yarns determined by the President 
     to be in short supply do not impart the essential character 
     of the article, the article shall not be ineligible for 
     preferential treatment under this Act because the article 
     contains the short supply fabric or yarn.

              Special Origin Rule for Nylon Filament Yarn

     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       Articles otherwise eligible for duty-free treatment and 
     quota free treatment under the bill are not ineligible 
     because they contain certain nylon filament yarn (other than 
     elastomeric yarn) from a country that had an FTA with the 
     U.S. in force prior to January 1, 1995.
     Conference agreement
       House recedes.

               Dyeing, Finishing and Printing Requirement

     House amendment
       New requirement that apparel made of U.S. knit or woven 
     fabric assembled in CBTPA country qualifies for benefits only 
     if the U.S. knit or woven fabric is dyed and finished in the 
     United States. Apparel made of U.S. knit or woven fabric 
     assembled in an Andean beneficiary country qualifies for 
     benefits only if the U.S. knit or woven fabric is dyed and 
     finished in the United States.

                      Penalties for Transshipment

     Present Law
       The Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, provides for civil 
     monetary penalties for unlawful transshipment. These include 
     penalties under 19 U.S.C. 1592 for up to a maximum of the 
     domestic value of the imported merchandise or eight times the 
     loss of revenue, as well as denial of entry, redelivery or 
     liquidated damages for failure to redeliver the merchandise 
     determined to be inaccurately represented. In addition, an 
     importer may be liable for criminal penalties, including 
     imprisonment for up to five years, under section 1001 of 
     title 18 of the United States Code for making false 
     statements on import documentation.
       Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 
     Parties to the Agreement must observe Customs procedures and 
     documentation requirements, which are established in Chapter 
     5 of NAFTA. Requirements regarding Certificates of Origin for 
     imports receiving preferential tariffs are detailed in 
     Article 502.1 of NAFTA.
     House amendment
       Section 3103 requires that importers comply with 
     requirements similar in all material respects to the 
     requirements regarding Certificates of Origin contained in 
     Article 502.1 of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
     (NAFTA) for a similar importation from Mexico.
       In addition, if an exporter is determined under the laws of 
     the United States to have engaged in illegal transshipment of 
     apparel products from an Andean country, then the President 
     shall deny all benefits under the bill to such exporter, and 
     to any successors of such exporter, for a period of two 
     years.
       In cases where the President has requested a beneficiary 
     country to take action to prevent transshipment and the 
     country has failed to do so, the President shall reduce the 
     quantities of textile and apparel articles that may be 
     imported into the United States from that country by three 
     times the quantity of articles transshipped, to the extent 
     that such action is consistent with World Trade Organization 
     (WTO) rules.
     Senate amendment
       In amending section 204(b) of the ATPA, section 3102 of the 
     present bill provides special penalties for transshipment of 
     textile and apparel articles from an ATPEA beneficiary 
     country. Transshipment is defined as claiming duty-free 
     treatment for textile and apparel imports on the basis of 
     materially false information. An exporter found to have 
     engaged in such transshipment (or a successor of such 
     exporter) shall be denied all benefits under the ATPA for a 
     period of two years.
       The bill further provides penalties for an ATPEA 
     beneficiary country that fails to cooperate with the United 
     States in efforts to prevent transshipment. Where textile and 
     apparel articles from such country are subject to quotas on 
     importation into the United States consistent with WTO rules, 
     the President must reduce the quantity of such articles that 
     may be imported into the United States by three times the 
     quantity of transshipped articles, to the extent consistent 
     with WTO rules.
     Conference agreement
       Conference agreement follows House and Senate bill.

                         Import Relief Actions

     Present law
       The import relief procedures and authorities under sections 
     201-204 of the Trade Act of 1974 apply to imports from ATPA 
     beneficiary countries, as they do to imports from other 
     countries. If ATPA imports cause serious injury, or threat of 
     such injury, to the domestic industry producing a like or 
     directly competitive article, section 204(d) of the ATPA 
     authorizes the President to suspend ATPA duty-free treatment 
     and proclaim a rate of duty or other relief measures.
       Under NAFTA, the United States may invoke a special 
     safeguard provision at any time during the tariff phase-out 
     period if a NAFTA-origin textile or apparel good is being 
     imported in such increased quantities and under such 
     conditions as to cause ``serious damage, or actual threat 
     thereof,'' to a domestic industry producing a like or 
     directly competitive good. The President is authorized to 
     either suspend further duty reductions or increase the rate 
     of duty to the NTR rate for up to three years.
     House amendment
       Under Section 3103 normal safeguard authorities under ATPA 
     would apply to imports of all products except textiles and 
     apparel. A NAFTA equivalent safeguard authorities would apply 
     to imports of apparel products from ATPA countries, except 
     that, United States, if it applied a safeguard action, would 
     not be obligated to provide equivalent trade liberalizing 
     compensation to the exporting country.
     Senate amendment
       The bill establishes similar textile and apparel safeguard 
     provisions based on the NAFTA textile and apparel safeguard 
     provision.
     Conference agreement
       Conference Agreement follows House and Senate bill.

                          Designation Criteria

     Present law
       In determining whether to designate any country as an ATPA 
     beneficiary country, the President must take into account 
     seven mandatory and 12 discretionary criteria, which are 
     listed in section 203 of the ATPA.
       Under Section 203 of the ATPA, the President shall not 
     designate any country a ATPA beneficiary country if:
       (1) the country is a Communist country;
       (2) the country has nationalized, expropriated, imposed 
     taxes or other exactions or otherwise seized ownership or 
     control of U.S. property (including intellectual property), 
     unless he determines that prompt, adequate, and effective 
     compensation has been or is being made, or good faith 
     negotiations to provide such compensation are in progress, or 
     the country is otherwise taking steps to discharge its 
     international obligations, or a dispute over compensation has 
     been submitted to arbitration;
       (3) the country fails to act in good faith in recognizing 
     as binding or in enforcing arbitral awards in favor of U.S. 
     citizens;
       (4) the country affords ``reverse'' preferences to 
     developed countries and whether such treatment has or is 
     likely to have a significant adverse effect on U.S. commerce;
       (5) a government-owned entity in the country engages in the 
     broadcast of copyrighted material belonging to U.S. copyright 
     owners without their express consent or the country fails to 
     work toward the provision of adequate and effective 
     intellectual property rights;
       (6) the country is not a signatory to an agreement 
     regarding the extradition of U.S. citizens,
       (7) if the country has not or is not taking steps to afford 
     internationally recognized worker rights to workers in the 
     country;
       In determining whether to designate a country as eligible 
     for ATPA benefits, the President shall take into account 
     (discretionary criteria):
       (1) an expression by the country of its desire to be 
     designated;
       (2) the economic conditions in the country, its living 
     standards, and any other appropriate economic factors;
       (3) the extent to which the country has assured the United 
     States it will provide equitable and reasonable access to its 
     markets and basic commodity resources;
       (4) the degree to which the country follows accepted rules 
     of international trade under the World Trade Organization;
       (5) the degree to which the country uses export subsidies 
     or imposes export performance or local content requirements 
     which distort international trade;
       (6) the degree to which the trade policies of the country 
     are contributing to the revitalization of the region;
       (7) the degree to which the country is undertaking self-
     help measures to protect its own economic development;
       (8) whether or not the country has taken or is taking steps 
     to afford to workers in that country (including any 
     designated zone in that country) internationally recognized 
     workers rights;
       (9) the extent to which the country provides under its law 
     adequate and effective means for foreign nationals to secure, 
     exercise, and enforce exclusive intellectual property rights;
       (10) the extent to which the country prohibits its 
     nationals from engaging in the broadcast of copyrighted 
     material belonging to U.S. copyright owners without their 
     express consent;
       (11) whether such country has met the narcotics cooperation 
     certification criteria of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 
     for eligibility for U.S. assistance; and

[[Page H5935]]

       (12) the extent to which the country is prepared to 
     cooperate with the United States in the administration of the 
     Act.
       Under the ATPA the President is prohibited from designating 
     a country a beneficiary country if any of criteria (1)-(7) 
     apply to that country, subject to waiver if the President 
     determines that country designation will be in the U.S. 
     national economic or security interest. The waiver does not 
     apply to criteria (4) and (6). Under the ATPA criteria on (7) 
     is included as both mandatory and discretionary.
       The President may withdraw or suspend beneficiary country 
     status or duty-free treatment on any article if he determines 
     the country should be barred from designation as a result 
     of changed circumstances. The President must submit a 
     triennial report to the Congress on the operation of the 
     program. The report shall include any evidence that the 
     crop eradication and crop substitution efforts of the 
     beneficiary country are directly related to the effects of 
     the legislation
     House amendment
       The House amendment provides that the President, in 
     designating a country as eligible for the enhanced ATPDEA 
     benefits, shall take into account the existing eligibility 
     criteria established under ATPA described above, as well as 
     other appropriate criteria, including: whether a country has 
     demonstrated a commitment to undertake its WTO obligations 
     and participate in negotiations toward the completion of the 
     FTAA or comparable trade agreement; the extent to which the 
     country provides intellectual property protection consistent 
     with or greater than that afforded under the Agreement on 
     Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights; the 
     extent to which the country provides internationally 
     recognized worker fights; whether the country has implemented 
     its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor; 
     the extent to which a country has taken steps to become a 
     party to and implement the Inter-American Convention Against 
     Corruption; and the extent to which the country applies 
     transparent, nondiscriminatory and competitive procedures in 
     government procurement equivalent to those included in the 
     WTO Agreement on Government Procurement and otherwise 
     contributes to efforts in international fora to develop and 
     implement international rules in transparency in government 
     procurement.
     Senate amendment
       Section 3102(5) contains identical provisions.
     Conference agreement
       Conference Agreement follows the House and Senate 
     amendments. In evaluating a potential beneficiary's 
     compliance with its WTO obligations, the conferees expect the 
     President to take into account the extent to which the 
     country follows the rules on customs valuation set forth in 
     the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement. With respect to 
     intellectual property protection, it is the Conferees intent 
     that the President will also take into account the extent to 
     which potential beneficiary countries are providing or taking 
     steps to provide protection of intellectual property rights 
     comparable to the protections provided to the United States 
     in bilateral intellectual property agreements.
       Since April 1995, Colombia has applied a variable import 
     duty system, known as the ``price band'' system, on fourteen 
     basic agriculture products such as wheat, corn, and soybean 
     oil. An additional 147 commodities, considered substitutes or 
     related products, are subject to the price band system which 
     establishes ceiling, floor, and reference prices on imports. 
     The Conferees's view is that the price band system is non-
     transparent and easily manipulated as a protectionist device. 
     In early 2000, the United States reached agreement with 
     Colombia in the WTO that Colombia would delink wet pet food, 
     the only finished product in this system, from the price band 
     system. In implementing the eligibility criteria relating to 
     market access and implementation of WTO commitments, it is 
     the Conferees intent that USTR insist that Colombia implement 
     its WTO commitment to remove pet food from the price band 
     tariff system and to apply the 20% common external tariff to 
     imported pet food.
       With respect to whether beneficiary countries are following 
     established WTO rules, the Conferees believe it is important 
     for Andean goveniments to provide transparent and non-
     discriminatory regulatory procedures. Unfortunately, the 
     Conferees know of instances where regulatory policies in 
     Andean countries are opaque, unpredictable, and arbritarily 
     applied. As such, it is the Conferees's view that Andean 
     countries that seek trade benefits should adopt, implement, 
     and apply transparent and non-discriminatory regulatory 
     procedures. The development of such procedures would help 
     create regulatory stability in the Andean region and thus 
     provide mere certainty to U.S. companies that would like to 
     invest in these countries.

            Determination Regarding Retention of Designation

     Present law
       Under Section 203(e) of the ATPA, the President may 
     withdraw or suspend a country's beneficiary country 
     designation, or withdraw, suspend, or limit the application 
     of duty-free treatment to particular articles of a 
     beneficiary country, due to changed circumstances.
     House amendnient
       Section 3102(b) amends section 203(e) of the ATPA to 
     provide that President may withdraw or suspend ATPA 
     designation, or withdraw, suspend or limit benefits if a 
     country's performance under eligibility criteria are no 
     longer satisfactory.
     Senate amendment
       Identical.
     Conference agreement
       Conference agreement follows the House amendment and Senate 
     amendment.

                         Reporting Requirements

     Present law
       Provides for: 1) an annual report by the International 
     Trade Commission on the economic impact of the bill and; 2) 
     an annual report by the Secretary of Labor on the impact of 
     the bill with respect to U.S. labor. Also under present law, 
     USTR is required to report triannually on operation of the 
     program.
     House amendment
       Retains current law on reports.
     Senate amendment
       Senate bill requires same ITC and Labor reports as well as 
     an annual report by the Customs Service on compliance and 
     anti-circumvention on the part of beneficiary countries in 
     the area of textile and apparel trade. It also requires USTR 
     to report biannually on operation of the program.
     Conference agreement
       House recedes.
       Petitions for Review
     Present law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       Section 3102(e) of the bill directs the President to 
     promulgate regulations regarding the review of eligibility of 
     articles and countries under the ATPA. Such regulations are 
     to be similar to regulations governing the Generalized System 
     of Preferences petition process.
     Conference agreement
       House recedes.


            section 3104--termination of duty-free treatment

     Present law
       Duty-free treatment under the ATPA expires on December 4, 
     2001.
     House amendment
       Duty-free treatment terminates under the Act on December 
     31, 2006.
     Senate amendment
       Section 3103 of the bill amends section 208(b) of the ATPA 
     to provide for a termination date of February 28, 2006. Basic 
     ATPA benefits apply retroactively to December 4, 2001.
     Conference agreement
       House recedes on retroactivity for basic ATPA benefits; 
     Senate recedes on termination.


     section 3106--trade benefits under the caribbean basin trade 
   partnership act (cbtpa) and the africa growth and opportunity act 
                                 (agoa)

       Knit-to-shape Apparel
     Present law
       Draft regulations issued by Customs to implement P.L. 106-
     200 stipulate that knit to-shape garments, because 
     technically they do not go through the fabric stage, are not 
     eligible for trade benefits under the act.
     House amendment
       Sec. 3106 and 3107 of the House bill amends AGOA and CBTPA 
     to clarify that preferential treatment is provided to knit-
     to-shape apparel articles assembled in beneficiary countries.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes.
     Present law
       Draft regulations issued by Customs to implement P.L. 106-
     200 deny preferential access to garments that are cut both in 
     the United States and beneficiary countries, on the rationale 
     that the legislation does not specifically list this 
     variation in processing (the so called ``hybrid cutting 
     problem'').
     House amendment
       Sec. 3107 of H.R. 3009 adds new rules in CBTPA and AGOA to 
     provide preferential treatment for apparel articles that are 
     cut both in the United States and beneficiary countries.

     made in CBI countries from regional fabric made with U.S. 
     yarn and to knit-to-shape apparel (except socks), up to a cap 
     of 250,000,000 square meter equivalents (SMEs), with a growth 
     rate of 16% per year for first 3 years.
     House amendment
       Sec. 3106 of H.R. 2009 would raise this cap to the 
     following amounts: 250,000,000 SMEs

[[Page H5936]]

     for the 1-year period beginning October 1, 2001; 500,000,000 
     SMEs for the 1-year period beginning on October 1, 2002;

       P.L. 106-200 extends benefits for an additional category of 
     CBI regional knit apparel products (T-shirts) up to a cap of 
     4.2 million dozen, growing 16% per year for the first 3 
     years.
     House amendment
       Section 3106 of H.R. 3006 would raise this cap to the

     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes.
     Present law
       Section 112(b)(3) of the AGOA provides preferential 
     treatment for apparel made in beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
     countries from ``regional'' fabric (i.e., fabric formed in 
     one or more beneficiary countries) from yarn originating 
     either in the United States or one or more such countries. 
     Section 112(b)(3)(B) establishes a special rule for lesser 
     developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, which 
     provides preferential treatment, through September 30, 2004, 
     for apparel wholly assembled in one or more such countries 
     regardless of the origin of the fabric used to make the 
     articles. Section 112(b)(3)(A) establishes a quantitative 
     limit or ``cap'' on the amount of apparel that may be 
     imported under section 112(b)(3) or section 112(b)(3)(B). 
     This ``cap'' is 1.5 percent of the aggregate square meter 
     equivalents of all apparel articles imported into the United 
     States for the year that began October 1, 2000, and increases 
     in equal increments to 3.5 percent for the year beginning 
     October 1, 2007.
     House amendment
       Section 3107 would clarify that apparel wholly assembled in 
     one or more beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries from 
     components knit-to-shape in one or more such countries from 
     U.S. or regional yarn is eligible for preferential treatment 
     under section 112(b)(3) of AGOA. Similarly, Section 5 would 
     clarify that apparel knit-to-shape and wholly assembled in 
     one or more lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
     countries is eligible for preferential treatment, regardless 
     of the origin of the yarn used to make such articles. The 
     House amendment also would increase the ``cap'' by changing 
     the applicable percentages from 1.5 percent to 3 percent in 
     the year that began October 1, 2000, and from 3.5 percent to 
     7 percent in the year beginning October 1, 2007.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       Conference agreement follows House Amendment accept the 
     increase in the cap is limited to apparel products made with 
     regional or U.S. fabric and yarn. No increases in amounts of 
     apparel made of third-country fabric over current law.
     Present law
       AGOA was supposed to provide duty-free, quota-free 
     treatment to sweaters knit in African beneficiary countries 
     from fine merino wool yarn, regardless of where the yarn was 
     formed. AGOA was supposed to provide duty-free, quota-free 
     treatment to sweaters knit in African beneficiary countries 
     from fine merino wool yarn, regardless of where the yarn was 
     formed. However, due to a drafting problem, the wrong 
     diameter was included, making it impossible to use the 
     provision.
     House amendment
       Section 3107 corrects the yarn diameter in the AGOA 
     legislation so that sweaters knit to shape from merino wool 
     of a specific diameter are eligible.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.

                      Africa: Namibia and Botswana

     Present law
       The GDBs of Botswana and Namibia exceed the LLDC limit of 
     $1500 and therefore these countries are not eligible to use 
     third country fabric for the transition period under the AGOA 
     regional fabric country cap.
     House amendment
       Section 5 allows Namibia and Botswana to use third country 
     fabric for the transition period under the AGOA regional 
     fabric country cap.

       Title XLI--EXTENSION OF GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES


       SEC. 4101-- EXTENSION OF GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES

     Expired law
       Section 505 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, provides 
     that no duty-free treatment under Title V (the Generalized 
     System of Preferences) shall remain in effect after September 
     30, 2001.
     House bill
       The House amendment to H.R. 3009 would amend section 505 of 
     the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize an extension through 
     December 31, 2002. It would also provide retroactive relief 
     in that, notwithstanding section 514 of the Tariff Act of 
     1930 or any other provision of law, the entry of any article 
     to which duty-free treatment under Title V of the Trade Act 
     of 1974 would have applied if the entry had been made on 
     September 30. 2001, and was made after September 30, 2001, 
     and before the enactment of this Act, shall be liquidated or 
     reliquidated as free of duty and the Secretary of Treasury 
     shall refund any duty paid, upon proper request filed with 
     the appropriate Customs officer, within 180 days after the 
     date of enactment.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment authorizes an extension of GSP through 
     December 31, 2006. The extension is retroactive to September 
     30, 2001, permitting importers to liquidate or reliquidate 
     entries made since that date and to seek a return of duties 
     paid on goods that would have entered the United States free 
     of duty, but for expiration of GSP.
       The Senate amendment also amends the definition of 
     ``internationally recognized worker rights'' set forth in the 
     GSP statute (section 507(4) of the Trade Act of 1974). 
     Specifically, it adds to that definition ``a prohibition on 
     discrimination with respect to employment and occupation'' 
     and a ``prohibition of the worst forms of child labor.'' 
     These two prohibitions come from the International Labor 
     Organization's 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
     Rights at Work, which defines certain worker rights as 
     ``fundamental.''
       The GSP statute identifies certain criteria that the 
     President must take into account in determining whether to 
     designate a country as eligible for GSP benefits. Conversely, 
     a country's lapse in compliance with one or more of these 
     criteria may be grounds for withdrawal, suspension, or 
     limitation of benefits. Whether a country is taking steps to 
     afford its workers internationally recognized worker rights 
     is one of those criteria. The Senate Amendment seeks to make 
     the concept of ``internationally recognized worker rights'' 
     as defined for GSP consistent with the concept as defined by 
     the ILO.
       Finally, the Senate Amendment establishes a new eligibility 
     criterion for GSP: ``A country is ineligible for GSP if it 
     has not taken steps to support the efforts of the United 
     States to combat terrorism.''
     Conference agreement
       The Conference agreement authorizes an extension of GSP 
     through December 31, 2006. Conferees approved the Senate 
     provision to include a prohibition on the worst forms of 
     child labor in the definition of internationally recognized 
     worker rights in Section 507(a) of the Trade Act of 1974. 
     Conferees declined to include the Senate provision on 
     discrimination with respect to employment in the definition 
     of ``international recognized worker rights under Sec. 507 
     (a) of the Trade Act of 1974. Agreement follows the House and 
     the Senate bill with respect to providing retroactive relief.

                  DIVISION E--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

                 TITLE L--MISCELLANEOUS TRADE BENEFITS

                      Subtitle A--Wool Provisions


   sec. 5101--wool manufacturer payment clarification and technical 
                            corrections act

     Present law
       Title V of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 
     No. 106-200) included certain tariff relief for the domestic 
     tailored clothing and textile industries. The relief was 
     largely aimed at reducing the harmful affects of a ``tariff 
     inversion''--i.e., a tariff structure that levies higher 
     duties on the raw material (such as wool fabric) than on the 
     finished goods (such as mens' suits). A component of the 
     relief to the U.S. tailored clothing and textile industry was 
     a refund of duties paid in calendar year 1999, spread out 
     over calendar years 2000, 2001 and 2002. Pub. L. No. 106-
     2000, Sec. 505.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate bill amends section 505 of the Trade and 
     Development Act of 2000 to simplify the process for refunding 
     to eligible parties duties paid in 1999. Specifically, it 
     creates three special refund pools for each of the affected 
     wool articles (fabric, yarn, and fiber and top). Refunds for 
     importing manufacturers will be distributed in three 
     installments--the first and second on or before the date that 
     is 45 days after the date of enactment of the Wool 
     Manufacturer Payment and Clarification and Technical 
     Corrections Act, and the third on or before April 15, 2003. 
     Refunds for nonimporting manufacturers will be distributed in 
     two installments--the first on or before the date that is 120 
     days after the date of enactment of the Wool Manufacturer 
     Payment Clarification and Technical Corrections Act, and the 
     second on or before April 15, 2003.

[[Page H5937]]

       The provision also streamlines the paperwork process, in 
     light of the destruction of previously filed claims and 
     supporting information in the September 11, 2001 attacks on 
     the World Trade Center in New York, New York. Finally, the 
     provision identifies all persons eligible for the refunds.
     Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate.


                   sec. 5102--duty suspension on wool

     Present law
       Sections 501(a) and (b) of the Trade and Development Act of 
     2000 provide temporary duty reductions for certain worsted 
     wool fabrics through 2003.
       Section 501(d) limits the aggregate quantity of worsted 
     wool fabrics entered under heading 9902.51.11 from January 1 
     to December 31 of each year, inclusive, to 2,500,000 square 
     meter equivalents, or such other quantity proclaimed by the 
     President pursuant to section 504(b)(3) of the Trade and 
     Development Act. Further, the section limits the aggregate 
     quantity of worsted wool fabrics entered under heading 
     9902.51.12 from January 1 to December 31 of each year, 
     inclusive, to 1,500,000 square meter equivalents, or such 
     other quantity proclaimed by the President pursuant to 
     section 504(b)(3) of the Trade and Development Act.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate bill
       The Senate bill extends the temporary duty reductions on 
     fabrics of worsted wool from 2003 to 2005. The provision 
     increases the limitation on the quantity of imports of 
     worsted wool fabrics entered under heading 9902.51.11 to 
     3,500,000 square meter equivalents in calendar year 2002, and 
     4,500,000 square meter equivalents in calendar year 2003. 
     Imports of worsted wool fabrics entered under heading 
     9902.51.12 are increased to 2,500,000 square meter 
     equivalents in calendar year 2002, and 3,500,000 square meter 
     equivalents in calendar year 2003.
       The bill extends the payments made to manufacturers under 
     section 505 of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 and 
     requires an affidavit that the manufacturer will remain a 
     manufacturer in the United States as of January 1 of the year 
     of payment. The two additional payments will occur as 
     follows: the first to be made after January 1, 2004, but on 
     or before April 15, 2004, and the second after January 1, 
     2005, but on or before April 15, 2005.
       Finally, the bill extends the ``Wool Research Trust Fund'' 
     for two years through 2006.
      Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate.

                      Subtitle B--Other Provisions


               sec. 5201--fund for wto dispute settlement

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       The provision authorizes a settlement fund within the 
     United States Trade Representative's Office in the amount of 
     $50 million for the use in settling disputes that occur 
     related to the World Trade Organization. The Trade 
     Representative must certify to the Secretary of the Treasury 
     that the settlement is in the best interest of the United 
     States in cases of not more than $10 million. For cases above 
     $10 million, the Trade Representative must make the same 
     certification to the United States Congress.
     Senate bill
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.


  sec. 5202--certain steam or other vapor generating boilers used in 
                           nuclear facilities

     Present law
       Under present law, certain steam or other vapor generating 
     boilers used in nuclear facilities imported into the United 
     States prior to December 31, 2003 are charged a duty rate of 
     4.9 percent ad valorem. This rate took effect pursuant to 
     section 1268 of Public Law Number 106-476 (``Tariff 
     Suspension and Trade Act of 2000''). Previously, the rate had 
     been 5.2 percent ad valorem.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       Section 203 of the Senate amendment chances the duty rate 
     on certain steam or other vapor generating boilers used in 
     nuclear facilities to zero for such goods entered, or 
     withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 
     1, 2002, and on or before December 31, 2006. The provision 
     was intended to lower the cost of inputs into the operation 
     of nuclear facilities and thereby lower the cost of energy to 
     consumers.
     Committee agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate.


            sec. 5203--sugar tariff rate quota circumvention

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate bill establishes a sugar anti-circumvention 
     program which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to 
     identify imports of articles that are circumventing tariff 
     rate quotas on sugars, syrups, or sugar-containing products 
     imposed under chapters 17, 18, 19, and 21 of the Harmonized 
     Tariff Schedule. The Secretary shall then report to the 
     President articles found to be circumventing such tariff-rate 
     quotas. Upon receiving the Secretary's report, the President 
     shall, by proclamation, include any identified article in the 
     appropriate tariff-rate quota provision of the Harmonized 
     Tariff Schedule.
     Conference agreement
       Conferees agreed to a provision directing the Secretary of 
     Agriculture and the Commissioner of Customs shall monitor for 
     sugar circumvention and shall report and make recommendations 
     to Congress and the President.
       This provision amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
     United States (``HTSUS'') to make clear in the statute an 
     important element of the ruling of the Court of Appeals for 
     the Federal Circuit in Heartland By-Products, Inc. v. United 
     States, 264 F. 3rd 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001), i.e., that molasses 
     is one of the foreign substances that must be excluded when 
     calculating the percentage of soluble non-sugar solids under 
     subheading 1702.90.40.
       The provision requires the Secretary of Agriculture and the 
     Commissioner of Customs to establish a monitoring program to 
     identify existing or likely circumvention of the tariff-rate 
     quotas in Chapters 17, 18, 19 and 21 of the HTSUS. The 
     Secretary and the Commissioner shall report the results of 
     their monitoring to Congress and the President every six 
     months, together with data and a description of developments 
     and trends in the composition of trade provided for in such 
     chapters. This report will be made public. The report will 
     discuss any indications that imports of articles not subject 
     to the tariff-rate quotas are being used for commercial 
     extraction of sugar in the United States. Imports of so-
     called ``high-test molasses'' currently classified under 
     subheading 1703.10.30 will be examined particularly closely 
     for such indications.
       Finally, the Secretary and the Commissioner will include in 
     the report their recommendations for ending circumvention, 
     including their recommendations for legislation. The Managers 
     emphasize that rapid action to stop circumvention is the best 
     way to prevent a problem from developing and that quick 
     administrative or legislative action is preferable to 
     protracted procedures and litigation, as occurred in the 
     Heartland case.

                DIVISION A--TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE


                         sec. 101--short title

     Present law

     House amendment
       Section 101 of H.R. 3009 provides that Division A of the 
     Act may be cited as the ``Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform 
     Act of 2002.''
     Senate amendment
       Section 101 of H.R. 3009 provides that Division A of the 
     Act may be cited as the ``Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform 
     Act of 2002.''
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.

              TITLE I--TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

          Subtitle A--Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers


  SEC. 111--REAUTHORIZATION OF THE TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

     Present law
       Current section 245 authorizes to be appropriated to the 
     Department of Labor such sums as may be necessary to carry 
     out the purposes of the TAA and NAFTA-TAA for workers 
     programs for the period October 1, 1998 through September 30, 
     2001. Current section 285 provides for termination of all 
     Trade Adjustment Assistance programs on September 30, 2001, 
     but provides that workers, and firms eligible to receive 
     benefits on or before that date shall continue to be eligible 
     to receive such benefits as though the programs were in 
     effect.
     House amendment
       The House Amendment reauthorized the Trade Adjustment 
     Assistance programs through September 30, 2004.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate bill creates a new section 248 of 
     the Trade Act of 1974 which authorizes to be appropriated to 
     the Department of Labor such sums as may be necessary to 
     carry out the purposes of the Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     workers program for the period October 1, 2001, through 
     September 30, 2007. Section 701 of the Senate bill amends 
     current section 285 to provide for termination of all Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance programs on September 30, 2007, but 
     provides that workers, and firms, communities, farmers, and 
     fishermen eligible to receive benefits on or before that date 
     shall continue to be eligible to receive such benefits as 
     though the programs were in effect.
     Conference agreement
       Conferees agree to extend the authorization of the Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance programs through September 30, 2007, 
     and to consolidate the NAFTA-TAA program with the regular TAA 
     program.

[[Page H5938]]

     sec. 112--filing of petitions and provision of rapid response 
    assistance; expedited review of petitions by secretary of labor

     Present law
       Current sections 221 and 250 set forth requirements 
     concerning who may file a petition for certification of 
     eligibility to apply for TAA and NAFTA-TAA assistance, 
     respectively. Under both programs, petitions may be filed by 
     a group of workers or by their certified or recognized union 
     or other duly authorized representative. TAA petitions are 
     filed with the Secretary of Labor. NAFTA-TAA petitions are 
     filed with the Governor of the relevant State and forwarded 
     by him to the Secretary of Labor. Under section 223, the 
     Secretary of Labor must rule on eligibility within 60 days 
     after a TAA petition is filed. Under section 250, the 
     Governor must make a preliminary eligibility determination 
     within 10 days after a NAFTA-TAA petition is filed, and the 
     Secretary of Labor must make a final eligibility 
     determination within the next 30 days. Section 221 also sets 
     forth notice and hearing obligations of the Secretary of 
     Labor upon receipt of a TAA petition. Section 250 provides 
     that, in the event of preliminary certification of 
     eligibility to apply for NAFTA-TAA benefits, the Governor 
     immediately provide the affected workers with certain rapid 
     response services.
     House amendment
       The House Amendment provided for a shortened period for the 
     Secretary of Labor to consider petitions from 60 days to 40 
     days and for other rapid response assistance to workers.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate bill creates a new section 231 of 
     the Trade Act of 1974, which consolidates the TAA and NAFTA-
     TAA programs by establishing a single program with a single 
     set of group eligibility criteria and a single set of 
     procedures and standards for filing and reviewing petitions, 
     certifying eligibility, and terminating certifications of 
     eligibility.
       Section 231 expands the list of entities that may file a 
     petition for group certification of eligibility to include 
     employers, one-stop operators or one-stop partners, State 
     employment agencies, and any entity to which notice of a 
     plant closing or mass layoff must be given under section 3 of 
     the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. 
     Section 231 also provides that the President, or the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate or the Committee on Ways 
     and Means of the House of Representatives (by resolution), 
     may direct the Secretary of Labor to initiate a certification 
     process under this chapter to determine the eligibility for 
     Trade Adjustment Assistance of a group of workers.
       Section 231 creates a single process for filing and 
     reviewing petitions for Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     workers, under which all petitions are filed with both the 
     Secretary of Labor and the Governor of the State. Upon filing 
     of the petition, the Governor is required to fulfill the 
     requirements of any agreement entered into with the 
     Department of Labor under section 222, to provide certain 
     rapid response services, and to notify workers on whose 
     behalf a petition has been filed of their potential 
     eligibility for certain existing federal health care, child 
     care, transportation, and other assistance programs. Upon 
     filing the petition, the Secretary of Labor must make his 
     certification determination within 40 days and provide the 
     notice required.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House with a change providing for 
     simultaneous filing of petitions with the Secretary of Labor 
     and State Governor.


                sec. 113--group eligibility requirements

     Present law
       Current law sections 222 and 250 of Title 11 of the Trade 
     Act of 1974 set forth group eligibility criteria. Under TAA, 
     the Secretary must certify a group of workers as eligible to 
     apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance if he determines (1) 
     that a significant number or proportion of the workers in 
     such workers' firm have become or are threatened to become 
     totally or partially separated; (2) sales or production of 
     such firm have decreased absolutely; and (3) imports of 
     articles like or directly competitive with articles produced 
     by such workers' firm contributed importantly to the total or 
     partial separation or threat thereof, and to the decline in 
     sales or production. Under NAFTA-TAA, group eligibility may 
     be based on the same criteria set forth in section 222, but 
     section 250 also provides for NAFTA-TAA eligibility where 
     there has been a shift in production by the workers' firm to 
     Mexico or Canada of articles like or directly competitive 
     with articles which are produced by the firm. Section 222 
     also includes special eligibility provisions with respect to 
     oil and natural gas producers.
     House amendment
       The House Amendment at Section 113 expanded the Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance programs to secondary workers that are 
     suppliers to firms that were certified and which satisfied 
     certain conditions.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment creates a new section 
     231 under which the eligibility criteria are revised. First, 
     workers are eligible for TAA if the value or volume of 
     imports of articles like or directly competitive with 
     articles produced by that firm have increased and the 
     increase in the value or volume of imports contributed 
     importantly to the workers' separation or threat of 
     separation. Second, eligibility is extended to workers who 
     are separated due to shifts in production to any country, 
     rather than only when the shift in production is to Mexico or 
     Canada. Third, eligibility is extended to adversely affected 
     secondary workers. Eligible secondary workers include workers 
     in supplier firms and, with respect to trade with NAFTA 
     countries, downstream firms. Fourth, a new special 
     eligibility provision is added with respect to taconite 
     pellets.
     Conference agreement
       The Conferees agree to extend coverage of Trade Adjustment 
     Assistance to new categories of workers: 1) secondary workers 
     that supply directly to another firm component parts for 
     articles that were the basis for a certification of 
     eligibility, 2) downstream workers that were affected by 
     trade with Mexico or Canada, and 3) certain workers that have 
     been laid off because their firm has shifted its production 
     to another country that has a free trade agreement with the 
     United States, that has a unilaterally preferential trading 
     arrangement with the United States, or when there has been or 
     is likely to be an increase in imports of the relevant 
     articles.


  sec. 114--qualifying requirements for trade readjustment allowances

     Present law
       Current section 231 establishes qualifying requirements 
     that must be met in order for an individual worker within a 
     certified group to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance. In 
     order to receive trade readjustment allowances, a 
     certified worker must have been separated on or after the 
     eligibility date established in the certification but 
     within 2 years of the date of the certification 
     determination; been employed for at least 26 of the 52 
     weeks preceding the separation at wages of $30 or more a 
     week; be eligible for and have exhausted unemployment 
     insurance benefits; not be disqualified for extended 
     compensation payable under the Federal-State Extended 
     Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970 by reason of the 
     work acceptance and job search requirements in section 
     202(a)(3) of that Act; and be enrolled in a training 
     program approved by the Secretary of Labor or have 
     received a training waiver.
     House amendment
       The House Amendment at Section 114 provided for 
     requirements and deadlines for workers to enroll in training.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new section 235 
     which maintains the individual eligibility requirements in 
     current law, with the exception of revisions to provisions 
     governing bases for granting training waivers.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House, with a change to adopt a 
     training enrollment deadline of 16 weeks after separation.


               SEC. 115--WAIVERS OF TRAINING REQUIREMENTS

     Present law
       Section 231 sets forth permissible bases for granting a 
     training waiver. Pursuant to section 250(d), training waivers 
     are not available in the NAFTA-TAA program.
     House amendment
       The House Amendment provides that all workers who are 
     eligible to apply for Trade Adjustment Assistance may be 
     considered for training waivers and codifies several bases on 
     which the Secretary may grant a waiver.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new section 235 
     which provides that all workers who are eligible to apply for 
     Trade Adjustment Assistance may be considered for training 
     waivers and codifies several bases on which the Secretary may 
     grant a waiver.
     Conference agreement
       The House receded to the Senate with a change to delete the 
     Senate provision giving the Secretary discretion to grant 
     waivers for ``other'' reasons.


  SEC. 116--AMENDMENTS TO LIMITATIONS ON TRADE READJUSTMENT ALLOWANCES

     Present law
       Current section 233 provides that each certified worker may 
     receive trade readjustment allowances for a maximum of 52 
     weeks. Current law also provides that, in most circumstances, 
     a worker is treated as participating in training during any 
     week which is part of a break in training that does not 
     exceed 14 days.
     House amendment
       Section 116 of the House Amendment would add 26 weeks of 
     trade adjustment allowances for those workers who were in 
     training and required the extension of benefits for the 
     purpose of completing training.

     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       Section 111 of the Senate Amendment adds a new section 243 
     which directs the Secretary of Labor, within one year of 
     enactment, to establish a two-year wage insurance pilot 
     program under which a State uses the funds provided to the 
     State for Trade Adjustment allowances to pay to an adversely 
     affected worker certified under section 231, for a period not 
     to exceed two years, a wage subsidy of up to 50 percent of 
     the difference between the wages received by the adversely 
     affected worker from reemployment and the wages received by 
     the adversely affected worker at the time of separation. An 
     adversely affected worker may be eligible to receive a wage 
     subsidy if the worker obtains reemployment not more than 26 
     weeks after the date of separation from the adversely 
     affected employment, is at least 50 years of age, earns not 
     more than $50,000 a year in wages from reemployment, is 
     employed at least 30 hours a week in the reemployment, and 
     does not return to the employment from which the worker was 
     separated. The wage subsidy available to workers in the wage 
     insurance program is 50 percent of the difference between the 
     amount of the wages received by the worker from reemployment 
     and the amount of the wages received by the worker at the 
     time of separation, if the wages the worker receives from 
     reemployment are less than $40,000 a year. The wage subsidy 
     is 25 percent if the wages received by the worker from 
     reemployment are greater than $40,000 a year but not more 
     than $50,000 a year. Total payments made to an adversely 
     affected worker under the wage insurance program may not 
     exceed $5,000 in each year of the 2-year period. A worker 
     participating in the wage insurance program is not eligible 
     to receive any other Trade Adjustment Assistance benefits, 
     unless the Secretary of Labor determines that the worker has 
     shown circumstances that warrant eligibility for training 
     benefits under section 240.
     Conference agreement
       The Conferees agree to create a new alternative Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance program for older workers.


          SEC. 125--DECLARATIONS OF POLICY; SENSE OF CONGRESS

     Present law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       The House passed amendment included a declaration of policy 
     and Sense of the Congress related to the responsibility of 
     the Secretary of Labor to provide information to workers 
     related to benefits available to them under the TAA and other 
     federal programs.
     Senate amendment
       Although certain supportive services are available to 
     dislocated workers under WIA, current law makes no express 
     linkage between these services and Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance and TAA certified workers may not be 
     able to access them. Section 111 of the Senate Amendment 
     adds a new section 243 which provides that States may 
     apply for and the Secretary of Labor may make available to 
     adversely affected workers certified under the Trade 
     Adjustment Assistance program supportive services 
     available under WIA, including transportation, child care, 
     and dependent care, that are necessary to enable a worker 
     to participate in or complete

[[Page H5940]]

     training. Section 243 requires the Comptroller General to 
     conduct a study of all assistance provided by the Federal 
     Government for workers facing job loss and economic 
     distress; to submit a report to the Committee on Finance 
     of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the 
     House of Representatives on the study within one year of 
     enactment of this Act; and to distribute the report to all 
     WIA one-stop partners. Section 243 further provides that 
     each State may conduct a study of its assistance programs 
     for workers facing job loss and economic distress. Each 
     State is eligible for a grant from the Secretary of Labor, 
     not to exceed $50,000, to enable it to conduct the study. 
     In the event that a grant is awarded, the State must, 
     within one year of receiving the grant, provide its report 
     to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Ways and 
     Means and distribute its report to one-stop partners in 
     the State.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.

           SUBTITLE B--Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms


    SEC. 131--REAUTHORIZATION OF TRADE ADJUSTMENT FOR FIRMS PROGRAM

     Present law
       The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms program provides 
     technical assistance to qualifying firms. Current Title 11, 
     Chapter 3, section 251 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides that 
     a firm is eligible to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance 
     under this program if (1) a significant number or proportion 
     of its workers have become or are threatened to become 
     totally or partially separated; (2) sales or production, or 
     both, have decreased absolutely; and (3) increases of imports 
     of articles like or directly competitive with articles which 
     are produced by such firms contributed importantly to the 
     total or partial separations or threat thereof.
       The authorization for the Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     Finns program expired on September 30, 2001. The TAA for 
     Firms program is currently subject to annual appropnations 
     and is funded as part of the budget of the Economic 
     Development Administration in the Department of Commerce.
     House amendment
       The House passed amendment included a 2 year 
     reauthorization for Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms.

     Adjustment Assistance for Firms program for fiscal years 2002 
     through 2007; expands the definition of qualifying firms to 
     cover shifts in production; and authorizes appropriations to 
     the Department of Commerce in the amount of $16 million 
     annually for fiscal years 2002 through 2007 to carry out the 
     purposes of the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms 
     program.
     Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate on the issue of providing a 
     $16 million authorization for Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     Firms and reauthorizing the program through September 30,

     Senate amendment
       Section 401 of the Senate Amendment adds new sections 292-
     298 of the Trade Act of 1974 which create a Trade Adjustment 
     Assistance program for farmers and ranchers in the Department 
     of Agriculture. Under this section, a group of agricultural 
     commodity producers may petition the Secretary of Agriculture 
     for Trade Adjustment Assistance. The Secretary must certify 
     the group as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     farmers if it is determined that the national average price 
     in the most recent marketing year for the commodity produced 
     by the group is less than 80 percent of the national average 
     price in the preceding 5 marketing years and that increases 
     in imports of that commodity contributed importantly to the 
     decline in price.
     Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate with changes. The Conferees 
     agree to include limitations on eligibility based upon 
     adjusted gross income and counter-cyclical payment

     fishermen in the Department of Commerce. Under this program, 
     a group of fishermen may petition the Secretary of Commerce 
     for Trade Adjustment Assistance. The Secretary must certify 
     the group as eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance for 
     fisherman if it is determined that the national average price 
     in the most recent marketing year for the fish produced by 
     the group is less than 80 percent of the national average 
     price in the proceeding five marketing years and that 
     increases in imports of that fish contributed importantly to 
     the decline in price.
     Conference agreement
       Conferees agree to drop Senate Amendment and authorize a 
     study by the Department of Labor to investigate applying TAA 
     to fisherman.

  TITLE II: CREDIT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS


SEC. 201 (a) AND 202.--CREDIT FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS OF INDIVIDUALS 
RECEIVING A TRADE READJUSTMENT ALLOWANCE OR A BENETFIT FROM THE PENSION 
  BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION; ADVANCE PAYMENT OF CREDIT FOR HEALTH 
                INSRUANCE COSTS OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIUDALS

     Present Law
       Under present law, the tax treatment of health insurance 
     expenses depends on the individual's circumstances. In 
     general, employer contributions to an accident or health plan 
     are excludable from an employee's gross income (sec. 106).
       Self-employed individuals are entitled to deduct a portion 
     of the amount paid for health insurance expenses for the 
     individual and his or her spouse and dependents. The 
     percentage of deductible expenses is 70 percent in 2002 and 
     100 percent in 2003 and thereafter.
       Individuals other than self-employed individuals who 
     purchase their own health insurance and itemize deductions 
     may deduct their expenses to the extent that their total 
     medical expenses exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income.
       Present law does not provide a tax credit for the purchase 
     of health insurance.
       The health care continuation rules (commonly referred to as 
     ``COBRA'' rules, after the Consolidated Omnibus Budget 
     Reconciliation Act of 1985 in which they were enacted) 
     require that employer-sponsored group health plans of 
     employers with 20 or more employees must offer certain 
     covered employees and their dependents (``qualified 
     beneficiaries'') the option of purchasing continued health 
     coverage in the event of loss of covera-e resulting ftom 
     certain qualifying events. These qualifying events include: 
     termination or reduction in hours of employment, death, 
     divorce or legal separation, enrollment in Medicare, the 
     bankruptcy of the employer, or the end of a child's 
     dependency under a parent's health plan. In general, the 
     maximum period of COBRA coverage is 18 months. An employer is 
     permitted to charge qualified beneficiaries 102 percent of 
     the applicable premium for COBRA coverage.
       Under present law, individuals without access to COBRA are 
     able to purchase indl-%idual policies on a guaranteed issue 
     basis without exclusion of coverage for pre-existing 
     conditions if they had 18 months of creditable coverage under 
     an employer sponsored group health plan, governmental plan, 
     or a church plan. Those with access to COBRA are required to 
     exhaust their 18 months of COBRA prior to obtaining a policy 
     on a guaranteed issue basis without exclusion of coverage for 
     pre-existing conditions.
     House amendment
       The House bill provides a refundable tax credit for up to 
     60 percent of the expenses of an eligible individual for 
     qualified health insurance coverage of the eligible 
     individual and his or her spouse or dependents. Eligible 
     individuals are certain TAA eligible workers and PBGC pension 
     beneficiaries. In the case of TAA eligible workers, no more 
     than 12 months of coverage would be eligible for the credit. 
     The amount of the credit would be phased out for taxpayers 
     with modified adjusted gross income between $20,000 and 
     $40,000 for single taxpayers ($40,000 and $80,000 for married 
     taxpayers filing a joint return). The credit would be 
     available on an advance basis pursuant to a program to be 
     established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Insurance that 
     qualifies for the credit includes certain COBRA coverage and 
     certain individual market options.

[[Page H5941]]

     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment provides a refundable credit for 70 
     percent of qualified health insurance expenses. The credit is 
     available with respect to certain TAA eligible workers. The 
     credit is payable on an advance basis pursuant to a program 
     to be established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Insurance 
     that qualifies for the credit includes certain COBRA 
     coverage, certain State-based options, and individual health 
     insurance if certain requirements are satisfied.
     Conference Agreement
       Refundable health insurance credit: in general
       In the case of taxpayers who are eligible individuals, the 
     conference agreement provides a refundable tax credit for 65 
     percent of the taxpayer's expenses for qualified health 
     insurance of the taxpayer and qualifying family members for 
     each eligible coverage month beginning in the taxable year. 
     The credit is available only with respect to amounts paid by 
     the taxpayer.
       Qualifying family members are the taxpayer's spouse and any 
     dependent of the taxpayer with respect to whom the taxpayer 
     is entitled to claim a dependency exemption.\1\ Any 
     individual who has other specified coverage is not a 
     qualifying family member.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ Present law allows the custodial parent to release the 
     night to claim the dependency exemption for a child to the 
     noncustodial parent. In addition, if certain requirements are 
     met, the parents may, decide by agreement that the 
     noncustodial parent is entitled to the dependency exemption 
     with respect to a child. In such cases, the provision would 
     treat the child as the dependent of the custodial parent for 
     purposes of the credit.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Persons eligible for the credit
       Eligibility for the credit is determined on a monthly 
     basis. In general, an eligible coverage month is any month 
     if, as of the first day of the month, the taxpayer (1) is an 
     eligible individual, (2) is covered by qualified health 
     insurance, (3) does not have other specified coverage, and 
     (4) is not imprisoned under Federal, State, or local 
     authority. In the case of a joint return, the eligibility 
     requirements are met if at least one spouse satisfies the 
     requirements. An eligible month must begin more than 90 days 
     after the date of enactment.
       An eligible individual is (1) an eligible TAA recipient, 
     (2) an eligible alternative TAA recipient, and (3) an 
     eligible PBGC pension recipient.
       An individual is an eligible TAA recipient during any month 
     if the individual (1) is receiving for any day of such month 
     a trade adjustment allowance \2\ or who would be eligible to 
     receive such an allowance but for the requirement that the 
     individual exhaust unemployment benefits before being 
     eligible to receive an allowance and (2) with respect to such 
     allowance, is covered under a certification issued under 
     subchapter A or D of chapter 2 of title 11 of the Trade Act 
     of 1974. An individual is treated as an eligible TAA 
     recipient during the first month that such individual would 
     otherwise cease to be an eligible TAA recipient.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ Part I of subchapter B, or subchapter D. of chapter 2 of 
     title 11 of the Trade Act of 1974.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       An individual is an eligible alternative TAA recipient 
     during any month if the individual (1) is a worker described 
     in section 246(a)(3)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974 who is 
     participating in the program established under section 
     246(a)(1) of such Act, and (2) is receiving a benefit for 
     such month under section 246(a)(2) of such Act. An individual 
     is treated as an eligible alternative TAA recipient during 
     the first month that such individual would otherwise cease to 
     be an eligible TAA recipient.
       An individual is a PBGC pension recipient for any month if 
     he or she (1) is age 55 or over as of the first day of the 
     month, and (2) is receiving a benefit any portion of which is 
     paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC).
       An otherwise eligible taxpayer is not eligible for the 
     credit for a month if, as of the first day of the month the 
     individual has other specified coverage. Specified coverage 
     would be (1) coverage under any insurance which constitutes 
     medical care (expect for insurance substantially all of the 
     coverage of which is for excepted benefits) \3\ if at least 
     50 percent of the cost of the coverage is paid by an employee 
     \4\ (or former employer) of the individual or his or her 
     spouse or (2) coverage under certain governmental health 
     programs. \5\ A rule aggregating plans of the same employer 
     applies in determining whether the employer pays at least 50 
     percent of the cost of coverage. A person is not an eligible 
     individual if he or she may be claimed as a dependent on 
     another person's tax return. A special rule applies with 
     respect to alternative TAA recipients.

     \3\ Excepted benefits are: (1) coverage only for accident or 
     disability income or any combination thereof, (2) coverage 
     issued as a supplement to liability insurance; (3) liability 
     insurance. including general liability insurance and 
     automobile liability insurance; (4) worker's compensation or 
     similar insurance; (5) automobile medical payment insurance; 
     (6) credit-only insurance; (7) coverage for on-site medical 
     clinics; (8) other insurance coverage similar to the 
     coverages in (1)-(7) specified in regulations under which 
     benefits for medical care are secondary or incidental to 
     other insurance benefits; (9) limited scope dental or vision 
     benefits; (10) benefits for long-term care, nursing home 
     care, home health care, community-based care, or any 
     combination thereof, and (11) other benefits similar to those 
     in (9) and (10) as specified in regulations; (12) coverage 
     only for a specified disease or illness; (13) hospital 
     indemnity or other fixed indemnity insurance; and (14) 
     Medicare supplemental insurance.
     \4\ An amount would be considered paid by the employer if it 
     is excludable from income. Thus. for example, amounts paid 
     for health coverage on a salary reduction basis under an 
     employer plan are considered paid by the employer.
     \5\ Specifically, an individual would not be eligible for the 
     credit if, as of the first day of the month, the individual 
     is (1) entitled to benefits under Medicare Part A, enrolled 
     in Medicare Part B, or enrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP, (2) 
     enrolled in a health benefits plan under the Federal 
     Employees Health Benefit Plan, or (3) entitled to receive 
     benefits under chapter 55 of title 10 of the United States 
     Code (relating to military personnel). An individual is not 
     considered to be enrolled in Medicaid solely by reason of 
     receiving immunizations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Qualified health insurance
       Qualified health insurance eligible for the credit is: (1) 
     COBRA continuation coverage (2) State based continuation 
     coverage provided by the State under a State law that 
     requires such coverage; (3) coverage offered through a 
     qualified State high risk pool; (4) coverage under a health 
     insurance program offered to State employees or a 
     comparable program; (5) coverage through an arrangement 
     entered into by the State and a group health plan, an 
     issuer of health insurance coverage, an administrator, or 
     an employer; (6) coverage offered through a State 
     arrangement with a private sector health care coverage 
     purchasing pool; (7) coverage under a State-operated 
     health plan that does not receive any Federal financial 
     participation; (8) coverage under a group health plan that 
     is available through the employment of the eligible 
     individual's spouse; and (9) coverage under individual 
     health insurance if the eligible individual was covered 
     under individual health insurance during the entire 30-day 
     period that ends on the date the individual became 
     separated from the employment which qualified the 
     individual for the TAA allowance, the benefit for an 
     eligible alternative TAA recipient, or a pension benefit 
     from the PBGC, whichever applies.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \6\ For this purpose, ``individual health insurance'' means 
     any insurance which constitutes medical care offered to 
     individuals other than in connection with a group health 
     plan. Such term does not include Federal- or State-based 
     health insurance coverage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Qualified health insurance does not include any State-based 
     coverage (i.e., coverage described in (2)-(8) in the 
     preceding paragraph), unless the State has elected to have 
     such coverage treated as qualified health insurance and such 
     coverage meets certain requirements. Such State coverage must 
     provide that each qualifying individual is guaranteed 
     enrollment if the individual pays the premium for enrollment 
     or provides a qualified health insurance costs eligibility 
     certificate and pays the remainder of the premium. In 
     addition, the State-based coverage cannot impose any pre-
     existing condition limitation with respect to qualifying 
     individuals. State-based coverage cannot require a qualifying 
     individual to pay a premium or contribution that is greater 
     than the premium or contribution for a similarly situated 
     individual who is not a qualified individual. Finally, 
     benefits under the State-based coverage must the same as (or 
     substantially similar to) benefits provided to similarly 
     situated individuals who are not qualifying individuals. A 
     qualifvlng individual is an eligible individual who seeks to 
     enroll in the State-based coverage and who has aggregate 
     periods of creditable coverage \7\ of three months or longer, 
     does not have other specified coverage, and who is not 
     imprisoned. A ``qualifying, individual'' also includes 
     qualified family members of such an eligible individual.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \7\ Creditable coverage is determined under the Health Care 
     Portability and Accountability Act (Code sec. 9801 (c)).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
       Qualified health insurance does not include coverage under 
     a flexible spending or similar arrangement or any insurance 
     if substantially all of the coverage is of excepted benefits.
       Other rules
       Amounts taken into account in determining the credit could 
     not be taken into account in determining the amount allowable 
     under the itemized deduction for medical expenses or the 
     deduction for health insurance expenses of self-employed 
     individuals. Amounts distributed from a medical savings 
     account would not be eligible for the credit. The amount of 
     the credit is reduced by any credit received on an advance 
     basis. Married taxpayers filing separate returns are eligible 
     for the credit; however, if both spouses are eligible 
     individuals and the spouses file a separate return, then the 
     spouse of the taxpayer is not a qualifying family member.
       The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to prescribe 
     such regulations and other guidance as may be necessary or 
     appropriate to carry out the provision.
       Advance payment of refundable health insurance credit; 
           reporting requirements
       The conference agreement provides for payment of the credit 
     on an advance basis (i.e., prior to the filing of the 
     taxpayer's return) pursuant to a program to be established by 
     the Secretary of the Treasury no later than August 1, 2003. 
     Such program is to provide for making payments on behalf of 
     certified individuals to providers of qualified health 
     insurance. In order to receive the credit on an advance 
     basis, a qualified health insurance costs credit eligibility 
     certificate would have to be in effect for the taxpayer. A 
     qualified health insurance costs credit eligibility 
     certificate is a written statement that an individual is an 
     eligible individual for purposes of the credit, provides such 
     information as the Secretary of the Treasury

[[Page H5942]]

     may require, and is provided by the Secretary of Labor or the 
     PBGC (as appropriate) or such other person or entity 
     designated by the Secretary.
       The conference report permits the disclosure of return 
     information of certified individuals to providers of health 
     insurance information to the extent necessary to carry out 
     the advance payment mechanism.
       The conference report provides that any person who receives 
     payments during a calendar year for qualified health 
     insurance and claims a reimbursement for an advance credit 
     amount is to file an information return with respect to each 
     individual from whom such payments were received or for whom 
     such a reimbursement is claimed. The return is to be in such 
     form as the Secretary may prescribe and is to contain the 
     name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the 
     individual and any other individual on the same health 
     insurance policy, the aggregate of the advance credit amounts 
     provided, the number of months for which advance credit 
     amounts are provided, and such other information as the 
     Secretary may prescribe. The conference report requires that 
     similar information be provided to the individual no later 
     than January 31 of the year following the year for which the 
     information return is made.

                             Effective Date

       The provision is generally effective with respect to 
     taxable years beginning after December 31, 2001. The 
     provision relating to the advance payment mechanism to be 
     developed by the Secretary would be effective on the date of 
     enactment.

SEC. 311--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR NONCOMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, 
         COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS, AND AIR AND MARINE INTERDICTION

     Present law
       The statutory basis for authorization of appropriations for 
     Customs is section 301 (b)(1) of the Customs Procedural and 
     Simplification Act of 1978 (19 U.S.C. 2075(b)). That law, as 
     amended by section 8102 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation 
     Act of 1986 [P.L. 99-509], first outlined separate amounts 
     for non-commercial and commercial operations for the salaries 
     and expenses portion of the Customs authorization. Under 19 
     U.S.C. 2075, Congress has adopted a two-year authorization 
     process to provide Customs with guidance as it plans its 
     budget, as well as guidance from the Committee for the 
     appropriation process.
       The most recent authorization of appropriations for Customs 
     (under section 101 of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 [P.L. 
     101 382]) provided $118,238,000 for salaries and expenses and 
     $143,047,000 for air and marine interdiction program for FY 
     1991, and $1,247,884,000 for salaries and expenses and 
     $150,199,000 for air and marine interdiction program in FY 
     1992.
     House amendment
       This provision authorizes $1,365,456,000 for FY 2003 and 
     $1,399,592,400 for FY 2004 for noncommercial operations of 
     the Customs Service. It also authorizes $1,642,602,000 for FY 
     2003 and $1,683,667,050 for FY 2004 for commercial operations 
     of the Customs Service. Of the amounts authorized for 
     commercial operations, $308,000,000 is authorized for the 
     automated commercial environment computer system for each 
     fiscal year. The provisions require that the Customs Service 
     provide the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on 
     Finance of the Senate with a report demonstrating that the 
     computer system is being built in a cost-effective manner. In 
     addition, the provisions authorizes $170,829,000 for FY 2003 
     and $175,099,725 for FY 2004 for air and marine interdiction 
     operations of the Customs Service. The provision requires 
     submission of out-of-year budget projections to the Ways and 
     Means and Finance Committees.
     Senate amendment
       This provision authorizes $886,513,000 for FY 2003 and 
     $909,471,000 for FY 2004 for noncommercial operations of the 
     Customs Service. It also authorizes $1,603,482,000 for FY 
     2003 and $1,645,009,000 for FY 2004 for commercial operations 
     of the Customs Service. Of the amounts authorized for 
     commercial operations, $308,000,000 is authorized for the 
     automated commercial environment computer system for each 
     fiscal year. The provisions require that the Customs Service 
     provide the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on 
     Finance of the Senate with a report demonstrating that the 
     computer system is being built in a cost-effective manner. In 
     addition, the provisions authorizes $181,860,000 for FY 2003 
     and $186,570,000 for FY 2004 for air and marine interdiction 
     operations of the Customs Service. The provision requires 
     submission of out-of-year budget projections to the Ways and 
     Means and Finance Committees.

     Mexico border, the United States-Canada border, and 
     Florida and the Gulf seaports. The equipment would include 
     vehicle and inspection systems. The provision would 
     require that $9,000,000 of the FY 2004 appropriations be 
     used for maintenance of equipment described above. This 
     section would also provide the Commissioner of Customs 
     with flexibility in using these funds and would allow for 
     the acquisition of new updated technology not anticipated 
     when this bill was drafted. Nothing in the language of the 
     bill is intended to prevent the Commissioner of Customs 
     from dedicating resources to specific ports not identified 
     in the bill.
       The equipment would include vehicle and container 
     inspection systems, mobile truck x-rays, upgrades to fixed-

                  CHAPTER 4--ANTITERRORISM PROVISIONS


     SEC. 341--IMMUNITY FOR CUSTOMS OFFICERS THAT ACT IN GOOD FAITH

     Present law
       Currently, Customs officers are entitled to qualified 
     immunity in civil suits brought by persons, who were searched 
     upon arrival in the United States. Qualified immunity 
     protects officers from liability if they can establish that 
     their actions did not violate any clearly established 
     constitutional or statutory rights.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would protect 
     Customs officers by providing them immunity from lawsuits 
     stemming from personal searches of people entering the 
     country so long as the officers conduct the searches in good 
     faith.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes to the House, but conferees qualify the 
     provision by adding that the means used to effectuate such 
     searches must be reasonable. To be covered by this immunity 
     provision, inspectors must follow Customs Service inspection 
     rules including the rule against profiling against race, 
     religions, or ethnic background.


SEC. 342--EMERGENCY ADJUSTMENTS TO OFFICES, PORTS OF ENTRY, OR STAFFING 
                         OF THE CUSTOMS SERVICE

     Present law
       Present law places numerous restrictions on and, in some 
     instances, precludes the Secretary of the Treasury or Customs 
     from making any adjustments to ports and staff. 19 U.S.C. 
     1318 requires a Presidential proclamation of an emergency and 
     authorization to the Secretary of the Treasury only to extend 
     the time for performance of legally required acts during an 
     emergency. No other emergency powers statute for Customs 
     exists.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would permit 
     the Secretary of the Treasury, if the President declares a 
     national emergency or if necessary to address specific 
     threats to human life or national interests, to eliminate, 
     consolidate, or relocate Customs ports and offices and to 
     alter staffing levels, services rendered and hours of 
     operations at those locations. In addition, the amendment 
     would permit the Commissioner of Customs, when necessary to 
     address threats to human life or national interests, to close 
     temporarily any Customs office or port or take any other 
     lesser action necessary to respond to the specific threat. 
     The Secretary or the Commissioner would be required to notify 
     Congress of any action taken under this proposal within 72 
     hours.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House Amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.

 SECS. 343 & 343A--MANDATORY ADVANCED ELECTRONIC INFORMATION FOR CARGO 
            AND PASSENGERS; SECURE SYSTEMS OF TRANSPORTATION

     Present law
       Currently, commercial carriers bringing passengers or cargo 
     into or out of the country have no obligation to provide 
     Customs with such information in advance.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would require 
     every air, land, or water-based commercial carrier to file an 
     electronic manifest describing all passengers with Customs 
     before entering or leaving the country. There is a similar 
     requirement for cargo entering the country. Specific 
     information required in the advanced manifest system would be 
     developed by Treasury in regulations.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is similar to the House Amendment. 
     However, with respect to cargo, the Senate Amendment applies 
     to out-bound as well as in-bound shipments.
     Conference agreement
       The conferees agree to direct the Secretary of the Treasury 
     to promulgate regulations pertaining to the electronic 
     transmission to the Customs Service of information relevant 
     to aviation, maritime, and surface transportation safety and 
     security prior to a cargo carrier's arrival in or departure 
     from the United States. The agreement sets forth parameters 
     for the Secretary to follow in developing these regulations. 
     For example, the parameters require that the regulations be 
     flexible with respect to the commercial and operational 
     aspects of different modes of transportation. They also 
     require that, in general, the Customs Service seek 
     information from parties most likely to have direct knowledge 
     of the information at issue. The conferees also agree to 
     amendment of the Tariff Act of 1930 to establish requirements 
     concerning proper documentation of ocean-bound cargo prior to 
     a vessel's departure. Finally, the conferees agree to direct 
     the Secretary of the Treasury to establish a task force to 
     evaluate, prototype and certify secure systems of 
     transportation.


 SEC. 344--BORDER SEARCH AUTHORITY FOR CERTAIN CONTRABAND IN OUTBOUND 
                                  MAIL

     Present law
       Although Customs currently searches all inbound mail, and 
     although it searches outbound mail sent via private carriers, 
     outbound mail carried by the Postal Service is not subject to 
     search.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would enable 
     Customs officers to search outbound U.S. mail for unreported 
     monetary instruments, weapons of mass destruction, firearms, 
     and other contraband used by terrorists. However, reading of 
     mail would not be authorized absent Customs officers 
     obtaining a search warrant or consent.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is the same as the House Amendment 
     with respect to mail weighing in excess of 16 ounces. 
     However, under the Senate Amendment, the Customs Service 
     would be required to obtain a warrant in order to search mail 
     weighing 16 ounces or less. The Senate Amendment also 
     requires the Secretary of State to determine whether it is 
     consistent with international law and U.S. treaty obligations 
     for the Customs Service to search mail transiting the United 
     States between two foreign countries. The Customs Service 
     would be authorized to search such mail only after the 
     Secretary of State determined that such measures are 
     consistent with international law and U.S. treaty 
     obligations.
     Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate.


   SEC. 345--Authorization of appropriations for reestablishment of 
                  Customs operations in New York City

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House authorizes 
     funds to reestablish those operations.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.

              CHAPTER 5--TEXTILE TRANSSHIPMENT PROVISIONS


  SEC. 351--GAO AUDIT OF TEXTILE TRANSSHIPMENT MONITORING BY CUSTOMS 
                                SERVICE

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would direct 
     the Comptroller General to conduct an audit of the systems at 
     the Customs Service to monitor and enforce textile 
     transshipment. The Comptroller General would report on 
     recommendations for improvements.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


  SEC. 352--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR TEXTILE TRANSSHIPMENT 
                         ENFORCEMENT OPERATIONS

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would 
     authorize $9,500,000 for FY 2002 to the Customs Service for 
     the purpose of enhancing its textile transshipment 
     enforcement operations. This amount would be in addition to 
     Customs Service's base authorization and the authorization to 
     reestablish the destroyed textile monitoring and enforcement 
     operations at the World Trade Center.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House, but the text is clarified 
     to provide that personnel will also conduct education and 
     outreach in addition to enforcement.


   SEC. 353--IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would earmark 
     approximately $1.3 million within Customs' budget for 
     selected activities related to providing technical assistance 
     to help sub-Saharan African countries develop and implement 
     effective visa and anti-transshipment systems as required by 
     the African Growth and Opportunity Act (title I of Public Law 
     106-200).
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.

      Subtitle B--Office of the United States Trade Representative


               SEC. 361--AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS

     Present law
       The statutory authority for budget authorization for the 
     Office of the United States Trade Representative is section 
     141(g)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2171 (a)(1)). 
     The most recent authorization of appropriations for USTR was 
     under section 101 of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 [P.L. 
     101-382]. Under 19 U.S.C. 2171, Congress has adopted a two-
     year authorization process to provide USTR with guidance as 
     it plans its budget as well as guidance from the Committee 
     for the appropriation process.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House authorizes 
     $32,300,000 for FY 2003 and $31,108,000 for FY 2004. The 
     provision requires submission of out-of-year budget 
     projections to the Ways and Means and Finance Committees. In 
     light of the substantial increase in trade negotiation work 
     to be conducted by USTR and the associated need for 
     consultations with Congress, this provision would authorize 
     the addition of two individuals to assist the office of 
     Congressional Affairs.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment authorizes $30,000,000 for FY 2003 and 
     $31,000,000 for FY 2004.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.

        Subtitle C--United States International Trade Commission


               SEC. 371.--Authorization of appropriations

     Present law
       The statutory authority for budget authorization for the 
     International Trade Commission is section 330(e)(2)(A) of the 
     Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1330(e)(2)(A)). The most recent 
     authorization of appropriations for the ITC was under section 
     101 of the Customs and Trade Act of 1990 [P.L. 101-382]. 
     Under 19 U.S.C. 1330, Congress has adopted a two-year 
     authorization process to provide the ITC with guidance as it 
     plans its budget as well as guidance from the Committees for 
     the appropriation process.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House authorizes 
     $54,000,000 for FY 2003 and $57,240,000 for FY 2004. The 
     provision requires submission of out-of-year budget 
     projections to the Ways and Means and Finance Committees.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment authorizes $51,400,000 for FY 2003 and 
     $53,400,000 for FY 2004.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.

                   Subtitle D--Other Trade Provisions


  SEC. 381.--Increase in aggregate value of articles exempt from duty 
               acquired abroad by United States residents

     Present law,
       The Harmonized Tariff Schedule at subheading 9804.00.65 
     currently provides a $400 duty exemption for travelers 
     returning from abroad.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would 
     increased the current $400 duty exemption to $800.

[[Page H5945]]

     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


                 SEC. 382.--Regulatory audit procedures

     Present law
       Section 509 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1509) 
     provides the authority for Customs to audit persons making 
     entry of merchandise into the U.S. In the course of such 
     audit, Customs auditors may identify discrepancies, including 
     underpayments of duties. However, if there also are 
     overpayments, there is no requirement that such overpayments 
     be offset against the underpayments if the underlying entry 
     has been liquidated.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would require 
     that when conducting an audit, Customs must recognize and 
     offset overpayments and overdeclarations of duties, 
     quantities and values against underpayments and 
     underdeclarations. As an example, if during an audit Customs 
     finds that an importer has underpaid duties associated with 
     one entry of merchandise by $100 but has also overpaid duties 
     from another entry of merchandise by $25, then any assessment 
     by Customs must be the difference of $75.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment is the same as the House amendment.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


                 SEC. 383.--Payment of Duties and Fees

     Present law
       Current law at 19 U.S.C. 1505 provides for the collection 
     of duties by the Secretary through regulatory process.
     House amendment
       H.R. 3009 as amended and passed by the House would require 
     duties to be paid within 10 working days without extension. 
     The bill also provides for the Customs Service to create a 
     monthly billing system upon the building of the Automated 
     Commercial Environment.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes to the House.

            DIVISION B--BIPARTISAN TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY

                  TITLE XXI--TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY


                  SEC. 2101.--SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS

     Present law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       The short title of the bill is the ``Bipartisan Trade 
     Promotion Authority Act of 2001.'' Section 2101 of the House 
     amendment to H.R. 3009 states that Congress finds the 
     expansion of international trade is vital to U.S. national 
     security and economic growth, as well as U.S. leadership. 
     Section 2101 also states that the recent pattern of decisions 
     by dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body of the 
     World Trade Organization to impose obligations and 
     restrictions on the use of antidumping and countervailing 
     measures by WTO members has raised concerns, and Congress is 
     concerned that such bodies appropriately apply the standard 
     of review contained in Article 17.6 of the Antidumping 
     Agreement, to provide deference to a permissible 
     interpretation by a WTO member and to the evaluation by a 
     member of the facts where that evaluation is unbiased and 
     objective and the establishment of the facts is proper.
     Senate amendment
       The short title of the bill is the ``Bipartisan Trade 
     Promotion Authority Act of 2002.'' Section 2101 of the Senate 
     amendment to H.R. 3009 states that Congress finds the 
     expansion of international trade is vital to U.S. national 
     security and economic growth, as well as U.S. leadership. 
     Section 2101 also states that support for continued trade 
     expansion requires that dispute settlement procedures under 
     international trade agreements not add to or diminish the 
     rights and obligations provided in such agreements. It goes 
     on to note a troubling pattern of cases before WTO dispute 
     settlement panels and the WTO Appellate Body that do 
     precisely that.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House with modifications. With 
     respect to the findings, the Conferees believe that, as 
     stated in section 2101(b) of the Conference agreement, 
     support for continued trade expansion requires that dispute 
     settlement procedures under international trade agreements 
     not add to or diminish the rights and obligations provided in 
     such agreements. Therefore, the recent pattern of decisions 
     by dispute settlement panels and the WTO Appellate Body to 
     impose obligations and restrictions on the use of 
     antidumping, countervailing and safeguard measures by WTO 
     members has raised concerns, and Congress is concerned that 
     such bodies appropriately apply the standard of review 
     contained in Article 17.6 of the Antidumping Agreement, to 
     provide deference to a permissible interpretation by a WTO 
     member and to the evaluation by a member of the facts where 
     that evaluation is unbiased and objective and the 
     establishment of the facts is proper.


                SEC. 2102--TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES

     Present/expired law
       Section 1101(a) of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness 
     Act of 1988 (the 1988 Act) set forth overall negotiating 
     objectives for concluding trade agreements. These objectives 
     were to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market 
     access, the reduction or elimination of barriers and other 
     trade-distorting policies and practices, and a more effective 
     system of international trading disciplines and procedures. 
     Section 1102(b) set forth the following principal trade 
     negotiating objectives: dispute settlement, transparency, 
     developing countries, current account surpluses, trade and 
     monetary coordination, agriculture, unfair trade practices, 
     trade in services, intellectual property, foreign direct 
     investment, safeguards, specific barriers, worker rights, 
     access to high technology, and border taxes.
     House amendment
       Section 2102 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 would 
     establish the following overall negotiating objectives: 
     obtaining more open, equitable, and reciprocal market access; 
     obtaining the reduction or elimination of barriers and other 
     trade-distorting policies and practices; further 
     strengthening the system of international trading disciplines 
     and procedures, including dispute settlement; fostering 
     economic growth and full employment in the U.S. and the 
     global economy; ensuring that trade and environmental 
     policies are mutually supportive and seeking to protect and 
     preserve the environment and enhance the international means 
     of doing so, while optimizing the use of the world's 
     resources; promoting respect for worker rights and the rights 
     of children consistent with International Labor Organization 
     core labor standards, as defined in the bill; and seeking 
     provisions in trade agreements under which parties strive to 
     ensure that they do not weaken or reduce the protections 
     afforded in domestic environmental and labor laws as an 
     encouragement to trade.
       In addition, section 2102 would establish the principal 
     trade negotiating objectives for concluding trade agreements, 
     as follows:
       Trade barriers and distortions: expanding competitive 
     market opportunities for U.S. exports and obtaining fairer 
     and more open conditions of trade by reducing or eliminating 
     tariff and nontariff barriers and policies and practices of 
     foreign governments directly related to trade that decrease 
     market opportunities for U.S. exports and distort U.S. 
     trade; and obtaining reciprocal tariff and nontariff 
     barrier elimination agreements, with particular attention 
     to products covered in section 111(b) of the Uruguay Round 
     Agreements Act.
       Services: to reduce or eliminate barriers to international 
     trade in services, including regulatory and other barriers, 
     that deny national treatment or unreasonably restrict the 
     establishment or operations of services suppliers.
       Foreign investment: to reduce or eliminate artificial or 
     trade-distorting barriers to trade-related foreign investment 
     and, recognizing that U.S. law on the whole provides a high 
     level of protection for investment, consistent with or 
     greater than the level required by international law, to 
     secure for investors important rights comparable to those 
     that would be available under U.S. legal principles and 
     practice, by:
       reducing or eliminating exceptions to the principle of 
     national treatment; freeing the transfer of funds relating to 
     investments; reducing or eliminating performance 
     requirements, forced technology transfers, and other 
     unreasonable barriers to the establishment and operation of 
     investments;
       seeking to establish standards for expropriation and 
     compensation for expropriation, consistent with United States 
     legal principles and practice;
       providing meaningful procedures for resolving investment 
     disputes including between an investor and a government;
       seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes 
     between an investor and a government through mechanisms to 
     eliminate frivolous claims and procedures to ensure the 
     efficient selection of arbitrators and the expeditious 
     disposition of claims;
       providing an appellate or similar review mechanism to 
     correct manifestly erroneous interpretations of law; and
       ensuring the fullest measure of transparency in investment 
     disputes by ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement 
     and all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions are 
     promptly made public; all hearings are open to the public; 
     and establishing a mechanism for acceptance of amicus curiae 
     submissions.
       Intellectual property: including: promoting adequate and 
     effective protection of intellectual property rights through 
     ensuring accelerated and full implementation of the Agreement 
     on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, 
     including strong enforcement; providing strong protection for 
     new and emerging technologies and new methods of transmitting 
     and distributing products embodying intellectual property; 
     and ensuring that standards of protection and enforcement 
     keep pace with technological developments, and in particular 
     ensuring that right holders have the legal and technological 
     means to control the use of their works through the internet 
     and other global communication media.

[[Page H5946]]

       Transparency: to increase public access to information 
     regarding trade issues as well as the activities of 
     international trade institutions; to increase openness in 
     international trade fora, including the WTO, by increasing 
     public access to appropriate meetings, proceedings, and 
     submissions, including with regard to dispute settlement and 
     investment; and to increase timely public access to 
     notifications made by WT0 member states and the supporting 
     documents.
       Anti-corruption: to obtain high standards and appropriate 
     enforcement mechanisms applicable to persons from all 
     countries participating in a trade agreement that prohibit 
     attempts to influence acts, decisions, or omissions of 
     foreign government; and to ensure that such standards do not 
     place U.S. persons at a competitive disadvantage in 
     international trade.
       Improvement of the WTO and multilateral trade agreements: 
     to achieve full implementation and extend the coverage of the 
     WTO and such agreements to products, sectors, and conditions 
     of trade not adequately covered; and to expand country 
     participation in and enhancement of the Information 
     Technology Agreement (ITA) and other trade agreements.
       Regulatory practices: to achieve increased transparency and 
     opportunity for the participation of affected parties in the 
     development of regulations; to require that proposed 
     regulations be based on sound science, cost-benefit analysis, 
     risk assessment, or other objective evidence; to establish 
     consultative mechanisms among parties to trade agreements to 
     promote increased transparency in developing guidelines, 
     rules, regulations, and laws for government procurement and 
     other regulatory regimes; and to achieve the elimination of 
     government measures such as price controls and reference 
     pricing which deny full market access for United States 
     products.
       Electronic commerce: to ensure that current obligations, 
     rules, disciplines, and commitments under the WTO apply to 
     electronic commerce; to ensure that electronically delivered 
     goods and services receive no less favorable treatment under 
     trade rules and commitments than like products delivered in 
     physical form; and the classification of such goods and 
     services ensures the most liberal trade treatment possible; 
     to ensure that governments refrain from implementing trade-
     related measures that impede electronic commerce; where 
     legitimate policy objectives require domestic regulations 
     that affect electronic commerce, to obtain commitments that 
     any such regulations are the least restrictive on trade, 
     nondiscriminatory, and transparent, and promote an open 
     market environment, and to extend the moratorium of the 
     WTO on duties on electronic transmissions.
       Agriculture: to ensure that the U.S. trade negotiators duly 
     recognize the importance of agricultural issues; to obtain 
     competitive market opportunities for U.S. exports in foreign 
     markets substantially equivalent to the competitive 
     opportunities afforded foreign exports in U.S. markets and to 
     achieve fairer and more open conditions of trade; to reduce 
     or eliminate trade distorting subsidies; to impose 
     disciplines on the operations of state-trading enterprises or 
     similar administrative mechanisms; to eliminate unjustified 
     restrictions on products derived from biotechnology; to 
     eliminate sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions that 
     contravene the Uruguay Round Agreement as they are not based 
     on scientific principles and to improve import relief 
     mechanisms to accommodate the unique aspects of perishable 
     and cyclical agriculture.
       Labor and the environment: to ensure that a party does not 
     fail to effectively enforce its environmental or labor laws, 
     through a sustained or recurring course of action or 
     Inaction, in a manner affecting trade between the United 
     States and that party; to recognize that a party to a trade 
     agreement is effectively enforcing its laws if a course of 
     inaction or inaction reflects a reasonable exercise of 
     discretion or results from a bona fide decision regarding 
     allocation of resources and no retaliation may be authorized 
     based on the exercise of these rights or the right to 
     establish domestic labor standards and levels of 
     environmental protection; to strengthen the capacity of U.S. 
     trading partners to promote respect for core labor standards 
     and to protect the environment through the promotion of 
     sustainable development; to reduce or eliminate government 
     practices or policies that unduly threaten sustainable 
     development; to seek market access for U.S. environmental 
     technologies, goods, and services; and to ensure that labor, 
     environmental, health, or safety policies and practices of 
     parties to trade agreements do not arbitrarily or 
     unjustifiably discriminate against U.S. exports or serve as 
     disguised barriers to trade.
       Dispute settlement and enforcement: to seek provisions in 
     trade agreements providing for resolution of disputes between 
     governments in an effective, timely, transparent, equitable, 
     and reasoned manner requiring determinations based on facts 
     and the principles of the agreement, with the goal of 
     increasing compliance; seek to strengthen the capacity of the 
     WTO Trade Policy Review Mechanism to review compliance; seek 
     provisions encouraging the early identification and 
     settlement of disputes through consultations; seek provisions 
     encouraging trade-expanding compensation; seek provisions to 
     impose a penalty that encourages compliance, is appropriate 
     to the parties, nature, subject matter, and scope of the 
     violation, and has the aim of not adversely affecting parties 
     or interests not party to the dispute while maintaining the 
     effectiveness of the enforcement mechanism; and seek 
     provisions that treat U.S. principal negotiating objectives 
     equally with respect to ability to resort to dispute 
     settlement and availability of equivalent procedures and 
     remedies.
       Extended WTO negotiations: concerning extended WTO 
     negotiations on financial services, civil aircraft, and rules 
     of origin.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is substantially similar to the House 
     Amendment, with the exception of several key provisions:
       Small Business: The Senate Amendment contains an overall 
     negotiating objective ``to ensure that trade agreements 
     afford small businesses equal access to international 
     markets, equitable trade benefits, expanded export market 
     opportunities, and provide for the reduction or elimination 
     of trade barriers that disproportionately impact small 
     businesses.''
       Trade in Motor Vehicles and Parts: The Senate Amendment 
     contains a principal negotiating objective on expanding 
     competitive opportunities for exports of U.S. motor vehicles 
     and parts.
       Foreign Investment: The Senate Amendment states as an 
     objective of the United States in the context of investor-
     state dispute settlement ``ensuring that foreign investors in 
     the United States are not accorded greater rights than United 
     States investors in the United States.'' The Senate 
     Amendment's objective with respect to investor-state dispute 
     settlement also differs from the House Amendment in the 
     following respects:
       It sets as an objective'' seeking to establish standards 
     for fair and equitable treatment consistent with United 
     States legal principles and practice, including the principle 
     of due process.''
       It sets deterrence of the filing of frivolous claims as an 
     objective, ``in addition to the prompt elimination of 
     frivolous claims.
       The Senate Amendment seeks to establish ``procedures to 
     enhance opportunities for public input into the formulation 
     of government positions.''
       The Senate Amendment seeks to establish a single appellate 
     body to review decisions by arbitration panels 'in investor-
     state dispute settlement cases. Also, unlike the House 
     Amendment, the Senate Amendment does not prescribe a standard 
     of review for an eventual appellate body.
       Intellectual Property: The Senate Amendment contains an 
     objective to respect the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement 
     and Public Health, adopted by the World Trade Organization at 
     the Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha, Qatar on November 
     14, 2001.''
       Trade in Agriculture: The Senate Amendment's negotiating 
     objective on export subsidies differs from the House 
     Amendment, stating that an objective of the United States is 
     ``seeking to eliminate all export subsidies on agricultural 
     commodities while maintaining bona fide food aid and 
     preserving U.S. agriculture development and export credit 
     programs that allow the U.S. to compete with other foreign 
     export promotion efforts.'' The Senate Amendment also 
     provides that it is a negotiating objective of the United 
     States to ``strive to complete a general multilateral round 
     in the WTO by January 1, 2005, and seek the broadest market 
     access possible in multilateral, regional, and bilateral 
     negotiations, recognizing the effect that simultaneous sets 
     of negotiations may have on US import-sensitive commodities 
     (including those subject to tariff-rate quotas).''
       Human Rights and Democracy: The Senate Amendment contains a 
     negotiating objective ``to obtain provisions in trade 
     agreements that require parties to those agreements to strive 
     to protect internationally recognized civil, political, and 
     human rights.''
       Dispute Settlement: The Senate Amendment contains a 
     negotiating objective absent in the House Amendment ``to seek 
     improved adherence by panels convened under the WTO 
     Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the 
     Settlement of Disputes and by the WTO Appellate Body to the 
     standard of review applicable under the WTO Agreement 
     involved in the dispute, including greater deference, where 
     appropriate, to the fact finding and technical expertise of 
     national investigating authorities.''
       Border Taxes: The Senate Amendment contains an objective 
     absent from the House Amendment on border taxes. The 
     objective seeks ``to obtain a revision of the WTO rules with 
     respect to the treatment of border adjustments for internal 
     taxes to redress the disadvantage to countries relying 
     primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather than indirect 
     taxes.'' The objective is addressed to a decision by the WTO 
     Dispute Settlement Body holding the foreign sales corporation 
     provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to be inconsistent 
     with WTO rules.
       Textiles: The Senate Amendment contains an extensive 
     objective on opening foreign markets to U.S. textile exports. 
     There is no similar provision in the House Amendment.
       Worst Forms of Child Labor: The Senate Amendment contains a 
     negotiating objective to prevent distortions in the conduct 
     of international trade caused by the use of the worst forms 
     of child labor and to redress unfair and illegitimate 
     competition based upon the use of the worst forms of child 
     labor.

[[Page H5947]]

     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House with several modifications. 
     With respect to the overall negotiating objectives, the 
     Conferees agree to the overall negotiating objective 
     regarding small business in section 2102(a)(8) of the Senate 
     amendment. Second, the Conferees agree to an overall 
     negotiating objective to promote universal compliance with 
     ILO Declaration 182 concerning the worst forms of child 
     labor.
       With respect to the principal negotiating objectives, the 
     Conferees agree to expand the negotiating objective on 
     intellectual property to respect the Declaration on the TRIPS 
     Agreement and Public Health, adopted by the WTO at Doha 
     (section 2102(b)(4)(c) of the Senate amendment).
       With respect to the principal negotiating objectives 
     regarding foreign investment, the Conferees believe that it 
     is a priority for negotiators to seek agreements protecting 
     the rights of U.S. investors abroad and ensuring the 
     existence of a neutral investor-state dispute settlement 
     mechanism. At the same time, these protections must be 
     balanced so that they do not come at the expense of making 
     Federal, State and local laws and regulations more vulnerable 
     to successful challenges by foreign investors than by 
     similarly situated U.S. investors.
       No Greater Rights: The House recedes to the Senate with a 
     technical modification to clarify that foreign investors in 
     the United States are not accorded greater substantive rights 
     with respect to investment protections than United States 
     investors in the United States. That is, the reciprocal 
     obligations regarding investment protections that the United 
     States undertakes in pursuing its goals should not result in 
     foreign investors being entitled to compensation for 
     government actions where a similarly situated U.S. investor 
     would not be entitled to any form of relief, while ensuring 
     that U.S. investors abroad can challenge host government 
     measures which violate the terms of the investment agreement. 
     Thus, this language expresses Congress' direction that the 
     substantive investment protections (e.g., expropriation, fair 
     and equitable treatment, and full protection and security) 
     should be consistent with United States legal principles and 
     practice and not provide greater rights to foreign investors 
     in the United States.
       This language applies to substantive protections only and 
     is not applicable to procedural issues, such as access to 
     investor-state dispute settlement. The Conferees recognize 
     that the procedures for resolving disputes between a foreign 
     investor and a government may differ from the procedures for 
     resolving disputes between a domestic investor and a 
     government and may be available at different times during the 
     dispute. Thus, the ``no greater rights'' direction does not, 
     for instance, apply to such issues as the dismissal of 
     frivolous claims, the exhaustion of remedies, access to 
     appellate procedures, or other similar issues.
       The Conferees also agree that negotiators should seek to 
     provide for an appellate body, or similar mechanism to 
     provide coherence to the interpretations of investment 
     provisions in trade agreements.
       With respect to the principal negotiating objective on 
     agriculture, the Conferees agree to section 
     2102(b)(10)(A)(iii) and (xv) of the House amendment, in lieu 
     of section 2102(b)(10)(A)(iii) of the Senate amendment. The 
     Conferees also accept section 2102(b)(10)(A)(xvi) of the 
     Senate amendment on the timing and sequence of WTO 
     agriculture negotiations relative to other negotiations.
       The Conferees agree to section 2102(b)(13)(C) of the Senate 
     amendment, relating to dispute settlement in dumping, 
     subsidy, and safeguard cases, as modified, to seek adherence 
     by WTO panels to the applicable standard of review.
       The Conferees recognize the importance of preserving the 
     ability of the United States to enforce rigorously its trade 
     remedy laws, including the antidumping, countervailing duty 
     and safeguard laws. Because this issue is significant to many 
     Members of Congress in both the House and Senate, the 
     Conferees have made this priority a principal negotiating 
     objective. Negotiators must also avoid agreements that lessen 
     the effectiveness of domestic and international disciplines 
     on unfair trade, as well as domestic and international 
     safeguard provisions. In addition, section 2102(b)(14)(B) 
     directs the President to address and remedy market 
     distortions that lead to dumping and subsidization, including 
     overcapacity, cartelization, and market-access barriers.
       The Conferees agree to section 2012(b)(14) of the Senate 
     amendment stating that the United States should seek a 
     revision of WTO rules on the treatment of border adjustments 
     for internal taxes to redress the disadvantage to countries 
     relying primarily on direct taxes for revenue rather than 
     indirect taxes. The Conferees agree that such a revision of 
     WTO rules is one among other options for the United States, 
     including domestic legislation, to redress such a 
     disadvantage.
       The Conferees agree to include as a principal negotiating 
     objective to obtain competitive market opportunities for U.S. 
     exports of textiles substantially equivalent to those for 
     foreign textiles in the United States.
       The Conferees agree to a principal negotiating objective 
     concerning the worst forms of child labor, to seek 
     commitments by trade agreement parties to vigorously enforce 
     their own laws prohibiting the worst forms of child labor.


             SEC. 2102(c)--PROMOTION OF CERTAIN PRIORITIES

     Present/expired law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 2102(c) of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 sets 
     forth certain priorities for the President to address. These 
     provisions include seeking greater cooperation between WTO 
     and the ILO; seeking to establish consultative mechanisms 
     among parties to trade agreements to strengthen the capacity 
     of U.S. trading partners to promote respect for core labor 
     standards; seeking to seek to establish consultative 
     mechanisms among parties to trade agreements to strengthen 
     the capacity of U.S. trading partners to develop and 
     implement standards for environment and human health based on 
     sound science; conducting environmental reviews of future 
     trade and investment agreements, consistent with Executive 
     Order 13141 and its relevant guidelines; reviewing the impact 
     of future trade agreements on U.S. employment, modeled after 
     Executive Order 13141; taking into account, in negotiating 
     trade agreements, protection of legitimate health or safety, 
     essential security, and consumer interests; requiring the 
     Secretary of Labor to consult with foreign parties to trade 
     negotiations as to their labor laws and providing technical 
     assistance where needed; reporting to Congress on the extent 
     to which parties to an agreement have in effect laws 
     governing exploitative child labor; preserving the ability of 
     the United States to enforce rigorously its trade laws, 
     including antidumping and countervailing duty laws, and 
     avoiding agreements which lessen their effectiveness; 
     ensuring that U.S. exports are not subject to the abusive use 
     of trade laws, including antidumping and countervailing duty 
     laws, by other counties; continuing to promote consideration 
     of Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAS) and 
     consulting with parties to such agreements regarding the 
     consistency of any MEA that includes trade measures with 
     existing environmental exceptions under Article XX of the 
     GATT.
       In addition, USTR, twelve months after the imposition of a 
     penalty or remedy by the United States permitted by an 
     agreement to which this Act applies, is to report to the 
     Committee on the effectiveness of remedies applied under U.S. 
     law to enforce U.S. rights under trade agreements. USTR shall 
     address whether the remedy was effective in changing the 
     behavior of the targeted party and whether the remedy had any 
     adverse impact on parties or interests not party to the 
     dispute.
       Finally, section 2102(c) would direct the President to seek 
     to establish consultative mechanisms among parties to trade 
     agreements to examine the trade consequences of significant 
     and unanticipated currency movements and to scutinize whether 
     a foreign government engaged in a pattern of manipulating its 
     currency to promote a competitive advantage in international 
     trade.
     Senate amendment
       With several notable exceptions, the priorities set forth 
     in section 2102(c) of the Senate Amendment are identical to 
     the priorities set forth in the House Amendment. The 
     exceptions are:
       With respect to the study that the President must perform 
     on the impact of future trade agreements on employment, the 
     Senate Amendment requires the President to examine particular 
     criteria, as follows: the impact on job security, the level 
     of compensation of new jobs and existing jobs, the 
     displacement of employment, and the regional distribution of 
     employment, utilizing experience from previous trade 
     agreements and alternative models of employment analysis. The 
     Senate Amendment also requires that the report be made 
     available to the public.
       The Senate Amendment requires that, in connection with new 
     trade agreement negotiations, the President shall ``submit to 
     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of 
     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate a 
     meaningful labor rights report of the country, or countries, 
     with respect to which the President is negotiating.''
       The Senate Amendment adds to the House Amendment priority 
     on preserving the ability of the United States to enforce 
     vigorously its trade laws, by including U.S. ``safeguards'' 
     law in the list of laws at issue. This is the U.S. law 
     authorizing the President to provide relief to parties 
     seriously injured or threatened with serious injury due to 
     surges of imports. The priority in the Senate Amendment also 
     directs the President to remedy certain market distorting 
     measures that underlie unfair trade practices.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House amendment with several 
     modifications. With respect to the worst forms of child 
     labor, the Conferees agree to expand section 2102(c)(2) of 
     the House amendment to include the worst forms of child labor 
     within requirement to seek to establish consultative 
     mechanisms to strengthen the capacity of U.S. trading 
     partners to promote respect for core labor standards.
       The Conferees agree to modify section 2105(c)(5) of the 
     House amendment to require the President to report on impact 
     of future trade agreements on US employment, including on 
     labor markets, modeled after E.O. 13141 to the extent 
     appropriate in establishing procedures and criteria, and to 
     make the report public.

[[Page H5948]]

       With respect to the labor rights report in section 
     2102(c)(8) of both bills, the Conferees agree to the Senate 
     provision. Furthermore, the Conferees agree to section 
     2107(b)(2)(E) of the Senate amendment to require that 
     guidelines for the Congressional Oversight Group include the 
     time frame for submitting this report.


  SEC. 2102(d)--CONSULTATIONS, ADHERENCE TO OBLIGATIONS UNDER URUGUAY 
                            ROUND AGREEMENTS

     Present/expired law
       No provision.
     Housc amendment
       Section 2102(d) of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 
     requires that USTR consult closely, and on a timely basis 
     with the Congressional Oversight Group appointed under 
     section 2107. In addition, USTR would be required to consult 
     closely (including immediately before the initialing of an 
     agreement) with the congressional advisers on trade policy 
     and negotiations appointed under section 161 of the Trade Act 
     of 1974, as well as the House Committee on Ways and Means, 
     the Senate Committee on Finance, and the Congressional 
     Oversight Group. With regard to negotiations concerning 
     agriculture trade, USTR would also be required to consult 
     with the House and Senate Committees on Agriculture.
       In determining whether to enter into negotiations with a 
     particular country, section 2102(e) would require the 
     President to take into account whether that country has 
     implemented its obligations under the Uruguay Round 
     Agreements.
     Senate amendment
       Section 2102(d) of the Senate amendment is identical to the 
     House provision in the House amendment to H.R. 3009.
     Conference agreement
       The Conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


                 SEC. 2103--TRADE AGREEMENTS AUTHORITY

     Present/expired law
       Tariff proclamation authority. Section 1102(a) of the 1988 
     Act provided authority to the President to proclaim 
     modifications in duties without the need for Congressional 
     approval, subject to certain limitations. Specifically, for 
     rates that exceed 5 percent ad valorem, the President could 
     not reduce any rate of duty to a rate less than 50 percent of 
     the rate of duty applying on the date of enactment. Rates at 
     or below 5 percent could be reduced to zero. Any duty 
     reduction that exceeded 50 percent of an existing duty higher 
     than 5 percent or any tariff increase had to be approved by 
     Congress.
       Staging, authority required that duty reductions on any 
     article could not exceed 3 percent per year, or one-tenth of 
     the total reduction, whichever is greater, except that 
     staging was not required if the International Trade 
     Commission determined there was no U.S. production of that 
     article.
       Negotiation of bilateral agreements. Section 1102(c) of the 
     1988 Act set forth three requirements for the negotiation of 
     a bilateral agreement:
       The foreign country must request the negotiation of the 
     bilateral agreement;
       The agreement must make progress in meeting applicable U.S. 
     trade negotiating objectives; and
       The President must provide written notice of the 
     negotiations to the Committee on Ways and Means and the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate and consult with these 
     committees.
       The negotiations could proceed unless either Committee 
     disapproved the negotiations within 60 days prior to the 90 
     calendar days advance notice required of entry into an 
     agreement (described below).
       Negotiation of multilateral non-tariff agreements. With 
     respect to multilateral agreements, section 1102(b) of the 
     1988 Act provided that whenever the President determines that 
     any barrier to, or other distortion of, international trade 
     unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United 
     States or adversely affects the U.S. economy, or the 
     imposition of any such barrier or distortion is likely to 
     result in such a burden, restriction, or effect, he may enter 
     into a trade agreement with the foreign countries involved. 
     The agreement must provide for the reduction or elimination 
     of such barrier or other distortion or prohibit or limit the 
     imposition of such a barrier or distortion.
       Provisions qualifying for fast track procedures. Section 
     1103(b)(1)(A) of the 1988 Act provided that fast track apply 
     to implementing bills submitted with respect to any trade 
     agreements entered into under the statute. Section 151(b)(1) 
     of the Trade Act of 1974 further defined ``implementing 
     bill'' as a bill containing provisions ``necessary or 
     appropriate'' to implement the trade agreement, as well as 
     provisions approving the agreement and the statement of 
     administrative action.
       Time period. The authority applied with respect to 
     agreements entered into before June 1, 1991, and until June 
     1, 1993 unless Congress passed an extension disapproval 
     resolution. The authority was then extended to April 15, 
     1994, to cover the Uruguay Round of multilateral negotiations 
     under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
     House amendment
       Section 2103 of the House amendment provides:
       Proclamation authority. Section 2103(a) would provide the 
     President the authority to proclaim, without Congressional 
     approval, certain duty modifications in a manner very similar 
     to the expired provision. Specifically, for rates that exceed 
     5 percent ad valorem, the President would not be authorized 
     to reduce any rate of duty to a rate less than 50 percent of 
     the rate of duty applying on the date of enactment. Rates at 
     or below 5 percent ad valorem could be reduced to zero. Any 
     duty reduction that exceeded 50 percent of an existing duty 
     higher than 5 percent or any tariff increase would have to be 
     approved by Congress.
       In addition, section 2103(a) would not allow the use of 
     tariff proclamation authority on import sensitive 
     agriculture.
       Staging authority would require that duty reductions on any 
     article could not exceed 3 percent per year, or one-tenth of 
     the total reduction, whichever is greater, except that 
     staging would not be required if the International Trade 
     Commission determined there is no U.S. production of that 
     article.
       These limitations would not apply to reciprocal agreements 
     to eliminate or harmonize duties negotiated under the 
     auspices of the World Trade Organization, such as so-called 
     ``zero-for-zero'' negotiations.
       Agreements on tariff and non-tariff barriers. Section 
     2103(b)(1) would authorize the President to enter into a 
     trade agreement with a foreign country whenever he determined 
     that any duty or other import restriction or any other 
     barrier to or distortion of international trade unduly 
     burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the United States 
     or adversely affects the U.S. economy, or the imposition of 
     any such barrier or distortion is likely to result in such a 
     burden, restriction, or effect. The agreement must provide 
     for the reduction or elimination of such barrier or other 
     distortion or prohibit or limit the imposition of such a 
     barrier or distortion. No distinction would be made between 
     bilateral and multilateral agreements.
       Conditions. Section 2103(b)(2) would provide that the 
     special implementing bills procedures may be used only if the 
     agreement makes progress in meeting the applicable objectives 
     set forth in section 2102(a) and (b) and the President 
     satisfies the consultation requirements set forth in section 
     2104.
       Bills qualifying for trade authorities procedures. Section 
     2103(b)(3)(A) would provide that bills implementing trade 
     agreements may qualify for trade promotion authority TPA 
     procedures only if those bills consist solely of the 
     following provisions:
       Provisions approving the trade agreement and statement of 
     administrative action; and
       Provisions necessary or appropriate to implement the trade 
     agreement.
       Time period. Sections 2103(a)(1)(A) and 2103(b)(1)(C) would 
     extend trade promotion authority to agreements entered into 
     before June 1, 2005. An extension until June 1, 2007, would 
     be permitted unless Congress passed a disapproval resolution, 
     as described under section 2103(c).
     Senate amendment
       In most respects, section 2103 of the Senate Amendment is 
     identical to section 2103 of the House Amendment. However, 
     there are several key differences, as follows:
       The Senate Amendment limits the President's proclamation 
     authority with respect to ``import sensitive agricultural 
     products,'' a term defined in section 2113(5) of the Senate 
     Amendment. This limitation differs from the limitation in the 
     House Amendment, inasmuch as it includes certain products 
     subject to tariff rate quotas.
       The Senate Amendment contains a provision making a trade 
     agreement implementing bill ineligible for ``fast track'' 
     procedures if the bill modifies, amends, or requires 
     modification or amendment to certain trade remedy laws. A 
     bill that does modify, amend or require modification or 
     amendment to those laws is subject to a point of order in the 
     Senate, which may be waived by a majority vote.
       The Senate Amendment requires the U.S. International Trade 
     Commission to submit a report to Congress on negotiations 
     during the initial period for which the President is granted 
     trade promotion authority. This report would be made in 
     connection with a request by the President to have such 
     authority extended.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House amendment with several 
     modifications. The Conferees agree to the new definition of 
     import sensitive agriculture in section 2103(a)(2)(B), 
     2104(b)(2)(A)(i), and 2113(5) of the Senate amendment to 
     encompass products subject to tariff rate quotas, as well as 
     products subject to the lowest tariff reduction in the 
     Uruguay Round.
       The Conferees agree to section 2103(c)(3)(B) of the Senate 
     amendment, which requires the ITC to submit a report to 
     Congress by May 1, 2005 (if the President seeks extension of 
     TPA until June 2, 2007) analyzing the economic impact on the 
     United States of all trade agreements implemented between 
     enactment and the extension request.


                SEC. 2104--CONSULTATIONS AND ASSESSMENT

     Present/expired law
       Section 102 of the Trade Act of 1974 and sections 1102(d) 
     and 1103 of the 1988 Act set forth the fast track 
     requirements. These provisions required the President, before 
     entering into any trade agreement, to consult with Congress 
     as to the nature of the agreement, how and to what extent the 
     agreement will achieve applicable purposes, policies, and 
     objectives, and all matters relating to agreement 
     implementation. In addition, before entering into an 
     agreement, the President was required to give Congress at 
     least

[[Page H5949]]

     90 calendar days advance notice of his intent. The purpose of 
     this period was to provide the Congressional Committees of 
     jurisdiction an opportunity to review the proposed agreement 
     before it was signed.
       Section 135(e) of the Trade Act of 1974 required that the 
     Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations meet at 
     the conclusion of negotiations for each trade agreement and 
     provide a report as to whether and to what extent the 
     agreement promotes the economic interests of the United 
     States and achieves the applicable overall and principal 
     negotiating objectives of section 1101 of the 1988 Act. The 
     report was due not later than the date on which the President 
     notified Congress of his intent to enter into an agreement. 
     With regard to the Uruguay Round, the report was due 30 days 
     after the date of notification.
     House amendment
       Section 2104 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 would 
     establish a number of requirements that the President consult 
     with Congress. Specifically, section 2104(a)(1) would require 
     the President to provide written notice and consult with the 
     relevant committees at least 90 calendar days prior to 
     entering into negotiations. Section 2104(a)(c) also provides 
     that President shall meet with the Congressional Oversight 
     Group established under section 2107 upon a request of a 
     majority of its members. Trade promotion authority would not 
     apply to an implementing bill if both Houses separately agree 
     to a procedural disapproval resolution within any 60-day 
     period stating that the Administration has failed to notify 
     or consult with Congress.
       Section 2104(b)(1) would establish a special consultation 
     requirement for agriculture. Specifically, before initiating 
     negotiations concerning tariff reductions in agriculture, the 
     President is to assess whether U.S. tariffs on agriculture 
     products that were bound under the Uruguay Round Agreements 
     are lower than the tariffs bound by that country. In his 
     assessment, the President would also be required to consider 
     whether the tariff levels bound and applied throughout the 
     world with respect to imports from the United States are 
     higher than U.S. tariffs and whether the negotiation provides 
     an opportunity to address any such disparity. The President 
     would be required to consult with the Committees on Ways and 
     Means and Agriculture of the House and the Committees on 
     Finance and Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry of the Senate 
     concerning the results of this assessment and whether it is 
     appropriate for the United States to agree to further tariff 
     reductions under such circumstances and how all applicable 
     negotiating objectives would be met.
       Section 2104(b)(2) provides special consultations on import 
     sensitive agriculture products. Specifically, before 
     initiating negotiations on agriculture and as soon as 
     practicable with respect to the Free Trade Area of the 
     Americas and WTO negotiations, USTR is to identify import 
     sensitive agriculture products and consult with the 
     Committees on Ways and Means and Agriculture of the House and 
     the Committees on Finance and Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
     Forestry in the Senate concerning whether any further 
     tariff reduction should be appropriate, and whether the 
     identified products face unjustified sanitary or 
     phytosanitary barriers. USTR is also to request that the 
     International Trade Commission prepare an assessment of 
     the probable economic effects of any such tariff reduction 
     on the U.S. industry producing the product and on the U.S. 
     economy as a whole. USTR is to then notify the Committees 
     of those products for which it intends to seek tariff 
     liberalization as well as the reasons. If USTR commences 
     negotiations and then identifies additional import 
     sensitive agriculture products, or a party to the 
     negotiations requests tariff reductions on such a product, 
     then USTR shall notify the Committees as soon as 
     practicable of those products and the reasons for seeking 
     tariff reductions.
       Section 2104(c) would establish a special consultation 
     requirement for textiles. Specifically, before initiating 
     negotiations concerning tariff reductions in textiles and 
     apparel, the President is to assess whether U.S. tariffs on 
     textile and apparel products that were bound under the 
     Uruguay Round Agreements are lower than the tariffs bound by 
     that country. In his assessment, the President would also be 
     required to consider whether the tariff levels bound and 
     applied throughout the world with respect to imports from the 
     United States are higher than U.S. tariffs and whether the 
     negotiation provides an opportunity to address any such 
     disparity. The President would be required to consult with 
     the Committee on Ways and Means of the House and the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate concerning the results of 
     this assessment and whether it is appropriate for the United 
     States to agree to further tariff reductions under such 
     circumstances and how all applicable negotiating objectives 
     would be met.
       In addition, section 2104(d) would require the President, 
     before entering into any trade agreement, to consult with the 
     relevant Committees concerning the nature of the agreement, 
     how and to what extent the agreement will achieve the 
     applicable purposes, policies, and objectives set forth in 
     the House amendment to H.R. 3009 and all matters relating, to 
     implementation under section 2105, including the general 
     effect of the agreement on U.S. laws.
       Section 2104(e) would require that the report of the 
     Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations under 
     section 135(e)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 be provided not 
     later than 30 days after the date on which the President 
     notifies Congress of his intent to enter into the agreement 
     under section 2105(a)(1)(A).
       Finally, section 2104(f) would require the President, at 
     least 90 days before entering into a trade agreement, to ask 
     the International Trade Commission to assess the agreement, 
     including the likely impact of the agreement on the U.S. 
     economy as a whole, specific industry sectors, and U.S. 
     consumers. That report would be due 90 days from the date 
     after the President enters into the agreement.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is substantially similar to the House 
     bill, with the following exceptions:
       Consultations on export subsidies and distorting policies. 
     Section 2104(b)(2)(A)(ii)(III) requires consultations on 
     whether nations producing identified products maintain export 
     subsidies or distorting policies that distort trade and 
     impact of policies on U.S. producers.
       Consultations relating to fishing trade. Section 2104(b)(3) 
     requires that for negotiations relating to fishing trade, the 
     Administration will keep fully apprised and on timely basis 
     consult with the House Resources Committee and the Senate 
     Commerce Committee.
       Special reporting requirements on U.S. trade remedy laws. 
     Section 2104(d) provides that the President, at least 90 
     calendar days before the President enters into a trade 
     agreement, shall notify the House Ways and Means Committee 
     and the Senate Finance Committee in writing any amendments to 
     U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws (title VII of 
     the Tariff Act of 1930) or U.S. safeguard provisions (chapter 
     1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974) that the President 
     proposes to include in the implementing legislation. On the 
     date that the President transmits the notification, the 
     President must also transmit to the Committees a report 
     explaining his reasons for believing that amendments to these 
     trade remedy laws are necessary to implement the trade 
     agreement and his reasons for believing that such amendments 
     are consistent with the negotiating objective on this issue. 
     Not later than 60 calendar days after the date on which the 
     President transmits notification to the relevant committees, 
     the Chairman and ranking members of the House Ways and Means 
     Committee and the Senate Finance Committees shall issue 
     reports stating whether the proposed amendments described in 
     the President's notification are consistent with the 
     negotiating objectives on trade laws.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House with several modifications. 
     The Conferees agree to section 2104(b)(2)(A)(ii)(III) of the 
     Senate amendment, which requires consultations on whether 
     other nations producing identified products maintain export 
     subsidies or distorting policies that distort trade and 
     impact of policies on U.S. producers. In addition, the 
     Conferees agree to section 2104(b)(3) of the Senate 
     amendment, which requires that for negotiations relating to 
     fishing trade, the Administration will keep fully apprised 
     and on timely basis consult with the House Resources 
     Committee and the Senate Commerce Committee.
       Finally, the Conferees agree to include the notification 
     and report on changes to trade remedy laws in sections 
     2104(d)(3)(A) and (B) in the Senate amendment with 
     modifications. Given the priority that Conferees attach to 
     keeping U.S. trade remedy laws strong and ensuring that they 
     remain fully enforceable, the Conference agreement puts in 
     place a process requiring special scrutiny of any impact that 
     trade agreements may have on these laws. The process requires 
     the President, at least 180 calendar days before the day on 
     which he enters into a trade agreement, to report to the 
     Committees on Ways and Means and the Committee on Finance 
     the range of proposals advanced in trade negotiations and 
     may be in the final agreement that could require 
     amendments to title VII of the Tariff Act of 1930 or to 
     chapter 1 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974; and how 
     these proposals relate to the objectives described in 
     section 2102(b)(14).
       The Conference agreement also provides a mechanism for any 
     Member in the House or Senate to introduce at any time after 
     the President's report is issued a nonbinding resolution 
     which states ``that the ______ finds that the proposed 
     changes to U.S. trade remedy laws contained in the report of 
     the President transmitted to the Congress on ______ under 
     section 2104(d)(3) of the Bipartisan Trade Promotion 
     Authority Act of 2002 with respect to ______, are 
     inconsistent with the negotiating objectives described in 
     section 2102(b)(14) of that Act.'', with the first blank 
     space being filled in with either the ``House of 
     Representatives'' or the ``Senate'', as the case may be, the 
     second blank space filled in with the appropriate date of the 
     report, and the third blank space being filled in with the 
     name of the country or countries involved.
       The resolution is referred to the Ways and Means and Rules 
     Committees in the House and the Finance Committee in the 
     Senate, and is privileged on the floor if it is reported by 
     the Committees. The Conference agreement allows only one 
     resolution (either a nonbinding resolution or a disapproval 
     resolution) per agreement to be eligible for the

[[Page H5950]]

     trade promotion authority procedures contained in sections 
     152 (d) and (e) of the Trade Act of 1974. The one resolution 
     quota is satisfied for the House only after the Ways and 
     Means Committee reports a resolution, and for the Senate only 
     after the Finance Committee reports a resolution.
       The Conference agreement states that, with respect to 
     agreements entered into with Chile and Singapore, the report 
     referenced in section 2104(d)(3)(A) shall be submitted by the 
     President at least 90 calendar days before the day on which 
     the President enters into a trade agreement with either 
     country.


             SEC. 2105--IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADE AGREEMENTS

     Present/expired law
       Before entering into the draft agreement, the President was 
     required to give Congress 90 days advance notice (120 days 
     for the Uruguay Round) to provide an opportunity for revision 
     before signature. After entering into the agreement, the 
     President was required to submit formally the draft 
     agreement, implementing legislation, and a statement of 
     administrative action. Once the bill was formally introduced, 
     there was no opportunity to amend any portion of the bill--
     whether on the floor or in committee. Consequently, before 
     the formal introduction took place, the committees of 
     jurisdiction would hold hearings, ``unofficial'' or 
     ``informal'' mark-up sessions and a ``mock conference'' with 
     the Senate committees of jurisdiction in order to develop a 
     draft implementing bill together with the Administration and 
     to make their concerns known to the Administration before it 
     introduced the legislation formally.
       After formal introduction of the implementing bill, the 
     House committees of jurisdiction had 45 legislative days to 
     report the bill, and the House was required to vote on the 
     bill within 15 legislative days after the measure was 
     reported or discharged from the committees. Fifteen 
     additional days were provided for Senate committee 
     consideration (assuming the implementing bill was a revenue 
     bill), and the Senate floor action was required within 15 
     additional days. Accordingly, the maximum period for 
     Congressional consideration of an implementing bill from the 
     date of introduction was 90 legislative days. Amendments to 
     the legislation were not permitted once the bill was 
     introduced; the committee and floor actions consisted of ``up 
     or down'' votes on the bill as introduced.
       Finally, section 1103(d) of the 1988 Act specified that the 
     fast track rules were enacted as an exercise of the 
     rulemaking power of the House and the Senate, with the 
     recognition of the right of either House to change the rules 
     at any time.
     House amendment
       Under Section 2105 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009, the 
     President would be required, at least 90 days before entering 
     into an agreement, to notify Congress of his intent to enter 
     into the agreement. Section 2105(a) also would establish a 
     new requirement that the President, within 60 days of signing 
     an agreement, submit to Congress a preliminary list of 
     existing laws that he considers would be required to bring 
     the United States into compliance with agreement.
       Section 2105(b) would provide that trade promotion 
     authority would not apply if both Houses separately agree to 
     a procedural disapproval resolution within any 60-day period 
     stating that the Administration failed to notify or consult 
     with Congress, which is defined as failing or refusing to 
     consult in accordance with section 2104 or 2105, failing to 
     develop or meet guidelines under section 2107(b), failure to 
     meet with the Congressional Oversight Group, or the agreement 
     fails to make progress in achieving the purposes. policies, 
     priorities, and objectives of the Act. In a change from the 
     expired law, such a resolution may be introduced by any 
     Member of the House or Senate. Only one such privileged 
     resolution would be permitted to be considered per trade 
     agreement per Congress.
       Most of the remaining provisions are identical to the 
     expired law. Specifically, section 2105(a) would require the 
     President, after entering into agreement, to submit formally 
     the draft agreement, the implementing legislation, and a 
     statement of administrative action to Congress, and there 
     would be no time limit to do so, but with the new requirement 
     that the submission be made on a date on which both Houses 
     are in session, The procedures of section 151 of the Trade 
     Act of 1974 would then apply. Specifically, on the same day 
     as the President formally submits the legislation, the bill 
     would be introduced (by request) by the Majority Leaders of 
     the House and the Senate. After formal introduction of the 
     legislation, the House Committees of jurisdiction would have 
     45 legislative days to report the bill. The House would be 
     required to vote on the bill within 15 legislative days after 
     the measure was reported or discharged from the 
     Committees. Fifteen additional days would be provided for 
     Senate Committee consideration (assuming the implementing 
     bill was a revenue bill), and Senate floor action would be 
     required within 15 additional days. Accordingly, the 
     maximum period for Congressional consideration of the 
     implementing bill from the date of introduction would be 
     90 legislative days.
       As with the expired provisions, once the bill has been 
     formally introduced, no amendments would be permitted either 
     in Committee or floor action, and a straight ``up or down'' 
     vote would be required. Of course, before formal 
     introduction, the bill could be developed by the Committees 
     of jurisdiction together with the Administration during the 
     informal Committee mark-up process.
       Finally, as with the expired provision, section 2105(c) 
     specifies that sections 2105(b) and 3(c) are enacted as an 
     exercise of the rulemaking power of the House and the Senate, 
     with the recognition of the right of either House to change 
     the rules at any time.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate Amendment is substantially similar to the House 
     Bill, with the following exception:
       Reporting requirements. Section 2105(a)(1)(A)(ii) requires 
     the President to transmit to the House Ways and Means 
     Committee and the Senate Finance Committee the notification 
     and report described in section 2104(d)(3)(A) regarding 
     changes to U.S. trade remedy laws.
       Disclosure Requirements. Section 2105(a)(4) of the Senate 
     bill specifies that any trade agreement or understanding with 
     a foreign government (oral or written) not disclosed to 
     Congress will not be considered part of trade agreement 
     approved by Congress and shall have no effect under U.S. law 
     or in any dispute settlement body.
       Senate Procedures. Section 2105(b)(1)(C)(i)(11) provides 
     that any Member of the Senate may introduce a procedural 
     disapproval resolution, and that that resolution will be 
     referred to the Senate Finance Committee. Section 
     2105(b)(1)(C)(iv) provides that the Senate may not consider a 
     disapproval resolution that has not been reported by the 
     Senate Finance Committee.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House amendment with several 
     modifications. The Conferees agree to section 2105(a)(4) of 
     the Senate amendment, which specifies that any trade 
     agreement or understanding with a foreign government (oral or 
     written) not disclosed to Congress will not be considered 
     part of trade agreement approved by Con--2ress and shall have 
     no effect under U.S. law or in any dispute settlement body. 
     The Conferees also agree to sections 2105(b)(1)(C)(i)(11) and 
     (b)(1)(C)(Iv) of the Senate amendment, which applies the same 
     procedures for consideration of bills in the Senate as for 
     the House.
       Finally, the Conferees agree to section 2105(b)(2) of the 
     Senate amendment with modifications, which requires the 
     Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretaries 
     of State and Treasury, the Attorney General, and the United 
     States Trade Representative, to transmit to Congress a report 
     setting forth the strategy of the executive branch to address 
     concerns of Congress regarding whether dispute settlement 
     panels and the Appellate Body of the WTO have added to 
     obligations or diminished rights of the United States, as 
     described in section 2101 (b)(3). Trade authorities 
     procedures shall not apply to any implementing bill with 
     respect to an agreement negotiated under the auspices of the 
     WTO unless the Secretary of Commerce has issued such report 
     prior to December 31, 2002.


            SEC. 2106--TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TRADE AGREEMENTS

     Present/expired law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 2106 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 exempts 
     agreements resulting from ongoing negotiations with Chile or 
     Singapore, an agreement establishing a Free Trade Area of the 
     Americas, and agreements concluded under the auspices of the 
     WTO from prenegotiation consultation requirements of section 
     2104(a) only. However, upon enactment of H.R. 3009, the 
     Administration is required to consult as to those elements 
     set forth in section 2104(a) as soon as feasible.
     Senate Amendment
       Section 2106 of the Senate amendment is substantially 
     similar to the House bill.
     Conference Agreement
       The Conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


                SEC. 2107--CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT GROUP

     Present/expired law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 2107 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 would 
     require the Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means and 
     the Chairman of the Committee on Finance to chair and 
     convene, sixty days after the effective date of this Act, the 
     Congressional Oversight Group. The Group would be comprised 
     of the following Members of the House: the Chairman and 
     Ranking Member of the Committee on Ways and Means and three 
     additional members of the Committee (not more than two of 
     whom are from the same party), and the Chairman and Ranking 
     Member of the Committees which would have, under the Rules of 
     the House, jurisdiction over provisions of law affected by a 
     trade negotiation. The Group would be comprised of the 
     following Members of the Senate: the Chairman and Ranking 
     Member of the Committee on Finance and three additional 
     members of the Committee (not more than two of whom are from 
     the same party), and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the 
     Committees which would have, under the Rules of the Senate, 
     jurisdiction over provisions of law affected by a trade 
     negotiation.
       Members are to be accredited as official advisors to the 
     U.S. delegation in the negotiations. USTR is to develop 
     guidelines to facilitate the useful and timely exchange of 
     information between USTR and the Group, including regular 
     briefings, access to pertinent

[[Page H5951]]

     documents, and the closest possible coordination at all 
     critical periods during the negotiations, including at 
     negotiation sites.
       Finally, section 2107(c) provides that upon the request of 
     a majority of the Congressional Oversight Group, the 
     President shall meet with the Group before initiating 
     negotiations or any other time concerning the negotiations.
     Senate amendment
       Section 2107 of the Senate amendment is identical to the 
     House amendment to H.R. 3009.
     Conference agreement
       The Conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


   SEC. 2108--ADDITIONAL IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT REQUIREMENTS

     Present/expired law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 2108 of the House amendment to H.R. 3009 would 
     require the President to submit to the Congress a plan for 
     implementing and enforcing any trade agreement resulting from 
     this Act. The report is to be submitted simultaneously with 
     the text of the agreement and is to include a review of the 
     Executive Branch personnel needed to enforce the agreement as 
     well as an assessment of any U.S. Customs Service 
     infrastructure improvements required. The range of personnel 
     to be addressed in the report is very comprehensive, 
     including U.S. Customs and Department of Agriculture border 
     inspectors, and monitoring and implementing personnel at 
     USTF, the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and the 
     Treasury, and any other agencies as may be required.

                          SEC. 3102--FINDINGS

     Present law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       Section 1302 contains findings of Congress that:
       (1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act was enacted in 
     1991, it has had a positive impact on United States trade 
     with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Two-way trade has 
     doubled, with the United States serving as the leading source 
     of imports and leading export market for each of the Andean 
     beneficiary countries. This has resulted in increased jobs 
     and expanded export opportunities in both the United States 
     and the Andean region.
       (2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element 
     in the United States counter narcotics strategy in the Andean 
     region, promoting export diversification and broad-based 
     economic development that provide sustainable economic 
     alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the 
     legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable 
     alternatives to illicit trade in coca.
       (3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade 
     Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by 
     political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable 
     to the consequences of the drug war and fierce global 
     competition for its legitimate trade.
       (4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a 
     threat to the security interests of the United States and the 
     world. This problem has been partially addressed through 
     foreign aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in 
     2000. However, foreign aid alone is not sufficient. 
     Enhancement of legitimate trade with the United States 
     provides an alternative means for reviving and stabilizing 
     the economies in the Andean region.
       (5) The Andean Trade Preference Act constitutes a tangible 
     commitment by the United States to the promotion of 
     prosperity, stability, and democracy in the beneficiary 
     countries.
       (6) Renewal and enhancement of the Andean Trade Preference 
     Act will bolster the confidence of domestic private 
     enterprise and foreign investors in the economic prospects of 
     the region, ensuring that legitimate private enterprise can 
     be the engine of economic development and political stability 
     in the region.
       (7) Each of the Andean beneficiary countries is committed 
     to conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas 
     by the year 2005 as a means of enhancing the economic 
     security of the region.
       (8) Temporarily enhancing trade benefits for Andean 
     beneficiaries countries will promote the growth of free 
     enterprise and economic opportunity in these countries and 
     serve the security interests of the United States, the 
     region, and the world.
     Senate amendment
       Section 3101 is identical.
     Conference agreement
       The conference agreement follows the House amendment and 
     the Senate amendment.


        SEC. 3103--ARTICLES ELIGIBLE FOR PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT

     Articles (Except Apparel) Eligible for Preferential Treatment

     Present law
       The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), enacted on December 
     4, 1991 as title II of Public Law 102-182, authorizes 
     preferential trade benefits for the Andean nations of 
     Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, similar to those 
     benefits granted to beneficiaries under the Caribbean Basin 
     Initiative program. The ATPA authorizes the President to 
     proclaim duty-free treatment for all eligible articles from 
     Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru. This authority applies only 
     to normal column I rates of duty in the Harmonized Tariff 
     Schedule of the United States (HTS); any additional duties 
     imposed under U.S. unfair trade practice laws, such as the 
     antidumping or countervailing duty laws, are not affected by 
     this authority.
       The ATPA contains a list of products that are ineligible 
     for duty-free treatment. More specifically, ATPA duty-free 
     treatment does not apply to textile and apparel articles that 
     are subject to textile agreements; petroleum and petroleum 
     products; footwear not eligible for duty-free treatment under 
     the Generalized System of Preferences; certain watches and 
     watch parts; certain leather products;

[[Page H5952]]

     and sugar, syrups and molasses subject to over-quota rates of 
     duty.
     House amendment
       Section 3103 (a) amends the Andean Trade Preference Act to 
     authorize the President to proclaim duty-free treatment for 
     any of the following articles which were previously excluded 
     from duty-free treatment under the ATPA, if the President 
     determines that the article is not import-sensitive in the 
     context of imports from beneficiary countries:
       (1) Footwear not designated at the time of the effective 
     date of this Act as eligible for the purposes of the 
     Generalized System of Preferences under title V of the Trade 
     Act of 1974;
       (2) Petroleum, or any product derived from petroleum, 
     provided for in headings 2709 and 2710 of the HTS;
       (3) Watches and watch parts (including cases, bracelets and 
     straps), of whatever type including, but not limited to, 
     mechanical, quartz digital or quartz analog, if such watches 
     or watch parts contain any material which is the product of 
     any country with respect to which HTS column 2 rates of duty 
     apply;
       (4) Handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather 
     wearing apparel that--(i) are the product of any beneficiary 
     country; and (ii) were not designated on August 5, 1983, as 
     eligible articles for purposes of the Generalized System of 
     Preferences under title V of the Trade Act of 1974.
       Under H.R. 3009, textiles subject to textile agreements; 
     sugar, syrups and molasses subject to over-quota tariffs; and 
     rum and tafia classified in subheading 2208.40.00 of the HTS 
     would continue to be ineligible for duty-free treatment, as 
     would apparel products other than those specifically 
     described below. Imports of tuna, prepared or preserved in 
     any manner, in airtight containers would receive immediate 
     duty-free treatment.
     Senate amendment
       Section 3102 of the bill replaces the list of excluded 
     products under section 204(b) of the current ATPA with a new 
     provision that extends duty preferences to most of those 
     products. The new preferences take the form of exceptions to 
     the general rule that the excluded products are not eligible 
     for duty-free treatment.
       The enhanced preferences are made available to ``ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries.'' Paragraph (5) of section 204(b) of 
     the ATPA as amended by the present bill defines ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries as those countries previously 
     designated by the President as ``beneficiary countries'' 
     (i.e., Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru) which 
     subsequently are designated by the President as ``ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries,'' based on the President's 
     consideration of additional eligibility criteria.
       In the event that the President did not designate a current 
     ``beneficiary country'' as an ``ATPEA beneficiary country,'' 
     that country would remain eligible for ATPA benefits under 
     the law as expired on December 4, 2001, but would not be 
     eligible for the enhanced benefits provided under the present 
     bill.
       Footwear not eligible for duty-free treatment under GSP 
     receives the same tariff treatment as like products from 
     Mexico, except that duties on articles in particular tariff 
     subheadings are to be reduced by 1/15 per year.
       The Senate Amendment provides special treatment for rum and 
     tafia, allowing them to receive the same tariff treatment as 
     like products from Mexico. The bill also allows certain 
     handbags, luggage, flat goods, work gloves, and leather 
     wearing apparel to receive the same tariff treatment as like 
     products from Mexico.
       Under the bill, the President is authorized to proclaim 
     duty-free treatment for tuna that is harvested by United 
     States or ATPEA vessels, subject to a quantitative yearly cap 
     of 20 percent of the domestic United States tuna pack in the 
     preceding year.
     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes on the authority of President to proclaim 
     duty-free treatment for particular articles which were 
     previously excluded from duty-free treatment under the ATPA, 
     if the President determines that the article is not import-
     sensitive in the context of imports from beneficiary 
     countries.
       Textiles subject to textile agreements; sugar, syrups and 
     molasses subject to over-quota tariffs; and rum and tafia 
     classified in subheading 2208.40.00 of the HTS would continue 
     to be ineligible for duty-free treatment, as would apparel 
     products other than those specifically described below.
       House recedes on the treatment of tuna with an amendment 
     to: 1) retain U.S. or Andean flagged vessel rule of origin 
     requirement in Senate amendment; 2) authorize the President 
     to grant duty-free treatment for Andean exports of tuna 
     packed in flexible (e.g., foil), airtight containers weighing 
     with their contents not more than 6.8 kg each; and 3) update 
     calculation of current MFN tariff-rate quota to be an amount 
     based on 4.8 percent of apparent domestic consumption of tuna 
     in airtight containers rather than domestic production.

                       Eligible Apparel Articles

     Present law
       Under the ATPA, apparel articles are on the list of 
     products excluded from eligibility for duty-free treatment.
     House amendment
       Under Section 3103, the President may proclaim duty-free 
     and quota-free treatment for apparel articles sewn or 
     otherwise assembled in one or more beneficiary countries 
     exclusively from any one or any combination of the following:
       (1) Fabrics or fabric components formed, or components 
     knit-to-shape, in the United States (including fabrics not 
     formed from yarns, if such fabrics are classifiable under 
     heading 5602 or 5603 of the HTS and are formed in the United 
     States).
       (2) Fabrics or fabric components formed, or components 
     knit-to-shape, in one or more beneficiary countries, from 
     yarns formed in one or more beneficiary countries, if such 
     fabrics (including fabrics not formed from yarns, if such 
     fabrics are classifiable under heading 5602 or 5603 of the 
     HTS and are formed in one or more beneficiary countries) are 
     in chief weight of llama, or alpaca.
       (3) Fabrics or yarn not produced in the United States or in 
     the region, to the extent that apparel articles of such 
     fabrics or yarn would be eligible for preferential treatment, 
     without regard to the source of the fabrics or yarn, under 
     Annex 401 of the NAFTA (short supply provisions). Any 
     interested party may request the President to consider such 
     treatment for additional fabrics and yarns on the basis that 
     they cannot be supplied by the domestic industry in 
     commercial quantities in a timely manner, and the President 
     must make a determination within 60 calendar days of 
     receiving the request from the interested party.
       (4) Apparel articles sewn or otherwise assembled in one or 
     more beneficiary countries from fabrics or fabric components 
     formed or components knit-to-shape, in one or more 
     beneficiary countries, from yarns formed in the United States 
     or in one or more beneficiary countries (including fabrics 
     not formed from yarns, if such fabrics are classifiable under 
     heading 5602 or 5603 of the HTS and are formed in one or more 
     beneficiary countries), whether or not the apparel articles 
     are also made from any of the fabrics, fabric components 
     formed, or components knit-to-shape in the United States 
     described in paragraph 1. Imports of apparel made from 
     regional fabric and regional yarn would be capped at 3% of 
     U.S. imports growing to 6% of U.S. imports in 2006, 
     measured in square meter equivalents.
     Senate amendment
       Paragraph (2) of section 204(b) of the ATPA as amended by 
     section 3102 of the present bill extends duty-free treatment 
     to certain textile and apparel articles from ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries. The provision divides articles 
     eligible for this treatment into several different categories 
     and limits duty-free treatment to a period defined as the 
     ``transition period.'' The transition period is defined in 
     paragraph (5) of section 204(b) of the ATPA as amended to be 
     the period from enactment of the present bill through the 
     earlier of February 28, 2006 or establishment of a FTAA.
       In general, the different categories of textile and apparel 
     articles eligible for duty-free treatment are defined 
     according to the origin of the yarn and fabric from which the 
     articles are made. Under the first category, apparel sewn or 
     otherwise assembled in one or more ATPEA beneficiary 
     countries is eligible for duty-free treatment if it is made 
     exclusively from one or a combination of several sub-
     categories of components, as follows:
       (1) United States fabric, fabric components, or knit-to-
     shape components, made from yarns wholly formed in the United 
     States;
       (2) A combination of both United States and ATPEA 
     beneficiary country components knit-to-shape from yarns 
     wholly formed in the United States;
       (3) ATPEA beneficiary country fabric, fabric components, or 
     knit-to-shape components, made from yarns wholly formed in 
     one or more ATPEA beneficiary countries, if the constituent 
     fibers are primarily llama or alpaca hair; and
       (4) Fabrics or yarns, regardless of origin, if such fabrics 
     or yarns have been deemed, under the North American Free 
     Trade Agreement, not to be widely available in commercial 
     quantities in the United States. A separate provision of 
     section 204(b) of the ATPA as amended by the present bill 
     sets forth a process for interested parties to petition the 
     President for inclusion of additional yarns and fabrics in 
     the ``short supply'' list. This process includes obtaining 
     advice from the United States International Trade Commission 
     and industry advisory groups, and consultation with the 
     Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways 
     and Means of the House of Representatives.
       A second category of apparel articles eligible for duty-
     free treatment is apparel articles knit-to-shape (except 
     socks) in one or more ATPEA beneficiary countries from yarns 
     wholly formed in the United States. To qualify under this 
     category, the entire article must be knit-to-shape--as 
     opposed to being assembled from components that are 
     themselves knit-to-shape.
       A third category of apparel articles eligible for duty-free 
     treatment is apparel articles wholly assembled in one or more 
     ATPEA beneficiary countries from fabric or fabric components 
     knit, or components knit-to-shape in one or more ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries from yarns wholly formed in the United 
     States. The quantity of apparel eligible for this benefit is 
     subject to an annual cap. The cap is set at 70 million square 
     meter equivalents for the one-year period beginning March 1, 
     2002. The cap will increase by 16 percent, compounded 
     annually, in each succeeding one-year period, through 
     February 28, 2006.

[[Page H5953]]

       Thus, the cap applied to this category in each year 
     following enactment will be as follows:
       70 million square meter equivalents (SME) in the year 
     beginning March 1, 2002;
       81.2 million SME in the year beginning March 1, 2003;
       94.19 million SME in the year beginning March 1, 2004; and
       109.26 million SME in the year beginning March 1, 2005.
       A separate provision makes clear that goods otherwise 
     qualifying under the latter category will not be disqualified 
     if they happen to contain United States fabric made from 
     United States yarn.
       A fourth category of apparel eligible for duty-free 
     treatment under the Senate bill is brassieres that are cut or 
     sewn, or otherwise assembled, in one or more ATPEA 
     beneficiary countries, or in such countries and the United 
     States. This separate category requires that, in the 
     aggregate, brassieres manufactured by a given producer 
     claiming duty-free treatment for such products contain 
     certain quantities of United States fabric.
       A fifth category of textile and apparel eligible for duty-
     free treatment is handloomed, handmade, and folklore 
     articles.
       A final category of textile and apparel goods eligible for 
     duty-free treatment is textile luggage assembled in an ATPEA 
     beneficiary country from fabric and yarns formed in the 
     United States.
       In addition to the foregoing categories, the bill sets 
     forth special rules for determining whether particular 
     textile and apparel articles qualify for duty-free treatment.
     Conference agreement
       In general the conferees agreed to follow the House 
     amendment on apparel provisions with the exception that the 
     House receded to the Senate on the treatment of textile 
     luggage. With respect to category 2 in the House bill 
     relating to fabrics or fabric components formed, or 
     components knit-to-shape, in one or more beneficiary 
     countries, from yarns formed in one or more beneficiary 
     countries, if such fabrics are in chief weight of llama, 
     or alpaca, conferees agreed to include vicuna and 
     calculate product eligibility based on chief value instead 
     of chief weight. Also, conferees agreed to cap imports of 
     apparel made from regional fabric and regional yarn 
     (category 4 in the House bill) at 2% of U.S. imports 
     growing to 5% of U.S. imports in 2006, measured in square 
     meter equivalents.
       It is the intention of the conferees that in cases where 
     fabrics or yarns determined by the President to be in short 
     supply impart the essential character to an article, the 
     remaining textile components may be constructed of fabrics or 
     yarns regardless of origin, as in Annex 401 of the NAFTA. In 
     cases where the fabrics or yarns determined by the President 
     to be in short supply do not impart the essential character 
     of the article, the article shall not be ineligible for 
     preferential treatment under this Act because the article 
     contains the short supply fabric or yarn.

              Special Origin Rule for Nylon Filament Yarn

     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       Articles otherwise eligible for duty-free treatment and 
     quota free treatment under the bill are not ineligible 
     because they contain certain nylon filament yarn (other than 
     elastomeric yarn) from a country that had an FTA with the 
     U.S. in force prior to January 1, 1995.
     Conference agreement
       House recedes.

               Dyeing, Finishing and Printing Requirement

     House amendment
       New requirement that apparel made of U.S. knit or woven 
     fabric assembled in CBTPA country qualifies for benefits only 
     if the U.S. knit or woven fabric is dyed and finished in the 
     United States. Apparel made of U.S. knit or woven fabric 
     assembled in an Andean beneficiary country qualifies for 
     benefits only if the U.S. knit or woven fabric is dyed and 
     finished in the United States.
     Senate provision
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes.

                      Penalties for Transshipment

     Present law
       The Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, provides for civil 
     monetary penalties for unlawful transshipment. These include 
     penalties under 19 U.S.C. 1592 for up to a maximum of the 
     domestic value of the imported merchandise or eight times the 
     loss of revenue, as well as denial of entry, redelivery or 
     liquidated damages for failure to redeliver the merchandise 
     determined to be inaccurately represented. In addition, an 
     importer may be liable for criminal penalties, including 
     imprisonment for up to five years, under section 1001 of 
     title 18 of the United States Code for making false 
     statements on import documentation.
       Under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 
     Parties to the Agreement must observe Customs procedures and 
     documentation requirements, which are established in Chapter 
     5 of NAFTA. Requirements regarding Certificates of Origin for 
     imports receiving preferential tariffs are detailed in 
     Article 502.1 of NAFTA.
     House amendment
       Section 3103 requires that importers comply with 
     requirements similar in all material respects to the 
     requirements regarding Certificates of Origin contained in 
     Article 502.1 of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
     (NAFTA) for a similar importation from Mexico.
       In addition, if an exporter is determined under the laws of 
     the United States to have engaged in illegal transshipment of 
     apparel products from an Andean country, then the President 
     shall deny all benefits under the bill to such exporter, and 
     to any successors of such exporter, for a period of two 
     years.
       In cases where the President has requested a beneficiary 
     country to take action to prevent transshipment and the 
     country has failed to do so, the President shall reduce the 
     quantities of textile and apparel articles that may be 
     imported into the United States from that country by three 
     times the quantity of articles transshipped, to the extent 
     that such action is consistent with World Trade Organization 
     (WTO) rules.
     Senate amendment
       In amending, section 204(b) of the ATPA, section 3102 of 
     the present bill provides special penalties for transshipment 
     of textile and apparel articles from an ATPEA beneficiary 
     country. Transshipment is defined as claiming duty-free 
     treatment for textile and apparel imports on the basis of 
     materially false information. An exporter found to have 
     engaged in such transshipment (or a successor of such 
     exporter) shall be denied all benefits under the ATPA for 
     a period of two years.
       The bill further provides penalties for an ATPEA 
     beneficiary country that fails to cooperate with the United 
     States in efforts to prevent transshipment. Where textile and 
     apparel articles from such country are subject to quotas on 
     importation into the United States consistent with WTO rules, 
     the President must reduce the quantity of such articles that 
     may be imported into the United States by three times the 
     quantity of transshipped articles, to the extent consistent 
     with WTO rules.
     Conference agreement
       Conference agreement follows House and Senate bill.

                         Import Relief Actions

     Present law
       The import relief procedures and authorities under sections 
     201-204 of the Trade Act of 1974 apply to imports from ATPA 
     beneficiary countries, as they do to imports from other 
     countries. If ATPA imports cause serious injury, or threat of 
     such injury, to the domestic industry producing a like or 
     directly competitive article, section 204(d) of the ATPA 
     authorizes the President to suspend ATPA duty-free treatment 
     and proclaim a rate of duty or other relief measures.
       Under NAFTA, the United States may invoke a special 
     safeguard provision at any time during the tariff phase-out 
     period if a NAFTA-origin textile or apparel good is being 
     imported in such increased quantities and under such 
     conditions as to cause ``serious damage, or actual threat 
     thereof,'' to a domestic industry producing a like or 
     directly competitive good. The President is authorized to 
     either suspend further duty reductions or increase the rate 
     of duty to the NTR rate for up to three years.
     House amendment
       Under Section 3103 normal safeguard authorities under ATPA 
     would apply to imports of all products except textiles and 
     apparel. A NAFTA equivalent safeguard authorities would apply 
     to imports of apparel products from ATPA countries, except 
     that, United States, if it applied a safeguard action, would 
     not be obligated to provide equivalent trade liberalizing 
     compensation to the exporting country.
     Senate amendment
       The bill establishes similar textile and apparel safeguard 
     provisions based on the NAFTA textile and apparel safeguard 
     provision.
     Conference agreement
       Conference Agreement follows House and Senate bill.

                          Designation Criteria

     Present law
       In determining whether to designate any country as an ATPA 
     beneficiary country, the President must take into account 
     seven mandatory and 12 discretionary criteria, which are 
     listed in section 203 of the ATPA.
       Under Section 203 of the ATPA, the President shall not 
     designate any country a ATPA beneficiary country if:
       (1) The country is a Communist country;
       (2) The country has nationalized, expropriated, imposed 
     taxes or other exactions or otherwise seized ownership or 
     control of U.S. property (including intellectual property), 
     unless he determines that prompt, adequate, and effective 
     compensation has been or is being made, or good faith 
     negotiations to provide such compensation are in progress, or 
     the country is otherwise taking steps to discharge its 
     international obligations, or a dispute over compensation has 
     been submitted to arbitration;
       (3) The country fails to act in good faith in recognizing 
     as binding or in enforcing arbitral awards in favor of U.S. 
     citizens;
       (4) The country affords ``reverse'' preferences to 
     developed countries and whether such treatment has or is 
     likely to have a significant adverse effect on U.S. commerce;
       (5) A government-owned entity in the country engages in the 
     broadcast of copyrighted material belonging to U.S. copyright

[[Page H5954]]

     owners without their express consent or the country fails to 
     work toward the provision of adequate and effective 
     intellectual property rights;
       (6) The country is not a signatory to an agreement 
     regarding the extradition of U.S. citizens;
       (7) If the country has not or is not taking steps to afford 
     internationally recognized worker rights to workers in the 
     country;
       In determining whether to designate a country as eligible 
     for ATPA benefits, the President shall take into account 
     (discretionary criteria):
       (1) An expression by the country of its desire to be 
     designated;
       (2) The economic conditions in the country, its living 
     standards, and any other appropriate economic factors;
       (3) The extent to which the country has assured the United 
     States it will provide equitable and reasonable access to its 
     markets and basic commodity resources;
       (4) The degree to which the country follows accepted rules 
     of international trade under the World Trade Organization;
       (5) The degree to which the country uses export subsidies 
     or imposes export performance or local content requirements 
     which distort international trade;
       (6) The degree to which the trade policies of the country 
     are contributing to the revitalization of the region;
       (7) The degree to which the country is undertaking self-
     help measures to protect its own economic development;
       (8) Whether or not the country has taken or is taking steps 
     to afford to workers in that country (including any 
     designated zone in that country) internationally recognized 
     workers rights;
       (9) The extent to which the country provides under its law 
     adequate and effective means for foreign nationals to secure, 
     exercise, and enforce exclusive intellectual property rights;
       (10) The extent to which the country prohibits its 
     nationals from engaging in the broadcast of copyrighted 
     material belonging to U.S. copyright owners without their 
     express consent;
       (11) Whether such country has met the narcotics cooperation 
     certification criteria of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 
     for eligibility for U.S. assistance; and
       (12) The extent to which the country is prepared to 
     cooperate with the United States in the administration of the 
     Act.
       Under the ATPA the President is prohibited from designating 
     a country a beneficiary country if any of criteria (1)-(7) 
     apply to that country, subject to waiver if the President 
     determines that country designation will be in the U.S. 
     national economic or security interest. The waiver does not 
     apply to criteria (4) and (6). Under the ATPA criteria on (7) 
     is included as both mandatory and discretionary.
       The President may withdraw or suspend beneficiary country 
     status or duty-free treatment on any article if he determines 
     the country should be barred from designation as a result of 
     changed circumstances. The President must submit a triennial 
     report to the Congress on the operation of the program. The 
     report shall include any evidence that the crop eradication 
     and crop substitution efforts of the beneficiary country are 
     directly related to the effects of the legislation.
     House amendment
       The House amendment provides that the President, in 
     designating a country as eligible for the enhanced ATPDEA 
     benefits, shall take into account the existing eligibility 
     criteria established under ATPA described above, as well as 
     other appropriate criteria, including: whether a country has 
     demonstrated a commitment to undertake its WTO obligations 
     and participate in negotiations toward the completion of the 
     FTAA or comparable trade agreement; the extent to which the 
     country provides intellectual property protection consistent 
     with or greater than that afforded under the Agreement on 
     Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights; the 
     extent to which the country provides internationally 
     recognized worker rights; whether the country has implemented 
     its commitments to eliminate the worst forms of child labor; 
     the extent to which a country has taken steps to become a 
     party to and implement the Inter-American Convention Against 
     Corruption; and the extent to which the country applies 
     transparent, nondiscriminatory and competitive procedures in 
     government procurement equivalent to those included in the 
     WTO Agreement on Government Procurement and otherwise 
     contributes to efforts in international fora to develop and 
     implement international rules in transparency in government 
     procurement.
     Senate amendment
       Section 3102(5) contains identical provisions.
     Conference agreement
       Conference Agreement follows the House and Senate 
     amendments. In evaluating a potential beneficiary's 
     compliance with its Yv7O obligations, the conferees expect 
     the President to take into account the extent to which the 
     country follows the rules on customs valuation set forth in 
     the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement. With respect to 
     intellectual property protection, it is the Conferees intent 
     that the President will also take into account the extent to 
     which potential beneficiary countries are providing or taking 
     steps to pro,ride protection of intellectual property rights 
     comparable to the protections provided to the United States 
     in bilateral intellectual property agreements.
       Since April 1995, Colombia has applied a variable import 
     duty system, known as the ``price band'' system, on fourteen 
     basic agriculture products such as wheat, corn, and soybean 
     oil. An additional 147 commodities, considered substitutes or 
     related products, are subject to the price band system which 
     establishes ceiling, floor, and reference prices on imports. 
     The Conferees's view is that the price band system is non-
     transparent and easily manipulated as a protectionist 
     device. In early 2000, the United States reached agreement 
     with Colombia in the WTO that Colombia would delink wet 
     pet food, the only finished product in this system, from 
     the price band system. In implementing the eligibility 
     criteria relating to market access and implementation of 
     WTO commitments, it is the Conferees intent that USTR 
     insist that Colombia implement its WTO commitment to 
     remove pet food from the price band tariff system and to 
     apply the 20% common external tariff to imported pet food.
       With respect to whether beneficiary countries are following 
     established WTO rules, the Conferees believe it is important 
     for Andean governments to provide transparent and non-
     discriminatory regulatory procedures. Unfortunately, the 
     Conferees know of instances where regulatory policies in 
     Andean countries are opaque, unpredictable, and arbritarily 
     applied. As such, it is the Conferees's view that Andean 
     countries that seek trade benefits should adopt, implement, 
     and apply transparent and non-discriminatory regulatory 
     procedures. The development of such procedures would help 
     create regulatory stability in the Andean region and thus 
     provide mere certainty to U.S. companies that would like to 
     invest in these countries.

            Determination regarding retention of designation

     Present law
       Under Section 203(e) of the ATPA, the President may 
     withdraw or suspend a country's beneficiary country

     of duty-free treatment to particular articles of a 
     beneficiary country, due to changed circumstances.
     House amendment
       Section 3102(b) amends section 203(e) of the ATPA to 
     provide that President may withdraw or suspend ATPA 
     designation, or withdraw, suspend or limit benefits is a 
     country's performance under eligibility criteria are no 
     longer satisfactory.
     Senate amendment
       Identical.
     Conference agreement
       Conference agreement follows the House amendment and Senate 
     amendment.
       Reporting Requirements
     Present law

     the bill with respect to U.S. labor. Also under present law, 
     USTR is required to report triannually on operation of the 
     program.
     House amendment
       Retains current law on reports.
     Senate amendment
       Senate bill requires same ITC and Labor reports as well as 
     an annual report by the Customs Service on compliance and 
     anti-circumvention on the part of beneficiary countries in 
     the area of textile and apparel trade. It also requires USTR 
     to report biannually on operation of the program.
     Conference agreement
       House recedes.
       Petitions for Review
     Present law
       No provision.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       Section 3102(e) of the bill directs the President to 
     promulgate regulations regarding the review of eligibility of 
     articles and countries under the ATPA. Such regulations are 
     to be similar to regulations governing the Generalized System 
     of Preferences petition process.
     Conference agreement
       House recedes.


             SEC. 3104--TERMINATION OF DUTY-FREE TREATMENT

     Present law
       Duty-free treatment under the ATPA expires on December 4, 
     2001.
     House amendment
       Duty-free treatment terminates under the Act on December 
     31, 2006.
     Senate amendment

     to provide for a termination date of February 28, 2006. Basic 
     ATPA benefits apply retroactively to December 4, 2001.
     Conference agreement
       House recedes on retroactivity for basic ATPA benefits; 
     Senate recedes on termination.

 SEC. 3106--TRADE BENEFITS UNDER THE CARIBBEAN BASIN TRADE PARTNERSHIP 
      ACT (CBTPA) AND THE AFRICA GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT (AGOA)

                         Knit-to-shape Apparel

     Present law
       Draft regulations issued by Customs to implement P.L. 106-
     200 stipulate that knit to-shape garments, because 
     technically they do not go through the fabric stage, are not 
     eligible for trade benefits under the act.
     House amendment
       Sec. 3106 and 3107 of the House bill amends AGOA and CBTPA 
     to clarify that preferential treatment is provided to knit-
     to-shape apparel articles assembled in beneficiary countries.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes.
     Present law
       Draft regulations issued by Customs to implement P.L. 106-
     200 deny preferential access to garments that are cut both in 
     the United States and beneficiary countries, on the rationale 
     that the legislation does not specifically list this 
     variation in processing (the so-called ``hybrid cutting 
     problem'').
     House amendment
       Sec. 3107 of H.R. 3009 adds new rules in CBTPA and AGOA to 
     provide preferential treatment for apparel articles that are 
     cut both in the United States and beneficiary countries.

     made in CBI] countries from regional fabric made with U.S. 
     yarn and to knit-to-shape apparel (except socks), up to a cap 
     of 250,000,000 square meter equivalents (SMEs), with a growth 
     rate of 16% per year for first 3 years.
     House amendment
       Sec. 3106 of H.R. 2009 would raise this cap to the 
     following amounts: 250.000,000 SMEs for the 1-year period

     Senate amendment
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       Senate recedes
     Present law
       Section 112(b)(3) of the AGOA provides preferential 
     treatment for apparel made in beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
     countries from ``regional'' fabric (i.e., fabric formed in 
     one or more beneficiary countries) from yarn originating 
     either in the United States or one or more such countries. 
     Section 112(b)(3)(B) establishes a special rule for lesser 
     developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries, which 
     provides preferential treatment, through September 30, 2004, 
     for apparel wholly assembled in one or more such countries 
     regardless of the origin of the fabric used to make the 
     articles. Section 112(b)(3)(A) establishes a quantitative 
     limit or ``cap'' on the amount of apparel that may be 
     imported under section 112(b)(3) or section 112(b)(3)(B). 
     This ``cap'' is 1.5 percent of the aggregate square meter 
     equivalents of all apparel articles imported into the United 
     States for the year that began October 1, 2000, and increases 
     in equal increments to 3.5 percent for the year beginning 
     October 1, 2007.
     House amendment
       Section 3107 would clarify that apparel wholly assembled in 
     one or more beneficiary, sub-Saharan African countries from 
     components knit-to-shape in one or more such countries from 
     U.S. or regional yarn is eligible for preferential treatment 
     under section 112(b)(3) of AGOA. Similarly, Section 5 would 
     clarify that apparel knit-to-shape and wholly assembled in 
     one or more lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African 
     countries is eligible for preferential treatment, regardless 
     of the origin of the yarn used to make such articles. The 
     House amendment also would increase the ``cap'' by changing 
     the applicable percentages from 1.5 percent to 3 percent in 
     the year that began October 1, 2000, and from 3.5 percent to 
     7 percent in the year beginning October 1, 2007.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       Conference agreement follows House Amendment accept the 
     increase in the cap is limited to apparel products made with 
     regional or U.S. fabric and yarn. No increases in amounts of 
     apparel made of third-country fabric over current law.
     Present Law
       AGOA was supposed to provide duty-free, quota-free 
     treatment to sweaters knit in African beneficiary countries 
     from fine merino wool yarn, regardless of where the yarn was 
     formed. AGOA was supposed to provide duty-free, quota-free 
     treatment to sweaters knit in African beneficiary countries 
     from fine merino wool yarn, regardless of where the yarn was 
     formed. However, due to a drafting problem, the wrong 
     diameter was included, making it impossible to use the 
     provision.
     House amendment
       Section 3107 corrects the yarn diameter in the AGOA 
     legislation so that sweaters knit to shape from merino wool 
     of a specific diameter are eligible.
     Senate amendment
       No provision.

                      Africa: Namibia and Botswana

     Present law
       The GDBs of Botswana and Namibia exceed the LLDC limit of 
     $1500 and therefore these countries are not eligible to use 
     third country fabric for the transition period under the AGOA 
     regional fabric country cap.
     House amendment
       Section 5 allows Namibia and Botswana to use third country 
     fabric for the transition period under the AGOA regional 
     fabric country cap.

       TITLE XLI--EXTENSION OF GENERALIZED SYSTEM OF PREFERENCES


       sec. 4101--extension of generalized system of preferences

     Expired law
       Section 505 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, provides 
     that no duty-free treatment under Title V (the Generalized 
     System of Preferences) shall remain in effect after September 
     30, 2001.
     House bill
       The House amendment to H.R. 3009 would amend section 505 of 
     the Trade Act of 1974 to authorize an extension through 
     December 31, 2002. It would also provide retroactive relief 
     in that, notwithstanding section 514 of the Tariff Act of 
     1930 or any other provision of law, the entry of any article 
     to which duty-free treatment under Title V of the Trade Act 
     of 1974 would have applied if the entry had been made on 
     September 30, 2001, and was made after September 30, 2001, 
     and before the enactment of this Act, shall be liquidated or 
     reliquidated as free of duty and the Secretary of Treasury 
     shall refund any duty paid, upon proper request filed with 
     the appropriate Customs officer, within 180 days after the 
     date of enactment.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate amendment authorizes an extension of GSP through 
     December 31, 2006. The extension is retroactive to September 
     30, 2001, permitting importers to liquidate or reliquidate 
     entries made since that date and to seek a return of duties 
     paid on goods that would have entered the United States free 
     of duty, but for expiration of GSP.
       The Senate Amendment also amends the definition of 
     ``internationally recognized worker rights'' set forth in the 
     GSP statute (section 507(4) of the Trade Act of 1974). 
     Specifically, it adds to that definition ``a prohibition on 
     discrimination with respect to employment and occupation'' 
     and a ``prohibition of the worst forms of child labor.'' 
     These two prohibitions come from the International Labor 
     Organization's 1998 Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
     Rights at Work, which defines certain worker rights as 
     ``fundamental.''
       The GSP statute identifies certain criteria that the 
     President must take into account in determining whether to 
     designate a country as eligible for GSP benefits. Conversely, 
     a country's lapse in compliance with one or more of these 
     criteria may be grounds for withdrawal, suspension, or 
     limitation of benefits. Whether a country is taking steps to 
     afford its workers internationally recognized worker rights 
     is one of those criteria. The Senate Amendment seeks to make 
     the concept of ``internationally recognized worker rights'' 
     as defined for GSP consistent with the concept as defined by 
     the ILO.
       Finally, the Senate Amendment establishes a new eligibility 
     criterion for GSP: ``A country is ineligible for GSP if it 
     has not taken steps to support the efforts of the United 
     States to combat terrorism.''
     Conference agreement
       The Conference agreement authorizes an extension of GSP 
     through December 3 1, 2006. Conferees approved the Senate 
     provision to include a prohibition on the worst forms of 
     child labor in the definition of internationally recognized 
     worker rights in Section

[[Page H5956]]

     507(a) of the Trade Act of 1974. Conferees declined to 
     include the Senate provision on discrimination with respect 
     to employment in the definition of ``international recognized 
     worker rights under Sec. 507 (a) of the Trade Act of 1974. 
     Agreement follows the House and the Senate bill with respect 
     to providing retroactive relief.

                  DIVISION E--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

                 TITLE L--MISCELLANEOUS TRADE BENEFITS

                      Subtitle A--Wool Provisions


   sec. 5101--wool manufacturer payment clarification and technical 
                            corrections act

     Present law
       Title V of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (Pub. L. 
     No. 106-200) included certain tariff relief for the domestic 
     tailored clothing and textile industries. The relief was 
     largely aimed at reducing the harmful affects of a ``tariff 
     inversion''--i.e., a tariff structure that levies higher 
     duties on the raw material (such as wool fabric) than on the 
     finished goods (such as mens' suits). A component of the 
     relief to the U.S. tailored clothing and textile industry was 
     a refund of duties paid in calendar year 1999, spread out 
     over calendar years 2000, 2001 and 2002. Pub. L. No. 106-
     2000, Sec. 505.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate bill amends section 505 of the Trade and 
     Development Act of 2000 to simplify the process for refunding 
     to eligible parties duties paid in 1999. Specifically, it 
     creates three special refund pools for each of the affected 
     wool articles (fabric, yarn, and fiber and top). Refunds for 
     importing manufacturers will be distributed in three 
     installments--the first and second on or before the date that 
     is 45 days after the date of enactment of the Wool 
     Manufacturer Payment and Clarification and Technical 
     Corrections Act, and the third on or before April 15, 2003. 
     Refunds for nonimporting manufacturers will be distributed in 
     two installments--the first on or before the date that is 120 
     days after the date of enactment of the Wool Manufacturer 
     Payment Clarification and Technical Corrections Act, and the 
     second on or before April 15, 2003.
       The provision also streamlines the paperwork process, in 
     light of the destruction of previously filed claims and 
     supporting information in the September 11, 2001 attacks on 
     the World Trade Center in New York, New York. Finally, the 
     provision identifies all persons eligible for the refunds.
     Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate.


                   sec. 5102--duty suspension on wool

     Present law
       Sections 501(a) and (b) of the Trade and Development Act of 
     2000 provide temporary duty reductions for certain worsted 
     wool fabrics through 2003.
       Section 501(d) limits the aggregate quantity of worsted 
     wool fabrics entered under heading 9902.51.11 from January 1 
     to December 31 of each year, inclusive, to 2,500,000 square 
     meter equivalents, or such other quantity proclaimed by the 
     President pursuant to section 504(b)(3) of the Trade and 
     Development Act. Further, the section limits the aggregate 
     quantity of worsted wool fabrics entered under heading 
     9902.51.12 from January 1 to December 31 of each year, 
     inclusive, to 1,500,000 square meter equivalents, or such 
     other quantity proclaimed by the President pursuant to 
     section 504(b)(3) of the Trade and Development Act.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate bill
       The Senate bill extends the temporary duty reductions on 
     fabrics of worsted wool from 2003 to 2005. The provision 
     increases the limitation on the quantity of imports of 
     worsted wool fabrics entered under heading 9902.51.11 to 
     3,500,000 square meter equivalents in calendar year 2002, and 
     4,500,000 square meter equivalents in calendar year 2003. 
     Imports of worsted wool fabrics entered under heading 
     9902.51.12 are increased to 2,500,000 square meter 
     equivalents in calendar year 2002, and 3,500,000 square meter 
     equivalents in calendar year 2003.
       The bill extends the payments made to manufacturers under 
     section 505 of the Trade and Development Act of 2000 and 
     requires an affidavit that the manufacturer will remain a 
     manufacturer in the United States as of January 1 of the year 
     of payment. The two additional payments will occur as 
     follows: the first to be made after January 1, 2004, but on 
     or before April 15, 2004, and the second after January 1, 
     2005, but on or before April 15, 2005.
       Finally, the bill extends the ``Wool Research Trust Fund'' 
     for two years through 2006.
     Conference agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate.

                      Subtitle B--Other Provisions


               SEC. 5201--FUND FOR WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       The provision authorizes a settlement fund within the 
     United States Trade Representative's Office in the amount of 
     $50 million for the use in settling disputes that occur 
     related to the World Trade Organization. The Trade 
     Representative must certify to the Secretary of the Treasury 
     that the settlement is in the best interest of the United 
     States in cases of not more than $10 million. For cases above 
     $10 million, the Trade Representative must make the same 
     certification to the United States Congress.
     Senate bill
       No provision.
     Conference agreement
       The Senate recedes to the House.


  SEC. 5202--CERTAIN STEAM OR OTHER VAPOR GENERATING BOILERS USED IN 
                           NUCLEAR FACILITIES

     Present law
       Under present law, certain steam or other vapor generating 
     boilers used in nuclear facilities imported into the United 
     States prior to December 31, 2003 are charged a duty rate of 
     4.9 percent ad valorem. This rate took effect pursuant to 
     section 1268 of Public Law Number 106-476 (``Tariff 
     Suspension and Trade Act of 2000''). Previously, the rate had 
     been 5.2 percent ad valorem.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       Section 203 of the Senate amendment changes the duty rate 
     on certain steam or other vapor generating boilers used in 
     nuclear facilities to zero for such goods entered, or 
     withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 
     1, 2002, and on or before December 31, 2006. The provision 
     was intended to lower the cost of inputs into the operation 
     of nuclear facilities and thereby lower the cost of energy to 
     consumers.
     Committee agreement
       The House recedes to the Senate.


            SEC. 5203--SUGAR TARIFF RATE QUOTA CIRCUMVENTION

     Present law
       No applicable section.
     House amendment
       No provision.
     Senate amendment
       The Senate bill establishes a sugar anti-circumvention 
     program which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to 
     identify imports of articles that are circumventing tariff-
     rate quotas on sugars, syrups, or sugar-containing products 
     imposed under chapters 17, 18, 19, and 21 of the Harmonized 
     Tariff Schedule. The Secretary shall then report to the 
     President articles found to be circumventing such tariff-rate 
     quotas. Upon receiving the Secretary's report, the President 
     shall, by proclamation, include any identified article in the 
     appropriate tariff-rate quota provision of the Harmonized 
     Tariff Schedule.
     Conference agreement
       Conferees agreed to a provision directing the Secretary of 
     Agriculture and the Commissioner of Customs shall monitor for 
     sugar circumvention and shall report and make recommendations 
     to Congress and the President.
       This provision amends the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the 
     United States (''HTSUS'') to make clear in the statute an 
     important element of the ruling of the Court of Appeals for 
     the Federal Circuit in Heartland By-Products, Inc. v. United 
     States, 264 F. 3rd 1126 (Fed. Cir. 2001), i.e., that molasses 
     is one of the foreign substances that must be excluded when 
     calculating the percentage of soluble non-sugar solids under 
     subheading 1702.90.40.
       The provision requires the Secretary of Agriculture and the 
     Commissioner of Customs to establish a monitoring program to 
     identify existing or likely circumvention of the tariff-rate 
     quotas in Chapters 17, 18, 19 and 21 of the HTSUS. The 
     Secretary and the Commissioner shall report the results of 
     their monitoring to Congress and the President every six 
     months, together with data and a description of developments 
     and trends in the composition of trade provided for in such 
     chapters. This report will be made public. The report will 
     discuss any indications that imports of articles not subject 
     to the tariff-rate quotas are being used for commercial 
     extraction of sugar in the United States. Imports of so-
     called ``high-test molasses'' currently classified under 
     subheading 1703.10.30 will be examined particularly closely 
     for such indications.
       Finally, the Secretary and the Commissioner will include in 
     the report their recommendations for ending circumvention, 
     including their recommendations for legislation. The Managers 
     emphasize that rapid action to stop circumvention is the best 
     way to prevent a problem from developing and that quick 
     administrative or legislative action is preferable to 
     protracted procedures and litigation, as occurred in the 
     Heartland case.

                              H. Res. 507

       Resolved, That the requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII 
     for a two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee 
     on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is 
     waived with respect to any resolution reported on the 
     legislative day of Friday, July 26, 2002, providing for 
     consideration or disposition of any of the following 
     measures:
       (1) A conference report to accompany the bill (H.R. 3009) 
     to extend the Andean Trade Preference Act, to grant 
     additional trade benefits under the Act, and for other 
     purposes.
       (2) A conference report to accompany the bill (H.R. 3295) 
     to establish a program to provide funds to States to replace 
     punch card voting systems, to establish the Election 
     Assistance Commission to assist in the administration of 
     Federal elections and to otherwise provide assistance with 
     the administration of certain Federal election laws and 
     programs, to establish minimum election administration 
     standards for States and units of local government with 
     responsibility for the administration of Federal elections, 
     and for other purposes.
       (3) A conference report to accompany the bill (H.R. 333) to 
     amend title 11, United States Code, and for other purposes.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York (Mr. Reynolds) 
is recognized for 1 hour.
  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, for purposes of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to my colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Frost), the ranking member of the Committee on Rules, pending which I 
yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this 
resolution, all time yielded is for purposes of debate only.
  (Mr. REYNOLDS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 507 waives clause 6(a) of 
rule XIII requiring a two-thirds vote to consider a rule on the same 
day it is reported from the Committee on Rules.
  The rule applies the waiver to a special rule reported on the 
legislative day of Friday, July 26, 2002, providing for consideration 
or disposition of the conference report to accompany the following 
bill: H.R. 3009, the Trade Act of 2002.
  The rule will allow this body to consider the conference agreement on 
the important topic of trade promotion authority. The rule moves the 
process forward so this body can work its will on a long overdue piece 
of legislation.
  Mr. Speaker, there are only a few months remaining in the 107th 
Congress. In the past 2 years, we have had many accomplishments, but 
success in the area of expanding trade and opening markets is yet to be 
realized. But the power to change that is within our reach. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in taking the first step in the final leg of our 
efforts to bring to fruition this critical piece of legislation.
  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this rule so that we will be 
able to bring up this important issue.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  (Mr. FROST asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, Democrats strongly support free and fair 
trade that grows the economy and benefits American workers. At the same 
time, we insist on fulfilling our responsibility to ensure a level 
playing field for American businesses, farmers, and workers; and we 
insist on ensuring that Americans who lose their jobs because of trade 
are given the assistance and opportunity they need to adapt to the new 
economy.
  Unfortunately, this trade promotion authority conference agreement 
fails to accomplish these goals, and therefore, risks future trade 
agreements negotiated under it. That much we know about the conference 
report, Mr. Speaker.
  But since the conference report has not been filed, and since the 
Committee on Rules has not reported out the rule for consideration of 
the conference report, we have no way of knowing what is in this 
conference report that we are now clearing the parliamentary way for.
  That is a major problem for this House of Representatives because 
Republican leaders now want to pass this martial law, thereby waiving 
the House rule that gives every Member 1 day to review legislation 
before it comes to the floor. If that occurs, then the overwhelming 
majority of the Members of this House will have absolutely no way of 
knowing what is in this conference report.
  Now, we would like to be able to trust what the Republican leadership 
says is in the bill, but they have been caught red-handed on too many 
occasions when they tried to sneak controversial provisions into big 
pieces of legislation like this.
  As I understand it, they have even put such controversial provisions 
in this agreement that committee chairmen are objecting to it in the 
strongest possible terms, this after the Republican leadership snuck 
into the homeland security bill provisions that were objectionable to 
many Members of this body, but who did not know they were there until 
the bill was on the floor.
  So the Republican leadership has lost the credibility to come to the 
House floor and say, trust us. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to 
defeat this martial law rule. That is the only way Members will be able 
to figure out what is really in this conference report.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, first of all, both Republicans and Democrats have told 
me that the Committee on Ways and Means conference report has been on 
its Web site since this afternoon.
  Two, as is always customary in the Committee on Rules, there will be 
notice to, first, the Committee on Rules itself, which will have an 
ample time to see the legislation, and then we will hold a hearing and 
move forward on the decision of granting a rule on the legislation.
  To my knowledge, in the time I have been here, that provides not only 
the Web site access to the entire membership, but also close scrutiny 
by both the Committee on Rules staff and the entire majority and 
minority staffs that choose to look at it and have comments, both in 
the Committee on Rules and then, finally, as we had that debate on the 
floor.
  Certainly there is no secret that we have been in a long journey 
looking to have an opportunity to have trade legislation passed here in 
the House. We now have a conference report that has brought a consensus 
not only of a Republican majority here in the House, but Republican and 
Democrats who supports free trade in this body and in the other body.
  So we will have plenty of opportunity for our colleagues, both the 
majority and the minority, to review the legislation. Some have already 
done so as they have gone to the Committee on Ways and Means Web site. 
Others will have the opportunity through the process this evening.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I would make a couple of observations. First of all, the 
gentleman has just stated that, well, the conference report is on the 
Web site. I would ask, is that the conference report that is going to 
be signed by the conferees? And if so, why has it not been signed 
earlier in the evening?
  Apparently someone on the gentleman's side had some reservations 
about what was posted on the Web site and was not sure that that was 
going to be the final product.
  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?

[[Page H5958]]

  Mr. FROST. I yield to the gentleman from California.
  Mr. DREIER. I thank my friend for yielding to me, Mr. Speaker.
  Let me say that, in fact, all of the conferees have signed that 
report, and the gentleman is correct that it has yet to be filed; but 
at 4 o'clock this afternoon a hard copy was delivered to the minority 
members of the Committee on Rules; and as has been said by the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. Reynolds), it has been made available on 
the Web site.
  That is the report that will in fact be filed. This is the report 
that was agreed to by both the Members of the House and Senate in the 
conference.
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I would point out that 
the gentleman from Florida is a member of the conference committee and 
has not signed the conference report.
  Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. FROST. I yield to the gentleman from Florida.
  Mr. HASTINGS of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I would say to the chairman 
that my office was called earlier and I said that I would be happy to 
consider signing it, and they told me they would get back to me. In 
fact, I still have not signed it. My staff said if we saw it, we would 
sign it. So, Mr. Speaker, I have not signed the conference report, and 
I am a member of the conference committee on trade promotion authority.
  Mr. DREIER. If the gentleman would further yield, when I said 
everyone has signed, I know that my friend was raising the concern 
about majority Members signing the issue. That was what I meant, all of 
the majority Members of the House who were conferees have in fact 
signed.
  Mr. FROST. Reclaiming my time, everyone on that side of the aisle. 
When the gentleman says everyone, he means everyone on that side of the 
aisle.
  Mr. DREIER. If the gentleman will yield, what I will say is that when 
the gentleman said there was a particular concern about a signature and 
was looking to this side of the aisle, I inferred from the way he said 
it that he was concerned about a signature from this side of the aisle.
  The fact of the matter is the majority Members have signed the 
conference report. Does that answer the question that the gentleman 
posed? I thank my friend for yielding to me.
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, it is curious that this 
document has been somewhere in cyberspace since 4 o'clock and yet has 
not been made available to the House, apparently because someone was 
thinking about making a change in that document. Otherwise, it would 
have been made available to the House.
  I would point out that one of the earlier speakers said, well, the 
Committee on Rules members will have plenty of time to review this 
document. Actually, we will have 15 minutes. We have been given 15 
minutes from the time we get the document until the Committee on Rules 
will be meeting.
  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Mr. Speaker, I think it is important that we review again that we are 
not going to do anything other than the possibility of having a late 
decision of debate, but on this day, since 4 p.m., the minority staff 
of the Committee on Rules has been given a hard copy of the conference 
report. We also know that it has been on the Web site. We also know 
that some Members have started this and reviewed it early, and very 
thoroughly; other Members may not have had an opportunity to open their 
Web site to garner the information.
  We are moving here methodically. The methodical aspect is first of 
all having the debate on the same-day rule, which the Committee on 
Rules granted this morning. We now bring that to the body as a whole 
for their consideration. We will then schedule a Committee on Rules 
meeting, of which there will be a hearing to consider a conference 
report that has been made available since this afternoon to the entire 
body and has a majority of signatures, as the chairman of the Committee 
on Rules has indicated, from what he is aware of, and that the minority 
of the Committee on Rules has had documentation, hard copy, written, 
before them since 4 p.m. today.
  So as we move forward, my hope is that the Congress, this body, can 
make a decision of whether we will continue on a same-day rule to take 
up the trade promotion authority and have the opportunity to move 
forward with consideration of what has been a long journey, a process 
that has had the House deliberate, the other body deliberate, a 
conference report negotiated off and on throughout weeks, and now an 
opportunity for the House to consider an up-or-down on that conference 
report that has been put together not by just the majority of the House 
or the other body, but by a consensus of those who support free trade.
  The votes, as they have been in the past in this instance, have been 
of those who support free trade, both Republican and Democrat, and 
those who are opposed to free trade.
  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman 
from California (Chairman Dreier), from the Committee on Rules.
  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding time to me.
  I would like to take a few minutes to describe how we got to where we 
are.

                              {time}  2330

  We passed the North American Free Trade Agreement 9 years ago and so 
we are rapidly approaching the tenth anniversary of the passage of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. And, clearly, the implementation 
of NAFTA has been one of the greatest things that has happened in the 
relationship for this hemisphere. We have been able to take tremendous 
strides in enhancing the economic relationship among Canada, the United 
States, and Mexico with the North American Free Trade Agreement. We 
have seen free trade between the United States and Mexico more than 
double in the period of time that we have put NAFTA into place. And I 
think one of the most important products has been the successful 
implementation of full democratization in Mexico. We all know that they 
had 71 years of one-party rule and bringing about the economic 
liberalization that came under the leadership of President Miguel de la 
Madrid and Carlos Salinas went a long way towards encouraging 
democratization. We saw political liberalization follow economic 
liberalization. And we know that while there are still very serious 
problems, we have migration problems, we have water problems, other 
issues that exist between the United States and Mexico, clearly the 
election of President Fox is something that was heralded in that 
country and here in the United States and throughout the hemisphere 
and, for that matter, throughout the world.
  The reason I point to that is it is very clear that expanding trade 
is one of the most important vehicles toward expanding democratization. 
And that is really what this is all about.
  We are here right now having spent nearly a decade because we saw the 
authority, what was known as Fast Track, what we now describe as Trade 
Promotion Authority, expire shortly after implementation of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement. And during that period of time, I am 
very proud of the fact that through the Clinton presidency, I worked 
closely with President Clinton, with his U.S. Trade Representative 
Mickey Cantor and then Charlene Barshefski to try to grant President 
Clinton the authority to proceed with NAFTA-like agreements so that we 
could establish what our goal is here, and that is a free trade area of 
the Americas. And we know that there are very serious problems that 
exist in South America, in Venezuela, in Argentina and other countries. 
And virtually everyone agrees that if we were to have the chance to 
expand this NAFTA concept to a free trade area of the Americas, we 
would be able to more effectively address the political problems and 
economic problems that exist in those countries and, similarly, in 
other parts of the world, we have those challenges and, of course, the 
national security question for us.
  We have just successfully passed a bill establishing a Department of 
Homeland Security, and that is very important in dealing with our 
security here. But we know that economic liberalization and 
democratization are very important to encourage in other parts of the 
world where, in fact, terrorist threats have begun.
  And so I think that the vote that we are going to cast granting this 
same-

[[Page H5959]]

day rule will allow us to bring up and consider the bill that grants 
President Bush trade promotion authority.
  Now, Mr. Speaker, I underscored the fact I, as a Republican, I am a 
very proud Republican and no one has ever questioned my Republican 
credentials. Some did when I worked so hard to try to grant President 
Clinton trade promotion authority, but I believed was the right thing 
to do. And that is why I like to think that Democrats who join and 
understand of the very important benefits to economic liberalization 
and the expansion of freedom and democracy will join with us in 
bringing us support in a bipartisan way, which trade has traditionally 
been. But we are right now at 11:34 in the evening still working at 
this, trying to address some concerns that are out there because we, as 
conferees, went through a laborious process trying to address concerns 
and, of course, we have a Democratic United States Senate and we had to 
work closely with the senators to come to an agreement. And I believe 
that the agreement that has been struck is deserving of wide bipartisan 
support, and so we have taken this step to establish same-day 
consideration.
  We are on what we certainly hope is the last day of this type in the 
Congress before we go into our summer break, and I hope that Members 
will join in providing support for this same-day consideration of the 
rule and support for this very important trade promotion authority bill 
that we hope to be considering in the not too distant future.
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 9 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. Watt).
  Mr. WATT of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding me time, albeit reluctantly. I am sure everybody wants to go 
home. And this is probably not the greatest time to rise to speak on 
the floor of the House because everybody does want to go home.
  I should say at the outset that I have not been a supporter of fast 
track legislation, either giving that authority to a Democratic 
president or giving it to a Republican president, so for me this is not 
a partisan issue. But I presume that that part of this will be debated 
during the debate on the bill itself. I am not here to address the 
merit or lack of merits of fast track authority.
  What I am here to address is the martial law rule that we are being 
called upon to vote upon this evening, because I object vigorously to 
martial law. And quite often when we are in the last days of a session 
and the majority is trying to get martial law, I go out of my way to 
come to the floor to speak on this concept of martial law.
  Mr. Speaker, I practiced law for 22 years and there was nothing that 
I hated more in the practice of law than to start the trial of a case 
on a Monday or a Tuesday and have that case wind through the course of 
the week and get to Friday midday or Friday midafternoon and have that 
case still going on. Because what I realized was that whether it was 
somebody's property that was involved or whether it was somebody's 
liberty that was involved, everybody was tired, and the court and the 
judge and the lawyers wanted to start taking short-cuts. And when the 
case went to the jury, the jury was going to want to go home. And 
despite the importance of the matter before that court, you simply 
could not get justice late on a Friday afternoon.
  So here we are at 11:30 on a Friday night, and my colleagues come out 
on the floor and say we want to declare martial law which is to say we 
want you to give us the authority to consider a bill tonight that 
nobody has had a chance to read.
  Now they say they have posted it on a web site sometime this 
afternoon, but I am sure people who have been following this debate and 
session on C-SPAN have realized that this Congress has been in session 
right here on the floor of the House all afternoon debating a very, 
very important bill. And I would grant you, I would bet you that there 
is not a person in this body that has looked at this bill that we are 
getting ready to consider under martial law, same-day consideration. 
The whole rationale of the rule that says you will not consider a bill 
the same day that it is filed is to allow democracy to work, to allow 
the deliberative process to work, to allow the very thing that I 
objected to when I was practicing law, a compromise of justice, a 
compromise of democracy, to keep that from taking place.
  That is why we have the rules of the House. And despite that fact, 
here we are, my colleagues. They took an hour and a half recess before 
they even brought this to the floor because they did not know what was 
in the bill themselves.
  I know I am getting on everybody's nerves, but this is about 
democracy and this is about the ability to read and understand what we 
are being called upon to vote. Just like when I was practicing law for 
22 years, it was about somebody's property or somebody's liberty, this 
is about our democracy. That is what this is about. So heaven forbid 
that they give me 2 more minutes to tell you what this is about.
  This is about the quality of our democracy, and whether my colleagues 
can go home tomorrow or today, actually, we are going home tomorrow 
regardless of what happens here; maybe it is just later tomorrow, and 
so it would not make a whole heck of a lot of difference.
  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
  Mr. WATT of North Carolina. I yield to the gentleman from California.
  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I 
appreciate many of the points he has raised. I have prided myself to 
being strongly committed in minority rights, having served 14 years on 
the minority.
  Mr. WATT of North Carolina. This is not about minority rights. This 
is about democracy and the rights of every Member of this House.
  Mr. DREIER. Absolutely. Do not get me wrong. I am also concerned 
about majority rights, too, especially when I am a member of the 
majority, too. But I am also sensitive to the minority rights. But, 
again, at 4:00 this afternoon the gentleman's office received by e-mail 
a copy of this conference report which we are prepared to file now. The 
gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) is here, who is chairman of the 
conference, and he is prepared to file this report, and I hope that we 
will be able to move ahead with its consideration. It has been 10 
hours.
  Mr. WATT of North Carolina. Reclaiming my time, I presume what that 
means is that what the gentleman is saying is what we are about to vote 
on. I appreciate him clarifying it. I had thought the gentleman just 
said that this thing was just put up on a web site at 3:00 this 
afternoon. Now I am being told that he is getting ready to file it so 
we can read about it while we are debating it on the floor of the 
House.
  This is about the quality of our democracy and whether we have the 
time to read a bill that we were getting right now. There is important 
stuff we are doing here. Certainly no less, no less important than the 
things that were being deliberated in the courtroom. And all I am 
asking is for my colleagues to realize that and to take the time and to 
give us the time to read what it is we are being asked to vote on.
  And with that, I do not know how I can be more basic than that, but I 
am sure it will not make any difference to my colleagues.
  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Thomas), the chairman of the Committee on Ways and 
Means.
  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce that this is an 
additional step in a commitment this Congress made some time ago to try 
to move to a paperless Congress. More than 8 hours ago Members received 
in each of their offices an electronic copy of the document that was 
just delivered. If Members were concerned about the content of this 
particular report, they could have been reading it for 8 hours.

                              {time}  2345

  And in fact that is one of the things that this Congress can do in 
the 21st century, and that is instead of dealing with massive amounts 
of paper, 6 pounds delivered to each office, which is not read anyway, 
we have provided an electronic forum in which it is easily disseminated 
among staff and Members and that it is a far better way to deal with 
these issues. In addition to that, it allows Members for more than 8 
hours to consult the bill in which we are now bringing up the rule to 
allow us to consider. That is the way this

[[Page H5960]]

Congress should be operating in the 21st century.
  If someone believes they should be lugging around 6 pounds of paper 
when it has been in their office for 8 hours, I would urge Members to 
acquaint themselves with the computer operators and with the staff if 
the folks are not computer literate, because for more than 8 hours this 
identical bill has been in their offices.
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. Matsui), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.
  Mr. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Frost) 
for yielding me this time.
  I would like to clarify some misunderstanding because I heard at the 
time as I was sitting in my office that the documents were delivered at 
three o'clock or it was posted on the Web site at four o'clock and that 
would have undoubtedly then would have given about 7 hours and 45 
minutes for us to review the documents in the middle of the Homeland 
Security Department legislation as it was moving through there.
  The reality of it is, and I think the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Thomas) would have to verify this or at least his staff would have to 
verify this, or perhaps the gentleman from New York would, we were not 
notified that the documents, all 360 pages, would be posted on the Web 
site until 6:53 or almost seven o'clock in the evening. And as all of 
my colleagues know, we were in the final stages of debate on the 
Homeland Security Department at that time; so we have actually only had 
a little over 4 hours and 45 minutes to review this document, and I 
have to tell my colleagues that one of the things that troubles me 
about this is that this is a significant major piece of legislation, 
and I think that Members on both sides of the aisle, particularly 
Members on my Republican side of the aisle, because we are going to be 
discussing textile rules, we are going to be discussing issues like 
trade adjustment assistance, which could cost considerable sums of 
money.
  We are going to be discussing health care issues that were going to 
go to displaced workers, and it would seem like both parties would want 
an opportunity to review and vet this legislation before we adopt it, 
presumably this evening at 2 or 3 in the morning. And I will tell my 
colleagues why this is important is because the other body this week 
will be taking this legislation up and they will have a chance to 
review it, and all the flaws of this bill will come out, and some of my 
colleagues might be embarrassed if they, in fact, vote for this 
legislation, sight unseen, and it will be sight unseen.
  For example, let me just throw out the trade adjustment assistance 
that many people made a big thing about. The fact of the matter is that 
if a company closes and leaves the United States and goes, let us say, 
to China, which many companies are doing at this time, those employees 
that are displaced from that factory will not be eligible for trade 
adjustment assistance or the health care benefits. Most of my 
colleagues on my side of the aisle who have been told this are 
absolutely astonished because they were told when a plant closes, the 
employees are going to be able to receive assistance, and that is just 
not necessarily true in most cases.
  And the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas), if all of us recall, 
just two weeks ago, introduced legislation to provide $90 billion at a 
time when we are all facing a great deal of trouble on Wall Street, $90 
billion worth of tax cuts to U.S. companies that would go offshore, and 
so essentially this bill would encourage companies to go to China 
offshore, and the tax bill that the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Thomas) has offered would do the same thing.
  I find it kind of incomprehensible that Members who may not quite 
understand the implication of this, it could hurt their hometown 
companies, would end up voting for this and then next week maybe find 
out that this bill does not say what many of the Members suggested it 
might say. So I think this martial law proposal at this time in this 
evening for this kind of bill is pretty outrageous, and it should not 
be really offered tonight.
  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  I am proud to be a member of the Committee on Rules. We are usually 
the last here. This week we have been the last here and the first here. 
We can continue and use the entire full hour on this same-day 
resolution and have all our colleagues debate the same day. And then we 
will have a consensus on whether the House approves of the same-day 
rule or they do not, and then we will move into the opportunity to have 
the Committee on Rules meet because they were noticed last evening.
  At eight this morning, we put out this same-day rule which led the 
indication that we would be considering the trade bill which many in 
the House knew was being negotiated actively by the entire Conference 
Committee. So we will continue and do the full hour here. We will then 
have a Committee on Rules meeting and we will do a full hour on the 
rule and then we will take it to debate, if that is what the body 
chooses to do.
  I am prepared to yield back the balance of my time if the ranking 
member yields his time back and we can move forward, or we will 
continue to take the hour. So I will ask the ranking member if he has 
further speakers or whether he wants to yield his time, in which I will 
follow.
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman prepared to yield back his 
time so that the House may proceed to a roll call vote on this 
particular matter?
  Mr. REYNOLDS. Yes.
  Mr. FROST. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I 
move the previous question on the resolution.
  The previous question was ordered.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Simpson). The question is on the 
resolution.
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it.
  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a 
quorum is not present, and make the point of order that a quorum is not 
present.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Evidently a quorum is not present.
  The Sergeant at Arms will notify absent Members.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 217, 
nays 207, not voting 9, as follows:

                             [Roll No. 368]
