                          MANY THANKS TO STAFF

  (Mr. ARMEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the following people 
for 5 days of incredibly hard work and long nights, the 
Parliamentarian's Office, the cloak room staff, the clerks, the door 
keepers, the Capitol Police, the legislative counsels, the pages, and 
all of those marvelous people I am looking at now who love to stay with 
us here at night, night after night after night.
