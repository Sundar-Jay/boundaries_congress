             EVEN PRESIDENT CLINTON PRAISES 104TH CONGRESS

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GERALD B.H. SOLOMON

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, the 104th Congress has truly been the most 
significant Congress in over 40 years. When the people of this great 
Nation voted on November 8, 1994 to finally change Government as we 
know it, the 104th Congress responded. Mr. Speaker, not only has there 
been news pieces, editorials, and commentaries supporting the superb 
accomplishments of this Republican controlled Congress throughout this 
country, but our own President, Democrat Bill Clinton states, and I 
quote, ``You guys did such a great job. It's amazing how much you've 
got done in the last few weeks. You should really be proud.'' And proud 
we are, Mr. Speaker.
  Mr. Speaker, let me briefly mention some of the major 
accomplishments. Welfare as we have known it is no longer a guarantee 
of assistance, workers who change jobs will be assured of continued 
health coverage, mothers will no longer be forced out of hospitals 
after they bring new life into this world as they were in the past, we 
have relieved small businesses of excessive tax burdens while 
increasing the minimum wage to enable millions of American workers to 
bring home more pay. Mr. Speaker, this Congress promised to get tough 
on crime and we did just that. For example, crimes committed against 
our elderly and children are no longer tolerated; environmental 
protection acts like the Safe Drinking Water Act, along with 
legislation to overhaul pesticide regulations. I could go on and on, 
Mr. Speaker.
  The 104th Congress has done such a great job, 7 items of our Contract 
of America have been signed into law by President Clinton. And this is 
nothing new, Mr. Speaker. The President has been campaigning on our 
issues and beliefs all year now. You see, Mr. Speaker, President 
Clinton figures if you can't beat 'em, you might as well join 'em.
  At this time I commend to you an article that appeared in the Albany 
Times-Union about the achievements of this Congress.

                       104th Congress Is History

                         (By Elaine S. Povich)

       Washington.--The Senate approved an important aviation 
     safety and spending bill Thursday, breaking a Democratic-led 
     filibuster over a labor issue, and wrapped up business of the 
     watershed 104th Congress for the fall campaigns.
       The Congress, the first in 40 years to be controlled by 
     Republicans, ended as it began: with partisan wrangling. The 
     immediate battle was over a Federal Aviation Administration 
     bill that Democrats, led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., 
     said contained a special provision making it more difficult 
     for Federal Express employees to unionize. After the 
     filibuster was broken with a 66-31 vote (six more than the 
     number needed), the bill passed easily, 92-2.
       ``This is special-interest legislation that never would 
     have been passed by a Democratic House and a Democratic 
     Senate,'' Kennedy maintained. ``We look forward today to the 
     next vote for working families, which is Nov. 5 (Election 
     Day).''
       But the provision for Federal Express, which would require 
     its employees to organize nationally rather than locally, was 
     supported both by Democrats and Republicans. Sen. Ernest 
     Hollings, D-S.C., the provision's main champion, said Kennedy 
     was trying to give the bill the ``bum's rush.''
       The urgency of many senators to get home to campaign, along 
     with the fact that the bill contained millions for airport 
     construction projects, contributed to the lopsided vote.
       The White House had notified the senators that President 
     Clinton opposed the Federal Express provision. Thursday, 
     however, aides indicated that Clinton would sign the bill, 
     which the House approved last week.
       ``Because of this legislation, criminal-background checks 
     can now be conducted on airport personnel, new explosives-
     detection technology can be deployed, baggage will be checked 
     in more thoroughly, passenger profiling will be instituted, 
     and the families who lose a loved one in an accident will be 
     able to get the help they need.'' Clinton said in a 
     statement.
       The bill includes several anti-terrorism provisions for 
     airports, including stepped-up security. Some of the 
     requirements include background checks on airport-security 
     personnel and provisions aimed at dealing more humanely with 
     families of air-crash victims.
       The bill also streamlines the FAA, beefing up the 
     regulatory aspects of the agency and phasing out the air-
     travel promotional functions.
       Also on the Senate's last-minute agenda was a major federal 
     parks bill that passed on a voice vote after days of 
     wrangling over boundary lines in 100 individual federal 
     parks.
       Legislation to increase penalties for misuse of the so-
     called ``date-rape drug'' cleared the Senate and was 
     virtually certain to win final congressional approval.
       The Senate acted by voice vote to control use of Rohypnol. 
     The bill, sponsored by Rep. Gerald Solomon (R-Queensbury), 
     must return to the House, where a slightly different version 
     was approved last week, 421-1.
       Rohypnol is a tranquilizer that has no taste, order or 
     color when dissolved in a drink and is 10 to 20 times more 
     powerful than Valium. In ``roone rape,'' victims who are 
     slipped the drug become dizzy and disoriented and have 
     trouble moving their arms and legs. Ultimately, they pass out 
     and have little or no memory.
       After clearing up the last-minute items, Senate Majority 
     Leader Trent Lott, R-Mass., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, 
     D-S.D., made the traditional telephone call to Clinton to 
     announce that this session of Congress had concluded its 
     business.
       ``We've got good news for you,'' Lott told Clinton. They 
     discussed bills Congress had passed over the past few weeks.
       ``You guys did such a great job,'' Clinton said. ``It's 
     amazing how much you've got done in the last few weeks. You 
     should really be proud.''

                            key legislation

       Some of the major bills passed by the 104th Congress:
       Welfare: The longstanding federal guarantee of assistance 
     to every person who qualifies will end, to be replaced by 
     state programs financed partially by federal grants. 
     Eligibility for welfare generally will be limited to five 
     years. Food stamps, aid to legal immigrants will be scaled 
     back considerably.
       Health: Workers who change jobs will be assured continued 
     health coverage without a waiting period for pre-existing 
     conditions. Insurers will have to pay for at least 48 hours' 
     hospital care for newborns and their mothers and provide 
     higher benefits for mental-health care.
       Taxes: No across-the-board tax reduction, although targeted 
     cuts were approved for adoption expenses, long-term health 
     care, helping small businesses bear the cost of raising the 
     minimum wage and helping the self-employed buy health 
     insurance.
       Minimum wage: The $4.25-an-hour federal minimum wage will 
     rise in two steps to $5.15.
       Speed limit: The 55 mph federal speed limit was repealed.
       Crime: More money for police on the street. Limitation of 
     appeals in death-penalty cases. Tougher penalties for crimes 
     against the elderly and children. Interstate stalking was 
     made a federal crime.
       Environment: A new standard restricts cancer-causing 
     pesticides in fresh and processed foods and also targets 
     residues that raise the risk of birth defects. A new Safe 
     Drinking Water Act zeros in on pollutants posing the greatest 
     risk to health.
       Telecommunications: A major overhaul allows local telephone 
     companies to enter the long-distance business; big gas and 
     electric companies will be able to offer telecommunications 
     services. A ``V-chip'' eventually will screen TV programs for 
     violence and adult-oriented content.
       Gay marriages: States will be allowed to refuse to 
     recognize same-sex marriages. No federal spousal benefits 
     will be available in such marriages.
