the gentleman from Pennsylvania?

[[Page H12286]]

  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I would 
like to ask the distinguished chairman several questions about this 
bill.
  Mr. Speaker, my understanding is this is to parallel the 
Congressional Accountability Act, and I know that the House has decided 
not to allow unions for legislative employees. What are we doing in 
this bill then vis-a-vis executive branch employees?
  Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman will yield, my 
understanding is this bill tracks the Congressional Accountability Act. 
I am advised there is no provision in this bill with regard to union 
representation.
  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I 
thank the gentleman for that. The second question I have is about the 
inspector general. There were folks saying that the inspector general 
in the White House is given more authority than the inspector general 
has under the congressional accountability laws.
  Mr. CLINGER. If the gentlewoman would yield further, I would advise 
the gentlewoman that the provision with regard to inspector general, as 
well as the provision with regard to chief financial officer which were 
included in the House-passed version of the bill, were stricken by the 
Senate and are not included in this unanimous-consent request.
  Mrs. SCHROEDER. I see. So basically this is as close a mirror to what 
the Congressional Accountability Act was, and the areas that we have 
blocked by just not implementing them, would the White House be allowed 
to do the same?
  Mr. CLINGER. I am sorry, would the gentlewoman repeat the question?
  Mrs. SCHROEDER. As the gentleman knows, there have been parts of the 
Congressional Accountability Act that we have not implemented fully 
here. Would the White House be allowed that same leeway, to not 
implement in the areas where the House is not implementing?
  Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentlewoman would yield further, as 
I would suggest to the gentlewoman, I think since the act is designed 
to track the congressional version, obviously if portions of it have 
not been implemented in the House, they would be deferred in the 
executive branch as well.
  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I 
thank the gentleman. I am one of the people who really thinks both 
should be fully under the laws we pass for other people, but in my 
entire 24 years here we tend to pass it and then exempt all sorts of 
things. I want to be sure that we have not done that vis-a-vis 
ourselves, but turned around and done it to the executive branch. I 
think we ought to be treating both the same. I think we both ought to 
get rid of all roadblocks and be under the laws that everybody else is 
under. What the gentleman is assuring me is that his intent is to treat 
the executive branch exactly the same way he has treated us through 
this House.
  Mr. CLINGER. If the gentlewoman would yield further, precisely the 
same way as we are dealt with here in the House.
  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania?
  Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I think 
the veterans preference that was passed under the Mica bill is not in 
this bill we are considering now.
  Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, the gentleman 
is correct. It is not included in this measure.
  Mr. MONTGOMERY. The Senate did drop the provisions on the veterans 
provision.
  Mr. CLINGER. The gentleman is correct.
  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 3452, the 
Presidential and Executive Office Accountability Act, as amended by the 
other body. The basic principle behind this legislation is that the 
Federal Government should be subject to the same laws and regulations 
as the private sector. Congress has already passed the Congressional 
Accountability Act, and there is no good reason why the Executive 
Office of the President should not also be subject to the same laws as 
Congress and the private sector.
  The other body has improved this bill by deleting two controversial 
provisions from the House-passed version--one called for a compliance 
board and the other for establishing an inspector general in the White 
House. The compliance board would have been unnecessary and overly 
bureaucratic, as White House employees already have recourse to the 
Merit Systems Protection Board. The provision establishing an inspector 
general in the White House was, in my view, costly, unnecessary, and of 
dubious constitutionality. I am glad that we will have an opportunity 
for full and open debate on this issue in the future.
  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3452 is a good bill, and I want to thank 
Representative Horn and Chairman Clinger for their willingness to work 
with the minority as it made its way through the legislative process.
  Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
  Mr. SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania?
  There was no objection.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
