               TRIBUTE TO ASSEMBLYMAN THOMAS M. HANNIGAN

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. VIC FAZIO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Mr. FAZIO of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
a close friend and dedicated public servant, Hon. Tom Hannigan, a 
California Assemblyman representing Solano County, Yolo County, and the 
delta portion of Sacramento County in the California State Assembly.
  I owe my political career to Tom because he stepped aside when I 
first ran for the California Assembly and undoubtedly would have beaten 
me. A few years later, when I ran for the House of Representatives, he 
was elected to that assembly seat where he has served with distinction 
ever since.
  Due to term limits in the California Assembly, Tom is retiring at the 
end of this year. But for many years, he has worked as a quiet, 
effective assemblyman, playing a central role in the most important 
issues confronting California, chief among them budget, education 
reform, agriculture, and transportation.
  Tom Hannigan has been instrumental in easing the commuter crunch 
around Sacramento's transportation arteries, such as the Interstate 80 
corridor. He has pushed for increased passenger train service between 
the State capital and the Bay Area.
  Tom has also played a major role regarding California's largest 
industry--agriculture. He is the author of legislation strengthening 
the Williamson Act farm preservation law. His legislation also created 
the California Center for Cooperatives at UC-Davis, providing research 
and support for agricultural co-ops and other rural development 
initiatives.
  Tom has deep roots in Solano County. He was first elected to the 
California Assembly in 1978 after years of active service at the local 
level--as a successful businessman, as mayor of Fairfield, and as 
chairman of the Solano County Board of Supervisors. In the assembly, 
among other positions, he served as Democratic Majority Leader.
  He is a native Californian, born in Vallejo, and he stayed loyal to 
his State by attending college at Santa Clara University, receiving his 
degree in business administration. After college, Tom served his 
country as a U.S. Marine Corps officer and saw service in Vietnam.
  It may not be an exaggeration to say that Tom was a successful 
assemblyman only because Fairfield is close enough to Sacramento for 
him to get home to his family every night. His commitment to his family 
always ranked first on his priority list. Term limits may be forcing 
his retirement from the assembly, but perhaps not that much sooner than 
the strong call of grandchildren would have required.
  Tom's retirement from the California Assembly is a real loss, not 
only for his constituents, but for the assembly and for California 
itself. He retires with a record of achievement for his district and 
his State. I wish him continued success, and I extend my 
congratulations to him, his wife Jan, and their children and 
grandchildren.
