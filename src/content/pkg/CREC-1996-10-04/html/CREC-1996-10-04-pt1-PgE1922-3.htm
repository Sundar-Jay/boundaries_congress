                      A TRIBUTE TO GEORGE R. BOGGS

                                 ______
                                 

                     HON. RANDY ``DUKE'' CUNNINGHAM

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise George Boggs, 
president of Palomar Community College. It has been my privilege to 
work with Mr. Boggs in addressing the educational needs of the people 
of San Diego County.
  On October 12, George Boggs will be recognized as the best community 
college executive in the United States by the Association of Community 
College Trustees. His record of achievement is outstanding and clearly 
deserving of this recognition.
  I submit for the Record an editorial from the October 4, 1996, North 
County Times--Escondido, CA--newspaper which further describes 
President Boggs' outstanding achievements.
  Congratulations George, you have earned it.

            [From the North County (CA) Times, Oct. 4, 1996]

                          Unjustified Modesty

       When George R. Boggs came to Palomar Community College in 
     1985 to serve as its president, there were 15,500 students, 
     the equivalent of 325 full-time faculty members, and a 
     standard array of course offerings.
       Today, the college has about 26,000 students enrolled, a 
     full-time equivalent faculty of 516, and the honor of being 
     named as one of three``flagship'' community colleges in the 
     nation, for the college's focus on learning outcomes.
       Humility being one of his obvious traits, Boggs would never 
     take credit for the school's successful growth. But his board 
     of trustees and his national peers would: Boggs has been 
     named the best community college executive in the United 
     States by the Association of Community College Trustees.
       On Oct. 12, Boggs will receive the 1996 Marie Y. Martin 
     Chief Executive Officer Award at the association's annual 
     conference. It is an exceptional honor, one earned by Boggs' 
     exemplary performance in a politically and economically 
     challenging era for community colleges. And his success is 
     not based on his numerous publications, the size of the 
     school's endowment, or the value of its research facilities.
       No, instead Boggs has focused the district's resources on 
     that which is most important to the community: student 
     learning. Boggs has built partnerships within the community 
     to improve both student access to higher education and the 
     experience they have in the classroom. And the college is 
     continuing to grow.
       North County is lucky to have Boggs and the outstanding 
     curriculum, staff, and student body he has helped to nurture. 
     Congratulations.
