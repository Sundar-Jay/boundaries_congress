        CONGRATULATING HARVARD STREET NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CENTER

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY II

                            of massachusetts

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I rise on this occasion to 
compliment, encourage, and bring national attention to a successful 
grass roots health care initiative that started in my district at 
Harvard Street Neighborhood Health Center and has been implemented 
throughout the great Commonwealth of Massachusetts. This unique health 
care program is called Men of Color Health Care Initiative.
  This initiative, among other things, is an outgrowth of the fact that 
the population the program serves tends not to seek out or utilize the 
medical services available to them. The need for this type of program 
becomes even more urgent, considering the fact that this

population, when compared to the general public, reflects a 
disproportionate level of medical needs, including cardiovascular 
disease, strokes, diabetes, and cancer. Harvard Street Neighborhood 
Health Center and the other Men of Color health care programs do 
aggressive outreach and case management, and offer medical services in 
all major areas. They are to be commended for their hard work and 
commitment to the community.
  I also commend Brigham and Woman's Hospital, the Massachusetts 
Department of Public Health, and the numerous businesses and 
individuals whose hard work and financial contribution make this 
initiative possible.
