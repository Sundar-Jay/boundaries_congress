           IN MEMORY OF SECRET SERVICE AGENT RUFUS YOUNGBLOOD

  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to inform the house that 
one of America's heroes died on Wednesday.
  After a battle with cancer, retired U.S. Secret Service Agent Rufus 
W. Youngblood died at the age of 72 in Savannah, GA.
  Agent Youngblood was awarded the Treasury Exceptional Service Award 
in recognition of his outstanding courage and voluntary risk of 
personal safety in protecting the Vice President on November 22, 1963 
in Dallas, TX. He was riding in Vice President Lyndon Johnson's 
limousine when President John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
  When Rufus Youngblood retired from the Secret Service in 1971, he was 
the Deputy Director of the Service. Agent Youngblood joined the Service 
in 1951 and had a distinguished career including his service in the 
Presidential and Vice Presidential Protective Divisions.

  A World War II Army Air Force veteran, Rufus Youngblood was always 
there when his country called. Our Nation is the better for his service 
and we all share in the loss of this American hero. He is survived by 
his wife and four children and I know my colleagues in the Congress 
join me in sending our deepest sympathies and thanks to his family.
  Mr. Speaker, God was truly blessing America when he gave us Rufus 
Youngblood.
