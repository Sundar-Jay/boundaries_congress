                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Mr. FAZIO of California. Mr. Speaker, it is with a great deal of 
sadness that I rise today to announce the passing of Bill Flournoy of 
Tehama County, CA, who died on September 5, 1996, at the age of 75.
  Bill was a member of the Red Bluff Elks Lodge No. 1250, a member of 
the Tehama County Cattlemen's Association and the California 
Cattlemen's Association, a member of the Woolgrowers Association, a 
member of the Tehama County Fair Board, and a member of the Flood 
Control Board.
  Bill's 24 years of service as a Tehama County Supervisor was the 
longest tenure of any supervisor in recent years. He served his 
community with distinction in a variety of ways for many years. I 
extend my sympathy to his surviving family members while expressing my 
appreciation and the appreciation of every citizen of Tehama County for 
his life of service.
