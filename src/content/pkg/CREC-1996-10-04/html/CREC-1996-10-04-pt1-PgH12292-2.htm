 TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS TO PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND WORK OPPORTUNITY 
                       RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1996

  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the 
Speaker's table the Senate bill (S. 2183) to make technical corrections 
to the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act 
of 1996, and ask for its immediate consideration.
  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
  Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2183.
  This bill would allow States, like New Mexico, that have a growing 
number of people who qualify for food stamps or are unemployed access 
to the contingency fund moneys that were included in the recently 
enacted welfare reform bill.
  This is merely a technical correction which is necessary for many 
States which will not be able to reform welfare programs until their 
State legislatures meet again next year, but as of October 1 are 
operating under limited block grants funding.
  In New Mexico, our population is growing at such a rapid pace that 
continuing our current welfare program under the block grant system 
will lead to a funding shortfall.
  Inadequate block grant funding would cause States like New Mexico to 
make across-the-board cuts in welfare payments to families in need.
  This legislation would allow States like New Mexico to tap into the 
welfare contingency fund and avoid financial hardships during the 
transition to a new welfare program.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  There was no objection.
  The Clerk read the Senate bill, as follows:

                                S. 2183

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,
