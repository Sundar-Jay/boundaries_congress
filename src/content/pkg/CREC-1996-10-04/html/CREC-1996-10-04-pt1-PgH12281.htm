      EXTENDING PERIOD OF STAY IN UNITED STATES FOR CERTAIN NURSES

  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the 
Speaker's table the Senate bill (S. 2197) to extend the authorized 
period of stay within the United States for certain nurses, and ask for 
its immediate consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I 
understand that this is designed to help a lot of people who come here 
to provide employment, to be here as nurses, but I would like to 
understand a little bit more about this.
  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman would yield, I would like 
to withdraw the unanimous consent. I believe that the staff has some 
information that might solve some of his problems and I will bring it 
up at a later date.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] 
withdraws his unanimous-consent request with regard to S. 2197.
