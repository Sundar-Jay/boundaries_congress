     1997 complete a study of the feasibility of a circulating 
     commemorative coin program to commemorate each of the 50 
     States. The study shall assess likely public acceptance of 
     and consumer demand for different coins that might be issued 
     in connection with such a program (taking into consideration

     under the program and the revenue that the program would 
     generate, the impact on coin distribution systems, the 
     advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to 
     selecting designs for coins in such a program, and such other 
     factors as the Secretary considers appropriate in deciding 
     upon the feasibility of such a program. No steps taken in

       (c) 50-State Commemorative Coin Program.--The Secretary 
     shall determine by August 1, 1997 whether the results of the 
     study authorized by subsection (a) justify such a program. If

     issuance of quarter dollar coins bearing designs, selected in 
     accordance with paragraph (4) of this subsection, which are 
     emblematic of the 50 States. If the Secretary determines that 
     such a commemorative coin program is justified but that it is 
     not practicable to commence the program by January 1, 1999, 
     then he shall notify the Committee on Banking and Financial 
     Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on 
     Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate of such 
     impracticability and of the date on which the program will 
     commence.
       (1) Design.--The design for each quarter dollar issued 
     under the program shall be emblematic of 1 of the 50 States. 
     The designs for quarter dollar coins issued during each year

     SEC. 304. MINT MANAGERIAL STAFFING REFORM.

       Section 5131 of title 31, United States Code, is amended--
       (1) by striking subsection (c); and
       (2) by redesignating subsection (d) as subsection (c).

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (during the reading). Without objection, the 
Senate amendments are considered as read and printed in the Record.
  There was no objection.
  Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1776, an omnibus 
commemorative coin act that has been negotiated with the Senate. This 
bill contains seven surcharged commemorative coin programs and the 
promise of a new circulating program. For the first time, the taxpayer 
and the Mint will be insulated from any failure of these programs to 
sell their authorized mintage amounts. That is because the protections 
from our earlier reform legislation H.R. 2614, have been signed into 
law earlier this week.
  The beneficiaries of the respective coins are as follows--for 1997: 
the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, 100,000 $5 gold coins 
authorized, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 
500,000 silver dollars authorized, and the Jackie Robinson Foundation, 
100,000 $5 gold coins authorized and 200,000 silver dollars authorized. 
In 1999, Yellowstone National Park is scheduled to be commemorated, 
with 500,000 silver $1 coins authorized.
  In addition, we are moving toward the first circulating commemorative 
coin program since the bicentennial quarter. Providing a Treasury 
feasibility study is positive, the program will honor the 50 States of 
the United States of America by producing a series of circulating 
quarter dollar coins that commemorate each State in the order that they 
entered the Union.
  The bill also provides coins for the three programs that observed 
House Banking Committee rules and proceeded through the difficult 
process of obtaining two thirds co-sponsorship, through hearings, mark-
up and passage through this House in regular order. They are: The Black 
Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial for 1998, 500,000 silver dollars, 
the Dolley Madison coin for the benefit of Montpelier in 1999, 500,000 
silver dollars, and the George Washington coin to benefit Mount Vernon 
also in 1999, 100,000 gold $5 pieces.
  This bill protects the taxpayer from the abuses common to many 
earlier coin programs and still benefits these most worthy causes.
  I urge its immediate adoption.
  Mr. FRANKS of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the 
Senate amendments to H.R. 1776. Included in them is a bill I introduced 
with Congressman Floyd Flake which would commemorate the 50th 
anniversary of Jackie Robinson's breaking the color barrier in major 
league baseball. Our bill, entitled the ``Jackie Robinson Commemorative 
Coin Act'' (H.R. 4148) currently has 158 cosponsors.
  Our bill would authorize the minting of $1 coins to commemorate this 
important event in American history. Sales of the coin would benefit 
the Jackie Robinson Foundation, which provides college scholarships to 
hundreds of underprivileged students. An important feature of this bill 
is that it requires the Treasury Department to recover its full costs 
before any funds go to the Foundation.
  Jackie Robinson was a great and courageous American. Many Americans 
today would be unable to comprehend the virulent racism Jackie Robinson 
experienced when he became America's first African-American major 
league baseball player.
  It is truly amazing that any human being could have withstood the 
endless abuse and degrading racial epithets that were hurled at Jackie 
Robinson during the 1947 baseball season. Yet, he never let racial 
slurs get the best of him. Instead, Jackie Robinson conducted himself 
with the utmost grace and dignity. On the field, he proved to his 
detractors that the color of one's skin is irrelevant to one's athletic 
ability.
  In fact, he was such an incredible ballplayer that he won the Rookie 
of the Year award that year.
  Mr. Speaker, Jackie Robinson was a talented hitter and fielder, but 
to many, his athletic prowess was most apparent as a base runner. he 
led the National League in stolen bases in 1947 and 1949. Perhaps his 
most exciting play was stealing home. As any baseball fan knows, 
stealing home is one of the most difficult plays in baseball to 
execute--yet it was Jackie Robinson's specialty.
  I remember watching old newsreels of Brooklyn Dodger games and seeing 
Jackie on third base, with a big lead, taunting the pitcher. Then he 
would explode down the base path in a flash and slide into home before 
the catcher could apply the tag. No play in baseball is more exciting 
to watch.
  Of course, stealing home, like being the first black major league 
ball player, take guts, supreme confidence, and a steely 
determination--qualities Jackie Robinson had both on and off the field.
  Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1776, an omnibus 
commemorative coin act that has been negotiated with the Senate. This 
bill contains seven surcharged coin programs that, as usual, benefit 
worthy causes. I still believe that there are too many coin programs 
being ordered to be minted in 1997 for them all to be successful. 
However, for the first time, the taxpayer and the mint will be 
insulated from any failure of these programs to sell their authorized 
mintage amounts. That is because the protections from our reform 
legislation H.R. 2614, have been signed into law earlier this week.
  The beneficiaries of the respective coins are as follows--for 1997: 
the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, 100,000 $5 gold coins 
authorized, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, 
500,000 silver dollars authorized, and the Jackie Robinson Foundation, 
100,000 $5 gold coins authorized and 200,000 silver dollars authorized. 
In 1999 Yellowstone National Park will be commemorated, 500,000 silver 
coins authorized. Under the Commemorative Coin Reform Act signed into 
law on September 30, 1996, only two programs per year are permitted. 
Early in the 105th Congress we will address this conflict in a mutually 
agreeable fashion.
  The bill also includes something for the collectors who support all 
of these programs by actually purchasing the resulting coins. Beginning 
after 1999, mintages will be limited and as stated, only two programs 
per year will be permitted. In addition, we are moving toward the first 
circulating commemorative coin program since the bicentennial quarter. 
Providing a Treasury feasibility study is positive, the program will 
honor the 50 States of the United States of America by producing a 
series of circulating quarter dollar coins that commemorate each State 
in the order that they entered the Union.
  Each year, until every State has been honored, five unique designs, 
each representing an individual State, will be issued at intervals of 
about 2 months. The completed set will represent the diverse history 
and culture of the States of the Union.
  There will be no private surcharges added to the cost of these coins. 
Nevertheless, the estimated earnings from the silver coins alone is 
over $100 million over the course of the program. This sum is scorable 
for budgetary purposes.
  The mint's production schedule is demand driven. Increased 
production, estimated for this circulating commemorative program at an 
additional 50 percent over baseline projections, will produce 
anticipated earnings on the order of over $3 billion for the total 
program. By Congressional Budget Office scoring convention, these 
earnings are off-budget and thus are not available to be spent by 
Congress. Instead, they will be applied directly to replace borrowing 
otherwise necessary to fund the national debt, saving taxpayers over $1 
billion in interest payments over the first 10 years of the program.
  The bill also provides coins for the three programs that observed 
House Banking Committee rules and proceeded through the difficult 
process of obtaining two-thirds cosponsorship, through hearings, markup 
and passage through this House in regular order.

They are: The Black Revolutionary War Patriots Memorial for 1998, 
500,000 silver dollars, the Dolley Madison coin for the benefit of 
Montpelier in 1999, 500,000 silver dollars, and the George Washington 
coin to benefit Mount Vernon also in 1999, 100,000 gold $5 pieces.
  Among its other virtues, this program will introduce a younger and 
more diverse population to the fascinating hobby of coin collecting. 
This bill will also protect the taxpayer from the abuses common to many 
earlier coin programs and still benefit a number of worthy causes.
  I urge its immediate adoption.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of 
the gentleman from Virginia?
  There was no objection.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
