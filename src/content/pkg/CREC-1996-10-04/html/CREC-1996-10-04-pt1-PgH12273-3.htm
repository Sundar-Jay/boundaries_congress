                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Rev. James David Ford, D.D., offered the following 
prayer:
  Bless Your people, O gracious God, bless all who seek Your favor and 
who earnestly wish to serve You by serving others. We are specially 
aware this day of those who leave this institution, who have given of 
their knowledge and zeal and commitment in ways that have served the 
common good and who have done their part by promoting justice in our 
land and in our world. We salute them with our praise and we remember 
them in our prayers for their efforts have contributed to the 
foundations that strengthen the Nation. So may Your benediction be with 
all who serve and may Your grace be with every person now and in all 
the days to come. In Your name, we pray. Amen.
