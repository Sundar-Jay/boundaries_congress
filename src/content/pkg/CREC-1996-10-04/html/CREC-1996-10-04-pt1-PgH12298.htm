                          FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the 
gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Roth] is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. ROTH. Mr. Speaker, I wish to say that I have enjoyed serving here 
in this Congress with you. Let me say that this session, the first in 
40 years with conservatives in control, we made many fundamental 
changes. We did end the era of big government and ushered in the 
Information Age in government, the age of less government, but more 
responsive government. This is a great institution, the U.S. Congress. 
It is here that the people's will is carried out, maybe not always with 
rushing speed, but it is certainly carried out, heard and eventually 
carried out.
  The greatest honor that I have had bestowed on me has come from the 
people of the Eighth Congressional District of Wisconsin, who have 
elected me nine times to this U.S. House of Representatives, and for 
that I thank them. This is a wonderful institution, wonderful people to 
serve with, and as I take my leave today, I just want all of my 
colleagues to know how much I have appreciated serving in this body, 
and I hope to see them often, and I know that they will carry on in the 
great traditions that this Congress has served the American people for 
over 200 years.
