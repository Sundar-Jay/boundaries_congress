               HONORING ST. JUDE THADDEUS CATHOLIC CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. KEN BENTSEN

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Mr. BENTSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the parish of St. 
Jude Thaddeus in Highlands, TX, as they prepare to commemorate their 
50th anniversary on November 3, 1996. The church has been a building 
block and an inspiration for the community.
  The history of St. Jude Thaddeus Catholic Church began with a census 
taken in 1945 to determine the community and spiritual needs for a 
Catholic Church in Highlands, TX. In 1946, the parish began building a 
wooden structure on 2\1/2\ acres of land on Main Street. With Father 
Bernard Roehmer serving as resident pastor, Bishop Christopher Byrne 
dedicated this new structure on November 30, 1947.
  On March 6, 1966, the existing brick church and C.C.E. Building were 
completed and blessed by the Reverend Bishop John L. Morkovsky. From 
the humble beginning of 30 registered families at St. Jude Thaddeus 
Catholic Church, the support and commitment of the community has been 
inspirational.
  Father John Zabelskas, appointed in 1992, serves as the eighth pastor 
of the present facilities which include Marian Hall, a new rectory, 
C.C.E. Building, and parish gym. On Sunday, November 3, 1996, St. Jude 
Thaddeus Catholic Church will celebrate its 50th anniversary with a 
High Mass, dinner, and reception in the parish gymnasium. I thank the 
parish for all that they have contributed to our community in these 50 
years and wish them many blessings for the future.
