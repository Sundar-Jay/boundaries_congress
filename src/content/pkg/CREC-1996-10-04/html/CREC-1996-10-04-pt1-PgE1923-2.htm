                 NATIONAL INVASIVE SPECIES ACT OF 1996

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                            HON. BUD SHUSTER

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Mr. SHUSTER. Mr. Speaker, last night the Senate passed H.R. 4283, the 
National Invasive Species Act of 1996, clearing the measure for the 
President. Given the process that unfolded, Members and others may find 
helpful a few remarks to clarify the bill's legislative history.
  H.R. 4283 is the text of H.R. 3217--as passed the House on September 
24, 1996--with four additional provisions requested by Senators from 
the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Commerce, Science, 
and Transportation Committee. These amendments modify the bill's safety 
exclusion and restriction on ballast water discharges into harbors, 
authorize research funding in Narragansett Bay, require a study of 
shoreside ballast water facilities, and clarify authority to fund 
regional research. The House passed H.R. 4283 on September 28, 1996.
  This broadly supported, bipartisan legislation--introduced and 
championed by Representative Steve LaTourette--builds upon the 1990 Act 
that addressed zebra mussels and other invasive species in the Great 
Lakes.
  H.R. 4283 is national in scope, extending a voluntary, incentive-
based approach to all coasts and regions at risk.
  Whether you call them invasive, exotic, or nonindigenous, these 
species of plants, animals, and invertebrates can wreak havoc on 
infrastructure, commerce, recreation and tourism, and the environment.
  H.R. 4283 coordinates agencies, research institutions, and others to 
prevent and control the introduction and spread of invasive species--
primarily through voluntary ballast water exchange and management, 
education, and research.
  The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's report on H.R. 3217 
(Rept. 104-815) provides a detailed description of the bill and our 
committee's intent.
  For a description of the changes made to the reported bill, I would 
refer my colleagues to the floor debate on H.R. 3217 on September 24, 
1996.
  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not thank some of the Members and 
committees instrumental in moving this important legislation.
  More than anyone else, Representative Steve LaTourette is responsible 
for this bill and its movement through the House. He has worked with 
all interests to build broadly supported legislation. He has also 
worked closely with his colleague from Ohio and in the other body, 
Senator Glenn, who worked on the 1990 law and S. 1660, the Senate 
version of the National Invasive Species Act of 1996.
  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee members should also be 
congratulated for their efforts, particularly the ranking Democrat of 
the committee, Jim Oberstar, the chairman and ranking Democrat of the 
Water Resources and Environment Subcommittee, Sherry Boehlert and 
Robert Borski, and the chairman and ranking Democrat of the Coast Guard 
and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, Howard Coble and Bob Clement.
  Other committees have been helpful as well--particularly the 
Committees on Resources, Science, House Oversight, International 
Relations, National Security and Agriculture.
  Senate colleagues, including the chairmen and members of the 
Environment and Public Works Committee and Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation Committee, should also be commended. Without their 
cooperation and help, we could not have crafted this legislation and 
shepherded it through Congress and to the President.
  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleagues in both Chambers for their 
efforts to enact the National Invasive Species Act of 1996. The bill is 
yet another example of the 104th Congress' efforts to protect the 
Nation's environment and water infrastructure.
