           WILDFIRE SUPPRESSION AIRCRAFT TRANSFER ACT OF 1996

  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the 
Speaker's table the Senate bill (S. 2078) to authorize the sale of 
excess Department of Defense aircraft to facilitate the suppression of 
wildfire, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the Senate bill.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I wanted 
to thank them for bringing this up. I know the gentleman from New 
Mexico [Mr. Richardson] has worked terribly hard on this. For those of 
us who live in the West, where forest fires are so eminent, this is 
essential, because it gets us the airplanes we need to fight those 
wildfires. So I thank the gentleman from New York, and we thank the 
Congress for getting this here. Hopefully we will not have any 
wildfires. If we do, we had better be ready for them. I thank the 
gentleman very much, for the gentleman from New Mexico.
  Mr. RICHARDSON. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in strong support 
of the Wildfire Suppression Aircraft Transfer Act of 1996, a bipartisan 
bill that I introduced in the House and Senator Bingaman introduced in 
the Senate.
  This bill authorizes the Department of Defense to sell excess 
military aircraft to private contractors that provide fire fighting 
services to the Federal Government.
  The powerful wildfires that spread throughout the West this past year 
have highlighted the need for an improved, modernized and expanded 
fleet of airtankers to help the U.S. Forest Service and the Department 
of Interior to fight wildfires.
  The current fleet of World War II and Korean War vintage aircraft 
needs to be replaced with modern, turbine powered aircraft that are 
more efficient and safe.
  The only reliable source of these aircraft is excess military 
aircraft available from the Department of Defense that can be converted 
to deliver fire retardant.
  This legislation would provide the authority to the Secretary of 
Defense to sell appropriate aircraft to qualified airtanker operators 
solely for use in fighting wildfires.
  In New Mexico, many communities were threatened by wildfires this 
past summer including the community of Lama. The wildfires were burning 
on very steep slopes, with high fuel loads, strong wind gusts and 
unseasonably hot and dry weather.
  For this reason, the firefighters need as much assistance as 
possible. By upgrading our airtanker fleets, we will have a better 
chance of protecting and saving our lives, property, and forests.
  Because of the nearly 150,000 acres of forest and grasslands that 
were burned when wildfires ravaged New Mexico, and the many more 
wildfires that burned throughout the West this past year, it is 
essential that we give firefighters the necessary tools that they need. 
This bill provides the necessary equipment to assist firefighters.
  I want to thank Senator Bingaman for all his hard work on this 
legislation, and I also want to thank the Members on both sides of the 
aisle who worked to pass this important piece of legislation.
  Mrs. SCHROEDER. I withdraw my reservation of objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  There was no objection.
  The Clerk read the Senate bill, as follows:

                                S. 2078

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     requirements of the regulations prescribed under subsection 
     (d).
