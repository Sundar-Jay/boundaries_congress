                  TRIBUTE TO AMERICAN LEGION POST 642

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. MARCY KAPTUR

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 50th 
anniversary of American Legion Post 642--the Przybylski Post--in Toledo 
OH. The post is celebrating the occasion on Sunday, October 6, 1996. As 
part of this golden anniversary celebration, the post's adjutant has 
announced that the members and families of American Legion Post 642 
will ``honor the founding and present members for the American endeavor 
and patriotism which have sustained the post for so long.'' To mark 
this auspicious occasion, we recall the ``American Creed,'' penned by 
William Tyler Page.

       I believe in the United States of America as a Government 
     of the people, by the people, for the people; whose just 
     powers are derived from the consent of the governed; a 
     democracy in a republic, a sovereign Nation of

[[Page E1923]]

     many sovereign States; a perfect Union one and inseparable; 
     established upon those principles of freedom, equality, 
     justice, and humanity for which American patriots sacrificed 
     their lives and fortunes. I therefore believe it is my duty 
     to my country to love it, to support its Constitution, to 
     obey its laws, to respect its flag, and to defend it against 
     all enemies.

  The men and women of American Legion Post 642 have vigilantly upheld 
the tenets of the ``American Creed'' to a superior degree. For 
remaining true to these precious beliefs in times of battle and in 
times in peace, we thank them, and we honor their strength.
