                          TRIBUTE TO SAM KARAS

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. SAM FARR

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Mr. FARR of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a 
remarkable man who has served his community for more than 40 years. He 
has been an impressive figure of California's central coast and a 
strong leader in his home town of Monterey. It is with sadness that I 
announce that Sam Karas will soon be retiring from the Monterey County 
Board of Supervisors.
  Sam's long tradition of public service began in 1943 when he moved to 
Monterey as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. It was at this time 
that he also married the lovely Edith James. The Karas' have been 
blessed with three daughters, all of whom graduated from the Monterey 
Peninsula Unified School District, and four granddaughters.
  When not doting on his family, Sam Karas has long been involved in 
community service. Employed in the wholesale meat industry for 35 
years, Sam always found time to involve himself in a variety of 
activities and humanitarian causes, donating his time and talent as a 
fund raiser. He was one of the original board members of the Human 
Rights Commission, which led the fight against California's proposition 
14, a discriminatory housing initiative. He has received awards for the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the League 
of United Latin American Citizens and the Japanese American Citizens 
League for his outstanding work. Sam also served as an organizer and 
board member of the Monterey Peninsula Visitor and Convention Bureau.
  Additionally, Sam Karas served as board member for the Monterey 
Peninsula Visitor and Convention Bureau, and on the board of trustees 
of the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District from 1973 to 1980. 
During this time his contributions included fighting for a Magnet 
School Program and advocating for the integration of students, staff, 
and teachers. In 1984, Sam was elected to the Monterey County Board of 
Supervisors and has served Monterey County in that capacity ever since. 
He was elected chair of the board of supervisors in 1986 and again in 
1991. In his role as county supervisor, I have had the honor of 
cochairing the Big Sur Multi-Agency Advisory Council with him where he 
always provides a fresh outlook and a candid perspective.
  Among Sam's many accomplishments is the work he has done on behalf of 
the farm worker community and in support of decent and affordable 
housing in Monterey County. In addition to this, Sam Karas created the 
Carmel River Task Force which successfully rebuilt community bridges 
and neighborhoods after two devastating floods in the winter of 1995. 
Sam also helped to protect the environment by coauthoring a countywide 
ballot measure to prevent offshore oil and gas development in the 
Monterey Bay--now part of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.
  Sam's contributions to the area have stretched far beyond the average 
capacity, adding to the artistic richness of the community as well. He 
has appeared in many local theater productions, including being asked 
by his friend Clint Eastwood to play a role in the Academy Award 
winning film ``Unforgiven.'' Sam helped to organize the famous Monterey 
Pop Festival, served as an original member of the board of directors of 
the Monterey Jazz Festival, and is currently on the board of directors 
of the Monterey Bay Blues Festival. He has received many honors 
recognizing his extensive talents.
  Sam's devotion to community service is exemplary. It has been an 
honor and a pleasure to work with him for the benefit of Monterey 
County. Sam has offered us concern, compassion, realism, and a spunk 
that we will miss greatly. I know and I am speaking for all residents 
of Monterey County when I say that we will be sad to see Sam Karas 
retire from the Monterey County Board of Supervisors, but wish him all 
the very best in his future endeavors.
