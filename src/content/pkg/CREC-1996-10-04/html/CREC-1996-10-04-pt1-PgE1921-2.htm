                TRIBUTE TO ASSEMBLYMAN PHILLIP ISENBERG

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. VIC FAZIO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Friday, October 4, 1996

  Mr. FAZIO of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
a close friend and dedicated public servant, Hon. Phil Isenberg, who 
represents Sacramento in the California Assembly.
  Phil and I got our starts in politics together as staff members in 
the assembly, Phil for Willie Brown. An assemblyman himself since 1982, 
Phil has served as the conscience of that body. He is an unabashed 
liberal in the best sense of the word--using government to care for 
people--yet his record for fiscal responsibility in government was 
unrivaled and broke the mold of traditional liberalism in our State. 
Now, due to term limits, he is retiring at the end of the year.
  In the assembly, Phil authored laws to allow people who have been 
denied health insurance because of previous medical conditions to buy 
State-backed coverage, and he wrote the law establishing the toughest 
smoking prevention programs in the Nation. He was the author of 
landmark legislation to reform conditions in California nursing homes.
  Phil has been a leading advocate of restructuring State and local 
government to deliver services to citizens more effectively. As 
chairman of the assembly judiciary committee from 1989 to 1995, he 
authored landmark legislation mandating efficiencies in court 
operations, providing State funding for trial courts, and increasing 
public access.
  Phil has long been committed to the protection of the Delta and to 
the equitable distribution of water for people, farms, and the 
environment. He authored laws to promote agriculture water 
conservation, expand wetland areas, and protect Mono Lake.
  Phil's election to the California Assembly in 1982 came after years 
of active service at the local level. He served first as city council 
member, then two-term mayor for Sacramento, and he, more than anyone, 
was responsible for putting Sacramento on the map. He was the first 
mayor to focus on economic development, and his efforts have 
transformed Sacramento from a small city dominated by State government 
into one of the fastest-growing and most attractive cities in 
California and the United States, where high technology companies 
flourish alongside modern agriculture and manufacturing facilities.
  Born in 1939, his family moved to California in 1945. Phil earned a 
bachelor's degree from Sacramento State University and a law degree 
from the University of California, Boalt Hall, in Berkeley. He served 
in the California National Guard and as a civilian employee at 
McClellan Air Force Base.
  I have long admired Phil's contributions and service to his community 
and to his State. As he retires from the California Assembly with a 
record of achievement for his district and his State, I wish him 
continued success, especially with his art collection, and I extend my 
congratulations to him and his wife Marilyn.
