  ENHANCING FAIRNESS IN COMPENSATING OWNERS OF PATENTS USED BY UNITED 
                                 STATES

  Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the 
Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 632) to enhance fairness in compensating 
owners of patents used by the United States, with Senate amendments 
thereto, and concur in the Senate amendments.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The Clerk read the Senate amendments, as follows:

       Senate amendments: Page 2, line 8, strike out all after 
     ``States'.'' down to and including ``Acts.'' in line 13 and 
     insert ``Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, unless the 
     action has been pending for more than 10 years from the time 
     of filing to the time that the owner applies for such costs 
     and fees, reasonable and entire compensation shall not 
     include such costs and fees if the court finds that the 
     position of the United States was substantially justified or 
     that special circumstances make an award unjust.''
       Page 2, line 17, strike out ``January 1, 1995'' and insert 
     ``the date of the enactment of this Act''.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (during the reading). Without objection, the 
Senate amendments are considered as read and printed in the Record.
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the initial request of 
the gentleman from New York?
  There was no objection.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.

                          ____________________
