                      TRIBUTE TO AVIS GREEN TUCKER

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. IKE SKELTON

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, it is with sorrow that I inform the House 
of the death of Mrs. Avis Green Tucker, a distinguished Missouri 
citizen from Warrensburg, in the 4th Congressional District. Avis Green 
Tucker was not just my own long-time friend. She was one of Missouri's 
most highly respected newspaper publishers. She was a willing volunteer 
frequently called to important service by Missouri governors from both 
political parties. And she was a particularly inspiring role model 
among women leaders in our state.
  Avis and her husband, William Tucker, bought the Daily Star-Journal 
in 1947 and the paper stayed in the Tucker family for some 60 years, 
until its sale in 2007 to another distinguished Missouri newspaper 
family, the Bradleys of St. Joseph. Bill Tucker was serving as 
publisher in Warrensburg when he died of a heart attack in 1966. Avis 
took over as one of the few female daily newspaper publishers in the 
Midwest. She once said: ``I decided I was going to run this paper. I 
was going to try. I told everyone that I had more nerve than ability, 
which was the truth.'' But that was a typically reticent and humble 
statement from a

woman whose abilities were quite remarkable. Those abilities were 
widely recognized. In 1982, Avis became the first female president of 
the Missouri Press Association. That was just one of many ``firsts'' 
achieved by Avis Tucker, including serving as the first female 
president of the Missouri Associated Dailies organization, and becoming 
the first woman inducted into the Missouri Press Association Hall of 
Fame. She received the National Newspaper Association's McKinney Award, 
given to a woman who ``exhibited distinguished service to the community 
press.'' Just this past May, Avis became chair emeritus of the Missouri 
Press Association's Foundation Board, which she helped found and fund.
  She served not only as one of the state's rare female publishers, but 
in other leadership roles, particularly at our mutual alma mater, the 
University of Missouri. Mizzou's world-famous School of Journalism 
honored her with its Honor Medal in 1976. And in 1972, Avis became the 
first woman president of the University of Missouri's governing body, 
the Board of Curators. Her service as a curator has particular 
significance for me, since she was appointed to succeed her late 
husband as a curator upon his death. And Bill Tucker had been appointed 
to succeed my father, Isaac Newton Skelton III, upon his passing. In 
Missouri, one of the highest honors one can achieve is being named to 
help guide our land-grant state university, and this is an honor that 
has been treasured by both the Skelton and Tucker families.
  Avis Green Tucker will be remembered fondly by all who had the 
privilege of knowing her, including me. When she passed away at age 95 
on Friday, December 17th, 2010, she had lived a life that was 
exemplary. Her leadership was superb, her newspaper's readers and her 
community were well-served, and her place in Missouri journalism and 
public service is secure. Avis is survived by two nephews, Bob and 
Richard Green. I know members of the Congress will join me in paying 
tribute to the life, achievements and service of Avis Green Tucker, and 
in extending our condolences to her family and friends.
