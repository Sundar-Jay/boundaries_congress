               SAYING GOOD-BYE TO FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES

  (Mr. YARMUTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to say good-bye to some dear 
friends and colleagues. Four years ago, we arrived in this body, over 
40 of us, and we were called the majority makers because we had brought 
control of the House back to the Democrats. And now 18 of us are 
leaving for other endeavors. They have become more than colleagues and 
Members and great Americans, they have become part of a family.
  So I salute Baron Hill, Paul Hodes, John Hall, Carol Shea-Porter, 
Patrick Murphy, Ron Klein, Steve Kagen, Joe Sestak, Brad Ellsworth, 
Charlie Wilson, Chris Carney, Zack Space, Harry Mitchell, Mike Arcuri, 
Phil Hare, Bill Foster, Travis Childers, and Ciro Rodriguez. Although 
their faces will not appear in this body, at least on a frequent basis, 
the memories and the legacy that they have left will live on forever.
