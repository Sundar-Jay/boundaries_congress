  Mr. BROWN of OHIO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Brown amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; the bill, as 
amended, be read a third time and passed; the motions to reconsider be 
laid on the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any 
statements related to the bill be printed in the Record.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The amendment (No. 4924) was agreed to.
  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of 
Amendments.'')
  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a 
third time. The bill (H.R. 6517), as amended, was read the third time, 
and passed.
  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, in light of the generosity of the 
Republican leader and the assistant majority leader, 30 seconds.
  This agreement among Senator Casey, Senator Kyl, Senator McCain, and 
me will make a difference in restoring TAA, trade adjustment, and the 
health care tax credit, in addition to the Andean trade references and 
some other things that will make a difference.
  It will make a difference. It will mean that 50,000 people don't lose 
their health insurance the first of the year. I am appreciative of all 
who have been part of this.
  I will yield to Senator Casey for a moment. I thank the leaders for 
their generosity.
  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Brown, as well as Senators 
McCain and Kyl, for entering into this agreement. It extends this for a 
short period of time. It is important as it relates to manufacturing 
jobs in a State such as ours, where we have lost over 200,000 in less 
than a decade. I am sure that number corresponds to other States' 
losses. We are grateful for this extension. We have more work to do.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.
