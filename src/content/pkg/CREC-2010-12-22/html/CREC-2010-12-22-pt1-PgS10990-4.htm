                         FIRST RESPONDERS BILL

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senate was able to 
reach an agreement to provide health care for the men and women who 
helped in the rescue, recovery, and cleanup efforts after the 9/11 
attacks.
  In the years since then, as we all know, a number of these brave 
Americans have become ill. Today represents an important step in making 
sure they receive the care they need as a result of their extraordinary 
service. No one has ever questioned whether to provide the care they 
need. The only question was how to do so.
  Like many of my colleagues, I have been concerned that attempts to 
rush this legislation at the end of the session would prevent us from 
ensuring the bill was written in a responsible fashion. I still believe 
this cause and this legislation would have benefited from a bipartisan 
committee process. But thanks to the hard work of a number of 
Senators--most notably Senators Coburn and Enzi and their staffs--we 
have come a long way in improving this bill.
  We have made sure that more compensation will go to victims than 
trial lawyers. It has got improved oversight, so money isn't siphoned 
away from the people who need it. We put time limits on the legislation 
so Congress can come back and review what has worked and where 
improvements can be made. So this is a much better product.
  Some have tried to portray this debate as a debate between those who 
support 9/11 workers and those who don't. This is a gross distortion of 
the facts. There was never any doubt about supporting the first 
responders. It was about doing it right.
  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from 
Hawaii has to make a quick departure, so I ask he be recognized after 
this quick request.
