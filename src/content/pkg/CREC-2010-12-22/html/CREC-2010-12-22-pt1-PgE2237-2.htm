                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. GERLACH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Stephen ``Steve'' 
J. Ross for his more than 40 years of faithful service to communities 
in southeastern Pennsylvania.
   During the last two years, the residents, businesses and all 
taxpayers of West Pikeland Township, Chester County have benefitted 
immeasurably from Steve's breadth of experience and tremendous 
leadership as Township Manager.
   Prior to taking the helm in West Pikeland, Steve had a distinguished 
career spanning nearly 30 years as Township Manager in West Whiteland 
Township, Chester County. He has been an outstanding steward of public 
finances and played a critical role in helping a region experiencing 
phenomenal growth protect its open space and natural resources, enhance 
its recreational opportunities, and improve its infrastructure.
   The West Pikeland Township Board of Supervisors will recognize Steve 
for his exemplary efforts on December 28, 2010.
   Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me today in honoring 
Stephen J. Ross for his extraordinary commitment to public service and 
dedication to making southeastern Pennsylvania a great place to live, 
work and raise a family.

                          ____________________
