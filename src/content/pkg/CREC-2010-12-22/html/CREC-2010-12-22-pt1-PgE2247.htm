                       HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 21, 2010

  Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of 
S. 2925, the Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking Deterrence and Victims 
Support Act.
  It is fitting that as one of the last acts of this Congress which has 
done so much to aid the most vulnerable in our society, we are 
considering legislation that would protect children from sex 
traffickers.
  Tragically, this heinous crime is becoming more common with as many 
as 100,000 young people trafficked every year within our borders.
  To address this heartbreaking trend, the legislation before us 
authorizes a comprehensive grant program to identify and assist victims 
and strengthens the National Crime Information Center, NCIC, database 
that enables law enforcement officials to track missing and exploited 
children.
  These commonsense steps will make a real difference in the lives of 
thousands of kids who have experienced unimaginable ordeals.
  S. 2925 mirrors House legislation authored by my colleagues 
Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney and Congressman Chris Smith. I applaud 
their hard work on behalf of these forgotten young people and commend 
them for their leadership in devising smart solutions to fight the 
scourge of child prostitution in America.
  The Domestic Minor Sex Trafficking Deterrence and Victims Support Act 
will significantly augment our efforts to help children traumatized by 
the worst kind of criminal act and I urge its swift passage.
  In an era characterized by bitter partisanship, it is exceedingly 
gratifying for me that members of this body can still reach across the 
aisle and stand together in defense of children caught in perilous 
circumstances.
  It is my sincere hope that next year we can come together in the same 
spirit of bipartisanship to help young people apprehended along our 
southern border.

                          ____________________
