                     CELEBRATING THE 111TH CONGRESS

  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, today does end the 111th Congress, which 
Norm Ornstein, one of the most respected historians and observers of 
public events, said was the most historic and productive Congress since 
1965.
  I am proud to have been a Member of this 111th Congress that gave us 
health care, which this country yearned for for over 100 years; that 
saved us from the precipice of economic decline with the stimulus act 
that has done much good for this country and saved us from a great 
depression; that gave us the Lilly Ledbetter law for women who were 
discriminated against in the workplace; that gave us Don't Ask, Don't 
Tell; that also gave us credit card reform, student loan reform, 
additional Pell Grants, tobacco regulations, and food safety 
legislation.
  This 111th Congress did more than any Congress since Lyndon Johnson's 
in 1965 to 1966, and did it under the effective, passionate, honest, 
and remarkable leadership of the most historic Speaker in the House of 
Representatives' history, the Honorable Nancy Pelosi, who I am proud to 
have voted for and served with.
