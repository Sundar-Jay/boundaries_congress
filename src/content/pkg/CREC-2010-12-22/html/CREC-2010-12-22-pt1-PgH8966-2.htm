     revocation, except that there shall be no appeal of an

     do not result in the employee or applicant unlawfully 
     disclosing information specifically required by Executive 
     order to be kept classified in the interest of national 
     defense or the conduct of foreign affairs.
       ``(2) Rule of construction.--Consistent with the protection 
     of sources and methods, nothing in paragraph (1) shall be 
     construed to authorize the withholding of information from 
     the Congress or the taking of any personnel action against an 
     employee who discloses information to the Congress.
       ``(3) Disclosures.--
       ``(A) In general.--A disclosure shall not be excluded from 
     paragraph (1) because--
       ``(i) the disclosure was made to a person, including a 
     supervisor, who participated in an activity that the employee 
     reasonably believed to be covered by paragraph (1)(A)(ii);
       ``(ii) the disclosure revealed information that had been 
     previously disclosed;

       ``(v) the disclosure was made while the employee was off 
     duty; or
       ``(vi) of the amount of time which has passed since the 
     occurrence of the events described in the disclosure.
       ``(B) Reprisals.--If a disclosure is made during the normal 
     course of duties of an employee, the disclosure shall not be 
     excluded from paragraph (1) if any employee who has authority 
     to take, direct others to take, recommend, or approve any 
     personnel action with respect to the employee making the 
     disclosure, took, failed to take, or threatened to take or 
     fail to take a personnel action with respect to that employee 
     in reprisal for the disclosure.
       ``(4) Agency adjudication.--
       ``(A) Remedial procedure.--An employee or former employee 
     who believes that he or she has been subjected to a reprisal 
     prohibited by paragraph (1) of this subsection may, within 90 
     days after the issuance of notice of such decision, appeal 
     that decision within the agency of that employee or former 
     employee through proceedings authorized by paragraph (7) of 
     subsection (a), except that there shall be no appeal of an 
     agency's suspension of a security clearance or access 
     determination for purposes of conducting an investigation, if 
     that suspension lasts not longer than 1 year (or a longer 
     period in accordance with a certification made under 
     subsection (b)(7)).

     authorized under subparagraph (A), it is determined that the 
     adverse security clearance or access determination violated 
     paragraph (1) of this subsection, the agency shall take 
     specific corrective action to return the employee or former 
     employee, as nearly as practicable and reasonable, to the 
     position such employee or former employee would have held had 
     the violation not occurred. Such corrective action shall 
     include reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable 
     costs incurred, and may include back pay and related 
     benefits, travel expenses, and compensatory damages not to 
     exceed $300,000.

[[Page H8972]]

       ``(C) Contributing factor.--In determining whether the 
     adverse security clearance or access determination violated 
     paragraph (1) of this subsection, the agency shall find that 
     paragraph (1) of this subsection was violated if a disclosure 
     described in paragraph (1) was a contributing factor in the 
     adverse security clearance or access determination taken 
     against the individual, unless the agency demonstrates by a 
     preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the 
     same action in the absence of such disclosure, giving the 
     utmost deference to the agency's assessment of the particular 
     threat to the national security interests of the United 
     States in the instant matter.
       ``(5) Appellate review of security clearance access 
     determinations by director of national intelligence.--
       ``(A) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term `Board' 
     means the appellate review board established under section 
     204 of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.
       ``(B) Appeal.--Within 60 days after receiving notice of an 
     adverse final agency determination under a proceeding under 
     paragraph (4), an employee or former employee may appeal that 
     determination to the Board.
       ``(C) Policies and procedures.--The Board, in consultation 
     with the Attorney General, Director of National Intelligence, 
     and the Secretary of Defense, shall develop and implement 
     policies and procedures for adjudicating the appeals 
     authorized by subparagraph (B). The Director of National 
     Intelligence and Secretary of Defense shall jointly approve 
     any rules, regulations, or guidance issued by the Board 
     concerning the procedures for the use or handling of 
     classified information.
       ``(D) Review.--The Board's review shall be on the complete 
     agency record, which shall be made available to the Board. 
     The Board may not hear witnesses or admit additional 
     evidence. Any portions of the record that were submitted ex 
     parte during the agency proceedings shall be submitted ex 
     parte to the Board.
       ``(E) Further fact-finding or improper denial.--If the 
     Board concludes that further fact-finding is necessary or 
     finds that the agency improperly denied the employee or 
     former employee the opportunity to present evidence that, if 
     admitted, would have a substantial likelihood of altering the 
     outcome, the Board shall remand the matter to the agency from 
     which it originated for additional proceedings in accordance 
     with the rules of procedure issued by the Board.
       ``(F) De novo determination.--The Board shall make a de 
     novo determination, based on the entire record and under the 
     standards specified in paragraph (4), of whether the employee 
     or former employee received an adverse security clearance or 
     access determination in violation of paragraph (1). In 
     considering the record, the Board may weigh the evidence, 
     judge the credibility of witnesses, and determine 
     controverted questions of fact. In doing so, the Board may 
     consider the prior fact-finder's opportunity to see and hear 
     the witnesses.
       ``(G) Adverse security clearance or access determination.--
     If the Board finds that the adverse security clearance or 
     access determination violated paragraph (1), it shall then 
     separately determine whether reinstating the security 
     clearance or access determination is clearly consistent with 
     the interests of national security, with any doubt resolved 
     in favor of national security, under Executive Order 12968 
     (60 Fed. Reg. 40245; relating to access to classified 
     information) or any successor thereto (including any 
     adjudicative guidelines promulgated under such orders) or any 
     subsequent Executive order, regulation, or policy concerning 
     access to classified information.
       ``(H) Remedies.--
       ``(i) Corrective action.--If the Board finds that the 
     adverse security clearance or access determination violated 
     paragraph (1), it shall order the agency head to take 
     specific corrective action to return the employee or former 
     employee, as nearly as practicable and reasonable, to the 
     position such employee or former employee would have held had 
     the violation not occurred. Such corrective action shall 
     include reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable 
     costs incurred, and may include back pay and related 
     benefits, travel expenses, and compensatory damages not to 
     exceed $300,000. The Board may recommend, but may not order, 
     reinstatement or hiring of a former employee. The Board may 
     order that the former employee be treated as though the 
     employee were transferring from the most recent position held 
     when seeking other positions within the executive branch. Any 
     corrective action shall not include the reinstating of any 
     security clearance or access determination. The agency head 
     shall take the actions so ordered within 90 days, unless the 
     Director of National Intelligence, the Secretary of Energy, 
     or the Secretary of Defense, in the case of any component of 
     the Department of Defense, determines that doing so would 
     endanger national security.
       ``(ii) Recommended action.--If the Board finds that 
     reinstating the employee or former employee's security 
     clearance or access determination is clearly consistent with 
     the interests of national security, it shall recommend such 
     action to the head of the entity selected under subsection 
     (b) and the head of the affected agency.
       ``(I) Congressional notification.--
       ``(i) Orders.--Consistent with the protection of sources 
     and methods, at the time the Board issues an order, the 
     Chairperson of the Board shall notify--

     Affairs of the Senate;
       ``(II) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate;
       ``(III) the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of 
     the House of Representatives;

     Representatives that have jurisdiction over the employing 
     agency, including in the case of a final order or decision of 
     the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Geospatial-
     Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency, or the 
     National Reconnaissance Office, the Committee on Armed 
     Services of the Senate and the Committee on Armed Services of 
     the House of Representatives.

       ``(ii) Recommendations.--If the agency head and the head of 
     the entity selected under subsection (b) do not follow the 
     Board's recommendation to reinstate a clearance, the head of 
     the entity selected under subsection (b) shall notify the 
     committees described in subclauses (I) through (V) of clause 
     (i).
       ``(6) Judicial review.--Nothing in this section shall be 
     construed to permit or require judicial review of any--
       ``(A) agency action under this section; or
       ``(B) action of the appellate review board established 
     under section 204 of the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement 
     Act of 2010.

     shall be construed to permit, authorize, or require a private 
     cause of action to challenge the merits of a security 
     clearance determination.''.
       (c) Access Determination Defined.--Section 3001(a) of the 
     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (50 
     U.S.C. 435b(a)) is amended by adding at the end the

     relating to classified national security information), or any 
     successor thereto, and Executive Order 10865 (25 Fed. Reg.

       (A) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``(b)''; and
       (B) by adding at the end the following:

     establishment, the head of the establishment shall return the 
     complaint or information to the Inspector General with that 
     determination and the Inspector General shall make the 
     transmission to the Director of National Intelligence. In

     Enhancement Review Act of 2010 regarding all transmissions 
     under this paragraph.'';

                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Van Hollen

  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I have an amenment at the desk.
  The Clerk read as follows:

       Amendment offered by Mr. Van Hollen:
       Page 36, strike line 20 and all that follows through page 
     68, line 23.
       Page 69, line 1, strike ``TITLE III'' and insert ``TITLE 
     II''.
       Page 69, line 3, strike ``SEC. 301.'' and insert ``SEC. 
     201.''.
       Page 69, line 7, strike ``SEC. 302.'' and insert ``SEC. 
     202.''.
  The amendment was agreed to.
  Mr. TOWNS. Madam Speaker, as Chairman of the Committee on Oversight 
and Government Reform, I rise in strong support of S. 372, the 
Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.
  I want to congratulate Senator Akaka and the other Senate sponsors of 
S. 372 for their efforts. I commend the persistence they have 
demonstrated in championing this good government bill.
  I'm proud to be an original co-sponsor of H.R. 1507, the bipartisan 
companion bill to S. 372. H.R. 1507 was introduced by Representative 
Van Hollen last year. I want to thank Mr. Van Hollen and all the co-
sponsors of H.R. 1507, including Mr. Platts of Pennsylvania. They have 
demonstrated exceptional leadership in support of government 
whistleblowers.
  This legislation is long overdue. Different versions of this 
legislation have been introduced in every Congress for the last 12 
years.
  The Oversight Committee has long-recognized that enhancing 
whistleblower protections will help the Congress to fulfill its role in 
bringing about more honest, accountable, and effective government for 
the American people.
  Federal employees are often the first to witness abuses or misconduct 
that presents a risk to the taxpayers. Providing strong protections for 
those who disclose misconduct helps to promote a more accountable and 
transparent federal bureaucracy. This legislation provides a means of 
securing justice to those individuals who are punished for doing the 
right thing.
  During Committee hearings on this legislation, we heard from 
courageous government workers who risked their careers to promote the 
common good.
  Mr. Franz Gayl, a civilian employee in the Marine Corps, testified 
about the retaliation he faced. Mr. Gayl blew the whistle on 
significant delays in the acquisition process--delays that were costing 
Marines their lives in Iraq. Defense Secretary Gates ultimately agreed 
with the proposals put forth by Mr. Gayl on troop protection. However, 
Mr. Gayl remains at risk of losing his job. This bill will help Mr. 
Gayl, and many others like him.
  We have heard from dozens of whistleblowers who support this bill. I 
want to acknowledge one in particular. Mr. Robert Maclean is a former 
Federal Air Marshal who was fired after disclosing a threat to aviation 
safety. Mr. MacLean's case has been lingering for far too long under 
the current system. He has championed this bill because he knows first 
hand that the current system is broken. I thank him for his efforts on 
behalf of the country.
  As many of you remember, the House of Representatives passed similar 
legislation by a 331-94 vote in the 110th Congress. The House also 
unanimously passed whistleblower protections as an amendment to the 
Recovery Act at the beginning of this Congress. Unfortunately, that 
amendment was stripped out in conference with the Senate.
  After a long process in the Senate, this bill comes before the House 
for a third time. I am pleased the House-Senate compromise we are 
considering includes important provisions from the House bill. For the 
first time, the bill will allow Federal workers the right to a jury 
trial in Federal Court under some circumstances.
  The legislation we're considering today is a good compromise. 
However, I'm disappointed that the Senate did not agree to extend 
similar

[[Page H8974]]

whistleblower protections to government contractors.
  I am also disappointed that we could not come to an agreement with 
the Republican side on extending protections to employees in the 
Intelligence Community.
  In spite of the bill's imperfections and limitations, I 
wholeheartedly endorse this agreement. This is a good government bill 
that will help to curb waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal 
Government.
  I encourage the Senate to act quickly on our modifications, and send 
the bill to President Obama without further delay.
  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 372, 
the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.
  I would like to thank Senator Akaka, and the other Senators who have 
worked so hard to advance this bill to provide stronger whistleblower 
protections. This effort has spanned over a decade, and I am hopeful 
that it will come to a successful conclusion today.
  Whistleblower protections are a critical component in bringing about 
a more effective and accountable government. As the Congress considers 
proposals to address the deficit, our work needs to be pursued on 
numerous fronts. Whistleblowers risk their careers to challenge abuses, 
and gross waste of government resources. They deserve to be protected 
so they can carry out their important work conscientiously, and with 
the taxpayers best interests in mind.
  By providing new rights, remedies, and protections for government 
whistleblowers, this bill takes an important step toward curbing waste, 
fraud, and abuse. This will aid our deficit reduction efforts.
  S. 372, as passed by the Senate, reflects a bipartisan compromise 
between the original Senate bill and H.R. 1507, legislation I sponsored 
with Representatives Platts, Chairman Towns, and Representatives Waxman 
and Braley.
  The Oversight and Government Reform Committee has reported similar 
legislation, on a bipartisan basis, in each of the last two Congresses. 
The House of Representatives has twice passed similar bills, once in 
2007 with 331 votes and again as a bipartisan amendment to the Recovery 
Act.
  Unfortunately, H.R. 1507 was stripped out of the Recovery Act during 
the conference with the Senate.
  Over the course of the last two years, we have worked with the Obama 
administration and the Senate to work out a compromise that retains the 
core protections for federal workers and national security personnel 
that were included in bills passed by the House in 2007 and 2009.
  The bill before us today restores Congress' intent to protect an 
employee for any lawful disclosure of waste, fraud, abuse, or 
illegality. S. 372 addresses several court decisions that have limited 
the protections Congress made available to federal employees under the 
1989 Whistleblower Protection Act. These decisions quite frankly have 
gutted the protections available to federal employees.
  This bill provides the opportunity for whistleblower cases before the 
Merit Systems Protection Board to be reviewed by all of the Federal 
Circuits. Moreover it provides an opportunity for certain cases to 
receive jury trials. This expansion of opportunity for judicial review 
is critical. While I would have preferred broader criteria for review 
and that this enhanced judicial review be made permanent, I have 
reluctantly accepted the changes made by the Senate to narrow the 
circumstances under which cases can receive judicial review and to 
sunset these provisions in 5 years.
  This legislation also protects federal employees for disclosures 
related to distortions of government science and extends to employees 
of the Transportation Security Administration.
  S. 372 is a good bipartisan, bicameral compromise, and should be sent 
to the President without further delay. This bill, as passed by the 
Senate, included important protections for national security employees. 
These provisions had been included with significant input from the 
national security community and passed the Senate by unanimous consent. 
Unfortunately, jurisdictional disputes within the House have prompted 
us to remove these protections in the interest of passing the rest of 
these essential reforms. I regret the loss of these provisions and look 
forward to working with incoming Chairman Issa to advance these 
protections for national security employees in the next Congress.
  I want to thank my cosponsor and partner on this bill, Todd Platts 
for his assistance and strong leadership. I also want to thank Chairman 
Towns and Ranking Member Issa for their strong support throughout this 
Congress to advance this important legislation.
  I'll close by simply noting that this legislation is long overdue. 
Without whistleblowers and the unfiltered information that government 
insiders can provide, the oversight functions vested in Congress would 
be seriously compromised, as would our efforts to rein in the federal 
budget deficit. I encourage all Members to support this important bill.
  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of 
the S. 372, the ``Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010.''
  S. 372 amends the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA) and strengthens 
the rights and protections of Federal employees who come forward to 
disclose government waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. The House 
has passed similar legislation on a bipartisan basis in 2007 (H.R. 985) 
and 2009, as an amendment to the Recovery Act.
  I am a staunch advocate for protecting Federal employees from 
retaliation when they come forward to disclose waste, fraud, abuse and 
mismanagement. Whistleblowers are among the most patriotic and 
conscientious Federal employees. They take great risks to make certain 
that our Federal Government is functioning properly and effectively for 
all taxpayers. They serve as indispensable guardians for the efficient 
use of taxpayer funds. This is an especially valuable service during 
this vital period of national economic recovery.
  Unhindered exposure of waste, fraud and abuse identifies expensive 
break-downs in the functioning of our Federal Government while also 
preserving the Federal funds we require to effectively serve our 
citizens. In some instances, conscientious whistleblowers protect 
others from harm and actually save lives. So, we must protect these 
attentive Federal employees who expose systemic lapses and protect the 
integrity and proper functioning of our Federal Government.
  Discrimination and retaliation against Federal employees contravenes 
Federal law, puts the public at risk, and costs taxpayers millions of 
dollars. Retaliation and discrimination also breed a myriad of other 
costs that cannot be quantified in the toll exacted on the health, 
morale, and well-being of Federal employees who are entrusted to 
protect and serve our Nation. Federal managers and supervisors who 
engage in discriminatory conduct must be judiciously and expeditiously 
disciplined.
  S. 372, the ``Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act of 2010'' 
enhances the protection of Federal employees. It restores Congress' 
intent to protect an employee who makes any lawful disclosure of waste, 
fraud, abuse, or illegality. S. 372 addresses court decisions that have 
limited the protections Congress made available to Federal employees 
under the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act.
  This legislation will improve the administration of justice. It will 
allow non-intelligence whistleblowers to bring their cases before a 
jury under certain circumstances. The current administrative system 
will be further strengthened by allowing a limited number of more 
complex whistleblower cases to be considered in Federal court by 
juries. The bill also will allow whistleblower appeals to be heard by 
the regional Federal appellate courts.
  This bill further expands upon the protections for Federal employees 
in additional necessary and meaningful ways. It extends whistleblower 
protections to employees at the Transportation Security Administration. 
It clarifies that whistleblowers may disclose evidence of censorship of 
scientific or technical information under the same standards that apply 
to disclosures of other kinds of waste, fraud, and abuse. It enhances 
protections for employees facing retaliation after refusing to violate 
the law or participating in an Inspector General investigation.
  This legislation will codify and strengthen rules that preempt 
agencies from issuing regulations or directives that interfere with 
whistleblower protections. I am also pleased to say, that for the first 
time, S. 327 will make compensatory damage awards available to 
whistleblowers. This is a key component in ensuring a whistleblower is 
made whole after suffering retaliation. This bill will also make it 
easier for the Office of Special Counsel to discipline agency managers 
who are found to retaliate against employees.
  It is my fervent expectation that this legislation will meaningfully 
advance our national integrity by deterring Federal managers from 
violating the civil rights and civil liberties of their fellow Federal 
workers, especially whistleblowers.
  I ask my colleagues to stand with me today and vote in favor of S. 
327.
  The bill was ordered to be read a third time, was read the third 
time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
