                      TRIBUTE TO RETIRING SENATORS


                               Evan Bayh

  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, time and time I have come to the floor to 
give a few remarks about Senators who are retiring and leaving the 
Senate. They all contributed in their unique way one way or the other 
to the Senate. Now I find myself with two left about whom I want to 
comment on their way out of the Senate.
  In the closing days of the 111th Congress, we are saying goodbye to a 
number of colleagues, including a veteran Member, much respected on 
both sides of the aisle. I speak of the Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh.
  I listened with great interest to Senator Bayh's eloquent farewell 
remarks earlier this month. The Senator was also kind enough to have 
them typed up and sent to our offices.
  Looking back on his 12 years in this body, he spoke about times of 
national crisis, including after the 9/11 attacks and during the 
financial meltdown of 2008. He talked of a time when Senators acted not 
as Democrats and Republicans but as patriots concerned of doing one 
thing: doing what is right for the American people. He said that these 
times of bipartisan action were with the Senate at its very best.
  For more than two decades, Senator Bayh has embodied everything that 
is

[[Page S11014]]

good about this body: a passion for public service, a sincere desire to 
reach out across the aisle, a great talent for forging coalitions and 
bringing people together, and a willingness to work long hours to 
accomplish important things.
  As we all know, Evan is what we might call a ``son of the Senate.'' 
He is enormously proud to have been elected to the same seat his father 
Senator Birch Bayh held for two terms and who remains a great friend of 
mine after all these years. He has followed in his father's footsteps 
in fighting for quality public schools, student loans, retirement 
security, and giving every American access to quality, affordable 
health care.
  In addition, he has been a leader in strengthening our Armed Forces 
and national security. I know that Senator Bayh takes special pride in 
leading the charge to provide our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan with 
much improved mine-resistant armored vehicles.
  As he leaves this body, Senator Bayh is still a young man with many 
chapters yet to be written in his life and career. For more than a 
quarter century, he has devoted himself to public service, first as 
Indiana's secretary of state, then as an enormously successful two-term 
Governor of Indiana, and, of course, since 1999 as a Senator.
  I have always been a big admirer of one of his signature 
accomplishments as Governor, which was passing legislation creating the 
21st Century Scholars Program. It is a wonderful program. Thanks to his 
initiative, every child in Indiana who is eligible for the free lunch 
program in public schools, who graduates from high school, and signs a 
pledge not to experiment with illegal drugs is entitled--get this--is 
entitled to a full tuition scholarship at the Indiana public university 
of his or her choice.
  Over the years, many thousands of Hoosiers of modest means have been 
able to attend college thanks to this remarkable law. That is what I 
call a great--I hope my friend does not mind me saying this--populist, 
progressive accomplishment. It speaks volumes about Evan Bayh's 
priorities and values throughout his 24 years in public service.
  During his two terms in this body, Senator Bayh has always faithfully 
served the people of Indiana and the people of the United States. I 
hope and expect he will pursue new avenues of public service after he 
leaves the Senate because our country sorely needs public servants of 
his caliber, intelligence, and accomplishments.
  I will miss the day-to-day friendships, the counsels, the 
interchanges we have had together in the Senate. I wish Evan and his 
wonderful wife Susan and their twin sons, Beau and Nick, the very best 
in the years ahead.


                             Arlen Specter

  Mr. President, I also wish to pay a farewell to another long-time 
legislative partner, and that is Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.
  I listened with great interest to Senator Specter's farewell remarks 
yesterday. He decried the decline of bipartisan cooperation in this 
body. As he put it:

       In some quarters, compromising has become a dirty word. 
     Politics is no longer the art of the possible when senators 
     are intransigent in their positions.

  During his remarkable 30 years in the Senate--he is the longest 
serving U.S. Senator in Pennsylvania's history--Arlen Specter has been 
admired for his fierce independence and for his willingness to cross 
party lines in order to accomplish big and important things for this 
country.
  Nowhere has this been more vividly on display than in the Labor, 
Health and Human Services Subcommittee of the Committee on 
Appropriations, on which Senator Specter and I are senior members. 
Before last year, when he returned to his roots as a Democrat, Arlen 
was the senior Republican and I was the senior Democrat on that 
subcommittee. Since 1989, as the majority in the Senate has gone back 
and forth between the two parties, we alternated as either chair or 
ranking member. But the transitions were seamless as we passed the 
gavel back and forth because Arlen and I forged an unshakable 
partnership.
  That partnership has been grounded in our shared commitment to 
finding cures for diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease to 
Alzheimer's and in our determination to maintain the National 
Institutes of Health as the jewel in the crown of international 
biomedical research. Our proudest accomplishment was our collaboration 
in doubling funding for the National Institutes of Health over a 5-year 
period, between 1998 and 2003. Last year, we again collaborated in 
securing $10 billion for the National Institutes of Health in the 
Recovery Act, although I must be honest and give the senior Senator 
from Pennsylvania the lion's share of credit for that accomplishment.
  I say without fear of contradiction that there has been no Member of 
Congress in the Senate or the House who has championed NIH as 
passionately and relentlessly and successfully as Senator Arlen 
Specter. Indeed, at times, in my role when I was chair of the 
Appropriations Labor, Health and Human Services Subcommittee, I have 
had to remind Arlen that there were other programs besides the NIH in 
our appropriations bill. In fairness, Senator Specter has also fought 
passionately to increase funding for public schools and to increase 
access to higher education, but there is no question that his great 
passion, his living legacy has been the National Institutes of Health 
and biomedical research. Today, the prowess and excellence of the 
National Institutes of Health is truly a living legacy to Senator 
Specter, and we have countless new medical cures and therapies because 
of Senator Specter's long and determined advocacy.
  Mr. President, I will miss my good friend and colleague from 
Pennsylvania, who has been a tremendous ally for many years. As he 
departs the Senate, he can take enormous pride in 30 years of truly 
distinguished service to the people of Pennsylvania and the United 
States. I wish Arlen and his wonderful wife Joan the very best in the 
years ahead.
  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and wish the occupant of 
the chair the best of the holiday season and a happy New Year. We will 
see you when we come back to the next Congress.
  I yield the floor.


                             Russ Feingold

  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my 
colleague and friend, Senator Russ Feingold.
  I have had the privilege of serving with Senator Feingold since he 
and I were both elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992. Over the past 18 
years, Senator Feingold has been an independent, passionate advocate 
for his State and his Nation. He was consistently a voice of conscience 
in the Senate, never afraid to ask the tough questions or to speak out 
against policies he believed were flawed.
  Over the years, Senator Feingold has distinguished himself as a 
leading expert on foreign and domestic policy who is willing to work 
across party lines to get the job done, whether it was reforming our 
Nation's campaign finance laws or working to end the atrocities 
committed by Ugandan rebels in the Lord's Resistance Army.
  I have had the privilege of sitting next to Senator Feingold in the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I have been proud to witness how, 
as the chair of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, he has led the 
Senate in recognizing and addressing many of Africa's unique issues and 
challenges. He was one of the first to speak out about the genocide in 
the Darfur region of Sudan. He has advocated for an end to the illicit 
mining of conflict minerals that support armed conflict in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo. And he has placed a spotlight on drug 
trafficking in West Africa, the threat of terrorism in Somalia, and the 
affects of global diseases such as malaria on African populations.
  Senator Feingold is a great reformer, taking the lead on campaign 
finance reform and on the Army Corps of Engineers.
  Senator Feingold has been such an incredible champion for human 
rights, and I am personally grateful for his work on women's rights, 
particularly his commitment to combating violence against women and 
girls worldwide.
  His passion, expertise, and dedication to these issues are unmatched 
and will be greatly missed.


                              Byron Dorgan

  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and 
friend, Senator Byron Dorgan.

[[Page S11015]]

  It has been an honor to serve with Senator Dorgan since he and I were 
both elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992.
  Nobody can get to the heart of a matter like Byron Dorgan. He has an 
unbelievable ability to lay out both challenges and solutions with 
clarity. He is a populist in the best sense of the word, and our 
country is better for his service in this Chamber.
  Senator Dorgan has always been a champion for the people of North 
Dakota, for our workers, and for rural Americans. For the last 18 
years, he has devoted himself to supporting family farms and promoting 
economic development across our country.
  Senator Dorgan has been a leader in the Senate in fighting to 
preserve jobs here in America and end tax breaks for companies that 
ship jobs overseas. No one has fought harder for the middle class.
  He used his position as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water 
Appropriations Subcommittee to advance important projects and create 
jobs, and I will always be thankful for his support in our efforts to 
protect California communities from flooding.
  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Dorgan 
has worked tirelessly to improve health care and economic opportunities 
for Indians. He has helped streamline the bureaucracy of the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs. He developed the landmark Tribal Law and Order Act, 
which helped give tribal justice officials the tools they need to 
protect their communities. I was so proud to cosponsor that bill and so 
pleased that President Obama signed it into law this year.
  He leaves a distinguished legacy and will be greatly missed by all of 
us.


                             Arlen Specter

  Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our friend and colleague, 
Senator Arlen Specter.
  Senator Specter has spent five terms serving the people of 
Pennsylvania here in Congress--longer than any other Pennsylvania 
Senator. All of us can take a lesson from his dedication and passion 
for fighting for the people of his State.
  A member of the Judiciary Committee since he joined Congress, Senator 
Specter built on his background as an attorney and eventually assumed 
the chairmanship of the committee. His expertise on constitutional 
issues has long been admired by his colleagues.
  Senator Specter was always a leader on issues relating to our 
National Institutes of Health, championing investment in scientific 
research to find lifesaving treatments and cures for a range of 
diseases. He understood firsthand how crucial such funding could be, 
having fought his own battle with cancer. When we passed the Recovery 
Act, it was Senator Specter who ensured that it would include 
significant investments in NIH. His efforts to help double NIH's budget 
have contributed to advances in treatments for Parkinson's, cancer, 
heart disease and Alzheimer's.
  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to work closely with Senator 
Specter on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. He has 
been a thoughtful and constructive member committed to addressing 
climate change and fighting for clean energy jobs.
  Senator Specter loves this institution, and he will be missed. He has 
left his mark, and I thank him for his decades of dedicated public 
service.


                               Chris Dodd

  Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues to join me today in 
recognize the extraordinary leadership and service of our friend, 
Senator Chris Dodd.
  Senator Dodd has served the Senate with grace, intelligence, and 
compassion for three decades. The son of a U.S. Senator, he loves this 
institution and has done everything he could to preserve its best 
traditions. Senator Dodd has always encouraged all of us to keep our 
disputes and differences from becoming personal.
  He leaves behind an incredible legacy of accomplishments that have 
touched the lives of virtually all Americans.
  I will never forget the leadership role he played in helping to pass 
health care reform last spring--a fitting tribute to his close friend 
Ted Kennedy, whose vision finally became a reality.
  As chairman of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, 
Senator Dodd led the effort to pass Wall Street reform legislation. He 
was a forceful advocate for holding banks accountable for their 
actions, and we could not have enacted this landmark accomplishment 
without his leadership.
  Senator Dodd has devoted his career in public service to making life 
better for our families and our children. I saw this firsthand as we 
worked together to ensure that our children have safe places to go 
after school. As chairman of the Senate Afterschool Caucus and the 
founder of the Senate's first Children's Caucus, Senator Dodd worked 
hard to expand the Head Start program, to reform the No Child Left 
Behind Act, and to make college more affordable for students and their 
families.
  In the face of Presidential vetoes, Senator Dodd dedicated 8 years to 
enacting the Family and Medical Leave Act, which has helped ensure that 
50 million Americans can care for their loved ones during difficult 
times without fearing for their jobs.
  Senator Dodd is a fluent Spanish speaker and has been the Senate's 
leading expert on Latin America. I have been proud to work closely with 
him to reform our Nation's drug certification laws.
  His own years of service in the U.S. Peace Corps inspired Senator 
Dodd to support and promote President Kennedy's call to service in this 
Chamber. In the Senate, he has helped expand and modernize the Peace 
Corps and worked to provide loan forgiveness to Peace Corps volunteers, 
teachers, and others who devote themselves to public service.
  All of us in the Senate will greatly miss Senator Dodd.


                            Blanche Lincoln

  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague and 
friend, Senator Blanche Lincoln.
  Senator Lincoln has spent her entire career serving the people of 
Arkansas, and she has been a passionate and effective leader for her 
State.
  She has been an inspiration to so many women. Senator Lincoln made 
history as the first woman to chair the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry Committee, and I will never forget how Senator Lincoln led 
by example, showing us you could be a young mom in the Senate, 
dedicated to your children, while also being a strong advocate for your 
State.
  She has been a leader in the Senate on child nutrition and has worked 
tirelessly to pass important legislation, including the Healthy, 
Hunger-Free Kids Act that was just signed into law by President Obama. 
The measure will help combat the nationwide epidemic of obesity by 
making sure our schoolchildren have access to healthy, nutritious 
meals.
  As a cofounder of the Senate Hunger Caucus, Senator Lincoln has 
played a crucial role in shedding light on a problem that affects so 
many, both at home and abroad.
  Senator Lincoln was never afraid to stand up for what she believed 
in. She showed her tenacity in fighting for greater transparency and 
accountability in derivatives markets during the debate over Wall 
Street reform.
  She has been a fighter for her State and her legislative 
accomplishments will have a profound impact on the lives of so many 
children and communities across our country.
  I want to thank her for her years of friendship and for her dedicated 
service here in the Senate. We will all miss her.


                            christopher dodd

  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in 
paying tribute to Senator Christopher Dodd, a longtime public servant 
and fellow New Englander whose dedication to advancing the common good 
with common sense, independence, and a genuine desire to solve problems 
has served both his constituents of Connecticut as well as his country 
for 36 years. With trust, comity, and a love for the institution of the 
Senate, Senator Dodd has for more than three decades contributed to 
creating a legislative environment where at crucial moments in the life 
of the greatest deliberative body in human history, the upper Chamber 
was able to work its will to the lasting benefit of the American 
people, and we could not be more grateful.
  Indisputably, and as countless colleagues have noted, public service 
has

[[Page S11016]]

always been at the center of Senator Dodd's life--literally, as he is 
the first son of Connecticut to follow his father into the U.S. Senate, 
and remarkably, for the past 30 years, Senator Dodd has had the 
privilege of sitting at the same desk used by his father, Senator 
Thomas Dodd, during his 12 years in the Senate. Chris Dodd's 
longstanding devotion to the public arena has spanned from his three 
terms in the U.S. House--the last of which I was privileged to serve 
with him--to his five terms in the U.S. Senate. And Senator Dodd earned 
the lasting gratitude of his constituents and admiration of his 
colleagues with his stalwart leadership in foreign policy, his vigorous 
and unwavering battle to enact the Family and Medical Leave Act, and 
his longstanding stewardship of our Nation's most precious resource--
our children.
  And on this last point, like many in this Chamber, I cannot begin to 
justly measure the depth and breadth of the legacy Senator Dodd has 
forged in safeguarding the most vulnerable in our society. Consider for 
example the issue of child care. Time and again, Senator Dodd has 
battled to ensure both the quality of child care in America as well as 
the funding for it, and as he keenly and presciently understood, in 
this matter, our Nation could not have one without the other.
  An undeniable focus of Senator Dodd's, child care has unquestionably 
become one of his crowning achievements and legislative hallmarks--and 
nowhere was his imprint on the issue greater than during the landmark 
welfare reform debate in 1995 and 1996. I well recall working with 
Senator Dodd as we made the case that there was indeed a pivotal link 
between viable welfare reform and child care--that for families 
struggling to reduce their dependency on welfare--especially single 
parents--unaffordable, unavailable, or unreliable childcare was the 
chief barrier to steady employment, and one that could and should be 
lessened, if not eliminated.
  That is why I was pleased to join with Senator Dodd on our amendment 
to add $6 billion in child care funding to welfare reform legislation, 
especially at a time when that funding was very much imperiled. 
Arriving at a consensus required leaders from both parties to jettison 
their competing and hardened ideologies in favor not just of making 
dependable childcare more accessible, but in support of welfare reform 
that would effectively move more Americans from welfare to work. 
Senator Dodd, as colleague after colleague can attest, heeded his own 
beliefs that ``you don't begin the debate with bipartisanship--you 
arrive there. And you can do so only when determined partisans create 
consensus.'' Because he never lost sight of the primacy of working 
across the aisle, we were victorious in including the funding we sought 
in the Senate-passed bill.
  That bipartisan effort to garner concrete results designed to make a 
difference in the daily lives of the American people was not an 
isolated instance. Senator Dodd and I collaborated on legislation to 
support campus-based child care for low income mothers trying to 
further their education, and we authored legislation to help states 
improve training in early childhood development to make improved child 
care more available to more people. With innate New England pragmatism 
and a desire for solutions, Senator Dodd saw impediments to success 
that were impinging upon a segment of our society that if only reduced 
or removed would aid not only families striving to improve their lives, 
but a Nation seeking to help stem the tide of dependency.
  Ultimately, what occupied Senator Dodd's agenda was the active 
pursuit of an even better America. We didn't always agree on what that 
path should be, but where we did find common ground, as in child care, 
we cultivated it. That dynamic was at work recently as Senator Dodd and 
I, as the former chair and current ranking member of the Senate 
Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, collaborated to help 
the economic engines and catalysts of our economy--America's small 
businesses, the very enterprises that will lead us out of recession and 
into recovery.
  During the consideration of what would become The Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, I truly appreciated Senator 
Dodd's perseverance in including a provision I authored allowing small 
businesses to raise concerns over burdensome regulations through small 
business review panels within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
Senator Dodd and I also worked to reduce the regulatory compliance 
burden for small banks by striking a provision of the bill which would 
have required these lending institutions to report their transactions 
to the Federal Government down to each individual ATM.

  This kind of rapport was emblematic of how Senator Dodd viewed good 
governance. In his valedictory address on the floor of the Senate, he 
observed that ``in my three decades here, I cannot recall a single 
Senate colleague with whom I could not work.'' Indeed, Senator Dodd 
always saw adversaries as potential allies--and foes as unwon friends.
  From the days of his youth, Senator Dodd grew up steeped in the 
tradition of and respect for the Senate--and an abiding admiration for 
this venerable institution that runs at its own pace and by its own 
rules. Instead of exhibiting rancor and a burning desire to win at all 
costs, Senator Dodd sought instead to build relationships and by doing 
so, strengthened his capacity for legislating and contributed mightily 
to the advancement of this esteemed Chamber. Legendary American poet 
and son of Maine, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, once wrote that ``if you 
would hit the mark, you must aim a little above it.'' Chris Dodd has 
always aimed high--and met his target--leaving a legacy of enormous 
accomplishment to his constituents in Connecticut and to the American 
people.
  In closing, let me just extend my personal appreciation to his wife 
Jackie and their daughters Grace and Christina for sharing Christopher 
Dodd with us


                               judd gregg

  Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in paying a well-
earned tribute to Senator Judd Gregg, a fellow New Englander and one of 
New Hampshire's much-admired icons of public service over the last 
three decades.
  Senator Gregg has been immersed in public service his entire life, 
beginning with his father's election as Governor of New Hampshire in 
1952 when Judd was only 5 years old. And through the years, he has 
amassed a record of leadership at every level of government that is 
truly remarkable. It comes as no surprise that Judd is the first public 
servant from the Granite State ever to realize the political trifecta 
of being elected to the three offices of Congressman, Governor, and 
Senator. Serving others goes to the very core of Judd Gregg's persona 
and DNA. It always has and always will.
  And let me just say, at every step along the way, it has been a 
privilege for me to witness Senator Gregg's impressive trajectory in 
public life firsthand. In fact, it was during Judd's years in the U.S. 
House of Representatives, where my husband, Jock McKernan, and I first 
got to know him as well as his wonderful wife Kathy. And that 
friendship grew further during Judd's time as Governor as both he and 
Jock were chief executives of their respective States during the same 
period.
  And having served with Judd for nearly his entire tenure in the 
Senate, I have been proud to work side by side with an individual whose 
organizing principle behind public service has always been driven by 
common sense, pragmatism, and the imperative to forge solutions across 
the aisle. Time and again, Judd has sought to bridge the political 
divide to garner results, whether by tackling our Nation's fiscal 
challenges, promoting land conservation, or most notably, co-authoring 
the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 with the late Senator Edward 
Kennedy.
  Indeed, Senator Gregg's rigorous intellect, financial acumen, and 
budgetary expertise have earned him the respect and admiration of his 
Senate colleagues from both parties and made him one of the Nation's 
most well-regarded, leading champions of fiscal discipline and 
accountability, and one of the most knowledgeable voices and 
authorities in addressing our Nation's deficits and debt.
  In fact, the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility 
and Reform, created by President Obama, is modeled after legislation 
first introduced by Senator Gregg, the former chair and current ranking 
member of

[[Page S11017]]

the Senate Budget Committee, and the current Chair, Senator Kent Conrad 
of North Dakota--both of whom are commissioners. What a fitting coda 
for one of this generation's stalwart guardians of our Nation's budget.
  And Senator Gregg's service could not be more emblematic of his 
overall approach to public service which has always hewed to principle 
with a genuine desire to forge solutions across the aisle. No wonder 
that earlier this month, Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus wrote 
that in ``both parties, there are too few Greggs, and too many of them 
. . . are leaving public office.'' I couldn't agree more!
  Just as Senator Gregg has rightly earned national acclaim as a fiscal 
steward and sentinel on behalf of the American taxpayer, the heart of 
his leadership has always remained with his beloved Granite State as 
well as our region of New England. I well recall the ironclad 
solidarity our two delegations have shared, particularly in defending 
against efforts to close the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Through each of 
the five Base Realignment and Closure, BRAC, rounds from 1988 through 
2005, we have left no stone unturned to champion the cause of the U.S. 
Navy's oldest and best shipyard--and to ensure that the BRAC Commission 
recognized the legendary work-ethic and world-class craftsmanship of a 
workforce that is second to none.
  Former Senate majority and minority leader, Senator Robert Dole, with 
whom Senator Gregg and I both served, once observed ``as long as there 
are only 3 to 4 people on the floor, the country is in good hands. It's 
only when you have 50 to 60 in the Senate that you want to be 
concerned.'' When Judd Gregg was on the floor the people of New 
Hampshire and, indeed, the Nation knew that our country was in 
tremendously capable and conscientious hands, and we could not be more 
grateful!
  In thanking Senator Gregg for his immeasurable contributions to this 
storied chamber, I know I join all of my colleagues in wishing him and 
his beloved wife Kathy, Godspeed, as they embark on the well-earned, 
next chapter of their lives.


                            GEORGE VOINOVICH

  Mr. President, I rise today to join in paying tribute to my longtime 
good friend and colleague, Senator George Voinovich of Ohio. In the 
U.S. Constitution, our Founding Fathers made it clear that there is no 
one clear path, background, or station in life that leads to serving in 
the U.S. Senate. There is an age requirement and a residency 
stipulation and no more. That said, if ever there were a job 
description for being a Senator, it occurs to me that a model example 
we should consider is that of Senator George Voinovich.
  Senator Voinovich's depth and breadth of wisdom, knowledge, and 
experience about making government work at all levels which he has 
harnessed throughout his sterling, four decade trajectory in public 
life recall what James Madison wrote in The Federalist, No. 62 in 
advocating for a higher age requirement for Senators than members of 
the House. Madison postulated that the deliberative disposition of the 
Senate required a ``greater extent of information and stability of 
character.'' I don't think it's too far of a stretch to say that James 
Madison must have had a Senator like George Voinovich in mind when 
making this case.
  Before Senator Voinovich even stepped onto the floor of the U.S. 
Senate he had already been Governor of Ohio, mayor of Cleveland, 
Lieutenant Governor of Ohio, county commissioner, auditor, and a member 
of the Ohio House of Representatives. With a wealth of insights to draw 
upon through many years of public service, George has always been a 
force with whom to be reckoned, someone whose viewpoint and counsel are 
sought, and whose example is worthy of being emulated many, many times 
over.
  My husband Jock, former Governor of Maine, and I first got to know 
Senator Voinovich and his wonderful wife of nearly 50 years, Janet, in 
the 1990s when Jock and George were both serving as Governor of their 
respective States and active in the National Governors Association. In 
Ohio's State capital of Columbus, George was building on his enormous 
success as Mayor of Cleveland where he inherited a stagnant economy, 
rejuvenated it through fiscal discipline and acumen and public-private 
partnerships, and forged a three-time All-America City winner in the 
1980s.
  George made similar, remarkable strides as Governor, where, under his 
watch, unemployment hit a 25-year low and 600,000 new jobs were 
created. Many accolades were bestowed upon George for his 
accomplishments at the State level, and they were all well- earned to 
say the least. In fact, he is still the only individual to serve as 
both chairman of the National Governors Association and president of 
the National League of Cities.
  There are many laudatory characterizations of Senator Voinovich that 
have already been expressed by my colleagues, and there are certainly 
some that come to mind, especially as a highly regarded U.S. Senator--
thoughtful, independent, principled, rigorous, courageous, and 
pragmatic. With George, you always knew where he stood on an issue and 
frankly where you stood with him. In an institution whose very 
foundation is built upon trust and forging relationships, George was 
someone you could count on time and time again.
  And to say that Senator Voinovich was a workhorse in this Chamber 
from day one is an understatement to be sure. His word is as good as 
gold--and as they say, you can take it to the bank. If he shook your 
hand on a deal, that was all that was required. The fact is, they don't 
make enough legislators or public servants like Senator Voinovich 
anymore. Like the Ohio State flag, the only one in the U.S. not shaped 
like a rectangle, George has been and will always be . . . one of a 
kind.
  I can tell this Chamber from firsthand experience, there was no one 
you would rather be in the trenches with in the Senate, especially when 
the stakes were high, than George. I will never forget--and I know 
George won't either--how we stood side by side as stewards of fiscal 
accountability during the tax cut debate in 2003. We were certain that 
reducing taxes and hewing to our budget concerns did not have to be 
mutually exclusive--that we could champion billions in tax cuts without 
jeopardizing our Nation's fiscal future by proposing offsets.
  The fact is, once Senator Voinovich determined to chart a particular 
course, he was not easily dissuaded--and rightfully earned a reputation 
for being tireless and relentless in his pursuits. His moral fiber, 
character, and integrity can be traced back to being the grandson of 
Serbian and Slovenian immigrants who crossed the Atlantic from Croatia 
at the turn of the century. As a proud Greek-American whose parents 
emigrated from Greece, I see in George the same stalwart work ethic so 
prevalent in my own roots and culture growing up in Maine.
  Senator Voinovich once said that ``doing a good job at running your 
government is the best politics,'' and that ``people just want you to 
get the job done.'' But for him, these weren't platitudes worthy of a 
government class, they have been truly organizing tenets that have 
shaped a distinguished 40-year tenure of serving the common good for 
Ohioans and the Nation.
  In the Senate, when others refused to reach across the aisle, Senator 
Voinovich understood that doing so made the system work, especially for 
those who elected us in the first place--the American people. When 
political scorekeeping and posturing have ruled the day, Senator 
Voinovich has managed to transcend the short-term efforts to jockey for 
position in favor of immersing himself in the substance of the policy 
with the intention of championing it or opposing it based on the facts, 
not political sway or the temper of the times. The legacy of George's 
clear voice of reason and brave vision in this body will extend into 
the next Congress and for Congresses to come. My only regret is that 
the Senate could use more George Voinovichs, not fewer.
  For all of his dedicated public service to his Buckeye State and this 
great land, undoubtedly, George will tell you that his greatest 
achievement is his marriage of 39 years to his beloved wife Janet, 
their three children, and eight grandchildren. I wish them all the 
best.


                            BLANCHE LINCOLN

  Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in paying tribute 
to Senator

[[Page S11018]]

Blanche Lincoln, one of the finest public servants I have had the 
pleasure not only to know, but to work with during our one term in the 
U.S. House together and her distinguished 11-year tenure in the Senate.
  A seventh-generation Arkansan, Senator Lincoln has always been firmly 
rooted in the values and the people of her great State. Their concerns 
have been her battles--their hopes have been her cause. Her State's 
bedrock values of family and faith have always been at the center of 
Blanche's life as a daughter, wife, mother, church member, and 
Congresswoman. She has always been as authentic as they come, warm as 
she is determined, gracious as she is resolute, and Arkansans wouldn't 
have it any other way.
  Blanche understood the inherent human element and dimensions of 
public service as well as anyone--that you pursued elective office not 
for personal gain, but in order to make a difference on behalf of 
others, especially for rural America. For Senator Lincoln, the phrase 
``The People Rule'' was more than her great State's cherished motto, it 
was an organizing principle and a clarion call which inspired her to 
serve.
  The youngest woman ever elected to the Senate and the first woman to 
serve as chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry 
Committee in its 184 years of existence, Senator Lincoln was making her 
mark from the first time she entered the august Chamber of the U.S. 
Senate. From the beginning, she stood upon the mightiest of shoulders, 
Arkansas's legendary Hattie Caraway, the first woman to win a statewide 
U.S. Senate race in Arkansas and the first woman to chair a U.S. Senate 
committee. How fitting it is that Senator Lincoln paid homage to her 
predecessor by using the same desk on the Senate floor that Senator 
Caraway used 60 years ago.
  I was privileged to work with Senator Lincoln for her entire time and 
mine as well on the venerable Senate Finance Committee where we were 
kindred spirits and compatriots from day one. In fact, our very first 
year on the committee we forged an historic, bipartisan alliance to 
make the childcare tax credit refundable for the first time ever, and 
the bond we formed during that undertaking only increased as we 
shepherded other dependent care issues through the years to help give 
families the resources to be stronger and find empowerment through 
work.
  Senator Lincoln and I, as the former chair and current ranking member 
of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, also 
joined forces on the Small Business Health Options Program, or the so-
called SHOP Act, to increase the number of insurers available to small 
businesses, so that these engines of our economy could benefit from 
greater competition. On issue after issue, I valued our collaborations, 
our mutual respect, and our common desire to achieve results and 
jettison the partisan bickering that impedes not only progress, but our 
obligation to do the will of the American people.
  Central to that collegiality has been our great tradition as women in 
the Senate of getting together once a month for dinner, and there is no 
question that Senator Lincoln's absence will be keenly felt. 
Appropriately, we described one of our dinners in the prologue to the 
book we labored on together in the 1990s, entitled ``Nine and 
Counting,'' to demonstrate the progress women had made in the upper 
Chamber. In it, Blanche is described as ``ebullient, energetic, and 
unpretentious--she is the picture of representative government.'' That 
is the Blanche Lincoln I know and the Blanche Lincoln I will miss.
  Like all of the women I have had the honor of serving with on both 
sides of the aisle, Blanche has been a bulwark against the all-too-
prevalent dynamic confronting the American political system--the 
ongoing erosion of bipartisanship, cooperation, and civility. She has 
helped bridge the partisan divide as much as anyone, and has acted time 
and again as a catalyst for cultivating common ground in order to 
advance the common good.
  The Arkansas State flag contains diamond shapes in its center as 
Arkansas is the only State where diamonds have been discovered. It has 
been the pinnacle of generosity for Arkansans to share one of their 
gems here in our Nation's Capital in the form of Senator Blanche 
Lincoln. We also thank her husband Dr. Steve Lincoln and their twin 
boys, Reece and Bennett, for doing the same.


                               evan bayh

  Mr. President, today I wish to join in paying a well-deserved tribute 
to my good friend and colleague, Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana. When it 
comes to reflecting on his tremendous experience and influence in this 
esteemed Chamber for the past 12 years, the simple truth is that our 
Nation and our government would be exponentially improved by having 
more like Evan Bayh serving in the United States Senate.
  A proud native of the Hoosier State--as well as a son of the 
legendary former Senator Birch Bayh--Senator Evan Bayh is a man of 
unwavering principle and conviction, who has been a stalwart legislator 
and unparalleled guardian of the first branch of government over his 
two terms serving the people of Indiana. Born in Shirkieville, educated 
at Indiana University, and a graduate of the University of Virginia Law 
School, Senator Bayh went on to clerk for a Federal court judge, 
eventually being elected as Indiana's secretary of state in 1986.
  Yet even before Senator Bayh stepped onto the floor of the United 
States Senate he had already served two terms as Governor of Indiana, 
beginning in 1988. In fact, that is where I first got to know him as 
both he and my husband, John McKernan, were chief executives of their 
respective States during much of that same period. The depth and 
breadth of Evan's insight and experience that was forged during his 
years as Governor would become truly indispensable as a United States 
Senator.
  Having served side-by-side with Evan for his entire tenure--including 
this Congress as fellow members of the Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship, where I serve as ranking member--I can attest 
firsthand to his intellect, independence, and integrity that will truly 
leave an indelible mark on this institution and this Nation. Evan has 
also been a next-door neighbor in my hallway in the Russell Senate 
Building. So I will profoundly miss seeing him not only in the Senate, 
but also simply walking down the hall outside my office.
  Throughout his storied career, Senator Bayh has reached across the 
aisle to find consensus on legislation to advance both Indiana and the 
Nation. From focusing on job growth and fighting for America's small 
businesses to national security and trade, Evan has been a leader whose 
achievements truly leave an indelible mark.
  Indeed, I was pleased to work with Senator Bayh on legislation in 
2007 that linked the troop surge in Iraq to meaningful consequences and 
telegraphed to the Iraqi Government that they had to meet the 
benchmarks they themselves had set. And just this year, Senator Bayh 
and I worked with a number of our colleagues in the Senate to crack 
down on unfair currency manipulations in China--ensuring our government 
is equipped with the tools to adequately address inequities and provide 
consequences for countries that violate our global trade rules by 
holding down the value of their currency.
  Earlier, in 2001, Senator Bayh and I introduced a bipartisan 
resolution in the Senate, as well as a subsequent amendment on the 
Senate floor, to ensure that decisions on the use of the budget 
surpluses that were projected at the time--whether for tax cuts or for 
spending--should be linked to the surpluses actually realized. Simply 
put, the idea, based on a proposal first outlined by then-Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, was that long-term tax and spending 
plans should include a kind of ``trigger'' mechanism that limits the 
surplus-reducing impact of those proposals if budget targets weren't 
achieved, such as specific levels of debt reduction.
  We believed such a trigger would provide a strong incentive for 
Congress to act responsibly in the future allocation of any surpluses, 
while also serving as a ``backstop'' should estimates prove too 
optimistic. As I said at the time, we should have been utilizing those 
surpluses as a window of opportunity to address our most pressing 
domestic issues, such as strengthening Social

[[Page S11019]]

Security and Medicare. And frankly, how prescient that trigger 
mechanism proved to be--just imagine where we might be today if it had 
passed nearly 10 years ago.
  In multiple facets, Senator Bayh has been an esteemed colleague and 
friend in our mutual cause to revitalize and advance the political 
center--in our concerted effort to answer the challenges facing our 
Nation by producing results, not rancor, and accord instead of 
acrimony. His departure not only diminishes the Senate, but is also a 
loss for the country--because we require more voices seeking to craft 
compromise and consensus to forge solutions, not fewer.
  I have long argued that the legislative stalemate and political 
quagmire that has gripped much of this Congress has been to the 
detriment of our country--especially at a time when our Nation faces a 
number of challenges, not the least of which is a struggling economy 
that has caused far too many Americans to lose their jobs and their 
paychecks. In February, Senator Bayh wrote an op-ed for the New York 
Times in which he said, ``The most ideologically devoted elements in 
both parties must accept that not every compromise is a sign of 
betrayal or an indication of moral lassitude. When too many of our 
citizens take an all-or-nothing approach, we should not be surprised 
when nothing is the result.'' I could not agree more--and Senator 
Bayh's advocacy of moderation and reason in this body will truly be 
missed.
  President Theodore Roosevelt once said that ``far and away the best 
prize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth 
doing.'' Well, if ever there were a Senator who epitomizes that 
sentiment, it is Senator Bayh as he has given his very best to make an 
already great Nation greater still. I wish Evan, his wife, Susan, and 
their two sons, Beau and Nick, all the best for the future.


                               judd gregg

  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it has been a great pleasure and honor to 
serve in this body with Judd Gregg. He and his wife Kathy have enriched 
our lives with their friendship and their contributions to the work and 
responsibilities of the U.S. Senate.
  Judd's leadership on the Budget and Appropriations Committees have 
been especially important and worthy of high praise.
  His sense of humor has helped make our service in the Senate an 
enjoyable experience.
  I wish for him and his family all the best in the years ahead.


                             SAM BROWNBACK

  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the service of my 
friend and colleague Sam Brownback. Sam was elected to the House of 
Representatives in 1994 during the Republican Revolution and was 
subsequently elected to the Senate 2 years later when former majority 
leader Bob Dole made his bid for the White House.
  It has been both a privilege and a pleasure serving alongside Sam 
during these past 16 years. All of us who seek public service want to 
make a difference, and most certainly, Sam Brownback has done that. In 
these endeavors I have enjoyed working with Sam in achieving some note 
worthy accomplishments for our State of Kansas. As I reflect upon our 
mutual efforts, it is hard to figure out who was driving the stage and 
who was riding shotgun. Simply put, it has been a team effort, and I 
have been both humbled and proud to work with my colleague who has 
provided unique and respected leadership. Sam's record speaks for 
itself: bringing the Big Red One back home to Fort Riley, KS, where it 
started and now belongs; bringing the National Bio- and Agro-Defense 
Facility, NBAF, to Manhattan, KS; ensuring fair treatment of the 
general aviation industry in FAA bills; and working together to rebuild 
Greensburg, KS, after 95 percent of the community was literally blown 
away by an EF5 tornado.
  But beyond our work together on State specific issues, it is Sam's 
Federal legislative initiatives that I think will have the longest 
impact on the Senate and the lives of so many people, pot only within 
Kansas and our Nation but, indeed, around the world.
  Since the late 1970s, the term ``compassionate conservative'' has 
been tossed around quite a bit to describe a philosophy--a philosophy 
that states by applying conservative ideals, our government can best 
improve the welfare of our society. I think many of my colleagues would 
agree that if anyone in public service over the past 30 years embodies 
this philosophy, it would be Sam Brownback.
  What is unique about Sam and his approach to politics these past 16 
years is that his ideas went beyond words and rhetoric. The Sam 
Brownback approach was simple but effective. He applied his beliefs to 
action, reflected by the many legislative accomplishments he championed 
during his tenure in the Senate.
  Sam is a big believer in forgiveness and second chances. How to put 
that belief into action? Sam introduced a bill that really shows his 
heart for those in society who many times are not given an opportunity 
to make amends: the Second Chance Act.
  Signed into law during the Bush administration, this act created a 
grant program for State and local governments to fund job training and 
family mentoring programs to help reintegrate past offenders as they 
are granted release back into society.
  But Sam's legislative victories did not focus solely on domestic 
issues. Sam has a great love for the continent of Africa.
  Serving on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he traveled to 
Africa on multiple occasions to gain a better understanding of how he 
could help provide relief to those most vulnerable. His experiences led 
him to champion the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006. 
Enacted that same year, this law created sanctions against individuals 
and groups responsible for the terrible crime of genocide in Darfur, 
while establishing measures to protect civilians and humanitarian 
efforts within the borders of Sudan.
  The more Sam did, the more he felt called to do, and no one did more 
for the protection of victims of human trafficking than Sam. In 2000, 
he helped enact the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. This law 
created criminal punishments for individuals caught in the United 
States operating as traffickers. It established an annual reporting 
mechanism to help track individuals engaged in sex trafficking and 
created a new immigration status for victims of sex trafficking.

  Lastly, I believe Sam's prominence during his time in the Senate had 
a great deal to do with his willingness to work across party lines on 
issues where he could seek and find common passion and ground.
  The legislative item I think will leave the largest impact on many of 
us in the Senate is the bill upon which he worked tirelessly with the 
late Senator Ted Kennedy.
  Signed into law by President Bush, the Prenatally and Postnatally 
Diagnosed Conditions Act provides those families with children 
diagnosed with Down Syndrome the support services and networks they 
need to help them deal with the unique challenges they face. Put 
another way, what better legislation to help protect the lives of those 
in our Nation uniquely challenged but who deserve every right to the 
same opportunities we all enjoy everyday.
  I could easily and proudly recount many more of Sam's achievements 
during his time in the Senate, but I would do so in danger of Sam 
saying ``enough'' and giving me ``the hook.'' I have often said that 
the high road of humility is not often bothered by heavy traffic in 
Washington, but in Sam Brownback, we have indeed enjoyed the friendship 
of a humble man.
  In closing, I leave my colleagues with one of Senator Brownback's 
favorite quotes that I think sums up the man that Sam is and the love 
he has for all people, regardless of their nationality or place in 
society.
  Sam likes to say: `` I am pro-life and whole-life. Applying this 
belief to the child in the womb and to the child in Darfur. It includes 
the man in prison and the woman in poverty. It does not fail to cherish 
the child with Down syndrome or stand for the inherent dignity of the 
immigrant.''
  Sam, I remember the first campaign rally we attended together. The 
featured guest speaker, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, introduced me as 
one who made significant changes in the House of Representatives and 
then introduced Sam as: ``One who not only wants to change things, but 
to make the right changes.''

[[Page S11020]]

  Sam, you have done just that and it has been an honor to serve with 
you over these past 16 years. I thank you for your courtesy, 
cooperation, leadership, example and your friendship and support. As 
you head west, my friend, to lead our beloved State of Kansas, I look 
forward to continued cooperation and success. The people of Kansas are 
in good hands. God bless.


                             arlen specter

  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate in 2007 as a 
Senator-elect, one of the first things I did was to go see Senator 
Specter. He asked me at the time to go to lunch, and from the moment 
that I arrived in the Senate, he made it very clear to me, not only did 
the people of Pennsylvania expect, but he expected as well that we work 
together. From the beginning of his service here in the United States 
Senate, way back when he was elected in 1980, all the way up to the 
present moment, he has been a Senator who has focused on building 
bipartisan relationships and, of course, focusing on Pennsylvania 
priorities.
  I have been honored to have worked with him on so many Pennsylvania 
priorities, whether it was veterans or workers, whether it was dairy 
farmers or the economy of Pennsylvania, or whether it was our soldiers, 
or our children, or our families. He has been a champion for our state, 
and he has shown younger Senators the way to work together in the 
interest of our state and our country. That bipartisanship wasn't just 
a sentiment. He is a legislator who sought compromise that led to 
results in a Senate often divided by partisanship.
  His record is long, so I will only highlight a few areas.
  He helped to lead the effort to dramatically increase funding for the 
National Institutes of Health, that great generator of discoveries that 
cure diseases and create jobs and hope for people often without hope 
because of a disease or a malady of one kind or another.
  His experience working on a farm as a boy, Kansas not in 
Pennsylvania, helped him to understand and work on problems affecting 
Pennsylvania agriculture and farm families.
  He stood up for Pennsylvania industry and workers against subsidized 
or dumped products that hurt Pennsylvania's steel industry.
  He fought to bring Federal funding back to Pennsylvania to create 
jobs, build infrastructure and invest in local communities.
  No Senator in the history of the Commonwealth has served longer than 
Senator Specter. In fact, the Senator that he outdistanced in a sense, 
in terms of service, was only elected by the people twice after several 
terms elected by the state legislature. Senator Specter was elected by 
the people of Pennsylvania five times, but it is the life in those 
Senate years, the contribution to our Commonwealth and our country in 
those 30 years that really matter. His impact will be felt for 
generations, not just decades, but for generations.
  There was a history book of our State that came out in the year 2002. 
It was a series of stories, essays and chapters on the history of 
Pennsylvania, and it is a fascinating review of the State's history. 
The foreword of that publication, that book, was written by Brent D. 
Glass, at the time the executive director of the Pennsylvania 
Historical Museum Commission. He wrote this in March 2002. It is a long 
foreword which I won't read, but he wrote in the early part of this 
foreword the following, ``One way to understand the meaning of 
Pennsylvania's past is to examine certain places around the state that 
are recognized for their significance to the entire nation.'' Then he 
lists and describes in detail significant places in Pennsylvania that 
have a connection to our history, whether it's the Liberty Bell or the 
battlefield at Gettysburg, whether it's the farms in our Amish 
communities or whether it's some other place of historic significance.
  I have no doubt whatsoever that if the same history were recounted 
about the people of Pennsylvania, the people who moved Pennsylvania 
forward, the people who in addition to moving our State forward had an 
impact on the Nation; if we had to make a list of Pennsylvanians who 
made such contributions; whether it would be William Penn, Benjamin 
Franklin, you can fill in the blanks from there, I have no doubt that 
that list would include Senator Arlen Specter, a son of Kansas who made 
Pennsylvania his home, a son of Kansas who fought every day for the 
people of Pennsylvania.
  So it is the work and the achievements and the passion and the 
results in those years in the Senate that will put him on a very short 
list of those who contributed so much to our Commonwealth that we love 
and to our country that we cherish.
  So for all that and for so many other reasons, I, as a resident of 
Pennsylvania and a citizen of the United States, but as a Senator, want 
to express my gratitude to Senator Arlen Specter for his 30 years of 
service, but especially for what those 30 years meant to the people of 
Pennsylvania. Thank you, Senator Specter.
  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to 
pay tribute to the 16 Senators who will be departing this body at the 
end of the year.
  I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to serve alongside each 
of these Senators as colleagues and as friends. All served their States 
with distinction and gave their constituents strong voices in the 
world's greatest deliberative body. Senators Evan Bayh, Robert Bennett, 
Kit Bond, Sam Brownback, Jim Bunning, Roland Burris, Chris Dodd, Byron 
Dorgan, Russ Feingold, Carte Goodwin, Judd Gregg, Ted Kaufman, George 
LeMieux, Blanche Lincoln, Arlen Specter, and George Voinovich each left 
an indelible mark on the Senate, and I wish them well as they take on 
new challenges and opportunities into the future.
  I would like to speak briefly about a few of the Senators I knew best 
and served with in committees to recognize their contributions and 
accomplishments and share my fond memories of them and the legacies 
they will leave behind.


                              Bob Bennett

  For nearly two decades, Senator Bob Bennett has honorably served the 
people of Utah.
  His career in the U.S. Senate has been marked by his commonsense 
solutions to many of the most pressing issues facing our country.
  Before serving in the Senate, Bob was a successful entrepreneur as 
the CEO of Franklin International Institute. Under Bennett's 
leadership, the business grew from 4 employees to more than 1,000 and 
was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
  Bob brought his past experiences running a successful company with 
him to the Senate. His business sense was certainly an asset that 
informed his decisions as a U.S. Senator and made him an effective 
advocate for businesses, large and small, who keep our economy strong. 
Being a former businessowner myself, I valued his pragmatic perspective 
and ability to get things done.
  As a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee and a member of 
the distinguished Joint Economic Committee, Bob has been a leader in 
many national economic policy decisions.
  In addition, while serving as the ranking republican on the Senate 
Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water, he has worked to 
address the critical funding needs our country faces on a wide range of 
energy and water related issues.
  I am proud to have served with Bob for so many years, and his 
leadership and kind manner will be sorely missed in the Senate.


                              Jim Bunning

  I wish Senator Jim Bunning well as he departs the Senate. Much of his 
legacy can be defined by his competitive spirit and strong work ethic. 
These attributes have been evident throughout his many successes in 
life, first in his career as a Hall of Fame baseball player and then 
later as a public servant, representing the people of Kentucky. Being 
an avid sports fan myself, I hold deep admiration for those who can 
play at the highest levels of competitive sports and later bring that 
drive to the Senate!
  Following his highly successful professional baseball career for 17 
years, Jim decided he wanted to give back to his community. In 1977, he 
ran for city council and then later ran for the Kentucky State Senate 
eventually becoming the Republican leader.
  In 1986, Jim was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for the 
4th

[[Page S11021]]

District of Kentucky, where he served for 12 years before being elected 
to the U.S. Senate in 1998.
  During Jim's tenure in Congress, he has established himself as an 
expert and defender of social security, fighting hard to protect social 
security for current and future generations.
  His hard work and devotion will be missed by the people of Kentucky, 
whom I know are grateful for his many years of service.


                                Kit Bond

  Kit Bond has a long and distinguished history of service to the 
people of Missouri. As one of the longest serving Members in the U.S. 
Senate and a former two-term Governor, his life's work has been 
dedicated to the State of Missouri.
  In the Senate, Kit has been a respected leader on many issues, such 
as national security, transportation, and global economic 
competiveness. While serving as the vice chairman on the Senate Select 
Intelligence Committee, he has worked hard to strengthen national 
security through supporting the U.S. military and reforming the 
Nation's intelligence community. And as the leader of the Senate 
National Guard Caucus, no one has done more to support the role of the 
National Guard in our defense.
  Kit and I have worked on many issues together during our time in the 
Senate. In particular, last year when Democratic lawmakers tried to 
push cap-and-trade bills through Congress, Kit and I released the 
report, ``Climate Change Legislation: A $3.6 Trillion Gas Tax.''
  Our joint report revealed how climate legislation would result in a 
massive new national gas tax on American families, farmers, workers and 
truckers--by increasing the price of gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.
  It has been my pleasure to serve with Senator Bond. His office has 
been next to mine for 12 years and it will not be the same without that 
familiar cigar aroma lingering in the second floor halls of Russell. 
Without a doubt, he will be missed by his colleagues in the Senate and 
his constituents in Missouri.


                             Sam Brownback

  While Senator Sam Brownback will certainly be missed by the Senate, 
the people of Kansas will continue to benefit from his leadership, as 
he serves as their newly-elected Governor.
  Prior to being elected to public office, Sam's professional 
experiences include working as a radio broadcaster, attorney, teacher, 
and administrator.
  From these varied professional experiences he brought with him a 
unique and dynamic perspective to the U.S. Senate.
  Through his leadership as the ranking member on the Joint Economic 
Committee, ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
Agriculture, and ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resource 
Subcommittee on Water and Power, Sam established himself as a leader on 
a wide range of issues.
  During his tenure in the Senate, he has supported aviation research 
and expanded global aviation markets. Through these efforts, he has 
effectively spurred economic growth and strengthened the U.S. military.
  Some of Sam's most distinguishing characteristics are his personal 
integrity and his commitment to his Catholic faith. These principles 
came through in much of what he did in the Senate. I will always 
appreciate his passion and his work to translate his beliefs into his 
actions as a U.S. Senator.
  I am confident Senator Brownback will continue to serve the people of 
Kansas with the same character and dedication in his new role as 
governor.


                              Chris Dodd 

  Senator Chris Dodd departs the Senate after nearly three decades 
faithfully representing the people of Connecticut.
  From his service in the Peace Corps, the U.S. Army National Guard and 
Reserves as well as his many years in the U.S. Senate, Senator Dodd's 
commitment to public service and love for his country have been evident 
throughout his life.
  Chris was a leader in the Senate, serving as the chairman of the 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, chairman of the Foreign 
Relations Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Peace Corps, and 
Narcotics, and chairman of its Children and Families Subcommittee.
  Although we had our differences on various policy issues, I always 
appreciated his willingness to put partisanship aside to reach 
consensus when possible in order to improve legislation. For instance, 
earlier this year when working on the financial reform bill, despite my 
public opposition to the legislation, Chris worked with me to 
incorporate my amendments in the final version of the bill. I 
ultimately voted against the bill, but I am grateful for the efforts he 
made to include my amendments.
  Today we bid him farewell after 29 years of tireless service in the 
U.S. Senate.


                              Byron Dorgan

  Today we say goodbye to Senator Byron Dorgan after 18 years in the 
Senate, serving the State of North Dakota.
  First elected to Congress in 1980, Dorgan has devoted his career to 
serving North Dakota and fighting for the interests of rural America.
  After serving six terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, Byron 
was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1992.
  I have had the pleasure to serve with Senator Dorgan on the Senate 
Commerce Committee. Last summer, we joined together with several of our 
colleagues in the Senate to introduce bipartisan legislation that 
reauthorized the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA.
  The legislation accelerated the modernization of the Nation's air 
traffic control, ATC system, addressed critical safety concerns in the 
national airspace system, NAS, and improved rural community access to 
air service.
  I appreciated Byron's willingness to champion good ideas put forward 
by members from either side of the aisle. By focusing on issues where 
consensus could be achieved, he helped to move the debate forward on 
important issues and solve problems.
  Senator Dorgan leaves the Senate with my best wishes and respect.


                               Judd Gregg

  As a leading voice for fiscal responsibility, Senator Judd Gregg will 
be deeply missed in the Senate.
  Throughout his long and distinguished career, with unparalleled 
commitment to fiscal discipline, Senator Gregg worked to address many 
pressing issues.
  Senator Gregg is a well known budget expert and national leader on 
the most critical issues facing our country in recent years, notably 
health care, economic issues, and financial regulation.
  His efforts to address the looming entitlement crisis, the rising 
cost of health care, and the inefficient and complex tax system are 
commendable and serve as an example to all elected officials.
  In the Senate, Senator Gregg has also focused his efforts on helping 
the U.S. maintain its position as the leading destination for capital 
and investment in the world.
  I appreciate the job Senator Gregg has done in his position as the 
former chairman and current ranking member of the Budget Committee.
  In 2006, Judd sponsored an amendment that strengthened border 
security by providing resources to integrate biometric databases as 
well as construction of new stations and check points and tactical 
infrastructure for immigration and customs enforcement.
  Unlike other similar proposals at the time, his amendment was offset 
and did not add to the deficit.
  I will miss working with him in this Chamber, and I will miss his 
friendship and support on the issues that matter most to America.
  In conclusion, the departing Senators' contributions, their dedicated 
service, and the issues they championed will be remembered long after 
their final days in the Senate.
  I believe I can speak for my fellow Senators when I say that we will 
all miss our departing friends.
  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, when the 111th Congress draws to a 
close, we will bid farewell to 16 colleagues who have collectively 
given more than 200 years of service to our Nation through their 
service in the Senate. These include seven of the Senate's most 
experienced Members. People like Chris Dodd and Arlen Specter who have 
each served five terms in the Senate. Kit Bond who has served

[[Page S11022]]

four terms and Bob Bennett, Byron Dorgan, Russ Feingold, and Judd 
Gregg, who have each served three terms in this Chamber.
  When the 112th Congress convenes in January, the ranks of women 
Senators will be reduced by one. In fact, the 112th Congress will be 
the first Congress in recent memory in which the total number of women 
Senators will actually decline. And with the departure of our 
colleague, Roland Burris, there will not be a single African-American 
Senator when the new Congress convenes.
  In January we will feel the loss of the great pitching ace, Jim 
Bunning, and Evan Bayh, both respected colleagues on the Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee. They are among six of my Energy Committee 
colleagues who are leaving the Senate this year.
  Judd Gregg, one of our Nation's foremost experts on the Federal 
budget leaves us at the end of the year. As this Senate comes to grips 
with the challenges of a rising deficit and economic stagnation we will 
miss his firm hand and thoughtful guidance. My neighbor in the Hart 
Senate Office Building, Arlen Specter, is one of the Senate's most 
independent voices and perhaps the best friend that the National 
Institutes of Health, and every American who benefits from its cutting 
edge research, has ever had on Capitol Hill. Bob Bennett, one of the 
most thoughtful among us, who draws wisdom from experience as an 
entrepreneur as well as in public service, will not be among us. I 
learned much from Senator Bennett during the period that he served as 
counselor to the Republican leader and I served as vice chair of the 
Senate Republican Conference.
  I would also like to acknowledge contributions of Kit Bond, one of 
the foremost experts on our Nation's transportation and infrastructure 
needs. I appreciate Senator Bond's interest in understanding the unique 
transportation and infrastructure challenges that we in Alaska, the 
largest State in our Union in terms of land mass and one of the 
youngest must contend with. Senator Bond, like all of us, wears many 
hats in this institution. He has also earned the undying respect of our 
Nation's citizen soldiers through his leadership of the Senate National 
Guard Caucus.
  One of Chris Dodd's legacies to the Nation is legislation to ensure 
that the unique needs of children are addressed in our Nation's 
response to catastrophic disasters. I was honored to partner with 
Senator Dodd in helping to pass this legislation.
  Russ Feingold may have earned his place in history for his work on 
campaign finance reform but I will also appreciate him for his efforts 
to ensure that members of the National Guard and Reserve do not fall 
through the cracks when they return home with battlefield injuries. 
Senator Feingold and I teamed on the Wounded Warrior Transition Act, a 
portion of which was included in the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2010. I will continue to pursue the remaining 
provisions in the new Congress.
  Sam Brownback has forever earned a place in the heart of our first 
Americans for his work on the adoption of a joint resolution 
apologizing to American Indians and Alaska Natives for centuries of ill 
conceived policies carried out by our Federal Government. He is known 
around the world as a champion of religious freedom as well.
  George Voinovich came to the Senate after a distinguished career that 
included service as Governor of the State of Ohio and mayor of the city 
of Cleveland. He has made a substantial contribution to the efficient 
operation of our federal government as a leader of the Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. I appreciate his support 
of the effort that Senator Akaka and I advanced, along with others, to 
make locality pay available to Federal employees in Alaska and Hawaii 
through the Non-Foreign Act of 2009.
  I would like to say a few words about my friend Byron Dorgan. In 
2007, following the sudden and unexpected death of our friend and 
colleague Craig Thomas, I was elevated to vice chair of the Senate 
Committee on Indian Affairs. Senator Dorgan was the chairman of that 
committee. Last week both of us had the honor of addressing the 
National Congress of American Indians at one of the meetings that 
preceded President Obama's tribal summit. Each of us reflected on that 
fact that the committee has highly productive during the period we 
shared the gavel. During our time together the committee laid the 
groundwork for reauthorization of the Indian Health Care Improvement 
Act, more than a decade in the making. We reauthorized the Native 
American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act, we pursued a 
settlement of the Cobell litigation, and we crafted and introduced the 
Tribal Law and Order Act, which President Obama signed into law earlier 
this year. Senator Dorgan has consistently championed adequate funding 
for the Indian Health Service and he has come to the floor on many 
occasions to speak to the unacceptable rates of suicide among Native 
youth. I am pleased to know that he will continue this work after he 
leaves the Senate. It comes from the heart.
  As I noted at the outset, 2011 will be the first year in recent 
memory that the number of women serving in the Senate has actually 
declined. All of the women of the Senate will miss our dear friend and 
highly respected colleague Blanche Lincoln. Blanche Lincoln made 
history in her own right when she became the youngest woman ever 
elected to the Senate at the age of 38. Senator Lincoln represented the 
people of Arkansas with distinction for two terms, juggling a demanding 
career in public service while raising two wonderful twin boys Reece 
and Bennett. She is truly a wonderful colleague to work with. A 
centrist who comfortably works across the aisle and votes her 
convictions. One of the kindest people in the Senate. I expect great 
things of Blanche Lincoln  in the future and I have every confidence 
she will deliver on that prediction.
  It has been an honor and a pleasure to serve with each of the people 
who will leave this Chamber when we adjourn sine die. Each has made 
substantial contributions to their States, to the Nation and to the 
Senate during their time here.
