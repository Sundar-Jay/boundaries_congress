                    REPEAL OF DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL

  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, I just returned from the signing of the 
repeal of Don't Ask, Don't Tell. The President spoke wisely and 
strongly and welcomed those who were discharged under the Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell policy to consider reenlisting.
  President Obama said:
  ``There will never be a full accounting of the heroism demonstrated 
by gay Americans in service to this country.'' He continued, ``As the 
first generation to serve openly in our armed services, you will stand 
for all those who came before you, and you will serve as role models 
for all those who come after you.''
  Madam Speaker, today is an important day, not just for gay and 
lesbian members of the military, but to all of us who are gay or 
lesbian, to our families, to our friends, for they all know that today 
we hold our heads a little higher as Americans. We are closer to equal 
treatment under the law, which is all we've ever asked for.
  Our government will no longer be an instrument of discrimination 
against us, and all America will see and be told of the patriotism of 
the gay and lesbian Americans who proudly defend a country that today 
is one step closer to considering us equal.
