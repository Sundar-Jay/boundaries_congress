                                 PRAYER

  Monsignor Stephen J. Rossetti, Catholic University of America, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following prayer:
  Good and gracious God, as the year draws to a close, we reflect upon 
all that has taken place. It is easy for us to thank and praise You for 
the many good things. It is more difficult to see Your hand in the hard 
times.
  Help us to treasure each event, each moment of our lives. Help us to 
know that Your all-powerful spirit brings life and grace out of 
everything in our lives.
  May we embrace the joys and the sorrows. May we embrace the signs of 
new life and the crosses.
  As we look forward to a new year, may we look to it with expectation 
and hope, knowing that You will guide and direct our lives in 
everything that comes our way.
  May we praise and thank You for the year that is passing and for the 
year that is to come.
  We pray this in Your holy name.
  Amen.NOTICE
