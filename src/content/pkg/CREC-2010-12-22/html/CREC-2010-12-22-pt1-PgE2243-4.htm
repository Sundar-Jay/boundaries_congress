  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and applaud 
Barbara Roose-Cramer for her outstanding service to our community.
   Barbara has been married 47 years, is the mother of three and 
grandmother of seven. She is an accomplished athlete, writer, 
motivational speaker and volunteer. Barbara has been the recipient of 
numerous awards including California's Outstanding Athlete and Most 
Inspirational Athlete, the YWCA's Most Courageous Athlete and a two 
time Olympic Gold Medalist. Since the onset of polio at age eight, 
Barbara has been in a wheelchair.
   In addition to her accomplishments as an athlete, Barbara has served 
on numerous committees for organizations dedicated to those with 
disabilities. She is currently writing for major publications on issues 
concerning those with disabilities. Being a sports enthusiast she has 
written a book about the history of the Denver Broncos and donated all 
the profits to a local wheelchair basketball team.
   I extend my deepest congratulations to Barbara Roose-Cramer for her 
well deserved recognition by the West Chamber serving Jefferson County. 
I have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication and character in 
all her future accomplishments.
