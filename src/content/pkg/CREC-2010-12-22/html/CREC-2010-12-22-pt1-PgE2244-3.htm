                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. DAVIS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms. 
Jennifer Crase, a mathematics teacher at South Oldham Middle School in 
the Fourth Congressional District of Kentucky.
  Ms. Crase has been an educator for more than thirteen years and has 
taught eighth grade mathematics in Crestwood, Kentucky for 6 years.
  In June 2010, Ms. Crase was nominated by President Barack Obama as a 
Presidential Awardee for the Presidential Awards for Excellence in 
Mathematics and Science Teaching.
  In addition to being an outstanding teacher, she has worked at the 
State level to develop a standards-based report card for all Kentucky 
middle schools. Ms. Crase serves as a team leader, mentor, presenter 
and mathematics lead teacher for her school.
  Ms. Crase is a strong mentor and a reliable friend to her colleagues. 
She encourages collaboration and sets high goals for all students.
  Today, as we celebrate the accomplishments of this exceptional 
Kentuckian, it is my hope that others are encouraged by her hard work 
and determination.
  Madam Speaker, please join me in commending Jennifer Crase for her 
time and devotion in helping the youth of the Commonwealth of Kentucky 
and the United States of America.

                          ____________________
