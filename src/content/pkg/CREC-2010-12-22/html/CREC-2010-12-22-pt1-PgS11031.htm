                   SAN FRANCISCO MUSEUM OF MODERN ART

<bullet> Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this time to recognize the 
75th anniversary of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, SFMOMA. For 
75 years, SFMOMA has engaged and inspired Bay Area residents and 
visitors alike through first-rate exhibitions, public programs, and 
special events that enrich and educate the community.
  SFMOMA was founded in 1935 by Dr. Grace Louise McVann Morley. At the 
time of its founding, SFMOMA was the first and only museum on the west 
coast dedicated solely to modern and contemporary art. Dr. Morley, a 
visionary and committed leader, went on to serve as the museum's 
director for 23 years. Under her guidance, SFMOMA showcased innovative 
and challenging art by both new and established artists, helping to 
cement San Francisco's position as a leader in the world of modern art.
  SFMOMA's leadership has never been limited to art alone but also 
extends to influencing public policy, establishing avenues to success 
for local and regional artists and exhibiting work that addresses 
current political and social movements.
  To accommodate the expansion of the museum over the years, artwork 
was divided into four different departments: architectural and design, 
media arts, painting and sculpture, and photography. In addition to 
traditional exhibitions, SFMOMA now offers film festivals, live art 
performances, and educational programs for children and teens. The 
museum has also recently developed a new Web site and blog 
incorporating podcasts, an online tool for browsing the collection, and 
additional interactive features that make the museum more accessible 
than ever before.
  Last year, SFMOMA entered into an exciting partnership with Doris and 
Donald Fisher, founders of the Gap, enabling the museum to exhibit the 
Fishers' personal art collection, known internationally to be one of 
the most comprehensive and extraordinary collections of modern art in 
the world. The collection is comprised of more than 1,100 works by 185 
20th and 21st century American and European artists.
  Today, SFMOMA retains more than 26,000 pieces of art in its permanent 
collection, including photographs, design objects, sculptures, and 
other artworks. The museum is currently planning a major expansion to 
support its ongoing growth and to showcase the Doris and Donald Fisher 
Collection. The additional space will allow SFMOMA to continue evolving 
and offering additional programs for the community to learn, engage, 
and interact with each other and with some of the greatest works of 
modern art.
  Earlier this year, SFMOMA marked its 75th anniversary by offering 3 
free days of special programs entitled ``75 Years of Looking Forward.'' 
As a result, thousands visited the museum, eager to take advantage of 
the opportunity to honor and celebrate this cherished institution. 
SFMOMA hosts 800,000 visitors annually and boasts the largest member 
base of any modern or contemporary art museum in the United States. I 
commend SFMOMA for serving the community superbly for the past 75 
years. Audiences have been captivated and inspired by SFMOMA's 
collections and special exhibitions, and I wish this venerable cultural 
institution much success in the decades to come.<bullet>
