  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:

                            S. Con. Res. 78

       Whereas President Clinton, with the approval of Congress 
     and the bipartisan support of congressional sponsors, 
     representing the States of the Delta in both the House of 
     Representatives and the Senate, launched the Delta Regional 
     Authority on December 21, 2000, in an effort to alleviate the 
     economic hardship facing the Delta region and to create a 
     more level playing field for the counties and parishes of 
     such States to compete for jobs and investment;
       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority is a Federal-State 
     partnership that serves 252 counties and parishes in parts of 
     Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
     Mississippi, Missouri, and Tennessee;
       Whereas the Delta region holds great promise for access and 
     trade, as the region borders the world's greatest 
     transportation arterial in the Mississippi River;
       Whereas the Delta boasts a strong cultural heritage as the 
     birthplace of the blues and jazz music and as home to world 
     famous cuisine, which people throughout the United States and 
     the world identify with the region;
       Whereas the counties and parishes served by the Delta 
     Regional Authority constitute an economically-distressed area 
     facing challenges such as undeveloped infrastructure systems, 
     insufficient transportation options, struggling education 
     systems, migration out of the region, substandard health 
     care, and the needs to develop, recruit, and retain a 
     qualified workforce and to build strong communities that 
     attract new industries and employment opportunities;
       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has made significant 
     progress toward addressing such challenges during its first 
     10 years of work;
       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority operates a highly 
     successful grant program in each of the 8 States it serves, 
     allowing cities, counties, and parishes to leverage money 
     from other Federal agencies and private investors;
       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has invested nearly 
     $86,200,000 into more than 600 projects during the first 
     decade of existence, leveraging $1,400,000,000 in private 
     sector investment and producing an overall 22 to 1 return on 
     taxpayer dollars;
       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority is working with 
     partners to create or retain approximately 19,000 jobs and is 
     bringing the critical infrastructure to sustain new water and 
     sewer services for more than 43,000 families;
       Whereas an independent report from the Department of 
     Agriculture's Economic Research Service found that per capita 
     income

[[Page S11054]]

     grew more rapidly in counties and parishes where the Delta 
     Regional Authority had the greatest investment, showing that 
     each additional dollar of Delta Regional Authority's per 
     capita spending results in a $15 increase in personal income;
       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has developed a 
     culture of transparency, passing 9 independent audits showing 
     tangible results;
       Whereas during its first 10 years, the Delta Regional 
     Authority has laid a strong foundation for working with State 
     Governors, Federal partners, community leaders, and private 
     sector investors to capitalize on the region's strong points 
     and serve as an economic multiplier for the 8-State region, 
     helping communities tackle challenges and cultivating a 
     climate conducive to job creation;
       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority has expanded its 
     regional initiatives in the areas of health care, 
     transportation, leadership training, and information 
     technology, and is also increasing efforts in the areas of 
     small business development, entrepreneurship, and alternative 
     energy jobs; and
       Whereas the Delta Regional Authority stands prepared to use 
     the groundwork established during its first decade as a 
     springboard to create new opportunities for Delta communities 
     in the future: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring), That the Congress--
       (1) recognizes the 10th anniversary of the founding of the 
     Delta Regional Authority; and
       (2) honors and celebrates the Delta Regional Authority's 
     first decade of work to improve the economy and well-being of 
     the 8-State Delta region, and the promise of the Delta 
     Regional Authority's continued work in the future.
