                       THANKING OUR SENATE PAGES

  Mr. REID. I have a few brief words, so I would appreciate everyone's 
patience.
  Through early mornings and late nights, weekdays and weekends, 
dedicated Senate pages often work as hard as do Senators and staffs. 
Their job is fast-paced. We ask a lot of these young men and women. 
They have significant responsibilities and much is expected of them. 
Sometimes, like this past week, those responsibilities and expectations 
are tremendous.
  This past week has been one of those times. Thirty pages began 
working in September for this semester, and by now most of them have 
gone home to their families all across America--all but two of them, 
Rachel Bailey and Jarrod Nagurka. Rachel is from Maryland and Jarrod is 
from Virginia.
  This past week has been very hectic. Through last weekend and during 
this week, historic legislation has been debated and passed right here 
on the Senate floor. The Senate floor cloakrooms have been extremely 
busy. Many amendments have been filed and called up. There has been an 
unusual situation where we have been in executive session with one of 
the rare treaties that are debated in this body. Senators have been 
heavily engaged trying to finish the work of the 111th Congress.

  Without a single complaint, Rachel and Jarrod, these two pages, have 
been carrying the load of all 30 Democratic and Republican pages. These 
two fine young pages have worked both cloakrooms. They haven't had any 
days off and have regularly worked up to 13 to 14 hours each day. That 
is a lot for anyone, and it is certainly a lot for a 16-year-old who is 
a student besides.
  The Senate greatly appreciates Rachel and Jarrod's commitment and 
calmness while the Senate's work has been so hectic. They have made our 
work much easier. They have been exceedingly professional, and I thank 
them.
  I want every one of their family members to know that in the minds of 
the Senate, these are two legislative heroes.
