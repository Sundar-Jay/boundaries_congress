               SENATE RESOLUTION 707--HONORING LULA DAVIS

  Mr. REID submitted the following resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to:

                              S. Res. 707

       Whereas Lula Davis, the Secretary for the Majority, will be 
     retiring at the end of the 111th Congress, after a long and 
     distinguished career;
       Whereas Lula Davis was first elected as Assistant 
     Democratic Secretary in 1997, and she was the first woman 
     ever to hold that position;
       Whereas Lula Davis was elected to be the Secretary for the 
     Majority at the beginning of the 111th Congress, the first 
     African American to serve in this position, and during the 
     111th Congress she has expertly tackled one of the toughest 
     jobs in politics;
       Whereas throughout her time in the Senate, Lula Davis has 
     played a major role in managing the debate and passage of 
     many significant pieces of legislation;
       Whereas many legislative accomplishments over the years 
     would not have happened without the leadership of Lula Davis;
       Whereas Lula Davis lived in rural Louisiana, and worked as 
     a teacher and guidance counselor;
       Whereas Lula Davis remains committed to children in our 
     community, founding and continuing to run a nonprofit 
     mentoring and charitable organization called ``Leadership 
     Cares,'' which provides holiday meals to more than 650 
     families annually;
       Whereas Lula Davis has encouraged many of her fellow Senate 
     staff to volunteer alongside her family and friends to make a 
     difference for those in need;
       Whereas Lula Davis started her Senate career as a 
     legislative aide to her home-state Senator, Russell Long, and 
     went on to serve in almost every position on the floor staff, 
     including office assistant, floor assistant, chief floor 
     assistant, Assistant Secretary, and Secretary;
       Whereas Lula Davis is a master of the complex formal and 
     informal rules under which the Senate operates;
       Whereas Lula Davis has consistently provided thoughtful and 
     reliable advice to both Democratic and Republican leadership 
     and all members of the Senate;
       Whereas Lula Davis is loyal to the Senate and to Senators, 
     and respects the traditions that make this body great;
       Whereas the Senate has tremendous respect for Lula Davis 
     and her hard work, and deeply appreciates her enormous 
     contributions to the Senate and to the United States: Now, 
     therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate expresses its deepest thanks to 
     Lula Davis for her many years of outstanding service to the 
     United States Senate and to the United States of America.
