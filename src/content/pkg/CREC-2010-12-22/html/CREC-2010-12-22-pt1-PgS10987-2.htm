  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the following 
nominations are considered and confirmed en bloc: Calendar No. 1119, 
No. 1120, and No. 1139. The motions to reconsider are considered made 
and laid upon the table en bloc, and the President shall be immediately 
notified of the Senate's action.
  The nominations considered and confirmed en bloc are as follows:


                             the judiciary

       Kathleen M. O'Malley, of Ohio, to be United States Circuit 
     Judge for the Federal Circuit.
       Beryl Alaine Howell, of the District of Columbia, to be 
     United States District Judge for the District of Columbia.
       Robert Leon Wilkins, of the District of Columbia, to be 
     United States District Judge for the District of Columbia.

  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate 
has voted to confirm Judge Kathleen McDonald O'Malley to the U.S. court 
of appeals for the Federal circuit.
  The Nation's gain is Ohio's loss. But it is also a proud day for us.
  As a child Kate was blessed with wisdom beyond her years. At the age 
of 12 she was asked what she wanted to be when she grew up. She replied 
that she wanted to become a Federal judge.
  And she excelled in school--high school, college, and law school. She 
graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Kenyon College in 1979 and first in her 
class at Case Western Reserve Law School in 1982.
  After law school she clerked for the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals 
for the distinguished Judge Nathaniel R. Jones, who is one of her major 
influences and who considers Kate to be like family.
  After her clerkship with Judge Jones, Judge O'Malley spent several 
years in private practice, where she gained invaluable experience 
representing numerous large corporations in addition to medium-sized 
and small businesses.
  She became an expert in complex corporate litigation, patent and 
intellectual property cases--experience that will serve her well as a 
Circuit Judge in the Federal circuit.
  She translated her private sector experience into a distinguished 
career in public service as chief counsel and chief of staff for then-
Ohio attorney general Lee Fisher.
  Recognizing her talents, Ohio Senators Howard Metzenbaum and John 
Glenn recommended her to President Clinton for a place on the Federal 
bench.
  On September 20, 1994, President Clinton nominated her to serve on 
the Federal bench as a U.S. district judge for the Northern District of 
Ohio.
  When she began her service in the Northern District of Ohio, Judge

 O'Malley was among the youngest judges serving on the Federal bench.
  Since then, she has served the Northern District of Ohio with 
distinction.
  In addition to having a great legal mind, she is an innovator. She 
has spearheaded national efforts to integrate cutting edge technologies 
into courtrooms--ensuring that the administration of justice is equal, 
fair, and open for all who seek it.
  Judge O'Malley will make an outstanding judge on the U.S. court of 
appeals for the Federal circuit, and I congratulate her on her 
confirmation.
