            ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE 110TH AND 111TH CONGRESS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOHN J. HALL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I wold like to submit the 
following: As the Representative for New York's 19th Congressional 
District, I had numerous significant accomplishments in all aspects of 
meeting local community needs, individual constituent services, and 
enacting federal legislation on behalf of my constituents.
  I kept my annual promise of holding at least one public event in 
every town and city in the district to give my constituents an 
opportunity to speak directly with me about their opinions and 
concerns. I hosted Town Hall Meetings, Congress on Your Corners, 
business roundtables, issues forums and workshops throughout all 4 
years of my Congressional service. In addition to these events, I 
attended numerous community events hosted by local organizations, 
senior centers, fire departments, schools, etc. I also did a series of 
``work-a-day'' events where I worked alongside a constituent in a local 
job so I could better understand the day to day challenges they face. 
Some of these events included working with a nurse at an area hospital, 
an assembly line worker at a manufacturing plant, a ride along with a 
delivery truck driver, weatherization installation at a home, 
installation of a geothermal heat/cooling system at a new senior 
housing development, and installation of solar energy panels on the 
roof of an elementary school.
  The Congressional offices in Carmel, Goshen, and Washington responded 
to thousands of constituent opinions and information requests. Hundreds 
of casework problems were resolved for individuals and families who had 
problems with federal agencies when applying for Veterans benefits, 
Social Security and Medicare payments, and expediting passport 
applications.
  The Congressional office provided hundreds of Capitol tours for 
school classes and families visiting Washington DC, fulfilled flag 
requests, nominated students to our nation's military service 
academies, and assisted with federal grant applications.
  I cosponsored and voted for important legislation to create and save 
jobs, cut taxes on middle class families, improve the process for 
Veterans applying for well deserved benefits, reform financial services 
regulation, and health insurance reform designed to improve 
accessibility and affordability. I authored legislation that 
dramatically improved the Veterans benefits system, streamlining the 
process for veterans to receive the care and compensation they earned 
in service to our nation. My legislation is widely regarded as the most 
sweeping reform of the VA in a generation.
  I was proud to bring millions of federal dollars home for local 
projects that create and save jobs, improve water quality, improve 
traffic safety and public transportation, build local infrastructure, 
and save local property tax dollars.
  I voted against my own pay raise each time it came before the House, 
and donated my raise to local non-profit organizations rather than 
accepting it.

                     Meeting Local Community Needs


    Economic Development: Local Jobs and Small Business Development

  I worked actively to bring new jobs to the area and save local jobs 
that were at risk of leaving including:
  Kolmar--Successfully assisted in keeping the largest manufacturing 
company in Western Orange County from leaving the state, thereby 
retaining hundreds of local jobs in an economically depressed area.
  Pepsi Bottling--Successfully assisted with efforts to keep the 
company's facilities in Northern Westchester when they were considering 
a move out of state.
  SpectraWatt--Instrumental in negotiations to bring a new solar energy 
manufacturing company to Dutchess County, replacing almost a hundred 
jobs that had been outsourced overseas. Labor Secretary Hilda Solis 
visited the site to discuss the local benefits with business and labor 
leaders. Although recent reports indicate the company is struggling, 
discussions are still ongoing to keep the jobs in Dutchess County.
  I successfully advocated for Stewart Air National Guard Base to 
receive 8 new C-17 aircraft and all of the support services and local 
economic development opportunities that go with it. The Air Force made 
this award after a very competitive national process. I also brought US 
Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to Stewart Airport for a meeting 
with local business and community leaders to discuss how the airport 
could be more of an economic engine for the region.
  I hosted several small business seminars to inform local businesses 
about the opportunities created by the federal economic stimulus 
legislation, including direct tax reductions and capital availability. 
These events were attended by hundreds of people. In addition, numerous 
roundtables were held with local business leaders to provide me with 
direct input as to what they needed to create growth opportunities. 
These meetings served as the basis for small business tax cut 
legislation I introduced, several provisions were enacted into law.
  Job Opportunity and Training Fairs were held to provide assistance in 
getting a job including interviewing skills, resume writing, 
networking, employer connections, adult and continuing education, green 
jobs, and entrepreneurship and one-on-one consultation. Many local 
employers attended and were able to talk directly with job seekers who 
were in attendance.
  I brought House Education and Labor Committee Chairman George Miller 
to the district for a public meeting to inform the community about the 
provisions of the new Direct Student Loan legislation and how they will 
make it easier for more students to attend college.
  I held workshops for local constituents to provide them with 
information regarding how to prevent home foreclosure as well as 
mortgage refinancing options. I brought together local banks and 
housing counselors for presentations as well as direct individual 
counseling opportunities.


                          Energy Independence:

  I sponsored a series of energy independence forums throughout the 
district to provide practical information to municipalities, 
businesses, and individuals interested in developing domestic energy 
resources. These forums focused on wind, solar, hydro and tidal power, 
as well as biofuels and conservation. I also held an event which 
brought together solar manufacturers, retailers, and prospective buyers 
to create markets for local suppliers. Many local projects were 
developed as a result of the information provided and the introductions 
made between local providers and businesses.
  I helped bring more than $517m for weatherization funding and energy 
efficiency grants to New York. This money directly benefited local 
families who were able to save money on their energy bills by 
weatherizing their homes, and it created local jobs.


                                Veterans

  Many Veterans meetings were held throughout the district so I could 
gain input from local veterans regarding the challenges they face 
navigating the VA claims and benefits processes generally, as well as a 
specific challenges resulting from PTSD. Based on what I heard from 
local Veterans and VSOs, I successfully introduced legislation that 
significantly streamlined the benefits process, and advocated for a VA 
rules change regarding handling of PTSD claims. The rules change

makes it much easier for veterans suffering with PTSD to receive the 
care and compensation they deserve.
  I sponsored a Veterans Employment and Education forum to help 
returning veterans transition from the battlefield to the classroom and 
the workplace and make sure they are aware of all the benefits they 
earned. A member of the Wounded Warrior Program works on my 
Congressional staff.
  In addition I hosted a GI Bill forum to train Hudson Valley college 
admissions and administrative personnel regarding the benefits due to 
Veterans and how to assist them with the application process.
  I strongly advocated for maintaining health care services for 
veterans at both campuses in Montrose and Castle Point. I also assisted 
in bringing a new veterans health clinic to Orange County.
  I successfully sponsored legislation to name the Chester Post Office 
in memory of First Lt. Lou Allen, who was killed in Iraq and to name 
the Port Jervis Post office in memory of former Mayor and Senator 
Arthur Gray.


                                Seniors

  I hosted several events to help protect local Seniors from Medicare 
fraud. Experts were in attendance to provide specific information about 
scams in the area and how to avoid becoming a victim. In addition, I 
hosted informational events to prepare individuals and families who are 
nearing Medicare eligibility to prepare themselves to understand and 
navigate the many enrollment options and various plans available. 
Thousands of local Seniors participated in my Tele-Town Hall discussion 
about how the Health Care Reform law would affect them. Topics covered 
included closing the donut hole, free preventative care and wellness 
visits for seniors, reducing subsidies to Medicare Advantage plans, 
fighting waste, fraud and abuse in Medicare, and long term care 
options.


                   Law enforcement training sessions

  I became aware of concerns regarding communication between some local 
law enforcement officials and federal Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) officers. As a result I requested ICE officials come 
to the district and provide information to local law enforcement 
regarding how ICE can assist local law enforcement and ways they could 
work together to improve public safety.


                     Congressional Art Competition

  Each year my office hosted a Congressional Arts Competition for high 
school students in my district. The winner's artwork is shown for a 
year at the Capitol Building in Washington DC and runners up are shown 
in my local Congressional offices. The Congressional office worked with 
arts facilities and schools to encourage student artists, review the 
submissions, and have them shown within the community.


                            Resource Guides

  The Congressional office created the following resource guides to 
assist individuals, organizations, and small businesses with federal 
government services and opportunities:

of the federal economic stimulus legislation for individuals, 
businesses, organizations, and municipalities including information
