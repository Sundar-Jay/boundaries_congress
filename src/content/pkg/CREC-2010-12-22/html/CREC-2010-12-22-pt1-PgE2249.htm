                   FDA FOOD SAFETY MODERNIZATION ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. DANNY K. DAVIS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 21, 2010

  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 
2751, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act of 2010, a bill that would 
overhaul our Nation's food safety system by fundamentally changing the 
way we protect the safety of our food supply. The focus of this 
legislative measure is to prevent contamination of food before it 
occurs, which is a departure from the current system today that 
responds after a food-borne illness outbreak. Specifically, it requires 
food producers to come up with strategies to prevent contamination and 
then continually test to make sure these strategies are working. In 
addition, H.R. 2751 would allow the FDA to increase the number of 
inspections to conduct, and requires foreign importers to ensure their 
food products meet U.S. safety standards.
  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the leadership of the House and the Senate for 
this bipartisan legislation to provide a framework for developing 
preventive control standards from farm to table to protect the public 
from food contamination.
