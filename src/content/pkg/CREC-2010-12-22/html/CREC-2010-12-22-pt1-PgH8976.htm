  CELEBRATING 130 YEARS OF UNITED STATES-ROMANIAN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

  Mr. KLEIN of Florida. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs be discharged from further consideration 
of the concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 67) celebrating 130 years of 
United States-Romanian diplomatic relations, congratulating the 
Romanian people on their achievements as a great nation, and 
reaffirming the deep bonds of trust and values between the United 
States and Romania, a trusted and most valued ally, and ask for its 
immediate consideration in the House.
  The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Florida?
  There was no objection.
  The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:

                            S. Con. Res. 67

       Whereas the United States established diplomatic relations 
     with Romania in June 1880;
       Whereas the United States and Romania are two countries 
     united by shared values and a strong commitment to freedom, 
     democracy, and prosperity;
       Whereas Romania has shown, for the past 20 years, 
     remarkable leadership in advancing security and democratic 
     principles in Eastern Europe, the Western Balkans, and the 
     Black Sea region, and has amply participated to the forging 
     of a wider Europe, whole and free;
       Whereas Romania's commitment to meeting the greatest 
     responsibilities and challenges of the 21st century is and 
     has been reflected by its contribution to the international 
     efforts of stabilization in Afghanistan and Iraq, its 
     decision to participate in the United States missile defense 
     system in Europe, its leadership in regional nonproliferation 
     and arms control, its active pursuit of energy security 
     solutions for South Eastern Europe, and its substantial role 
     in shaping a strong and effective North Atlantic Alliance;
       Whereas the strategic partnership that exists between the 
     United States and Romania has greatly advanced the common 
     interests of the United States and Romania in promoting 
     transatlantic and regional security and free market 
     opportunities, and should continue to provide for more 
     economic and cultural exchanges, trade and investment, and 
     people-to-people contacts between the United States and 
     Romania;
       Whereas the talent, energy, and creativity of the Romanian 
     people have nurtured a vibrant society and nation, embracing 
     entrepreneurship, technological advance and innovation, and 
     rooted deeply in the respect for education, culture, and 
     international cooperation; and
       Whereas Romanian Americans have contributed greatly to the 
     history and development of the United States, and their rich 
     cultural heritage and commitment to furthering close 
     relations between Romania and the United States should be 
     properly recognized and praised: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring), That Congress--
       (1) celebrates the 130th anniversary of United States-
     Romanian diplomatic relations;
       (2) congratulates the Romanian people on their achievements 
     as a great nation; and
       (3) reaffirms the deep bonds of trust and values between 
     the United States and Romania.

  The concurrent resolution was concurred in.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
