                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. HALL of Texas. Madam Speaker, as we approach the close of the 
111th Congress, it is important to remember our men and women in 
uniform around the world. These brave men and women sacrifice every day 
to ensure that United States citizens enjoy the freedom that we all 
cherish. We pay tribute as well to our wounded warriors and wish them a 
safe and happy holiday season.
  One such hero is retired specialist Jim Batchelor who has served his 
country proudly for over three and a half years. During his tenure in 
the Army he has earned numerous awards and decorations, including the 
Purple Heart, Combat Infantry Badge, expert badges in driving and 
marksmanship, good conduct medals, and Army Commendation medals. Not 
allowing his military injury to slow him down, he has finished his 
degree in criminal justice and is now pursuing a master in psychology 
to help his fellow soldiers returning from the war. He and his wife, 
Antoinette, live in Cooper Texas, and are expecting the birth of their 
first child.
  Another hero who deserves tribute is retired Lieutenant Colonel 
Alphonse R. Telese Jr. Mr. Telese served in the U.S. Army for over 32 
years before retiring in August of 2008. It was during his tour of duty 
in Iraq that he was permanently injured during a mortar attack. He has 
received numerous awards and decorations throughout his distinguished 
career. These include the Legion of Merit award, National Defense 
Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, to name a 
few. Today, he and his wife Tierney reside in Frisco, Texas. Since his 
retirement, LTC Telese continues to support the military, volunteering 
his time and talents to the Dallas Summer Boat Show Tournament of 
Heroes Invitation Bass Fishing Tournament which provides a much 
deserved break for our military heroes.
  As we adjourn today, let us do so in memory and in honor of those who 
answer the call to duty and to whom we owe a debt of gratitude that can 
never be paid.
