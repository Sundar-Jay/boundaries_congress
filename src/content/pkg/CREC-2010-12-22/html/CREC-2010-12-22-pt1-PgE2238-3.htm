          FEDERAL GRANTS AND APPROPRIATIONS FOR LOCAL PROJECTS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOHN J. HALL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. HALL of New York. Madam Speaker, I would like to submit the 
following:
  I was proud to bring millions of federal dollars home to local 
taxpayers. New Yorkers pay more in federal taxes than New York receives 
in federal funding support, so I worked hard to bring additional 
dollars back home for local projects, thereby reducing the burden on 
local property taxpayers.

                          Constituent Services

  Casework: One of the aspects of the job that I find most rewarding is 
the ability to assist local constituents with individual problems. In 
many of these cases the constituent needs assistance cutting through 
the federal bureaucracy to get the attention they need to their 
individual situation. Although I believe that people shouldn't need to 
turn to their Congressional office in order to get their cases 
resolved, I am happy to be able to assist when such instances occur.
  My Congressional office resolved thousands of constituent service 
cases, which included providing assistance to Veterans, Seniors with 
Medicare and Social Security concerns, foreclosure and mortgage 
assistance to homeowners, families seeking adoptions, and expediting 
passports. The Congressional office provided assistance to constituents 
trying to reach family members during natural disasters overseas such 
as Haiti and Chile. In many of these cases our assistance made a real 
difference in people's daily lives.
  Some specific examples of the hundreds of successful results achieved 
by the Congressional office are described below.
  Veterans: Obtained well over $2 million in retroactive payments and 
benefits for individual local veterans earned but never received from 
the Veterans Administration due to administrative backlogs and errors. 
These awards ranged from a few dollars to over $100,000 depending on 
the type of injury, level of disability, and length of the VA delay in 
processing the case.

[[Page E2240]]

  Successfully assisted many local Veterans in receiving long over due 
combat medals such as medals from World War 2 for a Mahopac veteran and 
several Purple Heart recipients.
  Awarded the prestigious Air Medal to former flight crewmembers of the 
336th Medical Detachment, and Army Reserve Helicopter Ambulance unit in 
a ceremony at Stewart Airport. The 60 men and women of the 336th 
Medical Detachment, trained as Medevac pilots, helicopter crew chiefs 
and medics, evacuated sick and wounded soldiers from the battlefield. 
Due to adverse field conditions and administrative oversight, the 
unit's flight crews did not receive their Air Medals until my office 
intervened on their behalf.
  Social Security: Assistance was provided to constituents such as 
explaining eligibility for disability benefits; facilitating 
communication between beneficiaries and local SSA offices; assisting in 
setting up payment schedules for overpayments to beneficiaries' 
accounts; reinstatement of disability benefits that were incorrectly 
stopped; expediting appeal hearings, expediting the processing of 
retroactive checks in favorable disability cases that included amounts 
in excess of $100,000; removal of overpayments that were mistakenly put 
onto beneficiaries' records; and assisting with the appeal of an 
overpayment waiver request.
  For example--
  Expedited a Social Security appeals hearing for a constituent who 
suffered major spinal injuries, was unable to work and facing 
bankruptcy. The case was found fully favorable to the constituent.
  Expedited a retroactive payment in a Social Security disability case 
for $79,000.
  Helped get a Social Security disability appeals hearing for a woman 
suffering from a tick-borne illness similar to Lyme's Disease. The 
appeal was expedited and she was awarded more than $1,800 in monthly 
benefits and more than $65,000 in retroactive benefits, and found 
eligible for Medicare.
  Medicare: Facilitated reimbursement for Durable Medical Equipment and 
other services.
  Helped remove surcharge on Part B, premium and processing of 
retroactive payment.
  Internal Revenue Service: Expedited processing of refund and economic 
stimulus payments.
  Helped change filing status for taxpayer.
  Department of Labor: Challenged denial of prescription coverage for a 
drug that was in a beneficiary's plan.
  Assisted in having overpaid monthly COBRA premium credited toward 
future monthly premiums.
  Assisted with having COBRA premium reduction applied to several 
beneficiaries who did not initially receive it.
  Federal Trade Commission: Worked with constituents and relevant 
credit agencies to fix mistakes on credit reports.
  Visiting Washington DC: When constituents, school groups, and local 
organizations visit Washington DC, my office helps arrange tours, and 
can help with other aspects of the visits. I make every effort to 
personally greet local visitors. In 2009 my office arranged and gave 
over 700 tours of the Capitol to local families, school classes, and 
other visitors from the 19th Congressional District. The office also 
assisted with information including assistance in arranging for tours 
of other significant sites in Washington.
  Service Academy Nominations: Each year my Congressional office 
submits nominations of local students to our nation's military service 
academies including the U.S. Military Academy at West Point (USMA), 
Naval (USNA), Air Force (USAFA), and Merchant Marine (USMMA) Academies. 
I consider it a great honor to be able to nominate top local students 
who will become the next generation of military leaders. During my two 
terms in office, I was proud to serve on the U.S. Military Academy's 
Board of Visitors.
