                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Ms. KILROY. Madam Speaker, on the legislative day of Tuesday, 
December 21, 2010, I cast a vote but it apparently was not recorded on 
rollcall vote 661. As a co-sponsor of this legislation, had my vote 
been properly recorded I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall vote 661.
