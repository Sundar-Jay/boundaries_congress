                           THE RUMP CONGRESS

  (Mr. McCLINTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, this lame duck session is rapidly 
descending into farce. I believe the House is now in danger of becoming 
a caricature of everything the American people rejected in November: 
incompetence, arrogance, and a complete detachment from reality.
  Nearly 2 months ago, the American people said very clearly they don't 
want this Congress legislating for them any longer. And instead of 
graciously and humbly accepting the public's verdict, the Democratic 
leaders seem intent to thumb their nose at the American people.
  Perhaps the most bitter indictment of a malingering legislative body 
was delivered by Cromwell to the Rump Parliament. His words seem 
appropriate now to this rump Congress:
  ``You have sat here too long for any good you have been doing. It is 
not fit that you should sit here any longer. You shall now give way to 
better men. Now depart and go, I say, in the name of God, go.''
