                                SCHEDULE

  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, today the Senate 
will resume consideration of the New START treaty. Yesterday, cloture 
was invoked on the treaty, which limits debate to 30 hours. He hopes 
some of the postcloture debate time can be yielded back so we can 
complete action on it early this afternoon.
  In addition to the treaty, the majority leader would like the Senate 
to consider the Department of Defense authorization bill, the 9/11 
health legislation for first responders, and a number of executive 
nominations, including that of James Cole to be Deputy Attorney 
General, before we leave for the holidays. Senators will be notified 
when any votes are scheduled.
