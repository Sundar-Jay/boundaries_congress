                   THIS IS NO WAY TO RUN A GOVERNMENT

  (Mr. GOHMERT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, this bill that's just passed has been 
indicative of how things have gone here in this last 2 years. People 
didn't have a chance to read the bill. People didn't have a chance to 
make amendments to the bill.
  There is no question the heroes from 9/11 deserved our full 
attention. They deserved to have proper moneys raised in proper ways in 
order to fund their proper treatment. That should have been done, but 
it wasn't. No, we come rushing in here at the last minute, and in fact, 
there were 176 Democrats that voted. It took 42 Republicans voting to 
give a quorum to get enough people so the vote would count. We had to 
wait over an hour for people to fly in from different places.
  Is that any way to run a government? Is that any way to handle the 
business regarding heroes? And by the way, we're told, well, this will 
be paid for. One of the ways we're going to get a bunch of money to pay 
for that is our troops are in the Middle East, and we have to buy 
things from vendors over there, and we're going to slap a 2 percent tax 
on everything they sell to us. Our servicemembers will pay for it.
  This is no way to run a government.
