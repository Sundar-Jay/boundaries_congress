  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, congratulations to our 
former Colleague from New Jersey, Mike Ferguson, and his wife Maureen 
Ferguson on the birth of their new daughter Lucy Therese Ferguson. Lucy 
was born on Wednesday, December 15, 2010, at Sibley Hospital in 
Washington, DC.
  Lucy Therese Ferguson is eight pounds and two ounces of pride and joy 
to her loving grandparents, Patrick and Esther Malloy of West Swanzey, 
New Hampshire, and Tom Ferguson of Wellington, Florida. I am so excited 
for this new blessing to the Ferguson family and wish them all the 
best.
