                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I would like to call to your attention 
the story of an outstanding individual, Mr. George W. McCullough, III, 
who will visit New Jersey's 8th District on Sunday, December 12, 2010, 
for he is a great example of service to our Nation and communities.
  It is only fitting that he be honored in this, the permanent record 
of the greatest democracy ever known, for his story is a true 
embodiment of the American Dream.
  George W. McCullough, III serves as Supreme Governor of the Loyal 
Order of Moose for 2010-2011. He was elected to this post, which also 
serves as chairman of the Moose International Board of Directors, at 
the 122nd International Convention in Nashville in July 2010. He had 
previously served as Supreme Jr. Governor in 2009-2010, and Supreme 
Prelate during 2008-09.
  He is a Life Member of Charlotte, NC Lodge 1113, having been 
sponsored by his father in 1969. He immediately took an active role, 
serving on all standing and special committees, and holding all chairs, 
including Past Governor. He stepped in as acting Administrator for an 
eight month period. He has been an active Ritualist for more than 20 
years, and has been honored as an International Champion in Ritual 
Competition.
  He has served on all the committees and chairs of WENOCA Moose Legion 
78 and is a Past North Moose. He has served the North Carolina Moose 
Association on several District committee posts, as District President, 
and on most Association Committees; he is a Past President of the 
Association by Service. He was also conferred the honor of Past 
President by both the Louisiana and Minnesota Moose Associations.
  Mr. McCullough served on the International Community Service 
Committee before his appointment to the Mooseheart Board of Directors 
in 1994. A member of the 150 Division of the Moose 25 Club, he received 
the Fellowship Degree of Honor in 1978 and the Pilgrim Degree of Merit 
in 1990. He was awarded the Shining Star as International Moose of the 
Year for 1995.
  He is an ordained minister of the Baptist Church, and he is a U.S. 
Army combat veteran with service in Vietnam, holding the Bronze Star 
and the Purple Heart among other decorations. He and his wife Sue 
reside in Charlotte, where he owns and operates McCullough & Associates 
Auto Electric. The McCulloughs have two daughters, two sons, a 
daughter-in-law and two grandsons.
  The job of a United States Congressman involves much that is 
rewarding, yet nothing compares to learning about and recognizing the 
efforts of individuals like Mr. George W. McCullough, Ill.
  Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, George's family 
and friends, all the members of the Loyal Order of Moose, and me in 
recognizing the outstanding contributions of Mr. George W. McCullough, 
III to our Nation.
