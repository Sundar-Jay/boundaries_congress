                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and applaud Kay 
Ehalt for her outstanding service to our community.
   Kay Ehalt has made a life of caring for others. She has raised two 
sons and a daughter. She puts her heart and soul into creating gift 
baskets that are creative and unique and adds the personal touch to 
make each recipient feel cherished.
   Kay has been involved with the Kiwanis for many years and travels 
annually with the Children's Hospital Jungle Mobile. The Jungle Mobile 
is an ambulance converted into a safety education classroom on wheels. 
It travels to rural areas to teach kids about fire safety, water safety 
and how to call 911.
   In addition, Kay is an avid supporter of the Jefferson Foundation's 
Crystal Ball. Volunteering her time for the event and donating items 
for the silent auction. Whenever an organization needs something for 
auctions, fundraisers or decorations, Kay is always offering her 
services or her baskets without being asked.
   I extend my deepest congratulations to Kay Ehalt for her well 
deserved recognition by the West Chamber serving Jefferson County. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication and character in all 
her future accomplishments.

                          ____________________
