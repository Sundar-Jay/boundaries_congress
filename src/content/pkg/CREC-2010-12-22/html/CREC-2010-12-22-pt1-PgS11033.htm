                      RECOGNIZING AGREN APPLIANCE

<bullet> Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, small businesses are the engine of 
our economy. There are literally millions of unique stories about how 
these companies had developed since they opened their doors. Some of 
the most impressive businesses are family-owned entities that start 
with a handful of workers and a commitment to filling a niche in their 
city or town. Today I recognize Agren Appliance, a company that started 
with the basics and has blossomed into a familiar name to residents of 
Lewiston-Auburn, ME, for over 40 years.
  The Agren family began serving the community in 1969, when they 
operated two repair trucks to fix appliances for families and 
individuals throughout the greater Lewiston-Auburn area. Their only 
technology was a rotary telephone to receive calls from those requiring 
assistance. Over time, the family developed a reputation for its 
reliability, gaining regular customers and parlaying that recognition 
into future success.
  As a result of its strong and growing standing, Agren opened its 
first brick-and-mortar store in Auburn in 1978, carrying the Whirlpool 
brand of products. Over time, the company further expanded its reach, 
opening branches in the coastal town of Brunswick in 1983, as well as 
south Paris, in western Maine, in 1986. Later, Agren Appliance opened 
stores in south Portland and midcoast Maine, covering a large swath of 
the State's population. And on Monday, Agren Appliance moved from its 
former south Paris location to a newer, larger, 25,000-square-foot 
space in the neighboring town of Norway. The company has been 
recognized as one of the Nation's top 100 appliance retailers, an 
impressive feat in such a competitive market.
  Agren now offers its customers a variety of products and brands--
including televisions, beds, mattresses, and dining room sets. 
Nonetheless, each store is still a one-stop shop for all appliance 
needs, from dishwashers and refrigerators, to laundry machines and 
dryers. And the business stays true to its roots, boasting Maine's 
largest independent appliance repair team, as well as a fleet of repair 
trucks.
  Furthermore, Agren Appliance is still family-owned and remains an 
integral part of the communities which it serves. The company 
frequently makes donations to organizations across the State, often 
providing gift certificates or various small appliances for silent 
auctions to benefit those in need. Additionally, at certain locations, 
Agren posts messages on their large electronic outdoor signs, 
advertising upcoming events and fundraising efforts from various 
members of the community--a generous act that helps promote worthwhile 
occasions and causes.
  With five stores spread across the southern part of the State, Agren 
has developed from a small-town appliance repair business into a 
trusted name for appliance and furniture needs. I am always impressed 
by the ingenuity of small businesses like Agren, which has witnessed 
marked growth because of a strong work ethic and dedication to knowing 
and serving the community. I thank all of the company's employees for 
their hard work, and wish them much success in the years to 
come.<bullet>
