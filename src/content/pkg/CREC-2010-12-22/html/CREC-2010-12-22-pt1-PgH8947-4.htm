       The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of 
     complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go-Act of 2010, shall 
     be determined by reference to the latest statement titled 
     ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act, 
     submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the 
     Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, provided that such 
     statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.

                            Motion to Concur

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion.
  The Clerk read as follows:

       Mr. Pallone moves that the House concur in the Senate 
     amendment to H.R. 847.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, 
the motion shall be debatable for 30 minutes equally divided and 
controlled by the Chair and ranking minority Member of the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce.
  The gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) and the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Burgess) each will control 15 minutes.
  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.


                             General Leave

  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks 
and include extraneous material in the Record.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New Jersey?
  There was no objection.
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield to myself such time as I may 
consume.
  I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 847, the 
James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2019. Today, this 
body, for the third time, will vote on legislation to finally keep our 
promise and take care of the heroes of 9/11.
  I would like to thank the bill's sponsors, Representatives Carolyn 
Maloney and Jerry Nadler, as well as my colleagues from New York on the 
committee, Eliot Engel and Anthony Weiner, also, for their tireless 
work on behalf of this legislation.
  Madam Speaker, this bill would establish the World Trade Center 
Health Program, a program to screen, monitor and treat eligible 
responders and survivors who are suffering from World Trade Center 
related diseases. It also reopens the 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund.
  H.R. 847, as amended, costs $4.2 billion over 10 years. Of that 
amount, $1.5 billion will go to the health program, while $2.7 billion 
will go the VCF. Both programs are now limited to 5 years.
  The amended bill before us today also changes how the two programs 
are paid for by a 2 percent fee on government procurement from foreign 
companies located in nongovernmental procurement, and a 1-year 
extension of H1-B and L-1 visa fees for outsourcing companies.
  Madam Speaker, this bill has long been a huge priority for me and 
many of my colleagues in the House and the Senate. I urge my colleagues 
to pass the bill.

[[Page H8959]]

  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.
  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's efforts in this regard. I 
would like to take a few moments and clear up some of the 
mischaracterizations that have occurred, unfortunately, around the 
debate of this bill as it has worked its way through both Houses.
  There have been some who have claimed that my side, the Republicans, 
do not support providing treatment for 9/11 first responders, and that 
these first responders are currently going without treatment for the 
illnesses and injuries they suffered as a result of serving at the 
World Trade Center. Both of those claims are simply not true.
  According to President Obama's administration's own Centers for 
Disease Control, the agency said, ``We will continue to provide 
monitoring and treatment services for mental and physical health 
conditions related to World Trade Center exposures for both responders 
and for eligible non-responders. The World Trade Center program is 
critical in meeting the ongoing and long-term specialty needs of 
individuals that were exposed to dust, smoke, debris, and psychological 
trauma from the World Trade Center attacks.''
  As of September 30, 2009, the World Trade Center program had enrolled 
over 55,000 responders in its monitoring and treatment programs. This 
is in the CDC's budget justification for 2011.
  At the Energy and Commerce Committee's markup of this legislation, 
Republicans offered an amendment that would authorize the program that 
is already providing treatment and monitoring benefits and authorized 
funding for the program at exactly the level that was requested by the 
President of the United States. That same amendment asked for real 
accountability to ensure that we knew how the tax dollars were being 
spent. Unfortunately, that amendment was defeated.
  I am pleased that work in the Senate has yielded an amendment that 
will provide for increased accountability and increased transparency in 
how these funds are spent. H.R. 847 caps the number of people that can 
be enrolled in the program but it does not require those enrolled to 
verify their citizenship.

                              {time}  1600

  We offered an amendment that would require this program so that 
people in the country without benefit of Social Security numbers would 
not get benefits while Americans were being stuck on the waiting list. 
This amendment was defeated.
  As with any government spending program, there should be limitations 
on who can participate. The government has limited resources, so the 
principal beneficiaries of the 9/11 health program should be the first 
responders. However, H.R. 847 provides more than just benefits to first 
responders; it also provides benefits to anyone who lives and works in 
New York City. Under this bill, even Wall Street millionaires could 
receive benefits with no cost to them, all done at the taxpayers' 
expense.
  In fact, in the Committee on Energy and Commerce I offered an 
amendment that was rejected by the committee. I attempted to offer the 
amendment at Rules when this legislation was brought before the House 
before our adjournment in September, but I was thwarted in that. But it 
remains that we ought to ensure that Federal taxpayers would not have 
to pay for the health care of millionaires.
  The bill passed by the Senate is an improvement over what passed in 
the House. There could have been further improvements to ensure our 
limited resources are being spent in the most efficient manner 
possible. But all in all, the improvements that have been accomplished 
over the last 24 hours are all to the good. This is an important piece 
of legislation. This is something that this Congress or some Congress 
should have passed in the last 8 years. And it is unconscionable that 
we are here today at the last hour of the 111th Congress with still 
this work pending. It's important to get this work done.
  I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the chairman of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. 
Waxman).
  Mr. WAXMAN. I rise in strong support, Madam Speaker, of H.R. 847, the 
James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. I want to thank 
the chairman of the Health Subcommittee, Frank Pallone, as well as my 
colleagues from New York on the committee, Eliot Engel and Anthony 
Weiner, for their relentless work on behalf of this legislation, as 
well as Representatives Maloney and Nadler, and the whole New York City 
delegation, who were tireless in their support of this bill.
  This is an important piece of legislation that will attempt to 
provide the services to first responders and community residents who 
developed illness as a result of their exposure to the massive toxic 
dust cloud that blanketed Lower Manhattan after the terrorist attack on 
September 11, 2001. I strongly urge all Members to support this 
legislation.
  H.R. 847, was reported by the Energy and Commerce Committee with 
bipartisan support on May 25 by a vote of 33-12.
  The House passed H.R. 847 on September 29; the bill received 
bipartisan support from 268 Members.
  The version of before us this afternoon is one that has been amended 
by the Senate in order to obtain bipartisan support in that Chamber.
  Like the House-passed version, the Senate version is fully paid for 
and will not increase the deficit. It fully complies with all pay-go 
rules.
  The World Trade Center Health Program currently provides services to 
first responders and community residents who developed illnesses as a 
result of their exposure to the massive toxic dust cloud that blanketed 
lower Manhattan after the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.
  The current program is not authorized. The House-passed bill 
authorized the Health Program through FY 2019 at a federal funding 
level of $3.2 billion. The federal government will pay 90 percent of 
the cost, while New York City will pay 10 percent.
  The Senate amendment reduces the authorization period to FY 2015 and 
federal funding to $1.5 billion. New York City would still be required 
to pay 10 percent of the costs.
  The Senate amendment makes a number of other changes in the Health 
Program.
  It prohibits the Secretary of HHS from using NIOSH to administer 
payments to Centers of Excellence and other participating providers.
  It clarifies that Centers of Excellence delivering services to 
responders and community residents will have to provide claims-level 
data to the Health Program Administrator.
  It clarifies the Centers of Excellence should be paid for the costs 
of carrying out the program that are not otherwise reimbursable, such 
as outreach, data collection, social services, and development of 
treatment protocols.
  It authorizes the Program Administrator to contract with the VA to 
provide services to responders enrolled in the national program through 
its facilities, but only if the VA chooses to do so.
  Finally, the Senate amendment directs the GAO to conduct studies on 
various aspects of the Health Program and to report to the Committees 
of jurisdiction prior to July 1, 2011. That is the date on which 
Secretary of HHS and the WTC Administrator are responsible for 
implementing the Health Program. In the likely event that the GAO is 
unable to complete all of its work by that date, the Program will 
nonetheless begin furnishing services to responders and survivors.
  The Administration supports this bill for the same reason that all of 
us should: it is the right thing to do.
  The first responders were there for us on 9-11. We should be there 
for them today.
  I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and send it on to the 
President for signature.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).
  Mr. COLE. I thank the gentleman from Texas for yielding.
  Madam Speaker, long before New York City's first responders rushed to 
save their fellow Americans in the fire and the horror of 9/11, they 
came to help the people of Oklahoma City deal with the death and 
destruction stemming from the terrorist bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah 
Federal Building on April 19, 1995. The people of Oklahoma have never 
forgotten the help that they received in their most difficult days from 
the first responders of New York City and their fellow first responders 
from all across North America.
  When 9/11 occurred, Oklahoma's first responders were proud to join 
their fellow Americans and rush to the aid of a stricken New York City. 
Now it's our turn in this body to help all of those

[[Page H8960]]

who answered the call of duty on 9/11. They risked themselves to save 
others and to help one of America's great cities deal with and recover 
from the devastation of the greatest terrorist attack in our history. 
It's time, as our greatest President said in an earlier era and in 
another context, ``to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for him who 
shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and for his orphan.''
  Madam Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 847, as amended.
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to one of the sponsors 
of the bill who has worked tirelessly on this, the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. Nadler).
  Mr. NADLER of New York. Madam Speaker, let me first thank everyone 
who has worked on this bill and say the Senate passed this bill a 
little while ago unanimously. The most conservative Senators, Senators 
Enzi and Coburn, supported it, and I hope we can do the same.
  Nine years ago, Madam Speaker, the heroes of 9/11 ran into the 
buildings, they rushed into the burning buildings, and they worked in a 
toxic environment for weeks and months. They have suffered for that. 
They have suffered for their service to this country by getting sick, 
by dying, by being sick. It is now up to us to see that the United 
States honors its heroes, that the United States does not turn its back 
on those who served us.
  When we pass this bill, we will answer the question of whether the 
United States honors its heroes, and whether the United States honors 
itself. Let us pass this bill, let us redeem the honor of the United 
States after all these years, let us show the world that the United 
States looks after its own. That's what this bill is. I urge everyone 
to support it.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. Brady), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Madam Speaker, I too support the goal of ensuring 
that the brave men and women that acted as first responders at the 
World Trade Center attack are fairly treated and compensated. But I 
rise today to oppose the troubling provisions the majority has attached 
to pay for this bill.
  This measure would impose a 2 percent tax on goods and services that 
are produced or provided in certain foreign countries from firms that 
are based in foreign countries that are not parties to certain treaties 
or international agreements. It sounds complicated. But some analysis 
suggests that a significant majority of this tax, at least two-thirds, 
if not more, would be raised by taxing contracts that support American 
troops stationed in the Afghan and Iraqi theaters. Even more 
incredible, this tax could apply to American companies that are 
providing goods and services to our troops through local subsidiaries. 
Levying additional taxes on companies that support American troops is 
both illogical and dangerous.
  In addition, there is no reason that other countries wouldn't copy 
this tax and impose it on our U.S. companies that are competing to sell 
goods and services overseas. This would hurt our U.S. economic recovery 
efforts and efforts to boost U.S. sales abroad and create American jobs 
here at home. Moreover, I have real concerns that this excise tax could 
be subject to legal challenge at the World Trade Organization and may 
be inconsistent with our G-20 commitments to avoid imposing new 
protectionist measures.
  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote because of these provisions. 
Strangely, the proposed procurement tax doesn't include any of the 
exceptions included in our standard Buy America legislation, such as 
non-availability, unreasonable cost and inconsistency with the public 
interest. As a result, the bill would mandate a tax on the procurement 
of goods from a foreign producer even when U.S. goods aren't available.
  In addition to this new tax, the bill would extend a tax on companies 
that have more than half their employees on certain specialized visas 
to work here in the United States. This tax raises independent concerns 
under our international obligations.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.
  Mr. BURGESS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.
  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Finally, I would like to have printed in the 
Record a letter from 10 key business associations, including the 
Emergency Committee for American Trade and the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, that also oppose the use of these pay-for provisions.

                                                December 21, 2010.
     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,
     Speaker, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. John Boehner,
     Republican Leader, House of Representatives,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Harry Reid,
     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,
     Washington, DC.
     Hon. Mitch McConnell,
     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,
     Washington, DC.
       Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leaders Reid, Boehner, and 
     McConnell: We are writing to urge you to remove from the 
     proposed amended version of H.R. 847 the Title III revenue 
     raisers related to international government procurement. 
     First, its purported revenue raising benefits are highly 
     questionable. Second, there is a high risk that it will 
     undermine the international competitiveness of American 
     companies and American workers.
       Title III would impose an excise tax on companies that are 
     from foreign countries which are not members of the World 
     Trade Organization (WTO) Government Procurement Agreement 
     (GPA) or similar procurement arrangements ostensibly for the 
     purpose of helping finance health benefits for the valiant 9/
     11 first responders. In reality, the U.S. federal government 
     is already prohibited from procuring from such countries, 
     except under very limited conditions--when the good or 
     service is not available in the United States or would cost 
     an unreasonable amount or if the procurement is required for 
     the national interest. Moreover, the amount of such 
     procurement is generally regarded as relatively small 
     compared to U.S. sales into the procurement markets of these 
     countries.
       The procurement portions of this legislation would 
     undermine U.S. efforts to succeed in the international 
     economy by both inviting non-GPA countries to take reciprocal 
     action against U.S. companies seeking to participate in their 
     procurement markets and by opening the United States to 
     retaliation for violating its WTO obligations. While U.S. 
     companies certainly face significant and discriminatory 
     procurement barriers in China, India, Brazil and other 
     countries that are not part of the WTO procurement agreement, 
     U.S. companies are still selling more into those government 
     procurement markets than the United States is purchasing from 
     those countries. As a result, there would more than likely be 
     net loss for U.S. exports, U.S. companies and U.S. jobs if 
     this provision became a model for foreign governments.
       Furthermore, the imposition of this discriminatory tax on 
     foreign companies may also violate U.S. international 
     commitments if implemented. If found to be contrary to U.S. 
     WTO commitments, other countries could end up being 
     authorized to retaliate directly against U.S. exports, 
     further undermining U.S. opportunities overseas.
       For all of these reasons, we strongly urge you to remove 
     the Title III procurement provisions from this legislation.
           Respectfully,

         Association of Equipment Manufacturers (AEM);

  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the Speaker of the 
House, who has done so much to make this bill possible.
  Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I rise 
to briefly congratulate and thank the Members of the New York 
delegation and others who helped bring this legislation to the floor in 
a strong bipartisan way: Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Nadler, 
Congressman King. Thank you. We thank you for giving us the opportunity 
to say ``thank you'' in a real way to our first responders, to our 
firefighters, to those who rushed in without question to rescue their 
fellow Americans, and people from all over the country as a matter of 
fact.
  There is an exhilaration, Madam Speaker, that you see in the Chamber, 
because right now we know that any discussion we have ever had about 9/
11 has been a discussion where we have entered holy and sacred ground, 
where people lost their lives. Fewer did because others were willing to 
risk theirs. For over 9 years we have been

[[Page H8961]]

trying to redress the grievance that we have of people not having the 
health benefits and the recognition of their service, their sacrifice, 
and their courage.
  Today Mr. King, Congresswoman Maloney, Congressman Nadler--I should 
say Congressman King, Chairman King to be--and the leadership of this 
House and of the United States Senate, and I thank Senator Gillibrand 
and Senator Schumer as well as Senator Reid and the Republican 
leadership in the Senate for affording us this opportunity to extend 
our patriotic appreciation to those whose love of our country, whose 
care and commitment to their fellow person, who unquestionably made 
sacrifices, and now, almost 9\1/2\ years later, more than 9 years later 
we finally are doing the right thing for them.

                              {time}  1610

  Every day our firefighters, our police officers, our first responders 
leave their homes, willing to risk their lives. Little did they know on 
that day many of them would not return home. How can we ever repay 
their sacrifice and their courage?
  So, today we do so, certainly not enough, but as a token of our 
appreciation for what they have done to strengthen our country.
  Again, I thank all of those who made this important legislation 
possible.
  Mr. BURGESS. May I inquire as to how much time remains?
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 7\1/2\ minutes 
remaining, and the gentleman from New Jersey has 10\1/2\ minutes 
remaining.
  Mr. BURGESS. I yield myself 30 seconds.
  Madam Speaker, Congressman Brady articulated very well some of the 
concerns he has with the pay-for that is in this bill, raising new 
revenues through tariffs, and the possibility of retaliatory efforts by 
other countries.
  I would just point out, in section 4002 of the recently passed health 
care law last March, there is a section that calls for a Public Health 
and Wellness Trust Fund. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has 
$15 billion in a slush fund in ObamaCare. This money could have been 
easily used to pay for this legislation. It could have been done last 
April, and we wouldn't be here at the last minute trying to scrounge 
for capital to pay these funds.
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
New York (Mrs. Maloney), who is the prime sponsor of the legislation 
and has worked so hard on this bill.
  (Mrs. MALONEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend her 
remarks.)
  Mrs. MALONEY. I thank all of my colleagues, especially the New York 
delegation and the Speaker and Leader Hoyer.
  Today, Congress repays a long overdue debt and answers the emergency 
calls of our ailing 9/11 first responders and survivors. This bill will 
save lives. It has taken too long, but help finally is here for the 
thousands of Americans who are suffering because of 9/11.
  Our bill will give support and hope to more than 36,000 Americans who 
are ailing because of the attacks on our Nation. It also says to future 
generations that if you are harmed in the service of our country, you 
will be taken care of.
  I couldn't be more proud of everyone who fought like hell to pass 
this bill, our Senators Gillibrand and Schumer, my good friends and 
coauthors Nadler and King, the 9/11 responders and survivors who are 
here with us, and the thousands of their brothers and sisters who could 
not be. John Feal, you have been a warrior for this bill. Thank you.
  Just after the attacks, this body came together. With this bill, we 
put in law that we will never forget and do whatever it takes.
  Madam Speaker, today, I proudly rise to support the James Zadroga 9/
11 Health and Compensation Act. Passing this bill and getting it to the 
President's desk will truly be a Christmas miracle.
  When Jerry Nadler and I first introduced a 9/11 bill, we never would 
have thought it could take 7 years or that it could be the last 
legislative item out the door. It should never have taken so long.
  A TV commentator recently made a good point when he said that Pearl 
Harbor was not just a Hawaii issue and neither should caring for the 
victims of 9/11 be a New York issue. The Twin Towers were attacked as a 
symbol of our Nation and the sick and injured are not just from New 
York. After the attacks, at least 10,000 brave men and women came from 
all 50 states and 428 of 435 Congressional districts.
  I thank my colleagues from across the country for staying to complete 
the last remaining gap in America's response to 9/11. Our bill will 
give support and hope to the more than 36,000 Americans who are ailing 
because of the attacks on our Nation, and it also says to future 
generations that if you are harmed in the service of America, you will 
be taken care of.
  I especially thank my good friends and co-authors Jerry Nadler and 
Peter King, the entire New York Delegation, and Speaker Pelosi and 
Majority Leader Hoyer, who all helped pass this bill in September and 
are working on it today. I thank Senators Gillibrand and Schumer for 
tireless efforts to get this bill done.
  This long-overdue legislation will provide health care and financial 
compensation to the responders and survivors who are sick from exposure 
to toxins at Ground Zero. The cost of the bill has been cut almost in 
half to $4.3 billion from $7.4 billion. The Victim Compensation Fund 
will be funded for 5 years at $2.8 billion and the health programs will 
be fully funded for 5 years at $1.5 billion. I thank Members of the 
other body for coming to this bipartisan compromise.
  The offset has been entirely replaced with two other offsets and in 
addition to fully funding this bill, the procurement payfor will put an 
estimated $450 million in extra revenue toward the deficit.
  We are reminded this holiday season of the importance of giving. But 
today I ask my colleagues to remember all that the heroes of 9/11 have 
already given. These individuals rushed to the site of immeasurable 
danger and first gave their time, and later are giving up their health, 
and in some cases their lives.
  Nine long years have passed since the attacks. It was never the 
intention of the bill's authors to make this a partisan issue and I 
regret that it has become wrapped in party politics.
  I hope that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can come 
together, just as we stood together on the steps of the Capitol the 
evening of September 11, 2001, to show our gratitude to the responders 
and survivors who have given so much to our country.
  There could be no better gift to America this holiday season than 
helping save the lives of those who came to the aid of our Nation in a 
time of war.
  Mr. BURGESS. I reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
Engel) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. ENGEL. I rise in strong support of this bill. This is a fitting 
way to end the 111th Congress. This is the proudest moment I have had 
in Congress in 22 years. I believe that our hard work paid off, all of 
us together on the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee.
  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the James Zadroga 9/11 
Health Compensation Act. As a member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee I was proud to help shepherd this bill through the committee 
process and am proud to speak in support of this legislation yet again 
on the House floor this year.
  Two days ago, I joined New York City Mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and 
other members of the New York delegation, and first responders to urge 
swift passage of this bill in the Senate.
  Madam speaker, it is shameful that we are approaching the 10-year 
anniversary of 9-11 next year and this bill still has not reached the 
President for his signature.
  Now I am here again today to urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
the package that we are considering today, which rectifies some of the 
concerns that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have 
expressed.
  This is not a partisan issue, and the package that we consider today 
reflects that.
  People from all over the country joined to help after the attack 
without concern for their health or wellbeing. Now it is their 
country's time to step-up in their time of need. Victims of 9-11 
continue to suffer from crippling physical ailments. They are dying and 
have been ignored for almost a decade. The House noticed, once already 
this year. I am hopeful that we can send a bill to the Senate that will 
pass.
  I look forward to casting my vote in support of the James Zadroga 9/
11 Health Compensation Act and sending it back to the Senate.
  I am proud of the role that we played on the Health Subcommittee and 
the Energy and Commerce with our hearings and markups in moving this 
bill through. This is not a New

[[Page H8962]]

York issue; this is an American Issue. First responders came from all 
parts of the country. The Federal Government falsely told everyone it 
was safe to return and it wasn't.
  Today we say thank you to our first responders--it is a fitting way 
to end the 111th Congress.
  Mr. BURGESS. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
  Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley) for 
the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
  (Mr. CROWLEY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.)
  Mr. CROWLEY. Madam Speaker, on September 11, my cousin, John Moran, 
was at Tower Two of the World Trade Center. He said, ``Let me off here. 
I want to try and make a difference.''
  We have made a difference today in the lives of the people we're 
saving.
  Today, I rise as the cousin of Battalion Chief John Moran.
  My cousin, along with almost 3,000 others, died on September 11, 
2001.
  His last known words were to the driver of the New York City Fire 
Department vehicle. As he was dropped off at World Trade Center Tower 
2, John said, `Let me off here. I am going to try to make a 
difference.'
  Nothing can replace the loss of my cousin or the thousands of others 
who were killed that day. Nothing can replace the loss of those who 
have perished since.
  But, today we can make proud his memory and the memory of all those 
who served on September 11th and the days following.
  Enactment of the James Zadroga 9-11 Health and Compensation Act 
fulfills a commitment to those who served our Nation honorably, 
tirelessly and without pause.
  Today, I am proud to stand before my colleagues as the cousin of 
Battalion Chief John Moran, and I am proud, in the words of John, to 
`make a difference' for the many heroes who have suffered long enough 
because of their service to our great country.

  Mr. PALLONE. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) 
for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.
  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to revise 
and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. I thank the distinguished gentleman, and I 
rise to support the Senate amendment to H.R. 847, to be able to thank 
Carolyn Maloney for the enormous work and to also cite those who I saw 
dying that they might live.
  Madam Speaker I rise today in strong support of H.R. 847, the ``James 
Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.'' This bill has been a long 
time coming, and I am glad that it is finally here for us to provide 
medical monitoring and treatment benefits to eligible emergency 
responders and recovery and cleanup workers who responded to the 
September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. This legislation also allows for 
initial health evaluation, monitoring, and treatment benefits to 
residents and other building occupants and area workers in New York 
City who were directly impacted and adversely affected by the 9/11 
terrorist attacks.
  I have met firsthand many of these first responders and workers, and 
I know the patriotic sacrifices they have made for their fellow 
Americans. These brave, selfless individuals who put aside their own 
needs and fears to come to the aid of their fellow Americans put their 
lives at risk. They ventured into the wreckage and dust of the World 
Trade Center, not worrying about their own well being, but rather, 
hoping that they could save the lives of strangers. As a result of 
their fearless acts, many of these emergency workers and first 
responders were exposed to airborne toxins and other hazards. Providing 
medical services, including clinical examinations, long-term health 
monitoring, mental health care and necessary prescription drug 
coverage, is the least we can do to repay them for their efforts.
  The James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act will provide both 
initial and follow-up medical services for World Trade Center 
responders and workers whose physical and mental health were impacted 
by the 9/11 attacks. H.R. 847 will also establish an outreach program 
to potentially eligible individuals.
  September 11, 2001, is a day that is indelibly etched in the psyche 
of every American and most of the world. Much like the unprovoked 
attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, September 11 is a day that 
will live in infamy. And as much as Pearl Harbor changed the course of 
world history by precipitating the global struggle between totalitarian 
fascism and representative democracy, the transformative impact of 
September 11 in the course of American and human history is indelible. 
September 11 was not only the beginning of the Global War on Terror, 
but moreover, it was the day of innocence lost for a new generation of 
Americans.
  Just like my fellow Americans, I remember September 11 as vividly as 
if it was yesterday. In my mind's eye, I can still remember being 
mesmerized by the television as the two airliners crashed into the Twin 
Towers of the World Trade Center, and I remember the sense of terror we 
experienced when we realized that this was no accident, that we had 
been attacked, and that the world as we know it had changed forever. 
The moment in which the Twin Towers collapsed and the nearly 3,000 
innocent Americans died haunts me until this day.
  At this moment, I decided that the protection of our homeland would 
be at the forefront of my legislative agenda. I knew that all of our

[[Page H8963]]

collective efforts as Americans would all be in vain if we did not 
achieve our most important priority: the security of our nation. 
Accordingly, I became then and continue to this day to be an active and 
engaged Member of the Committee on Homeland Security who considers our 
national security paramount.
  Our nation's collective response to the tragedy of September 11 
exemplified what has been true of the American people since the 
inception of our Republic--in times of crisis, we come together and 
always persevere. Despite the depths of our anguish on the preceding 
day, on September 12, the American people demonstrated their compassion 
and solidarity for one another as we began the process of response, 
recovery, and rebuilding. We transcended our differences and came 
together to honor the sacrifices and losses sustained by the countless 
victims of September 11. Let us honor those who served and sacrificed 
by passing H.R. 847.
  Madam Speaker, as I stand here today, my heart still grieves for 
those who perished on flights United Airlines 93, American Airlines 77, 
American Airlines 11, and United Airlines 175. When the sun rose on the 
morning of September 11, none of us knew that it would end in an 
inferno in the magnificent World Trade Center Towers in New York City, 
the Pentagon in Washington, DC, and in the grassy fields of 
Shanksville, Pennsylvania. How I wish we could have hugged and kissed 
and held each of the victims one last time.
  I stand here remembering those who still suffer, whose hearts still 
ache over the loss of so many innocent and interrupted lives. My prayer 
is that for those who lost a father, a mother, a husband, a wife, a 
child, or a friend will in the days and years ahead take comfort in the 
certain knowledge that they have gone on to claim the greatest prize, a 
place in the Lord's loving arms. And down here on the ground, their 
memory will never die so long as any of the many of us who loved them 
lives.
  Again, I would like to reiterate my strong support for H.R. 847, the 
James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, for it is important 
that we take care of those who take care of us in our time of need.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey will be 
charged.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. King).
  Mr. KING of New York. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I will keep 
my remarks very brief.
  I thank the Congress of the United States for what it is going to do 
today. Especially I want to thank Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler for 
the tremendous work they have done on this bill over the years from the 
very start. I want to thank Congressman Vito Fossella, who was also an 
original cosponsor of this. I want to thank the Speaker of the House, 
Ms. Pelosi, for doing so much to bring this bill forward, and also the 
Republican leader, who this summer managed to have this bill come up in 
a way that was not going to be disruptive at all.

                              {time}  1620

  I want to thank all the members of the New York delegation. Most 
importantly, I want to thank the firefighters, the police officers, the 
construction workers, and all of those who came forward to answer the 
Nation's call on September 11. This is a great victory for the American 
people. It's a great victory for the Congress of the United States. And 
it sends a signal that we stand by those who come to our Nation's 
defense in time of trouble and, indeed, in time of war, because this 
was the first battle of the great war of the 21st century.
  Mr. PALLONE. I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of 
my time.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.
  This is an important bill. It's something that should have been done 
a long time ago. I credit a former New York fireman, Richard Lasky, who 
is now my fire chief in Lewisville, Texas, for helping me understand 
the importance of this bill as it has gone forward. It has been 
difficult. In my opinion, there were better ways to do this bill, but 
it's before us today.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, we need to ensure that the 
first responders and individuals who were in the vicinity of the World 
Trade Center have access to the specialized medical treatment they need 
and that means ensuring these programs are properly funded.
  H.R. 847 accomplishes that goal and I am proud to be a cosponser of 
this bill.
  Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois. I find it appalling that a bill of this 
magnitude was amended in the Senate just hours before the House was 
asked to vote on it, with no Member having had the chance to review and 
deliberate on what we were voting on and enacting into law. When 
earlier versions of this bill were brought to the floor I had some 
major reservations and with no way to know if all of these were 
addressed I would not feel comfortable voting yes or no on this bill.
  Mr. HOLT. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to 
the Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act of 2010. As a cosponsor of 
the House bill, I urge passage of this important bill.
  Today, we have the opportunity to honor the rescue and recovery 
workers who served our nation after the devastating attacks at the 
World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and, more important than empty 
honor, to provide for their care. My district suffered casualities that 
day and nine years later, the memory of that terrible day is still 
fresh in our minds.
  Along with the victims of 9/11, there were thousands of rescue and 
recovery workers who came to the aid of our nation that day. These 
brave women and men rushed to Ground Zero to help the fallen and to 
participate in the clean-up effort without thinking about their health 
or safety. These workers were exposed to environmental hazards and have 
developed significant respiratory illnesses, chronic infections, and 
other medical conditions. Further, many first responders are only now 
being diagnosed with illnesses that are related to their exposure at 
Ground Zero.
  This bill would create the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) 
that would provide medical monitoring and treatment benefits to first 
responders and workers who were directly affected by the attacks. 
Additionally, the program would establish education and outreach 
programs and conduct research on physical and mental health conditions 
related to the 9/11 attacks. The WTCHP program would serve more than 
75,000 survivors, recovery workers, and members of the affected 
communities.
  Additionally, this bill provides long-term health care and 
compensation for thousands of responders and survivors. By passing this 
bill, we will be paying tribute to the sacrifice and courage of these 
women and men and we will be paying a debt. This bill will be paid for 
with a partnership with New York City and by reducing government 
procurement payments and the extension of fees for outsourcing 
companies.
  Unfortunately, this bill is a weaker version of the bill that I 
cosponsored and that the House passed in September. The bill caps 
federal funding for health programs over five years and allows first 
responders only five years to file claims. Unfortunately, some put 
politics over these brave first responders. Although this bill is a 
reduced version of the original bill, we must honor the rescue and 
recovery workers by providing them with the much needed health care. We 
cannot let our first responders down.
  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Madam Speaker, I was absent for legislative 
business and missed rollcall vote 663 on December 21, 2010, and 
rollcall vote 664 on December 22, 2010. Had I been present, I would 
have voted ``yes'' on H.R. 6547, the Protecting Students from Sexual 
and Violent Predators Act, and ``no'' on rollcall vote 664 (H.R. 847).
  The vote I wish to discuss is the bill H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/
11 Health and Compensation Act. Without a doubt, Republicans and 
Democrats can agree that both the victims of the attacks on September 
11, 2001, and the first responders who bravely served following the 
attacks deserve to be fairly treated and compensated. However, this 
bill would create a new health care entitlement, the World Trade Center 
Health Program, while also extending eligibility for compensation under 
the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001. As a result, had I 
been present, I would have voted against passage of the bill.
  Since the terrorist attacks occurred nearly nine years ago, I have 
supported legislation to ensure that these individuals are cared for 
and receive access to the services they deserve. However, rather than 
working with Republicans to craft a bill which truly addressed the 
shortcomings in care provided to those directly impacted by the 
September 11th terrorist attacks, the Majority instead rushed this bill 
to the floor in the waning hours of the 111th Congress, refusing to 
allow an open debate or consider amendments.
  The result is a deeply flawed bill. H.R. 847 creates yet another 
mandatory spending program--increasing spending by $4.2 billion dollars 
over 10 years--and paying for it by an excise tax on foreign 
manufacturers, an extension of Travel Promotion Act fees, and the 
extension of HI-B visa fees.
  There is no doubt that we owe a debt of gratitude to those who came 
to the rescue of countless individuals following the attacks on 
September 11, 2001, but these provisions distort that noble goal. At a 
time when our budget

[[Page H8964]]

deficit is $1.3 trillion and our national debt stands at $13.8 
trillion, we must accurately account for those programs that take 
priority. I remain hopeful that as the 112th Congress convenes, my 
colleagues and I can work together to reform some of my concerns with 
this proposal and truly provide the services these first responders 
deserve.
  Mrs. McCARTHY of New York. Madam Speaker, with the ninth anniversary 
of September 11th having passed, it is important to remember not only 
those who were lost that tragic day, but also the sense of purpose and 
togetherness that shined in the aftermath of, no doubt, one of the most 
difficult days in our nation's history. Heroic first responders deserve 
utmost recognition for selflessly digging through the ruins of Lower 
Manhattan in hope of finding survivors. The James Zadroga 9/11 Health 
and Compensation Act, a bill that I am proud to be an original 
cosponsor of, provides just that by extending and improving protections 
and services to individuals directly impacted by the terrorist attacks 
on September 11, 2001.
  Since our inception, we, as a nation, have grown stronger by 
protecting and honoring the sacrifices of our citizenry. This 
legislation is the embodiment of that mantra. As a New Yorker, not a 
day passes without thought of the horrific attacks of September 11th, 
this legislation will no doubt go a long way to provide first-
responders with peace of mind.
  During House floor consideration and passage of the James Zadroga 9/
11 Health and Compensation Act on Wednesday, I was unavoidably absent 
from Washington due to a family health emergency. I have had the 
privilege of working closely with my New York colleagues in both the 
House and Senate on this legislation, and I am extraordinarily happy 
that the Congress was able to pass this bill before the adjournment of 
the 111th Congress.
  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of legislation that 
would help thousands of first responders who were exposed to hazardous 
health conditions in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks.
  Many first responders bravely answered the call of duty and rushed to 
the scene of the attacks. While they were helping out the victims, the 
responders unknowingly were exposed to long-term physical and mental 
health problems due to the residual dust, toxins, and chemicals from 
the attacks. Congress and the federal government have an obligation and 
a responsibility to care and help those who responded to the September 
11th attacks.
  Madam Speaker, let us not forget the sacrifice and service of those 
brave individuals who responded to one of the worst attacks in American 
history. I am pleased that my colleagues in the Senate were able to 
come to a bipartisan agreement on this bill. I urge my House colleagues 
to support this legislation so that the thousands of 9/11 responders 
can get the help they need.
  Mr. RANGEL. Madam Speaker, I rise today, nine years after the tragic 
events of September 11, to recognize the passage of a bill that will 
allow the first responders who rushed to the scene that day to now be 
able to get the health care resources they need.
  Today, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate approved 
an amended version, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act 
that would provide medical treatment for the ailing first responders 
and recovery workers who were exposed to toxic dust following the 
collapse of the Twin Towers in New York City on September 11, 2001.
  This victory is for what is right; a long overdue thank you to those 
who rushed in to help after what was one of our nation's biggest 
tragedies. After nine long years, these unsung heroes and their 
families no longer have to worry about how they are going to get the 
care and resources they so desperately need.
  The Zadraga bill originally passed the House in September, but had 
been held up in the Senate due to various partisan concerns. It now 
goes to President Barack Obama, who is expected to sign the bill into 
law before the end of the holiday season.
  This should have never been about the money, but about what we should 
do to honor those who thought of their country first and not 
themselves. They answered the call when their country needed them and 
we are all a better nation for it.
  Thanks to the hard work of so many people--from legislators, like our 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the New York Congressional Delegation and 
House Leadership, to the NYS AFL-CIO President Dennis Hughes, the 32nd 
Fire Commissioner Salvatore Cassano and the countless union officials 
and 911 families that traveled to Washington to lobby on the bill's 
behalf--these patriotic Americans can spend the holiday seasons with 
some peace of mind.
  What the law would do: Under an agreement worked out by New York 
Senators Charles Schumer and Kristen Gillibrand, the James Zadroga 9/11 
Health and Compensation Act would: provide a total of $4.3 billion in 
funding for the health and compensation titles of the bill; cap federal 
funding for the health program over five years at $1.5 billion (New 
York City will contribute 10% of the cost). Any funds not spent in the 
first five years may be carried over and expended in the sixth year of 
the program; reopen the Victim Compensation Fund (VCF) for five years 
to file claims, with payments to be made over six years. Fund the VCF 
at $2.8 billion for six years, with $.8 billion available for payments 
in the first five years and $2.0 billion available for payment in year 
six. Claims will be paid in 2 installments--one payment in the first 
five years, and a second payment in the sixth year of the program; the 
pay for the House-passed version of the bill has been replaced by a 2 
percent fee on government procurement from foreign companies located in 
non-GPA countries and a one-year extension of H-B 1 and L-1 Visa fees 
for outsourcing companies. These are estimated by CBO to collect $4.59 
billion over the 10-year scoring period for the bill.
  Others changes made in the bill to address Republican concerns: 
requiring that the Centers of Excellence report claims data to HHS so 
that costs and utilization of services can be fully monitored; 
specifying the non-treatment services furnished by Centers of 
Excellence to be funded under the health program (e.g., outreach, 
social services, data collection, and development of treatment 
protocols); authorizing the World Trade Center Program Administrator to 
designate the Veteran's Administration as a provider for WTC health 
services; directing the Special Master to develop rules to implement 
the VCF within 180 days of passage of the legislation.
  Mr. ACKERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise yet again in the strongest 
possible support of the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, H.R. 847.
  Today, we must show the American people that their representatives 
can put away their differences and work together to pass this bill. 
Over the past few weeks, this clearly was not the case. Some Members of 
Congress have played political games with this legislation, delaying 
its passage for dubious reasons and causing the measure to be watered 
down. The sick and injured don't care about offsets and they don't care 
whether this is a $6 billion bill or a $7 billion bill. They just care 
about getting the medical care they need, the medical care they rightly 
deserve.
  So Madam Speaker, we are here for the third and I hope final time on 
the floor of the House to consider doing the decent thing: helping the 
living victims of 9/11 who continue to suffer the terrible effects of 
that day. The Federal Government has not stepped up enough to help the 
responders, volunteers, workers and residents that went to Ground Zero 
during and after the horrific 9/11 attack. This Congress has not acted 
to help these victims on a permanent basis--we have the opportunity to 
do that today. Tragically, some of the very people that we want to help 
with this legislation have already died. Thousands of Americans who 
responded need medical treatment now. Thousands more will need 
treatment in the future.
  So, Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the 9/11 
Health and Compensation Act so that all the victims of 9/11 will 
receive the medical care and help they need and deserve. Let's pass 
this bill.
  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today in full support of 
H.R. 847, the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. This bill 
will provide the needed assistance to the brave men and women who have 
become ill due to the dangerous toxins they inhaled while risking their 
lives to help out the city of New York during that tragic time in 
September of 2001. This is a bipartisan bill and should be supported by 
all Members of Congress.
  These heroes risked their lives to assist their fellow Americans and 
their efforts will never go unnoticed. This bill will allow health 
benefits to a wide range of first responders such as firefighters, 
construction workers, residents, area workers and even school 
children--all of whom have been affected by the toxins that filled the 
air after the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001.
  We all witnessed the terrible attacks on America, September 11, 2001 
and we also witnessed the acts of bravery by our first responders. I 
support the passage of the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.
  Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the James 
Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. Every American remembers the 
day the Twin Towers fell and the unparalleled heroism of the first 
responders who saved countless lives without any regard for their own. 
They showed courage in the face of terror and strength in a path of 
destruction. Too many of these brave men and women didn't make it out 
of the wreckage in time. Those who did returned every day for months, 
sifting through rubble, recovering victims and restoring order to 
Ground Zero with little consideration for their own welfare or safety.
  Tragically, many of these selfless workers are now suffering chronic, 
disabling health conditions as a direct result of injuries or toxic 
exposure sustained at the site. The bill before

[[Page H8965]]

us creates a program to provide medical services and health monitoring 
for first responders and others who have medical conditions related to 
the September 11 terrorist attacks. Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my 
colleagues to support this measure and finally show these heroes the 
same honor and respect they showed us, our families, our friends and 
our country.
  Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I am proud to say that we are finally 
doing the right thing to support our heroes from 9/11. The agreement we 
have here today is much less than we originally hoped for--but more 
than four and a half years after the death of NYPD Det. James Zadroga--
I am here to say that we need to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and 
Compensation Act right now because we are losing these brave souls as 
we speak.
  I'm sad to say its now been nine years since 9/11 and it has taken 
this long to pass the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act--
nine years is too long to wait and watch as our first responders from 
that day continue to suffer physically and emotionally--nine years is 
late, BUT its not too late to do the right thing. We need to pass this 
bill and we need to pass it now. Nine years ago we gave those brave 
souls the `all clear' sign, but we now know that we were exposing those 
men and women to a poisonous dust that would stay with them for the 
rest of their lives.
  I am proud to say that we found a way to pay for this bill so that we 
can do the right thing for our 9/11 workers AND for our children who 
will bear the debt of the decisions we make today.
  Let me be clear, this isn't just a bill for New York and New Jersey--
this is a bill for all Americans. We know that people from all 50 
states were in lower Manhattan on or after 9/11 and now are facing 
serious health concerns--there are 435 Congressional Districts and 431 
of them are represented by the names of constituents on the World Trade 
Center Health Registry.
  After 9/11 we all said we would be there for these brave first 
responders--but today if we vote against this bill we are asking those 
same brave individuals to come to Washington, year after year to fight 
for their health benefits--do we expect them to come here ten years 
from now? By then it may be too late for many of these men and women 
who responded to their nation's call of duty.
  I urge all my colleagues to support the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and 
Compensation Act--once and for all let us stand up for these brave 
Americans.
  Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Speaker, today the House will consider the James 
Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.
  More than 70,000 Americans from every state descended upon ground 
zero to help recover and rebuild after 9/11. Some have died from 
illnesses as a result and more than 17,000 who are ill lack the care 
they need.
  Just as we provide medical care for our troops, we must care for 
those who heroically responded.
  Passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act is a 
milestone for our nation, as we finally fulfill our obligation to those 
who sacrificed so much for us. Our nation owes a debt of gratitude that 
can never be fully repaid to the September 11 responders who died or 
were sickened as a result of their brave and selfless actions.
  Nearly all of us represent a responder, and almost nine years later, 
have a duty to do what is right--vote for this bill today.
  Mr. BURGESS. I yield back the balance of my time and urge support of 
the bill.
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I would urge passage of this bill and 
send it to the President.
  I yield back the balance of my time.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.
  Pursuant to the order of the House of today, the previous question is 
ordered.
  The question is on the motion by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
Pallone).
  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.
  Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
  The yeas and nays were ordered.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 206, 
nays 60, not voting 168, as follows:

                             [Roll No. 664]

                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (during the vote). The Chair will remind all 
persons in the gallery that they are here as guests of the House and 
that

[[Page H8966]]

any manifestation of approval or disapproval of proceedings is in 
violation of the rules of the House.

                              {time}  1736

  Mr. TERRY and BACHUS changed their vote from ``yea'' to ``nay.''
  So the motion was agreed to.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
  Stated for:
  Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I was absent on Wednesday, December 22, 
2010. I had legislative business in the district. Had I been present, I 
would have voted in support of the Motion to Concur in the Senate 
Amendment to H.R. 847--James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.
  Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I was absent on December 22, 2010. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ``yes'' on H.R. 847--James Zadroga 9/11 
Health and Compensation Act.
  Mr. BRALEY of Iowa. Madam Speaker, I regret missing floor votes on 
today, December 22, 2010 due to travel. If I was present, I would have 
voted: ``yea'' on rollcall 664, motion to concur in the Senate 
Amendment to H.R. 847--James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act.
  Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, today I missed rollcall vote 
664 on H.R. 847. Had I been present I would have voted ``aye.''
  Ms. HERSETH SANDLIN. Madam Speaker, I regret that I was unable to 
participate in one vote on the floor of the House of Representatives 
today.
  The vote was the Motion to Concur in the Senate Amendment to H.R. 
847--James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act. Had I been 
present, I would have voted ``yea'' on that question.
  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably absent for votes in 
the House Chamber today. I would like the record to show that, had I
