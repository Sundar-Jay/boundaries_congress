                             From so Little

     From so little . . .
     Can come so much!
     From so humble beginnings . . .
     Can, come as such . . .
     Greatness, that only a heart can bring . . .
     As from life's mistakes . . .
     But, comes life's lessons . . . time and time again such 
           blessings!
     For only in open hearts, will so ring!
     In the kind, that dares great men to dream great dreams!
     Who come from almost nothing!
     To grow and involve, all into a many splendid thing!
     As from such humble beginnings, as but comes such things!
     From a coal miners father, and his dreams . . .
     A child, who would bless this our Nation all in his being!
     A giant, who upon the Senate floor . . . his thundering voice 
           would so ring!
     Who fell in love, with one of our Forefathers greatest 
           dreams!
     The Great American Experiment, called Democracy of all 
           things!
     Democracy, and The United States Senate . . . all in this 
           wing!
     And, that from so little . What time and faith and courage, 
           can so bring!
     A man who so honored tradition, in all his fiber and all his 
           being . . .
     All in his great intuition, knowing that these were but time 
           tested things . . .
     But, so sacred and so essential . . . but to our Nation's 
           very being!
     Like, a mother cub . . . Protecting her young!
     With all of his heart and soul, he would not let this great 
           body be undone!
     And that some things you must not, and should not change!
     Time Tested, that for this our Nation to thrive must so 
           remain!
     For he was a visionary, a scholar, and a student of the past, 
           and legislation history to last!
     And with his very heart and soul, he so protected our 
           forefathers great dream of gold!
     For he so wisely knew, that some things no greater can be!
     Never mess with perfection you see!
     So with each new and succeeding year, a champion for The 
           Senate grew up so here!
     As this was but, his second greatest love so clear!
     His first, his beloved Erma, a marriage of seventy years . . 
           .
     As This Master of Senate, so soon appeared . . . the kind 
           even Webster would revere!
     And now, into the next world Robert you have gone, but ever 
           your memory will live on!
     As but a lesson to us all . . .
     As from what so little, can grow so tall!
     A Champion of The United States Senate, Robert Byrd . . .
     As now up in Heaven, your voice is heard!<bullet>
