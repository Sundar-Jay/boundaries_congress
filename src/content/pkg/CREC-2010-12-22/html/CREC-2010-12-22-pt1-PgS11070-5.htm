                          ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE

  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, if there is no further business to come 
before the Senate--let me say it has been a pleasure serving with you--
I wish everyone here Godspeed and a Merry Christmas, and I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate adjourn under the previous order.
  There being no objection, the Senate, at 8:03 p.m., adjourned sine 
die.
