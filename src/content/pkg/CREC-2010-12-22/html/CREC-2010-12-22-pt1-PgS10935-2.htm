                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  You have kept Your promises to us, Almighty God, and our hearts sing 
praises to You. You continue to supply our needs, to keep us from 
falling, and to work everything for our good. You prevent the weapons 
that are formed against us from prospering, surrounding us with the 
shield of Your favor.
  Lord, give wisdom and knowledge to our lawmakers today. Show them 
Your ways and guide them by Your spirit. Lead them in the path of Your 
truth so that they will abide in the shadow of Your providence and 
permit Your constant love to sustain them.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.NOTICE
