          CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT TO FRIDAY, DECEMBER 24, 2010

  Mr. ARCURI. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the 
House adjourns today on a motion offered pursuant to this order, it 
adjourn to meet at 11 a.m. on Friday, December 24, 2010, unless it 
sooner has received a message from the Senate transmitting its 
concurrence in House Concurrent Resolution 336, in which case the House 
shall stand adjourned sine die pursuant to that concurrent resolution.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from New York?
  There was no objection.
