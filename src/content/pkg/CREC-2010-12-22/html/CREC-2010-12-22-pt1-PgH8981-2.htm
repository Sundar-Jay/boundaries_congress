  Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members 
may have until publication of the last edition of the Congressional 
Record authorized for the Second Session of the 111th Congress by the 
Joint Committee on Printing to revise and extend their remarks and to 
include brief, related extraneous material on any matter occurring 
before the adjournment of the Second Session sine die.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Washington?
  There was no objection.
