    MOST ASTUTE, CONSCIENTIOUS CONGRESS IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATION

  (Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JACKSON LEE of Texas. Madam Speaker, my colleagues are absolutely 
right. This has been the most astute and conscientious Congress in the 
history of our Nation, the 111th Congress, led by the very astute and 
courageous Nancy Pelosi, the historic first woman Speaker. I thank her 
and the leadership.
  Thank you for health care and Wall Street reform. Thank you for the 
reform of the GI Bill, to provide more opportunity. And, as well, thank 
you for moving and pushing compassionately the repeal of Don't Ask, 
Don't Tell. The White House ceremony today was powerful.
  Thank you again for recognizing that the 9/11 heroes health bill must 
be taken care of. I ask the other body to act now and do not go home 
without doing so. But yet the omnibus bill that will help so many 
millions of Americans with resources directed to them has been 
imploded, and I call upon the Senate, I call upon this House when we 
return, to be able to return America's resources back to them. We 
negotiated that omnibus. It is time to make sure that those veterans 
and those who need PTSD recovery and those who need health care are 
provided for through this omnibus bill.
  Happy holiday, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
