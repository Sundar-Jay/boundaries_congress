HONORING THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND EXTRAORDINARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF CHAIRMAN 
                        DAVID OBEY OF WISCONSIN

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, with the conclusion of the 111th 
Congress, a career of extraordinary public service in the House of 
Representatives comes to an end. My colleague, friend and mentor--
Chairman David Obey--is concluding his career in Congress representing 
the families of northwestern Wisconsin that began in 1969. For twenty 
terms, David Obey has been a liberal champion and a fierce defender of 
workers and their families. He has been a passionate and effective 
legislator for right of all Americans to access quality health care and 
education. And, in the realm of U.S. foreign policy, Chairman Obey has 
a lifetime record of always striving to advance human dignity, peace, 
and the highest ideals of the American people around the world.
  It has been my privilege to serve in this House with Rep. Obey for 
the past ten years--one-quarter of his congressional career. For the 
past four years, I had the honor of serving on the House Appropriations 
Committee, calling the gentleman from Wisconsin ``Mr. Chairman.'' I 
have watched David Obey work--work hard, tirelessly, and with 
tremendous determination and intellect--to advance an agenda that makes 
the lives of regular Americans the highest priority of the federal 
government. Chairman Obey always fought for the less fortunate, the 
vulnerable, those struggling for an opportunity to succeed, and to 
ensure those who have made this country great with their toil and 
sacrifice in the factory, the farm field, or on the battlefield. He 
fought so they too could live and retire with security, respect, and 
dignity.
  It is often said that Mr. Obey was tough and rough on the outside, 
but I always found him to be a kind, warm soul who knew the importance 
and magnitude of his responsibilities and carried them out with the 
humble expertise of a legislative master. ``I started as a shy boy from 
a troubled family of modest means,'' Rep. Obey once said. Well, that 
shy boy has made a lifetime of contributions to our country that will 
be judged by history as both profound and far reaching. People who will 
never know David Obey are living better lives with more opportunities 
because of him. The State of Wisconsin and the United States are better 
places because of his years of service in the U.S. House.
  As a Wisconsin Progressive in the tradition of Robert LaFollette, 
Rep. Obey has never shied away from calling out injustice or just plain 
dumb policymaking. In his book, ``Raising Hell for Justice,'' he 
reminds citizens and policymakers that ``federal budgets that pay for 
tax cuts for millionaires with budget cuts in education, Medicaid, 
child care, and health care are not just unfair; they are immoral.''
  This quote was again put to the test only last week as Chairman Obey 
voted against extending massive tax cuts for millionaires and 
billionaires. I was proud to join Chairman Obey in opposing this tax 
cut for the wealthy that only continues the disturbing pattern of 
income re-distribution away from working families and towards a class 
of economic elites.
  As the longest serving Member of Congress in Wisconsin history, I 
know David spent far too much time away from his wife, Joan, and their 
family. I wish David, Joan, and their sons' families many happy days 
together in the coming years.
  In conclusion, let me simply say--Mr. Chairman, you have served our 
country so very well. It is personally difficult to see you leave, but 
your lifetime of service will live on in the lives of millions of 
Americans whose lives you have helped to improve. As a colleague and a 
friend, you have made me a better legislator and for that I am grateful 
to you.
