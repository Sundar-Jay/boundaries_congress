           CONGRATULATING LADY NITTANY LIONS VOLLEYBALL TEAM

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, the Lady Nittany Lions 
volleyball team went to Kansas City on Saturday, December 18, and 
brought home a terrific and unprecedented Christmas present to their 
school, Penn State University. They won their fourth straight NCAA 
Division I championship.
  While the team was undefeated in their previous two seasons, they 
were 32-5 going into the championship this year, and the California 
Golden Bears went into the match with a 30-4 season. The two teams have 
dominated the championships, meeting for 4 consecutive years in the 
regionals, semis or finals.
  This was Coach Russ Rose's fifth championship, and the ladies 
celebrated by giving their coach a ring for his thumb. He is the first 
coach in NCAA Division I women's volleyball history to win five 
national titles.
  The most outstanding player was Deja McClendon. Blair Brown summed up 
the feelings of the team in this quote:
  ``We're thrilled to have four national championships, but the legacy 
we want to leave is the program's history, I guess. It's the tradition 
of working hard every day in practice and going hard, because that's 
how you get here.''
  Congratulations to the team, the coach, and the school for this 
outstanding record.
