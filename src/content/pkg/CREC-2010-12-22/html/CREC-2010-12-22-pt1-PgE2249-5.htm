                 A ONE-OF-A-KIND-MINNESOTAN: WIN WALLIN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. ERIK PAULSEN

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of Winston 
``Win'' Wallin: businessman, philanthropist, pioneer and one-of-a-kind 
Minnesotan.
  Born in Minneapolis in 1926, Win, like so many in his generation, 
served in the military during World War II. After two years as a Navy 
pilot, he earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from 
the University of Minnesota.
  Following graduation, Win began a long and industrious career with 
Pillsbury, rising through the ranks to Chief Operations Officer.
  In the mid-80's, Win left Pillsbury to head a little-known, 
struggling medical device company based in Minnesota, named Medtronic. 
Win's leadership and determination, changed the face of Medtronic. 
Today it is the world's largest medical device company.
  Although Win brought great success to the companies he led, his life 
cannot simply be measured in their bottom lines, but rather in the 
countless lives he touched through his philanthropic endeavors.
  Win was a true believer in empowerment through higher education. 
Since 1986, Win and his wife Maxine have helped over 3,000 high school 
students make the dream of a college education a reality through their 
Wallin Scholarship.
  While Minnesota will never be able to replace Win, his legacy lives 
on through the lives he has touched and the state he has made better 
through his presence.
