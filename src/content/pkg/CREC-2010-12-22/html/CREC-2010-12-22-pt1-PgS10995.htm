                         THANKING SENATE PAGES

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am sorry they are not on the floor at 
this moment, but I rise to give special recognition to two Senate pages 
who have stayed here while all the others have gone home for Christmas. 
These two pages have been working hard today to keep up with the 
Senate's very busy schedule:
  Rachel Bailey, 16 years old, from Glendale, MD. Mom and dad are Susan 
and Karl. She is working late today as a Senate page. We thank Rachel 
so much.
  Jarrod Nagurka, 16 years old, from Arlington, VA. His mom and dad are 
Pamela and Stuart.
  Even though they aren't on the floor and they are running around here 
busy, they can look in the Congressional Record and realize that 
Senators of both political parties appreciate their dedication to this 
institution during this holiday season.
