                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and applaud 
Jennifer Friednash for her outstanding service to our community.
   Jennifer works full time as a real estate attorney, but always finds 
time to teach her kids the value of volunteering through leading by 
example. She has been an active member and fundraiser for Project 
PRIDE, which constructed an outdoor classroom alongside Red Rocks 
Amphitheatre.
   Jennifer's work doesn't stop there. She is an active committee 
member of the Jefferson Economic Council, chair of a committee that 
provides junior NAIOP members an opportunity to learn about the real 
estate industry from seasoned professionals and has been a provisional 
instructor for the Colorado Association of Realtors.
   I extend my deepest congratulations to Jennifer Friednash for her 
well deserved recognition by the West Chamber serving Jefferson County. 
I have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedication and character in 
all her future accomplishments.
