              TRIBUTE TO FERRARO MEDICAL ASSOCIATES, P.A.

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I would like to call to your attenion 
the work of an outstanding medical practice Ferraro Medical Associates, 
P.A., which is celebrating its 65th Anniversary of dedicated service to 
its patients, and by extension, the greater community. It is only 
fitting that Ferraro Medical Associates, and its late founder Dr. 
Stephen P. Ferraro, be honored in this permanent record of the greatest 
democracy ever known, for the comfort and care that it has provided to 
so many Paterson families.
  Dr. Stephen P. Ferraro was born in 1920 in Paterson, NJ to Angelo and 
Natalizia who emigrated from Sicily to the United States. They had four 
children, two of whom died untimely deaths leaving Stephen and Joseph. 
Stephen's parents ingrained in their sons the importance of education, 
and became successful themselves, owning multiple properties in 
Paterson.
  Dr. Ferraro attended School No. 15 and graduated Eastside High School 
in 1937. In high school he was very athletic but music intrigued him 
most and he played the violin for the Eastside orchestra. After 
graduation he earned a bachelor's degree from Notre Dame University in 
1941. Stephen developed a passion for medicine and flying which lasted 
a lifetime.
  In 1946 Dr. Ferraro obtained his degree of Doctor of Medicine from 
Georgetown University Medical School. He graduated in the top of his 
class. He returned to Paterson to pursue his career. He did a rotating 
internship at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson. In 
1947 he was certified and passed the State of New Jersey Board as 
Doctor in Medicine and Surgery. Dr. Ferraro then decided to join the 
United States Air Force University School of Medicine in Randolf, Texas 
and became a USAF Flight Surgeon, spending three years in Okinawa. In 
the Air Force he saw many in great need and he was determined to always 
be a ``people doctor'' and provide his service where the need was 
greatest.
  By 1950, when he returned from spending four years at Boston City 
Hospital, becoming Chief Surgical Resident, he had met a nurse named 
Betty. He went to Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and became Chief 
Surgical Resident from 1954-1956. Betty followed him and worked 
alongside him as his operating room nurse. They later married at St. 
Anthony Church in Paterson and had six children-- Stephen Jr., Natalie, 
Angelo, Lisa, Lucia and Barbara.
  Dr. Ferraro never forgot the city he came from. In 1957 he became 
attending surgeon of St. Joseph's Hospital & Medical Center in 
Paterson. He soon decided to open his own practice at 414 Broadway. 
Betty was always by his side and was his nurse at the practice. 
Together they were the perfect ``team.'' The office was on the first 
floor and their apartment was on the upper levels. He became the Co-
Chief of Department of Surgery at Fairlawn Memorial Hospital, attending 
surgeon at Saddle Brook Hospital, Police Surgeon and City of Paterson 
physician, Medical Director of Nabisco Brands, Inc., assistant 
professor at Seton Hall University Department of Surgery and also 
became Medical Examiner for Federal Aviation-Class A, and USCIS Civil 
Surgeon. Dr. Ferraro was a distinguished and respected physician who 
with all his qualities provided the best to his patients and left a 
remarkable legacy to his children.
  Dr. Ferraro's children admired their father for instilling the 
importance of education in them. When his children were very young he 
would always encourage them to read. They spent time with their father 
around the office. Dr. Ferraro was a great role model, allowing them to 
see the medical world in his office as one of the choices for their 
lives.
  Lisa Ferraro followed her father's footsteps and graduated from Ross 
University Medical School. In 1984-1987 she completed her internship 
and residency in Internal Medicine at St. Joseph's Regional Medical 
Center in Paterson and immediately went to work with her father. Dr. 
Lisa Ferraro was Board Certified in Internal Medicine in 1987 and 
joined attending staff Internal Medicine at SJHMC.
  She has worked as school physician for Public Schools Nos. 5, 8, 28 
and Kilpatrick School. She was assistant Medical Director at Nabisco 
from 1987-1992 and has taught first year medical students from UMDNJ, 
as well as forth year foreign medical students. In 2000 she was 
appointed as Civil Surgeon for USCIS. In February 2010 she became 
Certified in Aesthetic Medicine.
  Dr. Ferraro left a truly wonderful legacy in Paterson. In April 1996 
Dr. Stephen and Dr. Lisa Ferraro registered the office as a 
corporation, Ferraro Medical Associates, P.A. Despite the challenges, 
the office still serves our community at 414 Broadway. Presently the 
practice provides medical care to approximately five hundred patients a 
month. It is estimated that close to half a million patients have 
passed through the doors at 414 Broadway.
  Although Dr. Stephen P. Ferraro departed from this earth in 2002, he 
left a legacy of perseverance as well as a well recognized practice, 
which continues to thrive under the leadership of Dr. Lisa Ferraro. Her 
siblings are all successful professionals in their fields. Stephen P. 
Ferraro, Jr. M.D., is an orthopaeadic surgeon in Redding, California, 
Angelo Ferraro, M.D., a cardiologist, Spokane, Washington, Lucia 
Ferraro, M.D., an anesthesiologist and Critical Care, Sherman Oaks, 
California, Natalia Ferraro is a homemaker and professional 
photographer and Barbara Tabano is a homemaker and operates a family 
business, The Sock Company, with her husband Jim.
  The job of a United States Congressman involves much that is 
rewarding, yet nothing compares to recognizing the efforts of wonderful 
people in my District. Madam Speaker, I ask that you join all of the 
patients and friends of the Ferraro family, all those who have been 
helped throughout the years, and me in recognizing the outstanding 
contributions they have made to the community in Paterson and beyond.
