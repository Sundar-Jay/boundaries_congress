  Ms. KILPATRICK of Michigan. Dear Madam Speaker, as I leave Congress 
as the people's representative for the 13th Congressional District of 
Michigan, I thank God, who is the head

of my life, for allowing me the blessing of serving in perhaps the most 
august, deliberate, elected body in the world. I am humbled and honored 
that the great citizens of Michigan and the people of Detroit chose me 
for so many years to fight and serve them for more than three decades 
as a public servant. The many friendships, relationships, and 
associations I have formed will remain with me forever.
  I finally want to thank perhaps the most underappreciated team in any 
elected body--the staff who have worked for me for those years in the 
State of Michigan and on Capitol Hill. The tireless dedication, 
devotion and work will never be forgotten by me or the people to whom 
you have been so effective and efficient for so long.
  I hope and pray for all of my colleagues that we may bring a better 
world to all Americans, and never flinch from fighting for justice and 
democratic ideals. We made history. We made difficult decisions. We 
fought the good fight. We have difficult days ahead, and I remain 
faithful to protecting the Constitution of the United States and the 
goals of our great nation.
  God bless.
