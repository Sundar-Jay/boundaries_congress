  Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the chair

subcommittee be permitted to extend their remarks in the Congressional 
Record, up to and including the Record's last publication, and to 
include a summary of the work of that committee or subcommittee.

gentleman from Washington?
  There was no objection.
