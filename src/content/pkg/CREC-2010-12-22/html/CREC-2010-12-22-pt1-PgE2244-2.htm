                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. BACA. Madam Speaker, I thank you for your service to our country, 
for your sacrifice and unyielding dedication.
  Because of your leadership, Democrats have much to be proud of during 
our work in the 110th and 111th Congress.
  As Speaker, you have made the United States a better country. Women 
have more rights in the workforce, children are safer, our military is 
stronger and our economy was saved from near complete collapse.
  Without you at the helm, healthcare for all would only be a dream. 
Because of your labor, it will be a reality.
  As the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House, you have left an 
indelible mark on our history. Your positive, supportive and empowering 
leadership will forever remind us of what it is to be an American.
  Your strength of leadership will continue to serve the American 
people well as we protect the victories we have secured, and renew our 
efforts to move America forward.
  Speaker, I remember the day of your swearing-in. All the children 
surrounding you as you pounded the gavel leading us on a new direction. 
You have made them proud. You have made us all proud.
  Thank you, Speaker Pelosi. Thank you.
