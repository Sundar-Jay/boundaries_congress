                            MORNING BUSINESS

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
move to morning business with Senators allowed to speak for up to 10 
minutes each.
  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I could.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.
  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to the Senator from Illinois that I have an 
agreement with everybody on a 6-week extension of the Trade Adjustment 
Assistance and the Trade Preference Act, and on both sides everybody 
has agreed.
  I know I can't do that in morning business, so I ask unanimous 
consent, as soon as it is written up, that I be permitted to propose 
that legislation.
  Mr. DURBIN. I have no objection to your bringing it up whenever it is 
prepared, and we will of course consider it at that time.
  I thank the Senator for his work on this effort.
