                   INTEREST ON LAWYERS TRUST ACCOUNTS

  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, as if in 
legislative session and as if in morning business, that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6398, which was received 
from the House and is at the desk.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 6398) to require the Federal Deposit Insurance 
     Corporation to fully insure Interest on Lawyers Trust 
     Accounts.

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill 
be read three times and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon 
the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements 
related to the bill be printed in the Record.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The bill (H.R. 6398) was ordered to a third reading, was read the 
third time, and passed.
  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I wish to thank the Chair and my 
colleague from Georgia who understood and presented so effectively the 
impact on our community banks that are working hard to get funds out to 
our Main Street businesses so we can create jobs and put our economy 
back on track.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.
  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Oregon and 
thank him for his help on this important issue for people all over the 
United States, not just in Oregon and Georgia but around the country. 
This is a great effort, and I commend him on it.
