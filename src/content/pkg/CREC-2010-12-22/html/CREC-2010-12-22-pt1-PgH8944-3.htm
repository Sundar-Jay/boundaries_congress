               SOUTH CAROLINA GAINS A CONGRESSIONAL SEAT

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I am grateful to welcome 
the addition of a new congressional seat to my home State of South 
Carolina, one of America's fastest growing States. The Census Bureau 
announced the State's population has grown enough to merit one more 
Representative in Congress. Our State has been enhanced by transplants 
from the Midwest and Northeast and from people across the world due to 
a mild climate and lower tax rates.
  After 80 years, it appears we will regain a seventh House Member. The 
people of South Carolina will now have another advocate on their behalf 
in Washington and another electoral vote for President. Growing our 
representation on Capitol Hill is a key factor in achieving goals for 
the people of South Carolina. Our State will have another voice 
fighting for conservative principles with the new district on the Grand 
Strand with Florence.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th in the global war on terrorism.
  Godspeed to Marine Captain Ky Hunter, who has successfully 
accomplished her service for the people of the Second District of South 
Carolina, and now will be in the liaison office of the Marine Corps.
