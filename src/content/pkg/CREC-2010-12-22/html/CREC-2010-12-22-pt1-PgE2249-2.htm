                         HONORING JOHN SHADEGG

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JEFF FLAKE

                               of arizona

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. FLAKE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a valued member of 
the Arizona delegation, John Shadegg.
  John Shadegg is ending his service to this institution after 16 
years. He came here in 1994 and has served the State of Arizona 
extremely well during that time. During his time here, John promoted 
the principles of limited government, economic freedom, and individual 
responsibility, and has stayed true to his ideals while proudly serving 
the people of Arizona's Third District.
  Arizona has a habit of producing great legislators, including Barry 
Goldwater, Mo Udall, Carl Hayden, and others; John Shadegg's name will 
certainly be added to that illustrious list.
  I want to pay tribute to John today and tell him how much the Arizona 
delegation, and all of us will miss his steady, constant, principled 
leadership here in the House of Representatives. Well done, John 
Shadegg.
