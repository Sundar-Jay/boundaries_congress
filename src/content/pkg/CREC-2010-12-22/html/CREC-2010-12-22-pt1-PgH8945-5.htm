                  PASS THE 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS BILL

  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PAYNE. This is my country! Land of my birth!
  This is my country! Grandest on Earth!
  I pledge thee my allegiance, America, the bold,
  For this is my country to have and to hold.

  This is my country! Land of my choice!
  This is my country! Hear my proud voice!
  I pledge thee my allegiance, America, the bold,
  For this is my country to have and to hold.
  As a youngster in elementary school, I sang this song proudly many 
times. And nearly a decade ago, 9/11 responders embodied the American 
spirit proclaimed in this song when they dropped everything to help 
this country. These Americans paid the ultimate sacrifice and risked 
their health and lives when our country was attacked. Unfortunately, 
many have developed health issues as a result of their service.
  But my Republican colleagues believe that this treatment is too 
costly. The 9/11 Health and Compensation Act would provide monitoring 
and specialized treatment for those responders who were exposed to 
toxins during 9/11 and this bill is completely paid for. No responders 
questioned whether they should go in.
  Those American flag-wearing lapel Senators should vote for the 9/11 
Health and Compensation Act.
