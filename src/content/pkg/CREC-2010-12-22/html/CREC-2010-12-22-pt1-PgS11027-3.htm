                     ALASKA CONSERVATION PARITY ACT

  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to discuss 
an issue of importance to Alaska Native communities. The legislation 
currently under consideration would extend through 2011 the enhanced 
tax incentive for donations of qualified conservation easements. 
Unfortunately, Alaskan Native communities are ineligible under this 
provision and, as a result, do not have access to the tools they need 
to permanently protect historical or critical habitat.
  For thousands of years, Alaska has been home to Native communities, 
whose rich heritages, languages, and traditions have thrived in the 
region's unique landscape. These communities continue to engage in a 
traditional subsistence lifestyle and harvest their food from the land. 
Nearly 70 percent of Native communities' food comes from the land and, 
for many communities, subsistence is an economic necessity considering 
the cost and difficulty involved in purchasing food.
  I, along with my colleague, Ms. Murkowski, have proposed legislation, 
S. 1673, which would provide parity. Our proposal is imperative to the 
long-term survival of Alaska-Native communities and Alaska's nature 
resources, which makes this critical legislation timely. Development 
pressures are increasingly significantly in many parts of Alaska. This 
legislation will allow private land owned by Alaska Native communities 
to be protected, while facilitating development that will spur needed 
economic activity and job growth.
  We have worked with the Senate Finance Committee over the past 2 
years to ensure that this provision is ready for enactment. It is 
widely supported by the conservation community. I was hopeful it would 
be included in the end-of-the-year tax package the Senate is currently 
considering. Since the Senate was unable to address Alaska Native 
conservation parity before the end of the 111th Congress, I would be 
interested in learning, from the chairman of the Finance Committee, 
what his plans are for advancing the proposal in the 112th Congress.
  Mr. BAUCUS. I am happy to respond to Mr. Begich from Alaska. I 
support the conservation easement deduction and sympathize with the 
Senator's efforts. I will work with Mr. Begich and Ms. Murkowski to 
address conservation issues in the new Congress.
  Mr. BEGICH. I thank you, Mr. Baucus. I appreciate the Senator's 
support on this issue, and look forward to working with him and my 
other Senate colleagues to pass this much needed piece of legislation 
as soon as an opportunity presents itself in the new Congress.
