                        HON. PEDRO R. PIERLUISI

                             of puerto rico

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 21, 2010

  Mr. PIERLUISI. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my strong support for 
the inclusion of increased funding for the Federal Pell Grant Program 
in the Continuing Resolution. Pell Grants are instrumental in helping 
students obtain college degrees and further prepare themselves to join 
the modern workplace. In Puerto Rico, over 280,000 students benefit 
from this funding each year.
  Last year, I was proud to join my colleagues on the House Education 
Committee in voting to increase the maximum Pell Grant award to $5,550 
for the current academic year and to tie future awards to inflation. 
However, this increased funding will be put in jeopardy if Congress 
does not act today. Largely as a result of the economic downturn, Pell 
Grant applications have increased by 20 percent during the past year. 
Without an additional investment in the Pell Grant Program, the maximum 
award could be cut by more than 15 percent, putting college out of 
reach for many students.
  I urge my colleagues to support the Continuing Resolution to ensure 
that college remains affordable for our Nation's students.
