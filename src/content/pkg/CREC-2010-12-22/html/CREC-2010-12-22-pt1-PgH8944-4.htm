  IKE SKELTON NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011

  Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the 
Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 6523) to authorize appropriations for 
fiscal year 2011 for military activities of the Department of Defense, 
for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department 
of Energy, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal 
year, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendments thereto, and 
concur in the Senate amendments.
  The Clerk read the title of the bill.
  The text of the Senate amendments is as follows:

       Senate amendments:
       Strike title XVII and corresponding table of contents on 
     page 18.

  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Missouri?
  Ms. BORDALLO. Madam Speaker, reserving the right to object, I take 
this moment to express great disappointment at the situation the House 
now finds itself. It is very unfortunate that before us is an amended 
version of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for 
Fiscal Year 2011.
  Last night, the other body struck title XVII of the version of the 
bill that this House passed last Friday, December 17. Title XVII, Madam 
Speaker, was the Guam World War II Loyalty Recognition Act, which the 
House has passed on multiple occasions with strong bipartisan support. 
Several Senators objected to its inclusion in the bill. They expressed 
concerns over its budgetary impact, and indicated a willingness to work 
toward identifying an acceptable way to authorize and pay the claims.
  I regret the inability to resolve this matter at this time, and I am 
very appreciative of the strong support from Chairman Skelton and 
incoming chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Mr. McKeon of 
California for their strong support of this provision. The unresolved 
nature of Guam war claims has serious implications for the military 
build-up on Guam. I appreciate the administration's strong support for 
this provision. The administration recognizes the connection between 
resolving this issue and successfully implementing the military build-
up on Guam.
  We will continue our work to bring closure to this matter of justice 
for the people of Guam, and to act on the legislative recommendations 
of the Federal Guam War Claims Review Commission that reported to 
Congress pursuant to Public Law 107-333. It was not for a lack of 
effort from this body, and we will continue to build on the progress 
we've made. The underlying bill is important for our national defense 
and for our men and women in uniform and their families, and therefore 
this body is left no other choice but than to concur with the Senate 
amendments at this time.
  Again, I want to thank everyone who has assisted me, both the leaders 
and to the multiple staff members who have helped us through this 
process.
  Mr. SKELTON. Madam Speaker, I'll keep my remarks brief as this is the 
third time that the House will debate and vote on the National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. They say that the third time is 
the charm. Let it be so this morning.
  I return to the floor with this bill because the Senate found it 
necessary to delete a portion of the House-passed bill in order to 
achieve the consensus needed to move the bill to final passage. The 
Senate amendment removes from the House bill Title 17, which dealt with 
Guam War Claims. I am deeply disappointed in the Senate's decision to 
remove this important legislation, which I strongly support and which 
has been so ably advocated by the delegate from Guam. However, here we 
are and we are out of time to engage with a back and forth with the 
Senate. We must move this bill to the President's desk or watch it die. 
That is why I ask for unanimous consent for the House to concur to the 
Senate amendment to H.R. 6523.
  Let me briefly repeat what I said the other day. This bill is must 
pass legislation with many provisions that cannot become law any other 
way. This bill stops an increase in health care fees from hitting the 
families of military personnel; authorizes military families to extend 
TRICARE coverage to their dependent children under age 26; and adopts 
comprehensive legislation fighting sexual assault in the military. It 
creates a counter-IED database and enhances the effort to develop new, 
lightweight body armor. It gives DOD new

tools and authorities to reduce its energy demand while improving 
military readiness. It bolsters our defense against cyber attacks. It 
requires independent assessments of the National Nuclear Security 
Administration modernization plan and of the annual budget request for 
sustaining a strong deterrent. It aligns the Navy's long term 
shipbuilding plan with the QDR. And, it includes significant 
acquisition reform, the Improve Acquisition Act of 2010, which could 
save as much as $135 billion over the next 5 years. That is just a 
sampling of the good work done in this bill.
  I ask the House to support the men and women of the armed forces by 
passing this bill by unanimous consent, and ensure that the National 
Defense Authorization Act finally becomes law.
  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, H.R. 6523 is a strong bill 
that is intended to provide essential funding for our nation's troops, 
including providing our brave men and women in uniform the tools they 
need to succeed in our nation's missions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my 
concerns about the Senate Amendment to H.R. 6523, the Ike Skelton 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011. The Senate 
amendment struck Title XVII of the underlying bill, once again, denying 
the people of Guam the promise of closure and justice on the matter of 
Guam War Claims.
  The text of Title XVII was a compromise that eliminated payments to 
descendents of survivors of the brutal occupation that were subjected 
to personal injury. I support that compromise; in fact, I am an 
original co-sponsor of H.R. 44, the Guam World War II Loyalty 
Recognition Act. It is important that we bring closure to this long 
standing injustice for the people of Guam. It is even more important 
given that the realignment of Marines from Okinawa to Guam will begin 
in earnest over the coming year.
  I have travelled to Guam on a number of occasions and have been so 
impressed by the patriotism of the people led by Governor Felix Camacho 
and First Lady Joann Camacho, and I recognize the importance of this 
legislation to the Chamorro people. I look forward to working with 
Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo and Incoming Chairman Congressman Buck 
McKeon, incoming Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, to 
address this matter in next year's defense authorization bill. It is 
time to finally bring closure to this long standing matter for the 
people of Guam which is so strategic for our nation's defense and where 
America's day begins. I appreciate the tireless efforts of 
Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo's service for the people of Guam.
  Ms. BORDALLO. Madam Speaker, I withdraw my reservation.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Missouri?
  There was no objection.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
