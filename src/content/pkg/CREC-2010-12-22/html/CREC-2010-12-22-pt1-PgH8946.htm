              CONTINUING RECORD OF SUCCESSFUL JOB CREATION

  (Mr. CARSON of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I rise to express my hope that 
the 112th Congress will continue this Congress' record of successful 
job creation.
  We have taken the necessary steps during this, the most productive 
Congress in years, to pass a long list of important legislation. From 
middle class tax relief to the small business jobs initiatives, to 
teacher and health care jobs, to programs helping to keep Americans in 
their homes, the 111th Congress has succeeded in moving the American 
people's agenda forward. We have already created millions of jobs and 
spurred 11 months of private-sector job growth.
  But this recession cannot be corrected overnight. Next year, we must 
all focus on building the next generation of workers, increasing access 
to quality education, remaining competitive in the global marketplace 
and reducing the deficit. Together, we must all continue moving our 
country forward. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle in the next Congress.
  Thank you, God bless, happy holidays, and happy new year.
