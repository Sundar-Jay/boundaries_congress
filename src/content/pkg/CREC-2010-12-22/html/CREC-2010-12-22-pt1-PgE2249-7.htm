           POSTHUMOUS TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT WILLIE JAMES QUINCE

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR.

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I would like to call your attention to 
the life and work of an outstanding individual, the late Sergeant 
Willie James Quince of Paterson, New Jersey, whose life was celebrated 
during a memorial service on Monday, November 29, 2010, at the First 
A.M.E. Zion Church.
  It is only fitting that he be honored in this, the permanent record 
of the greatest democracy ever known, for he served countless others 
throughout his lifetime.
  Sergeant Willie James Quince was born in Valdosta, Georgia in 1921 to 
Mr. Remer Quince and Helen Braswell. His family moved to West Palm 
Beach, Florida, where he finished elementary school and graduated from 
Industrial High School. He went on to courses at Purple Kerpels School 
of Mechanical Dentistry in New York City, NY. He then studied 4 years 
at the Jones Barber School in Atlantic City, NJ, and the Interracial 
Barber College in Atlantic City, NJ, graduating in 3 years. After 
graduation, he moved to Paterson, N.J. in January 1958 and opened 
Quince's Barber Shop.
  He was married to Mary M. Quince for 61 years, and together they 
raised five children,

Wiley ``Sonny'' Quince, William A. Quince (Linda), Madgeline Z. Quince, 
Sylvia A. Lucas, and Kelvin C. Quince (Cora); and also now have 10 
grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Mr. Quince was a faithful 
husband, dedicated father, grandfather and great-grandfather, and a 
committed community servant. He earned many accolades and had a long 
record of accomplishment as a forerunner for civil rights and a leader 
throughout Paterson. He was a long-time member of First A.M.E. Zion 
Church, where he was elected Man Of The Year multiple times, served on 
the Board of Trustees for 31 years and served as Chairman for 15 years. 
He also served on the Stewart Board, Usher Board, The Dreamers, The 
Kitchen Cabinet, and The Zion Seniors.
  He served our nation as a Drill Sergeant during World War II Army Air 
Force and received the Medal of Good Conduct, WWII Victory Medal and 
ATO Medal. He was an Honored Life Member of the NAACP Paterson Branch, 
a member of the Habitat for Humanity Paterson Chapter Tenants Selection 
Committee for Home Ownership. He was the first African-American elected 
chairman of the Paterson Housing Authority Board of Commissioners, and 
he served as Project Housing Manager of Christopher Columbus Housing 
Development and as Manager of the Riverside Terrace Housing 
Development. He also served as Paterson's Fourth Ward Leader of the 
Passaic County Democratic Party for many years. He was known for his 
superb social mannerisms and good conversation.
  The job of a United States Congressman involves much that is 
rewarding, yet nothing compares to recognizing the lifetime achievement 
of a giving person such as Sergeant Willie James Quince.
  Madam Speaker, I ask that you join our colleagues, Willie's family 
and friends, and me in recognizing the late Sergeant Willie James 
Quince's outstanding life of service to his community.
