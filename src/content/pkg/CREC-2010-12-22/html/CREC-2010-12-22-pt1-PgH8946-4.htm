                       A VERY PRODUCTIVE CONGRESS

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I don't think there is any doubt that 
this has been one of the most productive Congresses in American 
history, but I also want to talk about the lame duck session and how 
productive that has been as well.
  In this lame duck session, we have had one of the largest major tax 
cuts to help the average person, to help the middle class, in the 
history of the Republic. Child tax credits, payroll tax reduction, 
education tax benefits, the list goes on.
  In addition to that, we did the ``doc fix'' for Medicare for another 
year. We also repealed Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Finally, yesterday, we 
did the food safety bill, one of the most comprehensive bills that we 
could possibly pass.
  So there is no question that this has been a productive Congress, and 
this has been a very productive lame duck Congress. I am also hopeful 
that today in the Senate and here in the House we will also pass the 9/
11 health bill for first responders, and that will complete, again, one 
of the most productive lame duck sessions and productive Congresses in 
American history.
