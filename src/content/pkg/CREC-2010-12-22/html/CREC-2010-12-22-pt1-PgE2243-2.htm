           HONORING THE EXEMPLARY SERVICE OF SANCTUARY, INC.

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. MADELEINE Z. BORDALLO

                                of guam

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Ms. BORDALLO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the exemplary 
service of Sanctuary, Inc., a community based non-profit organization 
that aims to improve the quality of life for Guam's families and youth. 
Through their 24-hour crisis intervention, Sanctuary promotes mediation 
services during times of family conflicts while also providing 
temporary safe refuge to youth in need of further supportive 
counseling. In addition, Sanctuary fosters the development of 
responsible community members and assists in preserving and promoting 
family unity through their outreach, education and prevention programs.
  Founded in 1971 by Father Robert Phelps and Mr. Luis Martinez, with 
the goal of creating a safe refuge for Guam's youth, Sanctuary 
originated in southern Guam, with seven families volunteering their 
time and homes to provide temporary housing to troubled youth who are 
not suitable for youth correctional facilities. Sanctuary has since 
relocated to central Guam and now provides shelter and services at 
three dedicated buildings: an emergency shelter, a transitional living 
program, and substance abuse program. They have made tremendous strides 
over the years and annually provide safe haven for over 300 youth and 
also provide assistance through outreach and prevention programs to 
over 3,000 troubled teens. These services and programs, such as alcohol 
and drug treatment programs, provide safe alternatives to detention or 
youth correctional facilities and are instrumental in helping troubled 
youth turn their lives around and contribute to society.
  It is on the occasion of Sanctuary's 39th anniversary that I join our 
community in commending their humanitarian services and outreach 
efforts in helping Guam's youth. I commend the efforts of Interim 
Executive Director, Millie Lujan; Staff members and Volunteers who have 
dedicated and contributed their time over the past 39 years and I look 
forward to many more years of continued service by Sanctuary Guam.
