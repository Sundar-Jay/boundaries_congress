                         DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL

  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the repeal of the discriminatory don't 
ask, don't tell law will mean a stronger and more secure America. 
Discrimination has no place in American society, especially when it 
undermines our national security by hampering military readiness. While 
the repeal of this law is long overdue, ending this harmful policy does 
mark an important moment in the fight for equal rights for all 
Americans. I applaud all those who worked to overturn this policy, the 
many Americans who advocated for its repeal, and the patriotic men and 
women who will now be able to openly serve their country.
