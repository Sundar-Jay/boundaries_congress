                CONCLUSION OF MY SERVICE IN THE CONGRESS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. EARL POMEROY

                            of north dakota

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, December 22, 2010

  Mr. POMEROY. Madam Speaker, I want to take this opportunity to thank 
the people of North Dakota for the chance to represent our great state 
in this great chamber for the past 9 terms.
  Words cannot adequately express the feelings of gratitude I have as 
my time as a member of body draws to a close.
  At varying times I've agreed or disagreed with virtually every 
member--Democratic or Republican--in this House. Steering the course 
for the United States of America is a very difficult and complex 
undertaking. As our country moves into its third century in the first 
decade of the new millennium, it seems like the challenges only get 
bigger as we go forward.
  But I conclude my life here with a strong sense of hope and optimism 
for the future.
  The United States Capitol is the icon of democracy known throughout 
the world. In this historic place, sometimes in the darkest hour, 
leaders here assembled have set the course to see us through.
  If the American people exhibit the best aspects of their nature--
courage, compassion, strength, resolve, community--the leaders in the 
chamber will deliver accordingly.
  I will always treasure the time I had here. I won some, I lost some, 
but I tried my best to reflect the concerns of those I represented, as 
well as the genuine goodness of the folks who call North Dakota home.
  North Dakotans have selected a new Congressman, Representative-elect 
Rick Berg, and I wish him great success in delivering for our state.
  In conclusion, there is one group in particular I want to thank--all 
of those who have served on my staff now at the end or any time during 
these nine terms. Present and recent staff members include Bob Siggins, 
Melanie Rhinehart Van Tassel, Stacy Austad, Brenden Timpe, Adam Durand, 
Dustin Olson, Diane Oakley, Chris Cunningham, Matt Pearce, Hillary 
Price, David Grant, Annie Finkenbinder, Ross Keys, Joan Carlson, Dianne 
Mondry, Nick Keaveny, Geoff Greenwood, Bill Heigaard, and Erin Hill.
  They are extraordinarily talented and dedicated individuals, 
reflective of the wonderfully gifted staff members I have been 
privileged to work with for the 18 years of my service in the House.
  Now I look forward to more time with my wife, Mary, and my children, 
Kathryn and Scott, as this term ends and my membership in this body 
ceases.
  I thank my colleagues for their commitment to work so hard to serve 
their constituents and our country.
  I have been richly blessed to have had the chance to work with you in 
the people's House--the United States Congress.

                          ____________________
