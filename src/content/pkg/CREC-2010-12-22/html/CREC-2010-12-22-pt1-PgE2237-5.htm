                          HON. DANNY K. DAVIS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                       Tuesday, December 21, 2010

  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5116, 
the America COMPETES Act. To maintain economic growth and a high 
standard of living, our nation must remain competitive in a global 
economy. To be competitive, U.S. companies must engage in trade, 
preserve market shares, and provide sustainable products, processes, 
and services. Scientific and technological advances serve as critical 
components of economic growth because they contribute to the creation 
of new goods, services, jobs, and increased productivity. Our country 
is in need of innovative concepts and ideas to strengthen our economy 
both domestically and internationally. The America COMPETES Act will 
increase the nation's investment in science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics, STEM. Further, COMPETES provides critical federal 
investment in science through research and education. I am pleased that 
the 111th Congress will reauthorize this law, and I am pleased that it 
contains some important elements to broaden the participation of groups 
of Americans who are underrepresented in STEM fields, such as women and 
racial or ethnic minorities.
  According to the Census Bureau, 39 percent of the population under 
the age of 18 is a racial or ethnic minority. Yet, in 2003, only 4.4 
percent of U.S. science and engineering jobs were held by African 
Americans and only 3.4 percent by Hispanics. In 2008, the American 
Community Survey reported that 10.3 percent of the total U.S. 
population were in the Professional, Scientific, Management and 
Administrative Services industry; however, only 7.7 percent of 
Cambodians, 6.8 percent of Hmongs, and 5.2 percent of Laotians actually 
held these types of jobs. Further, women represent only a little more 
than one quarter of our science and technology workforce. Many experts 
maintain that the ability of the U.S. to produce enough scientists will 
fall far short unless we take strong action to develop the potential of 
women and minorities. Thus, broadening participation efforts are 
critical to meeting the growing demand for U.S. workers with STEM 
skills and to improving American competitiveness globally.
  Although minorities have increased their share of degrees awarded in 
the sciences, poor preparation in science and mathematics is a major 
factor limiting the access of these citizens to careers in the STEM 
fields. H.R. 5116 helps improve secondary STEM education by requiring 
federal agencies to report how they are disseminating federally funded 
STEM education resources to practitioners, including to teachers and 
administrators at high-needs schools. Further, it requires the 
establishment of an inventory of federally sponsored STEM education 
programs that must include an assessment of the effectiveness of the 
programs and the rates of participation of underrepresented minorities 
in such programs. An increased investment in STEM-based programs will 
offer more high-level science and mathematics courses in high school, 
enhance undergraduate and graduate degrees in science and engineering, 
and solidify employment in science and engineering positions in this 
global economy. The National Science

Foundation will receive substantial funds to develop and implement a 
policy for the broader impacts review criterion that will result in 
improving the effectiveness and impact of activities to broaden 
participation within STEM. Such a policy is long overdue. We spend 
billions of federal dollars for science advancements but have limited 
requirements for the institutions receiving these dollars to give back 
to the nation in terms of helping institutions or students beyond their 
walls improve their access to quality science.
  I support the bill because it advances our nation in the STEM areas; 
however, I am disappointed that many of the provisions to broaden 
participation that were included in the House-passed version were 
absent from the final version. I promise to continue to work to ensure 
that all Americans have access to high quality STEM education and 
careers. I support H.R. 5116, the America COMPETES Act of 2010; this 
bill will enhance our present practices in science and our economic 
strength in the global marketplace.
