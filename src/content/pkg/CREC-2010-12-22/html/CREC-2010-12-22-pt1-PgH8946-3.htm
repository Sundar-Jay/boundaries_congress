                   PASS THE 9/11 HEALTH BENEFITS BILL

  (Mr. HIMES asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. HIMES. Madam Speaker, what does the Congress owe the American 
people? I think it owes a young man or a young woman who will put on 
the uniform of this Nation and agree to sacrifice his or her life the 
right to serve. The Republicans, all but a handful of courageous 
Republicans, disagree.
  I think that it owes a child who was brought here by their parents 
from a country they don't know, who speaks a language they don't speak, 
the opportunity to serve, to get a degree, to ultimately become an 
American. The Republicans disagree.
  But I know, Madam Speaker, that we owe those brave responders who 
went to the site of 9/11 and risked their health and risked their lives 
to serve others in this Nation's moment of pain, we owe them health 
care. The Republican Party disagrees. And it is to the shame of this 
institution and it will be to the eternal shame of the Republican Party 
if they do not allow us, after helping the banks, after helping the 
auto companies, after helping Americans, if they do not allow us to 
help the volunteers of 9/11.
