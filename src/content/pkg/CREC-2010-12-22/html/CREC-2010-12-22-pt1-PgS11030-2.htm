                    CARROLL COLLEGE FIGHTING SAINTS

<bullet> Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, today I wish to recognize an 
outstanding championship college football team from my home State.
  This past Saturday in Rome, GA the Carroll College Fighting Saints 
claimed another National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics 
national title with a hard fought 10 to 7 win over rival and fellow 
NAIA powerhouse the University of Sioux Falls Cougars. The win gives 
the Fighting Saints an unprecedented sixth national title in the past 
nine seasons. Coming into the game, Sioux Falls had won 42 games in a 
row. In fact, their last loss was to Carroll in the 2007 title game.
  Carroll College is a private, Catholic college in my hometown of 
Helena, MT. Carroll boasts an enrollment of about 1,500 students and is 
known around the country for its award-winning academic and 
preprofessional programs. The school is particularly strong in 
premedical, engineering, and nursing programs.
  The game Saturday was a hard-fought victory marked by key big plays 
on offense led by Saints quarterback Gary Wagner and a tough defense 
that shut down the Cougars high-powered offense. Wagner, a native of 
Havre, MT, was named the offensive player of the game and scored the 
Saints' only touchdown on an amazing 83-yard run. The winning points 
were provided by place kicker Tom Yaremko on a clutch 22 yard field 
goal in the fourth quarter.
  I would like to congratulate head coach Mike Van Diest and his 
coaching staff, along with Athletic Director Bruce Parker and Doctor 
Tom Trebon, the president of Carroll College, for their hard work and 
dedication in

coaching and teaching these fine student athletes. The motto of Carroll 
College is ``Not for School, but for life.'' Certainly the members of 
Carroll's football team have learned many life lessons. Coach Van Diest 
preaches the importance of getting a quality education, the value of 
teamwork, and the need to give back to the community. Last year 32 
Fighting Saints were named to the Frontier Conference All-Academic 
team.
  The Fighting Saints have a dedicated following throughout Montana. 
Thousands of fans dressed in purple and gold pack into Nelson Stadium 
on the Carroll campus for each home game. I always look forward to 
joining them whenever I can. And numerous fans made the long trip to 
Georgia to cheer on the Fighting Saints in the national title game.
  Now another reason that I am so excited about the Saints winning 
another title is because of a bet I made with my good friend Senator 
Tim Johnson. I put a case of Montana microbrew beer on the line with 
confidence knowing the Saints would pull out the win, and Senator 
Johnson put up some buffalo steaks with faith that his Cougars would 
prevail. I am looking forward to enjoying those steaks, and I thank 
Senator Johnson for being such a good sport. I would also like to 
commend the University of Sioux Falls on a fine football season.
  My congratulations and admiration goes out to all the Carroll coaches 
and players for their success and being great ambassadors for the State 
of Montana. Their hard work, dedication, and grit truly represent the 
best that Big Sky country has to offer. I look forward to cheering them 
on again next season as they go for title No. 7.<bullet>
