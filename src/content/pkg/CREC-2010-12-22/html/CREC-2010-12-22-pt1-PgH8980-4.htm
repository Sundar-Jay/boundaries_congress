             APPOINTING A COMMITTEE TO INFORM THE PRESIDENT

  Mr. McDERMOTT. Madam Speaker, I send to the desk a privileged 
resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.
  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:

                              H. Res. 1784

       Resolved, That a committee of two Members of the House be 
     appointed to wait upon the President of the United States and 
     inform him that the House of Representatives has completed 
     its business of the session and is ready to adjourn, unless 
     the President has some other communication to make to them.

  The resolution was agreed to.
  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.
