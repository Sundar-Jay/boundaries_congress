                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                            HON. IKE SKELTON

                              of missouri

                    in the house of representatives

                       Friday, December 17, 2010

  Mr. SKELTON. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following exchange of letters 
on H.R. 6523 for printing in the Congressional Record:

         House of Representatives, Committee on Science and 
           Technology,
                                Washington, DC, December 21, 2010.
     Hon. Ike Skelton,
     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,
     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.
       Dear Chairman Skelton: I am writing to you concerning the 
     jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Science and 
     Technology in H.R. 6523, the Ike Skelton National Defense 
     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011.
       Our committee recognizes the importance of H.R. 6523 and 
     the need for the legislation to move expeditiously. 
     Therefore, while we have a valid claim to jurisdiction over 
     the bill, I do not intend to request a sequential referral. 
     This, of course, is conditional on our mutual understanding 
     that nothing in this legislation or my decision to forego a 
     sequential referral waives, reduces or otherwise affects the 
     jurisdiction of the Committee on Science and Technology, and 
     that a copy of this letter and your response acknowledging 
     our jurisdictional interest will be included in the 
     Congressional Record during consideration of this bill by the 
     House.
       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
           Sincerely,
                                                      Bart Gordon,
     Chairman.
                                  ____

         House Committee on Armed Services, House of 
           Representatives,
                                Washington, DC, December 21, 2010.
     Hon. Bart Gordon,
     Chairman, House Committee on Science and Technology, 
         Washington, DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. 
     6523, the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for 
     Fiscal Year 2011. 1 agree that the Committee on Science and 
     Technology has valid jurisdictional claims to certain 
     provisions in this important legislation, and I am most 
     appreciative of your decision not to schedule a mark-up of 
     this bill in the interest of expediting consideration of this 
     important measure. I agree that by agreeing to waive 
     consideration of certain provisions of the bill, the 
     Committee on Science and Technology is not waiving its 
     jurisdictional claims over these matters.
       During consideration of this bill on the House floor, I 
     will ask that this exchange of letters be included in the 
     Congressional Record.
           Very truly yours,
                                                      Ike Skelton,
     Chairman.
