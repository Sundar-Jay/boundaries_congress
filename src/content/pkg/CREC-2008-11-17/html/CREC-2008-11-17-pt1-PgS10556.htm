              100TH ANNIVERSARY OF ALLENSWORTH, CALIFORNIA

<bullet> Mrs. Boxer. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Town of Allensworth, a town 
located in California's San Joaquin Valley founded by COL Allen 
Allensworth.
  After his retirement, COL Allen Allensworth, who escaped slavery 
during the Civil War to serve with the Union Army, arrived in 
California in hopes of developing a settlement where hard work and a 
strong sense of community would enable the town's residents and future 
generations to realize their full potential as free citizens and 
without discrimination.
  In 1908, the settlers eventually settled on a region located between 
Fresno and Bakersfield in Tulare County, a site with an abundance of 
rich farm land, a site that they would name ``Allensworth'' in honor of 
the Colonel whose belief in self-determination and liberty led them to 
central California.
  In just a few years after its founding, the town of Allensworth grew 
from a remote outpost to a vibrant community with a school, church, and 
a number of thriving businesses. The library in Allensworth was the 
first in Tulare County. Allensworth was a close-knit community where 
residents often came together to participate in formal debates, plays, 
and a number of social activities.
  After Colonel Allensworth's passing in 1914, a number of families 
remained in pursuit of his vision, and their dedication to the 
principles of freedom and liberty earned the town the title ``the town 
that refused to die.''
  In 1974, the California State Parks purchased the townsite of 
Allensworth, and it became the Colonel Allensworth Historic State Park, 
the first State park that highlights the contributions made by African-
American pioneers to the State of California.
  Today, the Allensworth Historic State Park, where many of the town's 
original buildings have been restored and reconstructed, provides a 
window for visitors to see the vision of COL Allen Allensworth, a true 
California pioneer.
  The story of the town of Allensworth's years is a testament to the 
value of freedom and determination. As its many admirers gather to 
celebrate the 100th anniversary of Allensworth, I thank them for their 
support and wish them a successful and enjoyable visit.<bullet>
