                     TRIBUTE TO JOHN J. LEONE, JR.

<bullet> Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, today I wish to honor Mr. John 
J. Leone, Jr. of Bristol, CT. A dedicated public servant who has served 
his community for over 40 years, John will retire from his position as 
president and CEO of the Greater Bristol Chamber of Commerce at the end 
of the year.
  John has been head of the Greater Bristol Chamber of Commerce, the 
third largest chamber in Connecticut, for 18 years. Under his 
leadership, the chamber grew immensely, going from 450 members to 
1,820. John demonstrated a remarkable ability to bring people from all 
walks of life together behind a project. He played an integral role in 
securing State and Federal funding for the extension of route 72, which 
will help commuters in central Connecticut and provide a significant 
boost to merchants in downtown Bristol.
  John's tenure with the chamber was the capstone of a lifetime spent 
serving Bristol. He was the mayor from 1984-1991, where he was elected 
to four terms. Before being elected mayor, he

was a cop for the Bristol Police Department. He has served as secretary 
of the Bristol Boys and Girls Club and as treasurer of the Metro 
Chambers of Commerce organization, which is composed of the seven 
largest chambers in Connecticut. He was also chairman of the Chambers 
Benefit Leadership Council, which pools together businesses from 
Connecticut and western Massachusetts for the purpose of purchasing 
health benefits.
  Given the deep commitment John has shown for Bristol, it is no 
surprise that he intends to remain in the Mum City. I couldn't be more 
thrilled that such a devoted civil leader will still be part of the 
community. I am sure he will find ways to remain involved.
  I extend to John Leone my sincerest thanks and heartfelt best wishes 
on a well deserved retirement. Connecticut is a better place because of 
him.<bullet>
