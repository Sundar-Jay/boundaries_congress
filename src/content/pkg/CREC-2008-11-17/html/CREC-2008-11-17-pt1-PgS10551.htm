                              Larry Craig

  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise to recognize the service of a 
great public servant and an outstanding leader.

U.S. Senate. He has been a fervent leader to the people of Idaho with 
unwavering devotion.

to the needs and interests of Idahoans by constructing strong, 
sustainable rural communities, seeking access to adequate, affordable 
health care and developing natural resource and energy policies that 
protect the environment and keep consistency with economic growth.
  Senator Craig's leadership in promoting economic development and 
strengthening American agriculture has led to the improvement of both 
agricultural studies and programs. His resilient leadership has helped 
to foster numerous programs in Idaho that will benefit agricultural 
entrepreneurship and help to strengthen the partnership between State 
and Federal groups. Senator Craig has truly served the people of Idaho 
with distinction.

placed the importance of our future generation at the forefront. He 
recognizes the necessity of cultivating the young minds of today to 
ensure a bright future. Over a decade ago, Senator Domenici introduced 
the Character Counts Program into New Mexico's school curriculum. Under 
the guidance of this program, schoolchildren learn the value of 
trustworthiness, respect, responsibility, fairness, caring, and 
citizenship as they build their character. Such traits are reflected in 
Senator Domenici. His legacy of public service has truly left its mark 
on Congress and will forever remain in the hearts of New Mexicans.

                              john sununu

  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise today to honor my colleague, 
Senator John Sununu, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this 
term. Senator Sununu has represented the great State of New Hampshire 
for 12 years in Congress, serving six of those years in the Senate. 
Senator Sununu and I both served on the Finance Committee. Although we 
did not always agree, I found John to be willing to work in a 
bipartisan manner to confront the major challenges that our great 
Nation faces.
  Raised in Salem, NH, John Sununu became interested in public service 
early in life when his mother served as chair of the local school 
board. John attended public school in Salem and later earned advanced 
degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard 
Graduate School of Business.
  John Sununu was elected to represent New Hampshire's First Electoral 
District in the House of Representatives in 1996. In the House, John 
served on the Budget and Appropriations Committees. He quickly rose in 
rank on the Budget Committee, becoming its vice chairman. In 2002, he 
was elected to represent the Granite State in this Chamber, becoming 
its youngest Member.
  John and I worked together on numerous occasions. We both served on 
the Finance Committee This summer, John joined the so-called ``Gang of 
Ten'' as it expanded from 10 to 20 members. Together, we sought 
pragmatic, bipartisan solutions to our Nation's energy crisis. Senator 
Sununu also joined me in standing up for our Nation's senior citizens 
and opposing cuts to Medicare-financed nursing home care.
  John will be remembered for his commitment to individual liberties 
and limited Government. In the uncertainties of today's world, Senator 
Sununu has been a voice for preserving civil liberties in the light of 
increased law enforcement needs.
  I thank Senator Sununu for his years of public service and wish him 
and his family the best in the future.
