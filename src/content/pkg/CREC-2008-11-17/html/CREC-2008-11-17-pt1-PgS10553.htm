                         TRIBUTE TO LYNN BAKER

  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I wish today to express my deep 
gratitude and heartfelt best wishes to my administrative director, Lynn 
Baker, who will be retiring at the end of the month after 27 years of 
distinguished service in the U.S. Senate.
  Lynn is a perfect example of the countless people who serve the 
Senate as dedicated, nonpartisan employees. Whether it has been as a 
member of committee staff or in personal offices, the Senate could not 
function without professional staff such as Lynn Baker.
  Over the past 27 years, Lynn has worked with many staff and interns, 
all of whom have benefitted from her experience, wisdom, and guidance. 
When asked about Lynn, many current and former staffers will tell you 
that she is always willing to listen and offer advice. She takes great 
pride in encouraging junior staffers to develop their abilities and 
pursue their goals. One former staffer remembers that Lynn made her 
feel like part of the family when she opened her home to this staffer 
until appropriate housing could be found. It is no wonder that Lynn 
stays in touch with so many of those with whom she has worked 
throughout her tenure in the Senate.
  Lynn graduated with a degree in history from Lake Forest College in 
Illinois, including a semester abroad in Florence. She subsequently 
worked in a Washington law firm for 2 years before joining Senator 
Charles H. Percy of Illinois' staff on the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations. During a 7-year period on Senator Percy's staff, Lynn 
also served as office manager for his personal office before she became 
chief clerk of the Subcommittee on Energy, Nuclear Proliferation and 
Government Process.
  Following a 4-year absence from the Senate, Lynn returned in 1987 as 
executive assistant and scheduling director for Senator Kent Conrad of 
North Dakota. When she became office manager for Senator Mark O. 
Hatfield of Oregon, Lynn worked closely with senior Disbursing Office 
staff to develop the first electronic financial management system and 
time and attendance system for personal Senate offices. Following 
Senator Hatfield's retirement, Lynn worked as office manager for Max 
Baucus of Montana before returning to the Senate Committee on 
Governmental Affairs as chief clerk in 1998. Lynn was financial clerk 
of the committee when I assumed the chairmanship in 2001, and then 
moved to my personal office as administrative director in 2003.
  As administrative director, Lynn has made a number of contributions 
that have helped my office better serve Connecticut. Always open to new 
ideas, Lynn implemented the acquisition and use of new technologies 
that enabled my staff to perform their duties more efficiently. She 
also took the initiative to update and rewrite my office policy manual, 
and played a leading role in integrating my office with a new software 
system that will revolutionize the way my staff communicates and works 
together. Lynn was instrumental in the redesign of my Senate office in 
2005, which resulted in an attractive, comfortable, and functional work 
space.
  Lynn has formed many lasting friendships throughout the Senate 
community, where she is beloved and respected for her character, 
judgment, and professionalism. I know I speak for my staff and many in 
the Senate family when I say how difficult it will be for us to bid a 
fond farewell to Lynn. Her patience, warmth, and wise counsel will be 
greatly missed. However, we all wish Lynn good health and happiness 
always as she begins her well-deserved retirement. I know that she has 
much to look forward to with her loving husband, Steve Nousen, and 
their son, Daniel Baker.
  I extend to Lynn Baker my personal thanks and congratulations for 27 
years of exemplary public service to the U.S. Senate.
