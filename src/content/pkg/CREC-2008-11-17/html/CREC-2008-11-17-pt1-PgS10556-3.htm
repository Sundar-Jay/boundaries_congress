                      TRIBUTE TO BARBRA STREISAND

<bullet> Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased and honored to pay 
tribute to the legendary Barbra Streisand, one of the most talented and 
successful female entertainers in modern history. For more than 40 
years, Barbra's wildly successful career in music, television, film, 
and theater has enamored fans across America and abroad. In recognition 
of her great achievements and contributions to American culture, Barbra 
has been named a Kennedy Center Honoree for 2008.
  Barbra Streisand was born on April 24, 1942 in Brooklyn, NY. The 
daughter of Diana and Emanual Streisand, Barbra passionately pursued 
her dream of a career in show business from a young age. After getting 
her start in New York City night clubs, Barbra signed a contract with 
Columbia Records in 1962.
  In 1963, the 21-year-old singer won two Grammy Awards, including 
Album of the Year. At that time, Barbra was the youngest artist to have 
ever received that award. Barbra has now recorded 60 albums, sold over 
148 million albums worldwide, and is one of the highest-selling female 
artists of all time.
  In 1965, ``My Name is Barbra,'' her first television special, earned 
five Emmys and the distinguished Peabody Award. In 1968, she earned the 
Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in her very first 
motion picture, ``Funny Girl.'' In 1976, Barbra became the first female 
composer to win an Academy Award, for her song ``Evergreen'' from the 
film ``A Star Is Born.''
  Barbra continued smashing glass ceilings when she became the first 
woman ever to direct, write, and star in a major motion picture. 
``Yentl'' received five Academy Award nominations. She also directed, 
wrote, and starred in ``Prince of Tides,'' which received even more 
nominations, including one for Best Picture. Barbra is one of a very 
few individuals who has won an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar, and a Tony 
award.
  As her career continues to rise to unfathomable heights, Barbra never 
shies away from an opportunity to improve the lives of others. She has 
worked tirelessly on issues of national and international importance. 
Her commitment to social justice is demonstrated by the work of the 
Streisand Foundation--which benefits national organizations working on 
the protection of civil rights, environmental preservation, voter 
education, nuclear disarmament, and women's health. Barbra received the 
Humanitarian Award from the Human Rights Campaign in 2004.
  Barbra's unparalleled talent, enthusiasm and commitment are reflected 
by the millions of individuals whose lives she has touched. We are 
grateful for Barbra's innumerable gifts, and I hope you will all join 
me in celebrating the remarkable Barbra Streisand.<bullet>
