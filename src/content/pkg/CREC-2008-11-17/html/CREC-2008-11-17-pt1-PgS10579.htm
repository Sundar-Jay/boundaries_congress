          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Levin, and Ms. 
        Stabenow):
  S. 3684. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow 
an above-the-line deduction against individual income tax for interest 
in indebtedness and for State sales and excise taxes with respect to 
the purchase of certain motor vehicles; to the Committee on Finance.
  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, our economy is in shambles. People are 
losing their jobs, they are losing their life savings, and they are 
losing their homes. Congress must act and we must act now.
  I agree with the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, that this 
session of the Congress and this session of the Senate should not be 
called a lameduck. We should neither be lame nor should we duck the big 
issue facing our country. We have helped out. If you look at what we 
have done already--well, we have already done a bailout. We helped the 
sharks and we helped the whales. Now it is time to help the minnows, 
the little guy and gal, the American consumer.
  I have that solution. Today, I introduce legislation, cosponsored by 
my colleague from Missouri, to save jobs in the American automobile 
industry, to help consumers, and get our economy back on track. It is 
simple, it is straightforward, and it is bipartisan. It is also timely 
and temporary.
  My bill would save jobs. What is it that I want to do? I want to 
stimulate demand in the automobile industry so people actually come 
into showrooms and buy cars, minivans, or light trucks. Why is this a 
good idea? Actually, if you buy a car, someone has to make it, someone 
has to sell it, someone has to service it, and someone has to provide 
administrative services. This is good for manufacturers, the dealers, 
and the suppliers. It could save considerable jobs in the auto 
industry.
  My bill is not about bailouts. It is about jobs, jobs, jobs. Six 
million jobs are at stake in the American car industry. One out of ten 
jobs in America relies on the auto industry. Right now, the facts are 
gloomy. Sales are down. The auto industry has already cut over 100,000 
jobs. The 30,000 American dealerships in this country are at risk of 
losing 37,000 jobs. We cannot let this happen. We cannot let the 
American automobile industry implode.
  I believe we can help by getting the consumers into the showroom, 
have them feel that Government is on their side in helping them with 
one of the biggest purchases during this tough time.
  What does this amendment do? My bill is simple. If you buy a 
passenger car, minivan, or light truck between November 12 of this year 
and December 31 of 2009, you will get a tax deduction for your sales or 
excise tax and the interest on your loan. Families can save anywhere 
from $2,000 to $5,000 by the Mikulski-Bond bill.
  This is a big deal because, next to the purchase of your home, the 
purchase of your automobile is your next big ticket.
  It is targeted. I cap it at families with an income of over $250,000 
a year. It focuses on the middle-income and the middle-class family 
cars. It is also timely because we need to know that the biggest 6-week 
period for automobile sales is between Thanksgiving and New Year's Eve. 
They sell other cars during 6-week periods, but between Thanksgiving 
and New Year's

[[Page S10580]]

Eve is the biggest 6-week sale. This bill also helps the environment 
because it gets more people in more fuel-efficient cars.
  This bill is not limited to only American cars. It focuses on any 
car, recognizing that many automobiles are now made in southern States, 
as Texas does Toyotas; Kentucky does Toyotas; Tennessee does Nissans. 
Any way we look at it, even though it might have a foreign logo, it is 
American jobs doing the manufacturing.
  What would this mean? I have here a chart--it is bigger than me--for 
a Dodge minivan. The average minivans cost about $25,500.
  On a 4-year loan at an 8 percent excise tax, it would result in a 
savings of anywhere, depending on the State, from $1,500 to $2,000.
  I have already heard from people all over this country how that, plus 
the deals being offered by manufacturers and dealers, could result in 
being able to buy a minivan for under $20,000 a year.
  This would be fantastic. I could put up chart after chart for the 
Malibu, for the Ford pickup 150, for the Toyota Camry. This would 
stimulate demand. Just think what it means. People could come into a 
showroom of their choice, and if we passed this bill--it would be 
retroactive to the day I announced they could actually buy something 
that would put them on the road with a car that is more fuel efficient 
with lower carbon emissions.
  At the same time, jobs, jobs, jobs. As I said, there are 30,000 new 
car dealerships nationwide. They employ close to 1 million people. In 
my own home State there are 300 dealerships. People do not realize that 
dealers in many rural parts of my State usually employ over 50 people 
in sales, the auto mechanics, as well as the administrative positions. 
This legislation would help them because they would actually be 
working. It would help the people who are actually making those.
  Senator Specter said he has been traveling the State. I have been 
traveling mine too. I went to the General Motors plant in Maryland at 
White Marsh where they make the new power transmission. Right now they 
can make a Tahoe hybrid, a Tahoe, a big muscle car, that with the 
hybrid technology they have now, can get the same mileage as a Toyota 
Camry.
  If you also talk to the people who worked there, they could employ 
1,000; they now employ 250 people. If you were with me in the car 
dealership and would talk to people such as the mechanic--I talked to a 
mechanic who works for a Chevy dealer in Bethesda. He has worked there 
for 23 years.
  He said to me: Senator Barb, all my life I have loved to work on 
cars. I just love it. I love to fix them; I love to repair them. If 
they are new, I want to make sure they are fit for duty. I have earned 
a good living. I have been happy. I think I have helped make a lot of 
other people happy. But the only way I can stay happy is if I continue 
to work. I have a mortgage. I have two kids in college. Maybe they are 
going to go into engineering, I do not know, but I know if we do not 
get more people into this dealership my job could be gone.
  Talk to the dealer. The dealer's name is Sam. The first thing you 
know about him is he wears the little Rotary pin on his lapel because 
he is the guy who not only provides jobs, tries to provide good deals 
to customers, but also is the one who is part of the Chamber of 
Commerce, part of the United Way.
  We are talking about people who are part of the fabric of our 
society. We are not talking about an abstraction. We are not talking 
about a single ZIP code like Wall Street. We are talking about the 
automobile industry in every State and every community. So when we help 
them, we are helping ourselves.
  People say: what is the cost of this, Senator Barb? Well, I will tell 
you. It is about $8 billion. They go: Oh, well, we just spent $350 
billion and threw it down the rat hole. We do not have anything to show 
for this $350 billion but more arrogance and more greed. While they 
want Americans to dine on Lean Cuisine, they are dining on spa cuisine.
  So I think it is time we help people in our own community, help the 
consumers who want to participate in the economy. Clunkers get traded 
in, and we also help them. Maybe you know somebody who works for a 
hedge fund, I do not. But I do know the people who work for the 
automobile industry--whether it is the dealers or the receptionist who 
came to work 43 years ago right out of high school who said: Senator 
Barb, we could not sell cars in those days, but I have been here in and 
out of this same dealer for 43 years, raised my kids, earned a good 
living, did the back office work. I want to keep on doing it. I am not 
ready for Social Security, and, for God's sake, do not put it in Wall 
Street.
  Well, I say do not put Social Security on Wall Street and do not put 
another nickel on Wall Street. If we are going to help with our 
economy, let's do it where it creates jobs.
  I wanted to explain the bill I have introduced today that I am going 
to bring up as part of our economic recovery plan on Wednesday. But 
most of all, what I wanted to say is, the Congress should not go home 
until we see how we are going to help this economy get rolling.
  I think my bill which has been cosponsored by Senator Bond puts 
wheels on the American economy, and I hope I have victory on it later 
this week.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.
  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure to join and partner 
with my good friend, Senator Mikulski, on this initiative to save 
American jobs, help American families, support the auto industry, as 
she has just said, and put America back on wheels.
  During those tough economic times, we believe this proposal will help 
American families afford the cars, small trucks, and SUVs they need to 
get to work, to take their kids to school, and encourage investment 
needed to boost auto sales which will help save American jobs, help 
middle-class families, and support the auto industry.
  Selling cars, again, is one of the most important things we can do 
for the entire auto industry, by encouraging now tentative buyers who 
are worried about making the payments to go ahead and purchase. This is 
the best way to get our auto industry back to work and provide the jobs 
people need.
  In my home State of Missouri and throughout the Nation car sales have 
declined sharply in recent months, and there will likely be a further 
decline as the economy struggles. Cars and trucks are one of the 
largest purchases for households. Most rely on some kind of financing 
to acquire the vehicles.
  By making interest payments and sales and excise taxes deductible, 
this program will help middle-class families afford the cars, SUVs, and 
light trucks they need to get to work and take their kids to school. 
This should mean real savings to middle-class families who are 
struggling to pay a mortgage or rent, buy groceries, and afford health 
care.
  This proposal also helps the struggling auto industry and millions of 
jobs that are dependent on them: auto suppliers, steel and glass 
manufacturers, and the car dealers.
  There are closing car dealerships in Missouri. They are shutting 
their doors, laying off workers, cutting jobs. Others are facing real 
squeezes. They, too, may be facing this same crisis if they do not get 
people purchasing cars.
  With our economy shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs over the past 
several months, it is critical that we act now to prevent further 
losses to an industry that touches the entire Nation.
  Now, in addition to this tax proposal, I think we must take action to 
provide bridge loan financing to Detroit's big three auto companies. 
The idea of getting Government involved in the free market is 
troublesome and potentially dangerous to the health of our system, but 
I strongly believe we have to act in unique times of crisis when 
millions of workers are in danger of losing their jobs. We are clearly 
in this unique crisis. We are experiencing a crisis unparalleled since 
the Great Depression.
  It is for that reason that I will not turn my back on hundreds of 
thousands of Missouri jobs. Now is the time to act. Unlike many other 
industries, the auto industry touches, as I said, millions of 
manufacturing and servicing jobs across the Nation.
  Over 100,000 auto workers are in assembly plants, more than 1 million 
workers are at auto dealerships in every State, over 300,000 workers 
are in the wholesale end of the auto industry,

[[Page S10581]]

over 800,000 workers work in auto repair, and over 500,000 workers are 
in auto parts plants.
  These autoworkers are not just in big cities such as Detroit. 
Autoworkers are found supporting families in small- and medium-sized 
communities across rural America.
  In my home State of Missouri, small towns such as Maryville in 
northwest Missouri have 10,000 people, and 1,800 families depend upon 
the 200 workers at the Federal-Mogul plant. They are making steering 
systems. Closing that plant will be a tough blow to the Maryville 
community dependent upon it.
  We have 500 jobs at the Dura plant in Moberly, 400 at the Gates plant 
in Versailles, 170 at the Modine plant in Joplin. On and on it goes, 
like a long list of just about every Missouri small- and medium-sized 
town. We cannot afford to pull the plug on the manufacturing backbone 
of rural America.
  These auto-dependent jobs, whether they are union or not--and many 
are not--provide very good wages. They are manufacturing jobs that 
support middle-class families. They provide health care benefits for 
families, retirement for the elderly, and a couple weeks of paid 
vacation. Without these blue-collar jobs, many of these middle-class 
families would slip back into lower incomes with no health care, little 
hope for college, and an uncertain future. We have to fight for working 
people and their jobs and not allow their employers to go under.
  Despite the real need for temporary emergency assistance to save jobs 
in Missouri and across the country, I do not support a blank check from 
the Government. I want to make sure we are not simply throwing good 
money after bad. It is critical that any rescue include three basic 
principles: First, the bill must have strong taxpayer protection. This 
means any bill must ensure that taxpayers are repaid for their 
emergency assistance and that taxpayers share in the turnaround profits 
of participating automakers.
  Second, the bill must include executive accountability so that failed 
executives are not rewarded for poor management. I do not know about 
you, but I am offended when I read in the paper that companies getting 
Federal bailout money are using it to pay bonuses. Some of them said 
they have already set the bonuses aside. Well, if they set the bonuses 
aside, they set them aside as their company was going down. Getting 
money from the Federal Government should not enable them to make those 
bonus payments.
  I have seen one major Wall Street firm saying it is going to stop 
bonuses until this crisis is over. I think that is something we should 
commend. I think that is a practice that ought to be followed.
  Third, and most important--and this is key--the bill must include 
significant financial reform so that recipients of taxpayer funds 
demonstrate that they have a plan to ensure long-term competitiveness, 
health, and profitability by bringing their costs under control.
  Funds should be conditioned on a strong restructuring plan for the 
industry and for each recipient to have funds so that this aid is a 
bridge to somewhere, not a bridge to nowhere. That is why I need to 
emphasize the need for a real financial strategy that will put the 
Detroit big three on the road to competitiveness, health, and 
profitability.
  I believe we ought to set up a system where a responsible Government 
agency, a Secretary-level official, has to approve the continuing 
plans, the goals, the definable standards that must be met, and that 
official ought to hold them accountable for accomplishing the purposes, 
cutting the costs, and making the tough business decisions that are 
necessary to assure profitability.
  Well, these are things I believe most of my colleagues want to see. I 
do not believe anybody wants to see the auto industry go down. But 
there is real concern that if we put in some money now, we may be back 
seeing them in the same condition several months down the road.
  Well, the time has come for the auto industry to lay out for 
Government officials in their ability to approve the release of these 
funds if they have a plan. And as they go forward, they ought to be 
required to show the approving official that they are taking those 
steps that are necessary to make their plants and their companies 
profitable.
  Some ask: Why don't we just allow the automakers to fall into 
bankruptcy like some in the airline industry? We all know bankruptcy 
has successfully allowed many airlines to get back in the air. I am 
afraid it would be a disaster for the thousands of parts and service 
businesses dependent on major automakers. How would they get credit to 
run their operations to supply a company in bankruptcy? How would the 
bankrupt company in the current crisis get the credit it needs to 
emerge from bankruptcy? Who is going to buy a car from a bankrupt 
company? What protections would they have for their warranties and 
other requirements they have for servicing?
  Others say a financial rescue has no place in the free market. I 
agree that generally that is a good question. But even free markets 
need oversight and a safety net. That is why we have the Federal 
Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation. Each of these agencies is designed to 
take emergency actions in times of emergency. Clearly, that is what we 
have. That is why we should respond now.
  There have been a lot of discussions on the source of funding for the 
auto industry, whether it should come out of the Treasury's Troubled 
Asset Relief Program, or TARP, or the Department of Energy's Section 
136 program. I am pleased to see that there seems to be broad support 
for assisting the auto industry despite the differences in funding. I 
support either or both of these measures of support, provided we meet 
the conditions I laid out which include significantly laying out a plan 
to profitability, cost cutting that will be approved and then will be 
monitored by the appropriate Government official who has the power to 
continue to release the funds.
  I will discuss in other remarks how the TARP has changed in purpose 
from what we were told it would be. It has continued to change. I am 
afraid it has caused a great deal of uncertainty, which, obviously, 
markets do not like. But before closing, I wish to suggest an area 
where there is great need and where I believe the funds under the 
Troubled Asset Relief Program can and should be used to give the 
economy a major boost, creating the jobs we badly need, and that is in 
State and local government infrastructure.
  Despite the Government's efforts to thaw the credit crunch, State and 
local governments continue to face hardships in municipal bond 
financing. People were telling me, once we got the money into the 
banks, credit would loosen up and municipal bonds could be sold. So 
far, we are not seeing that. State and local bond and debt financing is 
still a problem. In Missouri and throughout the Nation, many 
infrastructure projects are being delayed or scaled back due to credit 
problems, the inability to get credit, and they have not faced it in 
many years.
  Even State and local governments with high credit ratings are 
struggling to obtain affordable financing. In Missouri, for example, we 
have some $800 million approved in debt to rebuild our bridges. The 
city of Kansas City, MO, has $200 million it is ready to spend on its 
water and sewer infrastructure. The St. Louis Airport is badly in need 
of funding for $100 million in upgrades to facilitate commerce and 
continue to provide jobs. I believe the funds should be used to 
purchase those portions of those debts that can be used to put people 
to work in 2009. Not all of the $800 million on fixing bridges is going 
to be spent in 1 year, but there should be a reasonable judgment as to 
how much work can be started when construction season begins in the 
spring.
  We ought to be willing to have the Federal Government provide the 
funding and get the debt issuance in return, which, if they fund it at 
the current going rate for debt with the Federal Government, should be 
a no-cost ultimate cost to the taxpayer or an addition to the debt. But 
what these infrastructure jobs will do right now is provide work so 
that working men and women will be able to do things such as buy cars, 
provide for their families, spend the money to get the economy growing 
again.
  I urge Treasury to consider assisting the municipal bond market 
through the TARP program. It will not only

[[Page S10582]]

boost infrastructure investments, build the critical infrastructure we 
need to make our economy go forward, but it will create jobs. As has 
been said many times before by people a lot smarter than I, a good job 
is the best social policy we have. A good job is the basis of the 
economy.
  What we are advocating today in the bill I cosponsored with Senator 
Mikulski is a way to get cars sold so they will create jobs all up and 
down the chain in the auto industry and provide a bridge to somewhere 
for the future of the auto industry so they will get their costs under 
control, keep them out of bankruptcy, and make the changes that are 
needed to be competitive in the national and the world market.
  I urge my colleagues to join with us in the legislation by Senator 
Mikulski and also in pushing to use the TARP funds for investment in 
municipal bonds that will put people to work on infrastructure.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):
  S. 3685. A bill to prohibit the selling and counterfeiting of tickets 
for a Presidential inaugural ceremony; to the Committee on Rules and 
Administration.
  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor as chairman of the 
Rules Committee and as chairman of the Joint House-Senate Inaugural 
Committee. I come to introduce legislation to prohibit the selling and 
counterfeiting of tickets to the President's inauguration ceremony.
  The inauguration of the President of the United States is one of the 
most important rituals of our democracy, and the chance to witness this 
solemn event should not be bought and sold similar to tickets to a 
football game. This is not a football game. This is a dignified and 
critical moment of transition in Government, a moment of which 
Americans have always been proud because it is, in fact, the strength 
of our democracy--the fact that all across this great land people go to 
the polls and elect the next President of the United States, they don't 
take to the streets, they don't take to weapons. They elect the next 
President of the United States.
  We have all read the news reports: Tickets bid on the Internet for 
$5,000 apiece, some going as high as $40,000 each. Internet sites today 
are selling tickets they do not have and will not have unless somehow, 
some way they obtain them. I find it unconscionable.
  These tickets are supposed to be free for people, for the volunteers 
who gave up their weekends, walking miles door to door to encourage 
voters to turn out at the polls on election day, for Members of the 
African-American community to see one of their own take the oath of 
office, the highest office in the land, for schoolchildren to witness 
history, and for the American public to watch this affirmation of our 
Constitution, this peaceful transition from one administration to 
another.
  This is going to be a major civic event of our time. Excitement is at 
an all time high, and every one of us has received more phone calls for 
tickets than we could possibly ever meet. People are desperate to 
become part of it, to touch it, to be around, to feel it, to listen to 
it, and they are coming from all over the country. We could have more 
than 1.5 million people descend on the Nation's Capital for this 
inauguration.
  Congress has the responsibility of overseeing this historic event. So 
we must ensure that the inauguration has all the respect and dignity it 
deserves.
  These tickets are supposed to be free for the people. No one should 
have to pay for them. Once more, these tickets are not yet even 
available. They will not be distributed to congressional offices until 
the end of the week before the inauguration. And then the offices will 
require in-person pickup, with secure identification. But they will be 
free and they should stay that way.
  I can tell you what I am going to do. We will ask people to pick up 
their tickets the day before the inauguration in my office. Everyone 
will submit their name, their address, and their driver's license. They 
must be who they are if there are tickets waiting for them. I believe 
this kind of procedure essentially deters unscrupulous people from 
selling these tickets on the Internet. No Web sites or other ticket 
outlets have inaugural swearing-in tickets to sell, despite what some 
of them claim.
  This legislation is aimed at stopping those who seek to profit by 
selling these tickets. It would also target those who seek to dupe the 
public with fraudulent tickets or those who merely promise but can't 
deliver on tickets that they do not actually have.
  I want to say one thing. We are working now to see if there is any 
creative way we might be able to secure more tickets for the House and 
the Senate. We have followed protocol with exactly the same 
distribution system that existed in prior inaugurals, but it is clear 
that there are not as many tickets as there are requests.
  Those who violate the law under this legislation, if in fact it 
passes, would face a class A misdemeanor with a substantial fine, 
imprisonment up to 1 year, or both. I am also very pleased to tell you, 
Mr. President, that eBay and StubHub announced last week that they will 
not allow the sale of inaugural swearing-in tickets on any of their Web 
sites. I want to take this opportunity to thank them and to commend 
them for leading the way.
  It is my hope that Congress will pass this legislation this week. I 
hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it on a hotline. I think 
it is very important to establish once and for all that tickets to the 
inauguration of the next President of the United States are not issues 
of commerce, they are free tickets to be given to the people.
  So I hope that this week this legislation can pass unanimously by 
this body. I send it to the desk and thank the Chair.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill will be received and 
appropriately referred.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. SPECTER:
  S. 3686. A bill to establish an Office of Foreclosure Evaluation to 
coordinate the responsibilities of the Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Housing 
Administration, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Neighborhood 
Reinvestment Corporation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and other Federal 
Government entities regarding foreclosure prevention, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
  Mr. SPECTER. I am now introducing legislation captioned ``The 
Foreclosure Diversion and Mortgage Loan Modification Act of 2008.'' It 
would create an Office of Foreclosure Evaluation inside the Treasury 
Department, to coordinate a great many efforts. The core purpose of 
this legislation is to provide Federal endorsement and financial 
assistance for setting up programs such as those now in existence in 
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and similar programs which exist in New 
York, New Jersey, Ohio, and Connecticut, that suspend foreclosure until 
there has been an opportunity, under court supervision, to have the 
borrower and the lender sit down to try to work out a plan to avoid 
foreclosure. My full statement, which I will ask consent to place in 
the Record, goes into some great detail about the problems that exist 
at the present time regarding foreclosures.
  In addition to the legislation I am proposing, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation has proposed a program aimed at preventing an 
estimated 1.5 million foreclosures in the next year. I have talked to 
the FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair, and think her proposal is a good one. 
The legislation I am proposing and the program Chairwoman Bair has 
proposed would supplement legislation which is now pending in the 
Congress. Last October, Senator Durbin and I separately introduced 
bills that would permit mortgages to be modified by the bankruptcy 
courts. However, Senator Durbin's legislation would permit the court to 
modify the principal sum. I think that goes too far and would have the 
undesirable consequence of making it more difficult to obtain a 
mortgage in the future. My legislation authorizes the bankruptcy courts 
to modify interest rates on variable interest rate mortgages. In many 
cases, there was not full disclosure to borrowers who took out these 
loans. Then they found that their mortgage went from $1,200 a month, 
for illustrative purposes, to $2,000.
  It is my hope that Congress would stay in session beyond just this 
week. It seems to me the economic problems

[[Page S10583]]

we faced last July, before we adjourned for the month of August, 
required our remaining in session; I urged the leaders of the Senate to 
keep the body in session during August. And, I urged the President to 
call the Congress back into session. It seems to me the problem of 
delinquent mortgages and foreclosures is critical at the moment. I 
noticed Senator Dodd was quoted in the Washington Post last Friday as 
saying he plans to introduce legislation and that he thought the FDIC 
proposal was a good one.
  We are finding so many people are facing the threat of foreclosure. 
This is an issue which ought to be considered further. Congress ought 
to stay in session, ought to work these issues through, and ought to 
remain in session long enough to consider the details necessary to make 
a rational judgment on the proposal of economic aid to General Motors 
and the other companies.
  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my floor statement on 
the mortgage issue and the full text of the legislation be printed in 
the Record as if set forth in full on the Senate floor.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

    Floor Statement of Senator Arlen Specter on Introduction of the 
    Foreclosure Diversion and Mortgage Loan Modification Act of 2008

       Mr. President, I seek recognition today to introduce the 
     ``Foreclosure Diversion and Mortgage Loan Modification Act of 
     2008.'' The bill amends the recently passed Emergency 
     Economic Stabilization Act and the Housing and Economic 
     Recovery Act passed last July to ensure that more attention 
     and resources are given to the urgent need to prevent home 
     foreclosures and to stabilize the housing market.
       The bill creates an Office of Foreclosure Evaluation in the 
     Treasury Department. This Office will coordinate and foster 
     foreclosure prevention efforts of the Treasury Department, 
     the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Federal Reserve, the 
     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Department of 
     Housing and Urban Development, and other federal agencies. 
     The Office will also support and collaborate in foreclosure 
     prevention efforts with state and local government agencies, 
     state and local courts, and community based non-profit 
     organizations, such as the State Foreclosure Prevention 
     Working Group.
       The current economic turmoil began with a housing market 
     collapse that has had devastating consequences across the 
     entire financial system. Widespread mortgage modification 
     will address the root cause of the current crisis. Despite 
     talk and efforts since early 2007 to encourage voluntary loan 
     modification, the pace of affordable and sustainable 
     modifications has not been of sufficient scale to contain the 
     harm to our communities and our economy.
       This month, HUD made a preliminary projection that only 
     about 20,000 homeowners may be helped by the Hope for 
     Homeowners program created as part of the Housing and 
     Economic Recovery Act, instead of the anticipated 400,000. In 
     October, a Federal Reserve Governor expressed concerns about 
     the recent rise of shady companies that masquerade as non-
     profit foreclosure prevention organizations, and then charge 
     distressed borrowers thousands of dollars for their services. 
     Congress must act to ensure that homeowners are getting the 
     information and help they need to prevent avoidable 
     foreclosures.
       For the second quarter of 2008, foreclosure filings 
     nationwide were up 121 percent over the second quarter of 
     2007. Comparing third quarter filings, the 2008 increase over 
     2007 is 71 percent. Today there are more than 1.5 million 
     houses in foreclosure--three times the normal rate--and 
     approximately 3.5 million other homeowners are behind on 
     their mortgage payments. Too many families are losing their 
     homes even when it makes more sense for the lenders to let 
     them stay and make payments on a sustainable, modified 
     mortgage. And despite reports from industry groups that there 
     have been many modifications, consumer groups say many of 
     these modifications simply spread missed payments over the 
     remaining life of the loan, which has the perverse effect of 
     raising, not lowering, the monthly payment. A recent Credit 
     Suisse report found that of those mortgages where the monthly 
     payments increased, 44 percent were more than 60 days 
     delinquent after 8 months. By contrast, of those mortgages 
     that received an interest rate reduction, only 15 percent 
     were more than 60 days delinquent after 8 months. Similarly, 
     of those mortgages where the principal balance was reduced 
     only 23 percent were delinquent. .
       In some regions of the country the housing and job markets 
     are holding up fairly well, but in other areas the increase 
     in foreclosures is or will be devastating. But there is some 
     good news: in some of the areas that have been hardest hit, 
     there are newly instituted state-court based mortgage 
     foreclosure diversion programs that require conciliation 
     conferences between lenders and borrowers before a 
     foreclosure or sheriff sale may proceed. In some places, 
     there are hundreds of trained pro bono attorneys willing to 
     help homeowners. Homeowners need these programs because, even 
     though many states have housing financing programs, 
     homeowners may not know about them and they may not know that 
     lenders may offer modifications. A recent policy paper by the 
     Mortgage Bankers Association of America showed that borrowers 
     in 21% of foreclosures initiated in the third quarter of 2007 
     either could not be located or would not respond to repeated 
     attempts by lenders to contact them. According to a report by 
     Freddie Mac, 57 percent of late-paying borrowers do not know 
     that their lenders may offer alternatives to help avoid 
     foreclosure.
       The October 17, 2008 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing I 
     held in Pittsburgh explored Allegheny County's foreclosure 
     prevention program, which is at an early stage. The 
     Philadelphia hearing I held on October 24, 2008 explored a 
     program that was adopted in April 2008, and it appears to be 
     working. In the Philadelphia Mortgage Foreclosure Diversion 
     Program's first few months, there were 1,019 mortgage 
     foreclosure cases scheduled for conciliation conferences. In 
     467 cases (46%), borrowers did not participate. Of the 552 
     (54%) in which borrowers did participate, there was a 
     ``success'' rate of 80%--meaning the homeowners remained in 
     their homes as a result of settlement, postponement, or 
     bankruptcy. Only 2 properties (.4%) were ordered to be sold 
     at sheriff sale. The delays allow for more negotiation, or, 
     in some cases for ``graceful exits'' so families can find a 
     new place to live.
       The witnesses at the Philadelphia hearing testified about 
     successful outcomes for homeowners. One witness, Tania 
     Harrigan, testified that her family fell behind in mortgage 
     payments when her husband was laid off. They filed for 
     bankruptcy but could not afford to pay the fees; the 
     bankruptcy suit was dismissed and the house was listed for 
     sheriff sale for November 4, 2008. Through the Philadelphia 
     foreclosure prevention program, the interest rate was lowered 
     from 9.75% to 7%, which reduced the monthly payment from $437 
     to $411. The lender waived $6,500 in late fees and the 
     arrearage was put back into a new 30-year fixed rate 
     mortgage. Another homeowner who was contacted through the 
     program's door-to-door outreach initiative had an adjustable 
     rate mortgage modified from a 22% interest rate to a fixed 
     rate of 6%. Another homeowner saw a reduction in her monthly 
     payments from $1479 to $1124 after the interest rate went 
     from 9.9% to 5.5%. These were ``voluntary'' in the sense that 
     the court did not impose the terms of the modifications. But 
     the court does require communication, research and 
     preparation before the conference. The court makes 
     foreclosure a last resort instead of the first step by 
     ensuring that servicers or lenders are not simply ignoring 
     alternatives to foreclosure.
       A city employee testified that, as a result of coordinated 
     outreach, calls to the Save Your Home Philly Hotline, which 
     sets up appointments with housing counselors, tripled from 
     150 per month at the beginning of the year to 460 per month 
     currently. City-funded neighborhood assistance groups who 
     have access to court foreclosure files go door-to-door to 
     reach homeowners. The participation rate in the conciliation 
     program for homeowners who answered the door and spoke to the 
     outreach team was 73 percent, compared to 48 percent for 
     families that received no such outreach. The city also funds 
     Community Legal Services to provide legal assistance to 
     distressed homeowners and training to the hundreds of 
     volunteer attorneys who represent clients pro bono.
       New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Connecticut and Florida have 
     similar programs. As I've noted, Pittsburgh is also adopting 
     a foreclosure diversion program. Common Pleas Court Judge 
     Annette Rizzo in Philadelphia testified that she has had many 
     inquiries about the foreclosure diversion program from 
     numerous cities, states, and even from Sweden. These are good 
     developments, and they should be nurtured.
       That is what this legislation would do. It creates a 
     federal Office of Foreclosure Evaluation that will encourage 
     and assist cities and states in adopting mortgage foreclosure 
     diversion programs. The Office will also conduct an 
     informational campaign so that homeowners learn of state and 
     federal housing finance programs that are available to help 
     them, as well as other resources such as free counseling and 
     legal representation by community legal services groups and 
     local bar associations.
       The states and cities are making progress, but federal 
     assistance would help. The bill permits certain HUD Community 
     Block Grant funds to be used for foreclosure prevention 
     programs that provide free counseling and legal aid. 
     Currently those funds may only be used for rehabilitation of 
     vacant or foreclosed properties. There is also a provision 
     that will free up funds so they may be used to support 
     programs that provide legal advice and representation to 
     homeowners in foreclosure actions; the current restriction on 
     using funds for litigation is overly broad. Unlike some plans 
     discussed in the press, this bill does not call for direct 
     payments to borrowers. Rather, it makes federal funds 
     available to support state and local foreclosure 
     prevention programs that work.
       The bill also addresses another reason there are not more 
     affordable and sustainable loan modifications--even though 
     modifications usually leave lenders with more money than the 
     50 cents on the dollar that a foreclosure sale typically 
     brings them. Up until the last 10 or 15 years, a mortgage 
     loan

[[Page S10584]]

     involved two parties--the borrower and a bank that both 
     originated the loan and retained the default risk. If the 
     individual borrower had trouble, it was in the bank's 
     interest to adjust the terms of the loan. But that is no 
     longer the model. Through securitization, the risk of default 
     has been transferred to investors. There is no longer a 
     single entity that has an interest in reworking failing 
     loans. The loans are pooled together and the stream of 
     payments from those mortgages is divided up into securities 
     owned by investors all over the world. A mortgage servicer 
     manages the pools of loans and distributes the payments to 
     investors. It is the mortgage servicer who has the ability to 
     restructure a mortgage or foreclose on the property. However, 
     the servicers do not have the same incentives that banks used 
     to have. The way many pooling and servicing agreements (PSAs) 
     are written, there may be no incentives for the servicers to 
     restructure the loans. Servicers typically get paid a fee if 
     they foreclose, but may have to absorb the cost of 
     renegotiating the loans. One of the first steps the Office of 
     Foreclosure Evaluation should take is to encourage servicers 
     to use technology that would standardize the income to 
     expense and loan resolution process to keep costs down. The 
     Office also should determine what incentives may be needed to 
     encourage servicers to modify contracts. It may ultimately be 
     appropriate for the government to offer servicers a flat fee 
     for each sustainable, affordable modification completed 
     within a certain time period to help cover their additional 
     costs.
       Perhaps a more significant roadblock is that servicers are 
     worried they may be sued by some of the investors. Many 
     servicers still are thinking that it is best to simply pursue 
     foreclosures. Congress tried to address this concern in the 
     Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and again in the 
     Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, by clarifying that, 
     unless the contract or PSA clearly provides otherwise, the 
     duty owed by the servicer to investors is owed to the entire 
     pool and not to any individual groups or tranches of 
     investors, but the servicers still appear to be reluctant or 
     slow to modify.
       The concerns of the servicers or lenders may not be 
     unfounded. Recently, lawyers claiming to represent investors 
     are challenging the settlement between Countrywide and 11 
     attorneys general; the settlement proposes to modify the 
     loans of 400,000 borrowers. An October 24, 2008 article in 
     the New York Times reported that certain hedge funds are 
     opposing loan modifications because it might hurt their 
     investments. At least two funds recently have warned 
     servicers that they might be sued if they participated in 
     government-backed plans to renegotiate delinquent loans. 
     Congress must take action to protect homeowners who are 
     getting caught in the middle. So far disputes over loan 
     modifications have been theoretical because most mortgage 
     servicers are not aggressively altering the terms of loans, 
     but as a matter of public policy, we cannot let fear of tort 
     and contract claims cause grave harm to consumers and the 
     entire economy.
       The bill addresses the litigation threat by requiring 
     investors' attorneys to conduct a careful inquiry into the 
     factual and legal bases of their claims, including 
     consideration of the recent statutory clarification that the 
     servicer's duty is to the entire pool of investors or 
     beneficial owners. The attorneys also would have to obtain, 
     as a prerequisite to filing suit, a certification from the 
     new Office of Foreclosure Evaluation that the loan 
     modifications in question were unreasonable or not permitted 
     by restrictions on Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits 
     under the Internal Revenue Code. This opinion would be 
     admissible, but not conclusive. These administrative 
     prerequisites should result in more uniformity, guidance and 
     clarity regarding applicable legal standards and best 
     practices for servicers, taking into account the public 
     interest and current threat to our economy posed by barriers 
     to reasonable modification. This is not complete immunity 
     from suit. If the litigation threat continues to impede 
     modifications, Congress may have to hold hearings to consider 
     sufficient safeguards for servicers--taking into 
     consideration the importance of having capital available for 
     the mortgage market.
       In addition, although financial services industry groups 
     have criticized arbitrary quotas in PSAs that limit the 
     percentage of loans in a pool that may be modified, some PSAs 
     do contain such quotas. These quotas may have seemed 
     reasonable before the housing market crashed, but they do not 
     make sense now, are against public policy and, to the extent 
     these quotas are less than 25% of the total, they are 
     rendered unenforceable by this bill.
       Finally, to ensure we have reliable data regarding mortgage 
     loan modifications, the bill requires mortgage servicers to 
     report detailed data to the Office of Foreclosure Evaluation. 
     The bill also requires the Office to submit reports to 
     Congress. This data will help the Office and Congress 
     understand whether voluntary efforts are sufficient, and what 
     specific barriers there may be to case-by-case loan 
     modifications, including specific provisions in pooling and 
     service agreements that may be impeding reasonable steps to 
     avoid foreclosures.
       In the end, case-by-case loan modifications may not be 
     sufficient to appreciably slow the rate of foreclosures, in 
     which case the government may have to consider other options. 
     In that regard, I believe the proposal made recently by 
     Sheila Bair, the Chairman of the FDIC, deserves close 
     consideration. Ms. Bair's proposal is based on the FDIC's 
     real world experience with 5000 troubled mortgages at IndyMac 
     Bank, which the FDIC recently took over. Under the proposal, 
     delinquent homeowners would have their mortgage payments 
     reduced to as low as 31 percent of their monthly income. The 
     modifications would be based on interest rate reductions, 
     extension of the term of the mortgage, and principal 
     forbearance--in that order. The same protocol would be 
     applied to all delinquent mortgages, rather than having a 
     case-by-case assessment of each mortgage. The Bair proposal 
     may have the advantage of enabling rapid modification of 
     large numbers of mortgages, stemming the tide of 
     foreclosures. If a modified loan defaults later, the 
     government would share up to half of the losses. The proposal 
     would be funded under the $700 billion financial rescue 
     package. I spoke to Ms. Bair last week, and she estimates her 
     proposal could reach up to 2.2 million mortgages and enable 
     1.5 million homeowners to keep their homes. If effective, 
     across-the-board rather than case-by-case modifications may 
     be necessary.
       In the meantime, the Foreclosure Diversion and Mortgage 
     Loan Modification Act of 2008 will encourage servicers to 
     engage in greater numbers of case-by-case mortgage 
     modifications. This should be a goal those on both sides of 
     the aisle can agree to. I urge my colleagues to support it.

     the date of enactment of this Act, and every year thereafter 
     until the minimum wage in the respective territory is $7.25 
     per hour, the Government Accountability Office shall conduct

     Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of the Census (as the case

[[Page S10593]]

       (1) The Philippine islands became a United States 
     possession in 1898 when they were ceded from Spain following 
     the Spanish-American War.
       (2) During World War II, Filipinos served in a variety of 
     units, some of which came under the direct control of the 
     United States Armed Forces.
       (3) The regular Philippine Scouts, the new Philippine 
     Scouts, the Guerilla Services, and more than 100,000 members 
     of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were called into the 
     service of the United States Armed Forces of the Far East on 
     July 26, 1941, by an executive order of President Franklin D. 
     Roosevelt.
       (4) Even after hostilities had ceased, wartime service of 
     the new Philippine Scouts continued as a matter of law until 
     the end of 1946, and the force gradually disbanded and was 
     disestablished in 1950.
       (5) Filipino veterans who were granted benefits prior to 
     the enactment of the so-called Rescissions Acts of 1946 
     (Public Laws 79-301 and 79-391) currently receive full 
     benefits under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans 
     Affairs, but under section 107 of title 38, United States 
     Code, the service of certain other Filipino veterans is 
     deemed not to be active service for purposes of such laws.
       (6) These other Filipino veterans only receive certain 
     benefits under title 38, United States Code, and, depending 
     on where they legally reside, are paid such benefit amounts 
     at reduced rates.
       (7) The benefits such veterans receive include service-
     connected compensation benefits paid under chapter 11 of 
     title 38, United States Code, dependency indemnity 
     compensation survivor benefits paid under chapter 13 of title 
     38, United States Code, and burial benefits under chapters 23 
     and 24 of title 38, United States Code, and such benefits are 
     paid to beneficiaries at the rate of $0.50 per dollar 
     authorized, unless they lawfully reside in the United States.
       (8) Dependents' educational assistance under chapter 35 of 
     title 38, United States Code, is also payable for the 
     dependents of such veterans at the rate of $0.50 per dollar 
     authorized, regardless of the veterans' residency.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Economic Recovery Act of

      By Mr. DURBIN:
  S. 3690. A bill to help struggling families stay in their homes and 
to ensure that taxpayers are protected when the Secretary of the 
Treasury purchases equity shares in financial situations; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary.
  Mr. DURBIN. Just before the Congress paused for the elections, we 
passed one of the most historic--and contentious--pieces of legislation 
in my 26 years in Washington. We gave the Treasury Department the 
authority to spend $700 billion in taxpayer funds to prevent the 
complete meltdown of the financial system, which in turn would 
hopefully prevent the overall economy from descending into a deep and 
painful recession.
  I didn't like voting for that bill, but I joined the majority of my 
colleagues in doing so because not voting for it was even worse. I hope 
in the end that we were right.
  However, there are two areas that I do not believe were adequately 
addressed in that legislation: helping families save their homes from 
foreclosure and protecting taxpayers from the misuse of their dollars 
by the bankers that receive them. Today I am introducing legislation--
the Homeowner Assistance and Taxpayer Protection Act--to address both 
concerns.
  For far too long the Bush administration has relied on the voluntary 
efforts of the mortgage servicers to rework millions of troubled 
mortgages on a case by case basis. These voluntary efforts have been 
and still are insufficient. There aren't strong enough incentives for 
the servicers to pursue work-outs. Servicers aren't equipped to handle 
the huge volume of mortgages at risk. Far-flung investors who own 
pieces of many mortgages, and who often refuse to let servicers rework 
mortgages even in the cases where the servicers would like to help, 
present legal obstacles. And the mortgage industry has failed to take 
strong action against foreclosures, even if it is in their own best 
interests. The $700 billion rescue bill encouraged the administration 
to take stronger steps to help homeowners, but did not require the 
Government to do so.
  My bill would bring real hope to families who fear that they will 
lose their

[[Page S10600]]

homes, by doing three things. First, it would require Treasury, the 
Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and FHFA to restructure all loans that meet 
the criteria established in the Hope for Homeowners program to make the 
mortgages affordable. That means mortgages these regulators own or in 
which they have a controlling interest must be restructured if a 
reworked mortgage can be paid by the homeowner and is viable 
economically for the creditors. The Emergency Economic Stabilization 
Act as it is currently written only encourages the regulators to 
restructure those loans, rather than requiring them to do so.
  Second, it would require servicers to restructure all loans that 
qualify for the Hope for Homeowners program, rather than simply 
encouraging them to do so as the Housing and Economic Recovery Act is 
currently written.
  And, finally, it would allow bankruptcy judges to modify mortgages on 
primary residences. As I have argued for months now, this is the single 
most important thing we can do to spur nationwide systematic mortgage 
restructurings.
  The financial crisis will not ease, and the economy will not begin to 
recover, until we address the root cause of the crisis: the failed 
mortgage market. My bill would do just that.
  The rescue bill also failed to put in place enough taxpayer 
protections. Congress meant for banks to use the money provided by the 
Treasury to lend to qualified borrowers, rather than enriching their 
shareholders and executives. Recent reports indicating that AIG will 
lavish more than a half billion dollars on its employees at the same 
time that it receives an even larger $152 billion taxpayer bailout than 
originally announced speaks loudly to this problem.
  My bill would try to address this concern. The bill would bar banks 
participating in the Capital Purchase Program authorized by the 
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act from increasing common share 
dividends as long as the Government owns preferred shares. It also 
would require participating banks to reduce the next year's dividends 
in an amount equal to the compensation paid to the top five executives 
in excess of $500,000.
  The bill would not bar companies receiving assistance from the 
Treasury from paying their executives, nor would it bar them from 
paying dividends. But it would ensure that financial institutions think 
carefully before redirecting taxpayer-injected dollars away from 
lending for the good of the economy towards compensation for the good 
of its own executives and shareholders.
  The debate on how to help stabilize the financial sector will 
certainly continue into the 111th Congress, and I intend to continue to 
fight for homeowners and for the taxpayers so that we get our economy 
moving again as quickly as we can, and as prudently as we can.
  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be 
printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be 
printed in the Record, as follows:

                                S. 3690
