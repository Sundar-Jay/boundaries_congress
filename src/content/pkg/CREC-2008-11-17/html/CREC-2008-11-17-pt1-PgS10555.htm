                                 ______
                                 

                      TRIBUTE TO LARRY VANDERHOEF

<bullet> Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am pleased to recognize the 
career and contributions of University of California, Davis, Chancellor 
Larry Vanderhoef for his 25 years of service to the university.
  Chancellor Vanderhoef was born in a small Wisconsin town and was the 
first person in his family to graduate from high school. After high 
school, he attended the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, where he 
earned a B.S. and M.S. in biology and later earned a Ph.D. in plant 
biochemistry at Purdue University. Chancellor Vanderhoef began his 
career in education at the University of Illinois in 1970 as a faculty 
member and was appointed provost at the University of Maryland, College 
Park, in 1980. He spent the next 4 years at the University of Maryland 
before heading west to California and the University of California, 
Davis, in 1984.
  Chancellor Vanderhoef began his career at U.C. Davis serving as 
executive vice chancellor and later as provost/executive vice 
chancellor. In April 1994, Larry Vanderhoef was named the fifth 
chancellor of the University of California, Davis.
  Under Chancellor Vanderhoef's leadership, U.C. Davis experienced a 
period of dramatic growth, adding 4 million square feet of office, 
classroom, lab, and clinical space to support its 8,000 additional 
students and 44 percent more faculty. He revitalized the south end of 
campus with the additions of the Robert and Margrit Mondavi Performing 
Arts Center, the Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science, 
and the Graduate School of Management.
  During Chancellor Vanderhoef's tenure at Davis, the university was 
invited to join the Association of American Universities, recognizing 
Davis's standing as a top research university. The campus has also been 
recognized by U.S. News and World Report as the 11th best public 
university and Washington Monthly recognized it as the 8th best 
university for their contributions to society.
  Over his career, Chancellor Vanderhoef has been honored for his 
dedicated leadership at U.C. Davis and in the community. In 2003, the 
Arts and Business Council of Sacramento honored him with its Prelude to 
the Season Outstanding Contribution Award; in 2004, he was honored as 
Sacramentan of the Year by the Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of 
Commerce; and in 2006 he was given the Northern California 
International Leadership Award from the Northern California World Trade 
Center and California Business, Transportation and Housing Agency for 
his efforts to increase the campus's international engagement. He was 
also named one of the 20 people who have contributed most substantially 
to California's Capital Region over the past 20 years by The Sacramento 
Business Journal.
  As the University of California and Davis community gather to 
celebrate the retirement of Chancellor Larry Vanderhoef, I would like 
to congratulate him and thank him for his service to 
California.<bullet>
