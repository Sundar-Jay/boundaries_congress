                       TRIBUTE TO VALERIE WOODRUFF

<bullet> Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of 
Dr. Valerie Woodruff--like me a native of West Virginia--upon her 
retirement as secretary of the Delaware Department of Education. 
Valerie, known to her many admirers in the First State as Val, has 
dedicated the past 43 years of her career to education and served the 
last 10 as Delaware's secretary of education, a position I was 
privileged to nominated her to when I served as Delaware's Governor 
from 1993-2001.
  After receiving her bachelor's degree in secondary education from the 
Alderson Broaddus College in Philippi, WV, Val began her career in 
education as an English and social studies teacher at Bohemia Manor 
High School. She taught for 3 years before becoming a guidance 
counselor and beginning to work towards her master's degree.
  After receiving her master's degree in 1971 from the University of 
Delaware in guidance and counseling, Val moved to Delaware and became a 
guidance counselor at Delcastle Technical High School near Wilmington. 
Five years later, she became the school's assistant principal. During 
her time at Delcastle, she also served on the Governor's Advisory 
Council for Career and Vocational Education.
  Val worked on her doctorate degree in vocational education and 
curriculum development at Temple University while serving as assistant 
principal, then went on to become the principal at Middletown High 
School in 1984. She was an excellent principal, and her work did not go 
unnoticed. In June of 1990, she was selected as Principal of the Year 
by the Delaware Association of Secondary School Principals. During her 
watch at Middletown High School, the first school-based wellness center 
was established there. Today, in no small part because of her 
leadership, every public high school has a wellness center where 
students receive help and support to enable them to succeed in school 
and in life.
  Later, Dr. Woodruff served as the associate secretary for improvement 
and assistance in the areas of curriculum and instruction at the 
department of education for 7 years. In 1999, I nominated her be 
secretary of education, overseeing the implementation of our State's 
education improvement plan which focuses on rigorous academic 
standards; objectively measuring student progress toward those 
standards; and holding schools, school districts, students, educators 
and parents accountable for improving student achievement. Val has 
emerged as a national leader among our Nation's chief school officers 
and has worked closely with her peers and with the U.S. Department of 
Education to develop and modify the Leave No Student Behind law and to 
narrow the achievement in Delaware and across America.
  Val has a long list of accomplishments and is leaving big shoes to 
fill for the next secretary of education. She is a member of many 
prestigious boards including the board of directors of the Council of 
Chief State School Officers on which she was president from 2005-2006, 
the Southern Regional Education Board on which she was the first K-12 
educator to be elected vice-chair, and the Delaware Workforce 
Investment Board.
  Dr. Woodruff also currently serves on the Vision 2015 Steering and 
Implementation Committee and is on the President's Policy Council for 
the Alliance for Excellent Education. In addition, she is a valued 
member of the Delaware Mentoring Council and of the Delaware State 
Chamber of Commerce Partnership.
  Through her tireless efforts, Valerie Woodruff has made a positive 
difference in the lives of tens of thousands of students in Delaware 
and, in doing so, has enhanced the quality of life in our State for 
years to come. Upon her retirement, she will leave behind a legacy of 
commitment to education and to public service for generations to 
follow. I thank her for the friendship that we share, and I 
congratulate her on a truly remarkable and distinguished career. In 
closing, on behalf of the people of Delaware, I want to wish Val and 
her family the very best in all that lies ahead for each of 
them.<bullet>
