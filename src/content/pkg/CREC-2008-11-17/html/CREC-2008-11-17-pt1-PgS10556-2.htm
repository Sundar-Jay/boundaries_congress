                       REMEMBERING BRADLEY MOODY

<bullet> Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring the memory of a dedicated law enforcement officer, Officer 
Bradley Alan Moody of the City of Richmond Police Department. For the 
past 8 years, Officer Moody worked tirelessly to provide the citizens 
of Richmond with safety and service. On October 4, 2008, Officer Moody 
was tragically injured in the line of duty, and passed away 3 days 
later.
  Officer Moody, 29 years old, was deeply committed to the city of 
Richmond. Shortly before his accident, he had received a commendation 
for chasing down and arresting two suspects carrying concealed weapons 
in separate incidents in August 2008.
  A K-9 officer and a member of the Richmond Police Department SWAT 
team, Officer Moody was renowned for his extraordinary work ethic among 
fellow officers. He was also extremely personable; able to both fight 
crime and interact with youth in the community. Throughout his career, 
Officer Moody demonstrated a passion for law enforcement and commitment 
to helping others, qualities that enabled him to become a respected and 
model member of the Richmond Police Department. Officer Moody's 
colleagues will always remember him for his professionalism and 
devotion to serving the public.
  Officer Moody was a loving husband, proud father, and devoted friend. 
He is survived by his wife, Susan, a former Richmond police dispatcher, 
and two young children. Officer Moody served the city of Richmond with 
honor and dignity, and his contributions to his community and the many 
lives he touched will serve as a shining example of his legacy.
  We will always be grateful for Officer Moody's service and the valor 
that he displayed while serving and protecting the people of 
Richmond.<bullet>
