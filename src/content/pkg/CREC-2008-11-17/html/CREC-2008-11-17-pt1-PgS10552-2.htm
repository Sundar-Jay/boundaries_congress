                      IN RECOGNITION OF TIM LITVIN

  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, today I rise to make a few comments about 
a longtime staffer in my office, Tim Litvin.
  A native of Manchester and a graduate of Central High School, Tim 
came to work for me first as an intern from Colgate University and then 
joined the office full time in 2001. Through his 7 years of service, 
Tim rose through the ranks from manning the front desk to becoming a 
legislative aide on critical defense and military issues, as well as on 
other matters. From making sure our veterans and soldiers received the 
highest level care and attention, to his work with the Portsmouth Naval 
Shipyard, Tim gained respect from all those who crossed his path.
  In my office, Tim always came to work with a smile, a willingness to 
help, and a good sense of humor. At office functions in the conference 
room or on the softball field, Tim would always crack a few jokes among 
his coworkers, sometimes at his own expense to add a bit of levity. 
This low-key, low-ego approach helped keep things in the office light 
and upbeat. Where there was laughter in my office, Tim was usually 
there and we all appreciated it.

  But humor aside, Tim's passion for public service and military 
matters, especially defense appropriations, has been his strongest 
attribute. While working full time in my office, Tim attended evening 
classes at the Naval War College and obtained a master's degree. When 
Granite State servicemembers were recuperating at Walter Reed, Tim 
would often drive out there, visit them, and make sure that they 
received the best care possible. Time and again, he went above and 
beyond the call of duty.
  Although Tim's new job will not be taking him too far from the Hill, 
he will be missed. Whether it be his good cheer, his expertise, or his 
dedication to service, Tim will be hard to replace. Fortunately, it is 
good to know that the Federal Government will still benefit from his 
talents as he works for our men and women in the Armed Forces at the 
Pentagon. I am sure Tim will make us all proud there and I wish Tim 
best of luck on this new chapter in his life.
