                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O God of new beginnings, as our Nation greets the dawn of fresh 
opportunities and daunting challenges, inspire the Members of this body 
to trust Your sovereignty. May they remember the words of the 75th 
Psalm, declaring that You place leaders in positions of authority.
  As we pray for our outgoing and incoming Senators, help them to place 
their ultimate trust in You, the author and finisher of destinies.
  Today we also pray for our Government's executive branch. Sustain our 
President in the remaining days of his administration. Sustain also the 
President-elect, Barack Obama. Give him the integrity of Joseph, the 
faith of Moses, and the wisdom of Solomon. Prepare him to mobilize the 
branches of our Government toward shared objectives that honor Your 
name. Amen.
