                            OHIO'S VETERANS

  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, Ohio is home to more than 1 million 
veterans, dedicated men and women who have served in every branch of 
our Nation's Armed Forces and every major conflict in the modern era. 
They have served to keep our freedoms, so our Nation could remain 
secure. Ohioans have a longstanding tradition of service to our 
country. Ohio's veterans include Presidents and generals, from Grant to 
Sherman, and pioneers of American advancement, such as Neil Armstrong, 
John Glenn, and James Lovell.
  But for every well-known American veteran, there are, of course, many 
more heroes who have quietly served this Nation and my State of Ohio 
with honor and distinction.
  As our Nation looks forward to the return of our loved ones from the 
battlefield, all of us remember the tremendous contributions our 
veterans have made to Ohio and to our country. We are humbled by their 
patriotism and their bravery.
  On Veterans Day and every day, it is my honor to thank Ohio veterans 
and their families for their service to our great State and our great 
Nation.
  The Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame was created in 1992 to recognize the 
lifetime contributions of veterans, not just those who serve their 
country in the Armed Forces but also those who continue to give back 
since they left the service. I honor, congratulate, and salute all of 
them.

men and women whose stories I would like to briefly tell.

  As a Member of the Senate Veterans Committee, on which I serve with 
the Presiding Officer from Montana, my colleague, Senator Tester, it 
has been my privilege to hear from Ohio veterans across the State about 
what matters most to them. Those discussions with veterans at 
roundtables and hearings in Ohio reinforce my profound respect for our 
veterans.
  It is our duty as Members of Congress to do all we can to provide the 
services they have earned and deserved. I look forward to working with 
veterans and their families in the coming years to ensure that Ohio 
veterans' voices are heard in Washington.
  We made major progress last year. Senator Tester, Senator Webb, 
Senator Sanders--many of us on the Veterans Affairs Committee--Senator 
Murray and others, and, of course, Chairman Akaka, made major gains in 
health and education benefits for veterans with the new GI bill--the 
most important benefits granted, the largest amount of benefits granted 
since the original GI bill several decades ago. I am appreciative of 
the work of my colleagues on that issue.
