                      THANKING THE PEOPLE OF MAINE

  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, since this is the first time I have 
spoken on the Senate floor since the elections have been completed, let 
me say I am very honored the people of Maine have chosen me to 
represent them in the Senate for another 6 years. It is a great honor 
and privilege to represent the great State of Maine, and I want to 
begin my remarks this afternoon by acknowledging that.
