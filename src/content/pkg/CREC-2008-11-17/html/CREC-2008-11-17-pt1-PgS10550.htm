                              VETERANS DAY

  Mr. KYL. Madam Presdient, November 11 marked the 54th anniversary of 
Veterans Day. It is an occasion when we must remember the great debt 
that we owe veterans and members of the armed services who fight to 
maintain our freedom around the world. Throughout history, our soldiers 
have risked their lives to defend our freedom, and we must not forget 
their sacrifices.
  For my State of Arizona, Veterans Day is particularly special because 
it is home to over 560,000 veterans. Each one has worked to maintain 
our freedom. Whether as a medic administering aid to a fallen soldier, 
a soldier rooting out the enemy in a safe house, or a mechanic 
servicing the military equipment, every veteran played an integral role 
in our military and thus strengthened our Nation. Our veterans 
shouldered this great responsibility with courage, dedication and 
honor. We, as a Nation, cannot forget the countless sacrifices our 
veterans have made for this country.
  Brave men and women in our Armed Forces continue to fight the war 
against terrorists. It is important to remember that the troops 
currently working to defeat the terrorists all volunteered for our 
Nation's military. Young people today are presented with many 
opportunities when they begin their careers, and many serving in the 
military could have chosen a more lucrative career that would not put 
them in harm's way or take them away from their families. This act of 
selflessness not only underscores the patriotism of our Nation, but 
also highlights the dedication of our Nation's youth. We should be 
thankful that so many Americans are willing to serve their Nation, 
particularly at such a critical and dangerous time.
  In the coming year, Congress will be called upon to preserve care and 
services to our veterans, as well as to support our men and women who 
are engaged in the missions abroad. We cannot forget those who have 
given up so much to fight for our Nation, and we will work to ensure 
that our veterans and soldiers are recognized for their service.
  My family and I pay respect to all soldiers who have sacrificed to 
ensure America remains free, safe, and the symbol of democracy for the 
world. I

am immensely grateful to all who have served this great Nation.
