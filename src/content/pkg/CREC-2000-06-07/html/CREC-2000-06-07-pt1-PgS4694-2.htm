                JOHNSON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3191

  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. 
Reid, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Wellstone) proposed 
an amendment to the bill (S. 2549) to authorize appropriations for 
fiscal year 2001 for military activities of the Department of Defense, 
for military construction, and for defense activities of the Department 
of Energy, to prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for 
the Armed Forces, and for other purposes; as follows:

       On page 241, strike line 17 and all that follows through 
     page 243, line 19, and insert the following:

     SEC. 703. HEALTH CARE FOR MILITARY RETIREES.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) No statutory health care program existed for members of 
     the uniformed services who entered service prior to June 7, 
     1956, and retired after serving a minimum of 20 years or by 
     reason of a service-connected disability.
       (2) Recruiters for the uniformed services are agents of the 
     United States government and employed recruiting tactics that 
     allowed members who entered the uniformed services prior to 
     June 7, 1956, to believe they would be entitled to fully-paid 
     lifetime health care upon retirement.
       (3) Statutes enacted in 1956 entitled those who entered 
     service on or after June 7, 1956, and retired after serving a 
     minimum of 20 years or by reason of a service-connected 
     disability, to medical and dental care in any facility of the 
     uniformed services, subject to the availability of space and 
     facilities and the capabilities of the medical and dental 
     staff.
       (4) After 4 rounds of base closures between 1988 and 1995 
     and further drawdowns of remaining military medical treatment 
     facilities, access to ``space available'' health care in a 
     military medical treatment facility is virtually nonexistent 
     for many military retirees.
       (5) The military health care benefit of ``space available'' 
     services and Medicare is no longer a fair and equitable 
     benefit as compared to benefits for other retired Federal 
     employees.
       (6) The failure to provide adequate health care upon 
     retirement is preventing the retired members of the uniformed 
     services from recommending, without reservation, that young 
     men and women make a career of any military service.
       (7) The United States should establish health care that is 
     fully paid by the sponsoring agency under the Federal 
     Employees Health Benefits program for members who entered 
     active duty on or prior to June 7, 1956, and who subsequently 
     earned retirement.
       (8) The United States should reestablish adequate health 
     care for all retired members of the uniformed services that 
     is at least equivalent to that provided to other retired 
     Federal employees by extending to such retired members of the 
     uniformed services the option of coverage under the Federal 
     Employees Health Benefits program, the Civilian Health and 
     Medical Program of the uniformed services, or the TRICARE 
     Program.
       (b) Coverage of Military Retirees Under FEHBP.--
       (1) Earned coverage for certain retirees and dependents.--
     Chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, is amended--
       (A) in section 8905, by adding at the end the following new 
     subsection:
       ``(h) For purposes of this section, the term `employee' 
     includes a retired member of the uniformed services (as 
     defined in section 101(a)(5) of title 10) who began service 
     before June 7, 1956. A surviving widow or widower of such a 
     retired member may also enroll in an approved health benefits 
     plan described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title as an 
     individual.''; and
       (B) in section 8906(b)--
       (i) in paragraph (1), by striking ``paragraphs (2) and 
     (3)'' and inserting ``paragraphs (2) through (5)''; and
       (ii) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
       ``(5) In the case of an employee described in section 
     8905(h) or the surviving widow or

[[Page S4695]]

     widower of such an employee, the Government contribution for 
     health benefits shall be 100 percent, payable by the 
     department from which the employee retired.''.

     Section 1108 of title 10, United States Code, is amended to

       ``(3) A person eligible for coverage under this subsection

                           Amendment No. 3193

       At the end of title X, insert the following:

     SEC. 10____. CONGRESSIONAL MEDALS FOR NAVAJO CODE TALKERS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
       (1) on December 7, 1941, the Japanese Empire attacked Pearl 
     Harbor and war was declared by Congress on the following day;
       (2) the military code developed by the United States for 
     transmitting messages had been deciphered by the Japanese, 
     and a search was made by United States Intelligence to 
     develop new means to counter the enemy;
       (3) the United States Government called upon the Navajo 
     Nation to support the military effort by recruiting and 
     enlisting 29 Navajo men to serve as Marine Corps Radio 
     Operators;
       (4) the number of Navajo enlistees later increased to more 
     than 350;
       (5) at the time, the Navajos were often treated as second-
     class citizens, and they were a people who were discouraged 
     from using their own native language;
       (6) the Navajo Marine Corps Radio Operators, who became 
     known as the ``Navajo Code Talkers'', were used to develop a 
     code using their native language to communicate military 
     messages in the Pacific;
       (7) to the enemy's frustration, the code developed by these 
     Native Americans proved to be unbreakable, and was used 
     extensively throughout the Pacific theater;
       (8) the Navajo language, discouraged in the past, was 
     instrumental in developing the most significant and 
     successful military code of the time;
       (9) at Iwo Jima alone, the Navajo Code Talkers passed more 
     than 800 error-free messages in a 48-hour period;
       (10) use of the Navajo Code was so successful, that--

[[Page S4696]]

       (A) military commanders credited it in saving the lives of 
     countless American soldiers and in the success of the 
     engagements of the United States in the battles of 
     Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Saipan, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa;
       (B) some Code Talkers were guarded by fellow Marines, whose 
     role was to kill them in case of imminent capture by the 
     enemy; and
       (C) the Navajo Code was kept secret for 23 years after the 
     end of World War II;
       (11) following the conclusion of World War II, the 
     Department of Defense maintained the secrecy of the Navajo 
     Code until it was declassified in 1968; and
       (12) only then did a realization of the sacrifice and valor 
     of these brave Native Americans emerge from history.
       (b) Congressional Medals Authorized.--To express 
     recognition by the United States and its citizens in honoring 
     the Navajo Code Talkers, who distinguished themselves in 
     performing a unique, highly successful communications 
     operation that greatly assisted in saving countless lives and 
     hastening the end of World War II in the Pacific, the 
     President is authorized--
       (1) to award to each of the original 29 Navajo Code 
     Talkers, or a surviving family member, on behalf of the 
     Congress, a gold medal of appropriate design, honoring the 
     Navajo Code Talkers; and
       (2) to award to each person who qualified as a Navajo Code 
     Talker (MOS 642), or a surviving family member, on behalf of 
     the Congress, a silver medal of appropriate design, honoring 
     the Navajo Code Talkers.
       (c) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the awards 
     authorized by subsection (b), the Secretary of the Treasury 
     (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall 
     strike gold and silver medals with suitable emblems, devices, 
     and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.
       (d) Duplicate Medals.--The Secretary may strike and sell 
     duplicates in bronze of the medals struck pursuant to this 
     section, under such regulations as the Secretary may 
     prescribe, and at a price sufficient to cover the costs 
     thereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, 
     and overhead expenses, and the cost of the medals.
       (e) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this 
     section are national medals for purposes of chapter 51, of 
     title 31, United States Code.
       (f) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to 
     be charged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise 
     Fund, not more than $30,000, to pay for the costs of the 
     medals authorized by this section.
       (g) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of 
     duplicate medals under this section shall be deposited in the 
     United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.

                   TITLE V--BATTERED IMMIGRANT WOMEN

     SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.

       This title may be cited as the ``Battered Immigrant Women 
     Protection Act of 2000''.

     SEC. 502. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
       (1) the goal of the immigration protections for battered 
     immigrants included in the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 
     was to remove immigration laws as a barrier that kept 
     battered immigrant women and children locked in abusive 
     relationships;
       (2) providing battered immigrant women and children who 
     were experiencing domestic violence at home with protection 
     against deportation allows them to obtain protection orders 
     against their abusers and frees them to cooperate with law 
     enforcement and prosecutors in criminal cases brought against 
     their abusers and the abusers of their children without 
     fearing that the abuser will retaliate by withdrawing or 
     threatening withdrawal of access to an immigration benefit 
     under the abuser's control; and
       (3) there are several groups of battered immigrant women 
     and children who do not have access to the immigration 
     protections of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 which 
     means that their abusers are virtually immune from 
     prosecution because their victims can be deported as a result 
     of action by their abusers and the Immigration and 
     Naturalization Service cannot offer them protection no matter 
     how compelling their case under existing law.
       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--
       (1) to remove barriers to criminal prosecutions of persons 
     who commit acts of battery or extreme cruelty against 
     immigrant women and children; and
       (2) to offer protection against domestic violence occurring 
     in family and intimate relationships that are covered in 
     State and tribal protection orders, domestic violence, and 
     family law statutes.

     SEC. 509. PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN CRIME VICTIMS INCLUDING 
                   CRIMES AGAINST WOMEN.

       (a) Findings and Purpose.--
       (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (A) Immigrant women and children are often targeted to be 
     victims of crimes committed against them in the United 
     States, including rape, torture, trafficking, incest, battery 
     is or extreme cruelty, sexual assault, female genital 
     mutilation, forced prostitution, being held hostage or other 
     violent crimes.
       (B) All women and children who are victims of these crimes 
     and other human rights violations committed against them in 
     the United States must be able to report these crimes to law 
     enforcement and fully participate in the investigation, of 
     the crimes or other unlawful activity committed against them, 
     the prosecution of the perpetrators of such crimes or 
     activity, or both such investigation and prosecution.
       (2) Purpose.--
       (A) The purpose of this section is to create a new 
     nonimmigrant visa classification that will strengthen the 
     ability of law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, 
     and prosecute cases of trafficking of aliens, battering, 
     extreme crudity, and other crimes committed against aliens, 
     while offering protection to victims of such offenses in 
     keeping with the humanitarian interests of the United States.
       (B) Creating a new nonimmigrant visa classification will 
     facilitate the reporting of violations to law enforcement 
     officials by exploited, victimized, and abused aliens who arc 
     not in a lawful immigration status. It also gives law 
     enforcement officials a means to regularize the status of 
     cooperating individuals during investigations, prosecutions, 
     and civil law enforcement proceedings. By providing temporary 
     legal status to aliens who have been severely victimized by 
     criminal or other unlawful activity, it also reflects the 
     humanitarian interests of the United States.
       (C) Finally, this section gives the Attorney General 
     discretion to convert such nonimmigrants to permanent 
     resident status when it is justified on humanitarian grounds 
     or is otherwise in the public interest.
       (b) Establishment of Humanitarian/Material Witness 
     Nonimmigrant Classification.--Section 101(a)(15) of the 
     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)) is

     or other hardship if removed from the United States,

     of trafficking in persons as defined in section 3 of the 
     Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000;
       ``(ii) subject to section 214(m), an alien (and the spouse, 
     children, and parents of the alien if accompanying or 
     following to join the alien) who files an application for 
     status under this subparagraph, if the Attorney General 
     determines that--

     not unreasonably refused to supply such information to

     enforcement action, or to a Federal or State court;
       ``(III) the alien. would be helpful, were the alien. to 
     remain in the United States, to a Federal or State 
     investigation or prosecution of criminal or other unlawful 
     activity;
       ``(IV) the alien (or a child of the alien) has suffered 
     substantial physical or mental abuse as a result of the 
     criminal or other unlawful activity;
       ``(V) the alien has filed an affidavit from a Federal or 
     State law enforcement official or a Federal or State 
     administrative agency investigating or bringing and 
     enforcement action, or is a Federal or State court, that 
     provides information addressing the requirements under 
     subclauses (I) through (III); and

     to applications filed under clause (i) or (ii).''.

     subsection (a)(15)(T)--
       ``(1) the Attorney General and other government officials,

     to nongovernmental organizations that would educate the 
     aliens regarding their options while in the United States and 
     the resources available to them; and
       ``(2) the Attorney General shall, during the period those 
     aliens are in lawful temporary resident status under that 
     subsection, grant the aliens authorization to engage in 
     employment in the United States and provide the aliens with 
     an `employment authorized' endorsement or other appropriate 
     work permit.''.

     nonimmigrant described in section 101(a)(15)(T). The Attorney 
     General, in the Attorney General's discretion, may waive the 
     application of subsection (a) (other than paragraph (3)(E)) 
     in the case of a nonimmigrant described in section 
     101(a)(15)(T), if the Attorney General considers it to be in 
     the national interest to do so. Nothing in this section shall 
     be regarded as prohibiting the Attorney General from 
     instituting removal proceedings against an alien admitted as 
     a nonimmigrant under section 101(a)(15)(T) for material 
     nontrafficking related conduct committed after the alien's

Sec. 4301. Sense of the Senate regarding a preference for the use of 
              generic pharmaceuticals under the medicare program.

     SEC. 4002. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) Generic pharmaceuticals are approved by the Food and 
     Drug Administration on the basis of testing and other 
     information establishing that such pharmaceuticals are 
     therapeutically equivalent to brand-name pharmaceuticals, 
     ensuring consumers a safe, efficacious, and cost-effective 
     alternative to brand-name pharmaceuticals.
       (2) The pharmaceutical market has become increasingly 
     competitive during the last decade because of the increasing 
     availability and accessibility of generic pharmaceuticals.
       (3) The Congressional Budget Office estimates that--
       (A) the substitution of generic pharmaceuticals for brand-
     name pharmaceuticals will save purchasers of pharmaceuticals 
     between $8,000,000,000 and $10,000,000,000 each year; and

[[Page S4712]]

       (B) quality generic pharmaceuticals cost between 25 percent 
     and 60 percent less than brand-name pharmaceuticals, 
     resulting in an estimated average savings of $15 to $30 on 
     each prescription filled.
       (4) Generic pharmaceuticals are widely accepted by both 
     consumers and the medical profession, as the market share 
     held by generic pharmaceuticals compared to brand-name 
     pharmaceuticals has more than doubled during the last decade, 
     from approximately 19 percent to 43 percent, according to the 
     Congressional Budget Office.
       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
       (1) to reduce the cost of prescription drugs to the United 
     States Government and to beneficiaries under Federal health 
     care programs while maintaining the quality of health care by 
     encouraging the use of generic drugs rather than nongeneric 
     drugs under those programs whenever feasible; and
       (2) to increase the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals 
     by requiring the Food and Drug Administration, where 
     appropriate, to determine that a generic pharmaceutical is 
     the therapeutic equivalent of its brand-name counterpart, and 
     by affording national uniformity to that determination.

     requiring, to the extent feasible, a preference for the safe

  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Durbin) proposed an amendment to 
the bill, S. 2549, supra; as follows:

       On page 462, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:

     SEC. 1210. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE USE OF CHILDREN AS 
                   SOLDIERS.

       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
       (1) in the year 2000 approximately 300,000 individuals 
     under the age of 18 are participating in armed conflict in 
     more than 30 countries worldwide;
       (2) many of these children are forcibly conscripted through 
     kidnapping or coercion, while others join military units due 
     to economic necessity, to avenge the loss of a family member, 
     or for their own personal safety;
       (3) many military commanders frequently force child 
     soldiers to commit gruesome acts of ritual killings or 
     torture against their enemies, including against other 
     children;
       (4) many military commanders separate children from their 
     families in order to foster dependence on military units and 
     leaders, leaving children vulnerable to manipulation, deep 
     traumatization, and in need of psychological counseling and 
     rehabilitation;
       (5) child soldiers are exposed to hazardous conditions and 
     risk physical injuries, sexually transmitted diseases, 
     malnutrition, deformed backs and shoulders from carrying 
     overweight loads, and respiratory and skin infections;
       (6) many young female soldiers face the additional 
     psychological and physical horrors of rape and sexual abuse, 
     being enslaved for sexual purposes by militia commanders, and 
     forced to endure severe social stigma should they return 
     home;
       (7) children in northern Uganda continue to be kidnapped by 
     the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), which is supported and 
     funded by the Government of Sudan and which has committed and 
     continues to commit gross human rights violations in Uganda;
       (8) children in Sri Lanka have been forcibly recruited by 
     the opposition Tamil Tigers movement and forced to kill or be 
     killed in the armed conflict in that country;
       (9) an estimated 7,000 child soldiers have been involved in 
     the conflict in Sierra Leone, some as young as age 10, with 
     many being forced to commit extrajudicial executions, 
     torture, rape, and amputations for the rebel Revolutionary 
     United Front;
       (10) on January 21, 2000, in Geneva, a United Nations 
     Working Group, including representatives from more than 80 
     governments including the United States, reached consensus on 
     an optional protocol on the use of child soldiers;
       (11) this optional protocol will raise the international 
     minimum age for conscription and direct participation in 
     armed conflict to age eighteen, prohibit the recruitment and 
     use in armed conflict of persons under the age of eighteen by 
     non-governmental armed forces, encourage governments to raise 
     the minimum legal age for voluntary recruits above the 
     current standard of 15 and, commits governments to support 
     the demobilization and rehabilitation of child soldiers, and 
     when possible, to allocate resources to this purpose;
       (12) on October 29, 1998, United Nations Secretary General 
     Kofi Annan set minimum age requirements for United Nations 
     peacekeeping personnel that are made available by member 
     nations of the United Nations;
       (13) United Nations Under-Secretary General for Peace-
     keeping, Bernard Miyet, announced in the Fourth Committee of 
     the General Assembly that contributing governments of member 
     nations were asked not to send civilian police and military 
     observers under the age of 25, and that troops in national 
     contingents should preferably be at least 21 years of age but 
     in no case should they be younger than 18 years of age;
       (14) on August 25, 1999, the United Nations Security 
     Council unanimously passed Resolution 1261 (1999) condemning 
     the use of children in armed conflicts;
       (15) in addressing the Security Council, the Special 
     Representative of the Secretary General for Children and 
     Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, urged the adoption of a global 
     three-pronged approach to combat the use of children in armed 
     conflict, first to raise the age limit for recruitment and 
     participation in armed conflict from the present age of 15 to 
     the age of 18, second, to increase international pressure on 
     armed groups which currently abuse children, and third to 
     address the political, social, and economic factors which 
     create an environment where children are induced by appeal of 
     ideology or by socio-economic collapse to become child 
     soldiers;
       (16) the United States delegation to the United Nations 
     working group relating to child soldiers, which included 
     representatives from the Department of Defense, supported the 
     Geneva agreement on the optional protocol;
       (17) on May 25, 2000, the United Nations General Assembly 
     unanimously adopted the optional protocol on the use of child 
     soldiers;
       (18) the optional protocol was opened for signature on June 
     5, 2000; and
       (17) President Clinton has publicly announced his support 
     of the optional protocol and a speedy process of review and 
     signature.
       (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) Congress joins the 
     international community in--
       (A) condemning the use of children as soldiers by 
     governmental and nongovernmental armed forces worldwide; and
       (B) welcoming the optional protocol as a critical first 
     step in ending the use of children as soldiers.
       (2) It is the sense of Congress that--
       (A) It is essential that the President consult closely with 
     the Senate with the objective of building support for this 
     protocol, and the Senate move forward as expeditiously as 
     possible.
       (B) the President and Congress should work together to 
     enact a law that establishes a fund for the rehabilitation 
     and reintegration into society of child soldiers; and
        (C) the Departments of State and Defense should undertake 
     all possible efforts to persuade and encourage other 
     governments to ratify and endorse the new optional protocol 
     on the use of child soldiers.
                                 ______
