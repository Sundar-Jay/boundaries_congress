                         SUPPORT FOR H.R. 4094

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. LORETTA SANCHEZ

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 6, 2000

  Ms. SANCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to the 
deplorable conditions of so many of our nation's public schools.
  One need only listen to the stories of our teachers to know what 
those facilities are really like.
  For example: ``Often the children weren't able to have large group 
meetings because the room had peeling paint and ceiling tiles falling. 
When tropical storm Floyd hit, my daughter complained that they didn't 
have enough buckets to put under all the leaks.''
  Or: ``The school in which I teach was just closed down following an 
emergency evacuation due to a collapsed ceiling and subsequent 
flooding.''
  And: ``Our middle school was condemned 30 years ago and is still 
being used. It is in fairly good shape considering that, but we do have 
one downfall that no corporation would put up with. We have bats!''
  If my fellow Members of Congress visited schools in their districts 
during the Memorial Day recess, as I did, they witnessed facility 
conditions firsthand. Chances are many were run down and out of room.
  School bonds can help. School bonds are good for our communities, 
they're good for our schools and, most importantly, they're good for 
our children.
  That is why I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4094, 
the ``America's Better Classroom Act of 2000.'' This bipartisan 
legislation, authored by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Charlie 
Rangel, helps communities leverage funds for school bonds.
  The 106th Congress has the opportunity to pass meaningful school 
construction legislation. Endorsing this bill, as Members on both sides 
of the aisle have done, will enable the House to consider a valuable 
bill and begin to help our schools prepare to educate a new century of 
students.
