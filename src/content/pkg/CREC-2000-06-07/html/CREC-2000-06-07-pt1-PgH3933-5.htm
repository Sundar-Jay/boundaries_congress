               HATE CRIMES: A FORM OF DOMESTIC TERRORISM

  (Ms. BALDWIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, on this 2-year anniversary of the brutal 
dragging death of James Byrd, I rise to ask congressional leaders to 
let us vote on the Hate Crimes Prevention Act before we adjourn this 
year.
  Hate crimes are meant to instill fear and that fear is not only 
targeted at the immediate victim of the crime, the fear is experienced 
by all members of the group.
  Hate crimes are different from other violent crimes because they seek 
to terrorize an entire community. This sort of domestic terrorism 
demands a strong Federal response, because this country was founded on 
the premise that a person should be free to be who they are without 
fear of violence.
  I know that hate crime bills cannot cure the hate that still resides 
within some in our country. But this legislation can provide more 
protection for victims and send an important message that hate crimes 
against any group are a serious national problem. Let us pass the Hate 
Crimes Prevention Act this year.
