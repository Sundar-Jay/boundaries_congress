                   MEDICARE TO COVER CLINICAL TRIALS

  (Mr. BENTSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BENTSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise President Clinton 
for acting today to ensure that senior citizens have access to clinical 
trials identical to legislation, H.R. 61, which I have sponsored.
  The President's Executive Order announced this morning will ensure 
that Medicare will cover the routine costs associated with clinical 
trials. This action is long overdue and will ensure that 39 million 
Medicare beneficiaries get access to cutting-edge treatments which save 
lives.
  Clinical trials are research projects which test new therapies and 
treatments. It is especially significant that this initiative ensures 
access to all types of clinical trials, not just cancer, in the same 
manner as my legislation would.
  Under current law, Medicare does not provide coverage for routine 
patient costs associated with clinical trials. As a result, many senior 
citizens do not participate in these trials because they cannot afford 
to pay the out-of-pocket costs. Today, only 1 percent of senior 
citizens participate in clinical trials, yet seniors disproportionately 
face these diseases, such as cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and 
diabetes.
  This initiative is the right thing to do for our seniors. With more 
participation by seniors, researchers will discover treatments at a 
more rapid pace, because more participation will yield scientifically 
valid data to test the protocols being developed.
  I praise the President for this action.
