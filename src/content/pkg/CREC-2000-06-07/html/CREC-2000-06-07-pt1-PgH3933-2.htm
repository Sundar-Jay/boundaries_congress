                         DEATH TO THE DEATH TAX

  (Mr. HAYWORTH asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HAYWORTH. Mr. Speaker, I welcome people of all points of view to 
this Chamber and to this well, but facts are stubborn things.
  Perhaps if the Washington bureaucrats at the Department of Education 
were better educated in mathematics, they could tell us where $18 
billion appropriated by this Congress ended up. Here is a major hint: 
it did not end up in the classroom helping teachers teach and helping 
children learn.
  So when we have the litany of shame, remember the real shame is the 
people who ask for more and more and yet less and less responsibility 
in actually helping our children learn with the money we send to 
Washington.
  Mr. Speaker, another case in point: a lady now in her 80s, dependent 
on Social Security. Twenty years ago, her husband died and the IRS came 
to her and said she owed Uncle Sam $800,000. The family business was 
sold.
  Is that compassionate? Is that an irresponsible thing? I think it is 
irresponsible, not compassionate. Let us put the death tax to death and 
ask for more responsibility.
