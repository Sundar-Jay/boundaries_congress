                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd John Ogilvie, offered the following prayer:
  Gracious God, You are never reluctant to bless us with exactly what 
we need for each day's challenges and opportunities. Sometimes we are 
stingy receivers who find it difficult to open our tight-fisted grip on 
circumstances and receive the blessings that You have prepared. You 
know our needs before we ask You but wait to bless us until we ask for 
Your help. We come to You now honestly to confess our needs. Lord, we 
need Your inspiration for our thinking, Your love for our emotions, 
Your guidance for our wills, and Your strength for our bodies. We have 
learned that true peace and lasting serenity result from knowing that 
You have an abundant supply of resources to help us meet any situation, 
difficult person, or disturbing complexity. And so we may say with the 
psalmist, ``Blessed be the Lord, who daily loads us with benefits.--
Psalm 68:19. Amen.
