             ELIMINATION OF DEATH TAX IS RIGHT FOR AMERICA

  (Mr. HUTCHINSON asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. Speaker, Benjamin Franklin said that the only 
thing certain in life were death and taxes, but I do not even think Ben 
Franklin could have foreseen that death and taxes would eventually come 
hand in hand. Yet, for too many years, the death tax has been punishing 
Americans simply for dying.
  Because of the death tax, many Americans are denied the opportunity 
to pass on their life's work to their children or grandchildren. This 
unfair tax is especially hard on small business owners and farmers. 
Nine out of 10 American businesses are owned by families, and these 
families should have the right to keep their business. In Arkansas, 
because of the death tax, many farmers and small business owners must 
take out expensive life insurance policies to help their families cope 
with the tax burden. Instead of enjoying their retirement years, these 
Arkansans must worry about the government taxing their family into the 
ground.
  This week, the House will be voting on the Death Tax Elimination Act, 
a bill that is long overdue. Eliminating the death tax is the right 
thing to do for American families, American farmers, and American small 
business owners.
