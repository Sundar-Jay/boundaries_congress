                        Wednesday, June 7, 2000

  Mr. DEUTSCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Howard 
Braverman of Hollywood, Florida. On June 24, 2000, Howard will be sworn 
in as the 79th president of the American Optometric Association (AOA) 
during the AOA's annual Congress in Las Vegas, Nevada. Howard's 
extraordinary vision and enthusiasm has made him an exemplary 
contributor to the healthcare community, and I congratulate him on this 
well deserved honor.
   A graduate of both the University of Miami and the University of 
Houston College of Optometry, Dr. Braverman has exhibited an intense 
dedication to the profession of optometry at the local, state, and 
national levels, throughout his career. He is a past president of the 
Southern Council of Optometrists and the Florida and Broward County 
Optometric Associations. Additionally, he has served both as a member 
and as chair of the Florida State Board of Optometry. Howard's resume 
in the field of optometry is quite impressive: he has previously been 
named Broward County's and Florida's Optometrist of the Year in 1985, 
Florida's Optometrist of the Decade in 1991, and a member of the board 
of trustees of the AOA.
  In addition to his noteworthy professional achievements, the South 
Florida community has greatly benefited from Howard's leadership due to 
his active participation in civic affairs. Well known for his devotion 
to volunteer work within the community, Dr. Braverman is also a past 
president of the local Rotary Club.
  Mr. Speaker, through his unique vision and spirit, Dr. Howard 
Braverman has distinguished himself as an outstanding leader in the 
South Florida community. I wish to convey a heartfelt congratulations 
to Howard and his family on the occaision of his becoming the new 
president of the American Optometric Association, as well as many 
thanks for working to enrich the lives of those around him.
