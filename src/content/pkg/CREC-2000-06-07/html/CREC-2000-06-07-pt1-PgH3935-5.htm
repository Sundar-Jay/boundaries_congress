                        HATE CRIMES LEGISLATION

  (Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest this morning to people talking about the anniversary of the 
Byrd death, and I started to think, why is it that we sit here in 
Congress and profess how far America has come, how great the prosperity 
is, and how we have grown economically and socially? Is it not time, 
then, for America to grow morally? For those who fear to answer this 
question, I will answer it for them. The time is now.
  Over a year ago, the bipartisan Hate Crimes Prevention Act was 
introduced. This legislation will make it easier for Federal 
authorities to assist in the prosecution of racial, religious, and 
ethnic violence. It has been referred to a subcommittee. Why have we 
not done more? Instead of doing more to strengthen hate crime 
legislation, members of society with no sense of remorse are killing 
those who they believe to be inferior to them.
  Most people that are born do not have anything to do with their race, 
not a whole lot to do with their religion because their parents are the 
ones who help to determine that, and certainly not their sexual 
orientation.
  Let us move, Mr. Speaker. Let us pass this legislation.
