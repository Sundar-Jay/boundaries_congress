                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the 
Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on 
sensible gun legislation.
  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. 
Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of 
those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we 
will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.
  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following 
are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year 
ago today.
  June 7, 1999: Devron Baker, 17, Baltimore, MD; Allen Galathe, 19, New 
Orleans, LA; Jose Junco, 27, Houston, TX; Raynell Lawrence, 24, New 
Orleans, LA; Kenneth Martin, 41, New Orleans, LA; Earl Merriweather, 
23, Atlanta, GA; Solomon Morrison, 65, New Orleans, LA; Lawrence 
Piedra, 39, Philadelphia, PA; Allan P. Raidna, 30, Seattle, WA; Angel 
Retemar, 19, Bridgeport, CT; Timothy Stovall, 12, New Orleans, LA; 
Unidentified male, 49, Bellingham, WA.
