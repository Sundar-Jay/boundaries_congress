                          HON. JAMES T. WALSH

                              of new york

                        Wednesday, June 7, 2000

  Mr. WALSH. Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, November 20, 1999, the Westhill 
High Warriors defeated the St. Thomas Aquinas of Rochester 2-1 in 
sudden death overtime to win the

New York State Class B Girls Soccer Championship. This was a great win 
for the Warriors, who were outshot 23-7, but still managed to hold on 
for the victory. Although there were few scoring chances, Westhill's 
all-time leading scorer Courtney Spencer put the Warriors on the 
scoreboard first. Then, in the second overtime, Meagan Rogers, a senior 
midfielder, scored the game winner on a great header from teammate 
Leanne Guinn. On defense, Westhill sophomore goalie Ally Walker had a 
stellar showing to keep the Warriors in the game and was applauded for 
her talents as goalie of the game.
  The entire team gave an outstanding performance throughout the 
season, putting Westhill's soccer team among the best in the country. 
Not only did the girls win the championship but just two months earlier 
gave their coach Ann Riva her 300th career win. However, winning the 
championship was extra special to her. According to the local 
newspapers, Coach Riva said this state championship was the most 
memorable in her career. Many parents and fans felt from the very 
beginning that this team with its special chemistry was destined for 
great things.
  I am very proud of these young women, who have exhibited discipline, 
sportsmanship, and love of sports while representing their school in 
the very finest Westhill tradition. I am equally proud of the Westhill 
Athletic Department, the parents, and administrators who are so 
supportive of this outstanding group of fine young athletes.
