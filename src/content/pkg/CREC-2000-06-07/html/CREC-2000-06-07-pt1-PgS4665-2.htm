                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS

                                 ______
                                 

                      STAFF SERGEANT ANA V. ORTIZ

<bullet> Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a 
well-respected and remarkable public servant, Staff Sergeant Ana V. 
Ortiz, who has been chosen to receive the 2000 National Image Salute to 
Hispanics Award. Not only is Staff Sergeant Ortiz an upstanding and 
dedicated member of the Connecticut Air National Guard, but she is also 
the principal of the Betances Elementary School in Hartford and an 
active and vital member of her community.
  Staff Sergeant Ortiz has dedicated nine years of service to the 
Connecticut Air National Guard, displaying the qualities of a natural 
leader and setting an example for others to follow. She participated in 
three Air Force contingency operations that have sent her around the 
world. In 1996, she supported Operation Decisive Endeavor in Italy; 
1998 found her in Panama playing a role in Constant Vigil; and just 
last year she worked in Southwest Asia for Operation Guarded Skies. 
Staff Sergeant Ortiz previously attended the Air National Guard 
Diversity Conference, as well as the National Guard Bureau's National 
Diversity Program. A vocal advocate for diversity within the Air 
National Guard, she worked to build a solid foundation for minorities 
in the military, as well as a better understanding of the armed forces 
among both minorities and non-minorities. Her work in the Guard has 
earned her the Armed Forces Reserve Medal and two Air Force Achievement 
Medals.
  Although her military feats are impressive, Staff Sergeant Ortiz is 
further known for her strong commitment to the Hartford schools and 
community. As the principal of Betances Elementary School she keeps 
actively involved with her students and community. Staff Sergeant Ortiz 
is a member of the Language Arts Committee for the State of 
Connecticut, and a contributor to the Center for Youth After-School 
Programs, the Center City Churches, and the Charter Oak Cultural 
Center. She also encourages and maintains a partnership program with 
suburban schools in the surrounding area, and is constantly working to 
improve education and educational opportunities for her students.
  Ms. Ortiz' commitment to her students extends far beyond the school 
grounds. She was selected to serve on the Hartford Police Department 
Task Force for students at risk in the community, which strives to 
encourage children to find positive ways to overcome the dangers of 
drugs and violence that face our communities today. Furthermore, Ms. 
Ortiz is actively involved in protecting Connecticut's park attractions 
through her membership on the board of directors of the Bushnell Park 
Foundation, again promoting the well-being of her school children, as 
well as the entire community.
  Ms. Ortiz' professional achievements are matched by an impressive 
educational background. She earned a Bachelors of Science degree in 
Education with an English major from Central University in Puerto Rico, 
a Masters degree in Reading from the University of Hartford, and a six 
year degree in Supervision and Administration from the University of 
Connecticut. Her wide range of expertise has enabled her to better 
excel in all aspects of her life, and the surrounding community has 
clearly benefitted as a result.
  Staff Sergeant Ortiz strives to make the world a better place for 
all--through her military service, community work, and involvement with 
Connecticut schools. Her dedication and commitment appear to be 
boundless, and she is wholly deserving of the 2000 National Image 
Salute to Hispanics Award. Staff Sergeant Ortiz will travel to San 
Juan, Puerto Rico on Thursday, June 8, 2000 to receive her prestigious 
award.<bullet>
