                     THE RETIREMENT OF STEVE BENZA

  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, It is neither an understatement, nor a 
misstatement of fact, to say that the United States Senate is an 
impressive, awe inspiring, and unique institution for many different 
reasons. Certainly one of the biggest reasons that the Senate is such a 
special place is the talented, dedicated, and bright men and women who 
work in support of us and our duties. I rise to pay tribute to one of 
these individuals, Steve Benza, who is retiring today after thirty-two 
years of service as an employee of the United States Senate.
  Though he retains some of the mannerisms and accent that one would 
expect to find in someone who was born in the Bronx, New York City, 
Steve Benza is for all intents and purposes a native of the Senate. His 
family moved to the Washington area in 1958 and he began working in the 
Senate while a high school student, spending his summer breaks as a 
Page. Following graduation, Steve spent time working on the Grounds 
Crew and in the Senate Post Office before seizing the opportunity to 
work as a staff photographer, and his career was launched. As an aside, 
I would be remiss if I did not mention the fact that Senate service is 
a family tradition with the Benzas, Steve's mother Christine Benza has 
served with the Architect of the Capitol for the past forty-years.
  Beginning his career as a ``shooter'', even before the contemporary 
Photographic Studio was established back in 1980, Steve Benza has 
become a familiar and well liked member of the Senate family. During 
his career here, Steve has met hundreds of Senators, taken probably 
millions of pictures, and has become an instantly recognizable 
institution with trademark mustache and trusted camera slung over his 
shoulder. In his almost thirty-years of working as an official 
photographer, Steve Benza has seen and chronicled everything from the 
mundane and routine to the unusual and historic. Confirmation hearings 
for Supreme Court Justices, the Fiftieth Anniversary of the D-Day 
Invasion, the Inaugurations of four Presidents, dozens of State of the 
Union Addresses and Joint Sessions of Congress, and the Impeachment 
Trial of President Clinton are all among the events that have been 
covered by Steve Benza.
  In 1997, Steve was promoted from his position of supervisor of the 
Senate Photographers to Manager of the Senate Photo Studio where he has 
proven himself not only to be an able administrator, but someone of 
vision. Under his direction, the Senate Photographic Studio has 
invested in new equipment and technology, embracing the revolution in 
digital photography which has allowed for many innovations including 
quicker turn around time on orders, the creation of an image data base, 
and expanded services that ultimately benefit us and our constituents. 
Also under his direction, the Senate Photo Laboratory facilities were 
upgraded and training opportunities for staff were increased. All in 
all, the contributions and leadership of Steve Benza have turned the 
Photo Studio into a modern operation, equipped with the technology of 
the new century, and as a result, he has increased the efficiency of 
this vital Senate support service. He unquestionably leaves an 
impressive legacy of dedication to his job, and he has set an excellent 
example for others to emulate.
  It is hard to believe that after more than three-decades, Steve Benza 
has decided to retire. I know it is safe to say that he will missed by 
countless individuals including all one-hundred Senators, but I am 
certain that each of us will remember him. I had the pleasure of having 
Steve travel with me to the People's Republic of China when I led a 
delegation to that nation in 1997. Beyond putting together an 
impressive collection of images that chronicled our journey, Steve's 
relaxed disposition and ready sense of humor made what was a 
pleasurable journey all the more enjoyable.
  As many of us know, Steve Benza is a devoted family man. Though I 
understand that he has not made-up his mind as to what he will do in 
his retirement, I am certain that spending time with his wife Alma, and 
children George and Annie, will be a big part of his activities, as 
will pursuing his passions of fishing and golfing. Regardless of what 
Steve chooses to do in the future, I wish him many years of health, 
happiness, and success, and I want him to know that I am grateful and 
appreciative for his many years of loyal service to the United States 
Senate. It has been a pleasure to know him and I will certainly miss 
him.
