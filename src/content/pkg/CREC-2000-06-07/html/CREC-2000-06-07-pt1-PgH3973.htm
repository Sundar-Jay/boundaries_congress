  Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and 
extend their remarks on H.R. 4576, and that I may include tabular and 
extraneous material in the Record.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Wicker). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
