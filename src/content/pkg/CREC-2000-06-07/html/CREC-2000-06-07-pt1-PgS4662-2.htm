                       UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST

  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to 
Senators Lott and Daschle dated May 21, 2000, be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                                      U.S. Senate,


                             Select Committee on Intelligence,

                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2000.
     Hon. Trent Lott,
     Majority Leader,
     Hon. Tom Daschle,
     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,
     Washington, DC.
       Senator Lott and Daschle: S. 1902, the Japanese Imperial 
     Army Disclosure Act, contains provisions affecting 
     intelligence activities and programs. This legislation, which 
     amends the National Security Act of 1947, would permit the 
     release of any portion of any operational file of the Central 
     Intelligence Agency. As you know, these are issues of 
     significant interest to, and clearly within the jurisdiction 
     of, the Select Committee on Intelligence. Therefore, pursuant 
     to Senate Resolution 400, we hereby request that S. 1902 be 
     referred to the Intelligence Committee for consideration.
           Sincerely,
     Richard C. Shelby,
       Chairman.
     Richard H. Bryan,
       Vice Chairman.

                          ____________________
