                      KANSAS CITY SESQUICENTENNIAL

<bullet> Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to honor one of the great 
cities in Missouri: Kansas City. On June 3, 1850, the Town of Kansas 
was incorporated. Three years later, the town was reincorporated as the 
City of Kansas and renamed Kansas City in 1889. Today, Kansas Citians 
are celebrating the sesquicentennial of Kansas City, Missouri.
  Kansas City is situated at the point of entry at the confluence of 
the Missouri and Kansas Rivers. In the beginning, Kansas City was known 
as the last point of civilization before venturing into the untamed 
West. The settlement quickly prospered as an outfitting post for gold 
prospectors and homesteaders who were moving west.
  Because of its geographical location in the middle of the United 
States, Kansas City was destined to develop into one of our nation's 
most important trading markets and distribution hubs for goods and 
services.
  As Kansas City began to grow and prosper it became a major region for 
raising and sending cattle to market. Kansas City quickly emerged as 
the largest cattle market in the world. Since that time, each Fall, the 
American Royal Festival is held to pay tribute to this rich cultural 
heritage.
  Two words come to mind when people talk about Kansas City. Those two 
words are Jazz and Barbecue. Kansas City is world renowned for both. 
One also must not forget the grandeur of the Christmas lights that 
adorn Country Club Plaza, viewed annually by thousands.
  Kansas City is home to the Liberty Memorial which honors America's 
sons and daughters who defended liberty and our country through their 
service in World War I. This Memorial serves as a tribute to ensure 
that the sacrifices made by those brave men and women are not 
forgotten.
  Union Station was the gateway for many World War II service men and 
women passing through Kansas City on their way to service. Now newly 
refurbished it still stands tall and stately as a major tourist 
attraction.
  In the 1960s, Kansas City emerged as a powerhouse in professional 
sports. Lamar Hunt brought the Chiefs NFL football team to Kansas City, 
and Ewing Kauffman was awarded a major league baseball franchise. The 
Kansas City Chiefs and the Kansas City Royals have both captured world 
pennants.
  From its vibrant past to its glowing future, Kansas City is a 
community that remains on the cutting edge of technology, industry, 
medical research, manufacturing, and sports. At the dawn of a new 
century, Kansas City will continue to grow and prosper and rise to her 
highest and best.
  Mr. President, it is a distinct privilege to represent this great 
city in the United States Senate. I request that my colleagues join me 
in recognizing Kansas City for its 150 years of contributions to our 
great land and paying tribute to the KC150 celebration, Kansas City's 
sesquicentennial.
