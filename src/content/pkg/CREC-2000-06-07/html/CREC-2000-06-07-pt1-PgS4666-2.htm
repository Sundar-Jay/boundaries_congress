                   CONGRATULATIONS TO CHARLIE HOWELL

<bullet> Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to inform my 
colleagues that a young man from my state, Charlie Howell, won the 
individual National Collegiate Athletic Association golf championship 
this past weekend. Charlie hails from Augusta, home of the Masters Golf 
Tournament, and his achievement marks the beginning of another chapter 
in the great golf tradition of the Augusta area.
  Charlie, a junior at Oklahoma State University, finished the event 
with a final score of 265, a full 23 strokes under par. His score 
shattered the previous championship record of 17 under. Given the 
number of talented players who have won the title, including Tiger 
Woods, Charlie's accomplishment is nothing short of phenomenal.
  Along with his win in the individual tournament, Charlie helped the 
Oklahoma State team win the National Championship as well. This marks 
the first time since 1990 that the individual champion was also apart 
of a national championship team.
  While success on the professional golf circuit almost certainly 
awaits Charlie, he has decided that his future can wait. Charlie will 
return to OSU for his senior year, helping to lead his team in defense 
of their title, and more importantly, to complete his college 
education.
  Charlie's hard work and dedication to the sport have paid off 
handsomely. He now joins an elite group of golfers that can call 
themselves NCAA champions. I commend Charlie for his tremendous 
accomplishment, and wish him well in all of his future 
endeavors.<bullet>
