                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 7, 2000

  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today to honor Ray Wolfe 
of Edwardsville, IL. Ray is a veteran of World War II, whose army unit 
liberated the notorious Buchenwald death camp in Germany.
  Ray is speaking out about the Holocaust. He has been interviewed by 
many as a witness to the Holocaust and its horrific events. Ray was 
invited back to Germany five years ago for the 50th anniversary of the 
Buchenwald liberation.
  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ray for his service to 
his country. His willingness to bring light to the Holocaust and to 
teach us about its horrors makes us eternally grateful.

                          ____________________
