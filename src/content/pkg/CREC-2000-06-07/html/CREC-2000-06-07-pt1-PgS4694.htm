  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 120--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF CONGRESS 
    REGARDING THE NEED TO PASS LEGISLATION TO INCREASE PENALTIES ON 
                      PERPETRATORS OF HATE CRIMES

  Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted the 
following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on 
the Judiciary:

                            S. Con. Res. 120

       Whereas diversity and tolerance are essential principles of 
     an open and free society;
       Whereas all people deserve to be safe within their 
     communities, free to live, work, and worship without fear of 
     violence and bigotry;
       Whereas crimes motivated by hatred against persons because 
     of their race, color, religion, national origin, gender, 
     sexual orientation, or disability undermine the fundamental 
     values of our Nation;
       Whereas hate crimes tear at the fabric of American society, 
     leave scars on victims and their families, and weaken our 
     sense of community and purpose; and
       Whereas individuals who commit crimes based on hate and 
     bigotry must be held responsible for their actions and must 
     be stopped from spreading violence: : Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives 
     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that Congress--
       (1) needs to pass legislation that amends the Federal 
     criminal code to set penalties for persons who commit acts of 
     violence against other persons because of the actual or 
     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, 
     sexual orientation, or disability of any person;
       (2) condemns the culture of hate and the hate groups that 
     foster such violent acts;
       (3) commends the communities throughout our Nation that are 
     united in condemning such acts of hate in their 
     neighborhoods;
       (4) commends the efforts of Federal, State, and local law 
     enforcement officials; and
       (5) reaffirms its commitment to a society that fully 
     respects and protects all people, regardless of race, color, 
     religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or 
     disability.

  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a concurrent resolution 
urging Congress to enact meaningful hate crimes legislation. Today 
marks the sad second anniversary of the killing of James Byrd, Jr., the 
victim of a vicious hate crime in Texas. Mr. Byrd, a 49-year-old 
African-American man, was dragged for approximately two miles while 
chained to the back of a pickup truck by his white assailants. As a 
result of this brutal attack, Mr. Byrd's head and right arm were 
severed from his body.
  Reflecting on this terrible act of deep hatred against the dignity of 
a human being should strengthen our resolve to combat acts of bias in 
our society. We will not get to where we need to go in this country 
until we have eradicated the discriminatory hatred that lies in some 
people's hearts. While we cannot legislate away the prejudice in a 
person's heart or soul, we can certainly punish those who act upon 
their feelings of hatred and commit acts of utter brutality. Hate 
crimes tear at the very fabric of American society and often scar, not 
just the victims, but the families and communities involved as well. 
Those who harbor hatred must know that America will punish them for 
their actions and that we will not tolerate their acts of inhumanity.
  Our Nation is composed of a great diversity that contributes to our 
economic and educational preeminence in the world. We will never 
achieve all that our Nation is capable of accomplishing unless we are 
united in addressing the scourge of prejudice and hate crimes in our 
society. The Congress can lead on this issue by enacting comprehensive 
legislation, such as the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, that expands 
existing hate crimes law. Not only should those who are victimized by 
hate crimes because of their gender, sexual orientation, or disability 
be afforded access to appropriate justice, but we as a Nation should 
also pursue swift and serious punishment against violent hate-mongers 
to send a message that we will not tolerate their hate.
  Today, I join with colleagues from both the Senate and the House to 
introduce this concurrent resolution and spur action to combat the 
crimes motivated by bias which continue to shock the conscience of our 
civil society. Federal hate crimes legislation provides another avenue 
for prosecuting the perpetrators of violent hate, and I look forward to 
enacting a comprehensive Federal hate crimes statute. I am confident 
that our abhorrence of hate crimes will move the Congress to action.
