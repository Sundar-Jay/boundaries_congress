                     ANNUAL CHISHOLM TRAIL ROUND-UP

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 6, 2000

  Ms. GRANGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an honored 
tradition in the Great State of Texas and in Texas' Twelfth District--
the Annual Chisholm Trail Round-Up. This is the twenty-fourth year for 
the Round-up which will take place on Friday, June 16, 2000. This 
classic festival gives folks the opportunity to ``Saddle Up,'' ``Ride 
on the Old Chisholm Trail,'' and celebrate the western heritage of the 
City of Fort Worth. Folks bring their own horses, authentic western 
wear, and zeal for the Old West festivities. This year's theme, 
``Salute to the Fort,'' will recognize the U.S. Military and its 
veterans and will feature the biggest red, white, and blue parade in 
history.
  This year promises to be the biggest and best Round-Up ever. From the 
Big Ball in Cowtown Gala to the traditional Chisholm Trail ride, Fort 
Worth will be alive with western culture. In addition to great food, 
there will be great entertainment with Nashville recording artists and 
the finest Texas music entertainers. The event will also include Old 
Western Heritage re-enactment groups that celebrate how life used to be 
in Fort Worth.
  The Chisholm Trail Round-Up is the biggest event of the summer in 
Fort Worth. Everyone joins in to continue the tradition and celebrate 
our western heritage and culture. The Annual Chisholm Trail Round-Up is 
a wonderful way to unite the community in the rich heritage which ties 
us all together. I salute this historic event and all the people who 
give their time and energy to make this event successful.
