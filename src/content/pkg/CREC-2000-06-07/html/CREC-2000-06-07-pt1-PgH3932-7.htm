                        REPEAL OF THE DEATH TAX

  (Ms. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1

minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. DUNN. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will vote on H.R. 8, the 
Death Tax Elimination Act, a bipartisan bill supported by 244 Members 
of the House, including 46 Democrats and one Independent.
  Mr. Speaker, repeal of the death tax is supported by a huge coalition 
of folks all over this country. The Black Chamber of Commerce, the 
Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the National Indian Business Association, 
many environmental groups and the National Association of Women 
Business Owners.
  Twenty-five years ago, women were given access to business loans. 
Now, many are struggling to pass their life's work on to their 
children. According to their most recent study, women business owners 
spend an average of $1,000 a month on estate planning just to prepare 
for the death tax and keep the family business in the family. With 44 
million Americans without health insurance, a majority of them working 
for small businesses, that $1,000 a month could go a long way toward 
providing benefits for employees.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important measure. 
Support repealing the unfair death tax.
