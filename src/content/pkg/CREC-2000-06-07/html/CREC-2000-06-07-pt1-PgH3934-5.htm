             SUPPORT BIPARTISAN HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT

  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to say 
that an institution such as the United States Congress is judged as 
much for what it supports as what it opposes. It is time now for us to 
support the bipartisan Hate Crimes Prevention Act and to oppose the 
hateful acts that caused the dismemberment of James Byrd, Jr., caused 
the tragic killing in Illinois of Jews and Asians and African 
Americans, and the terrible attack on the Jewish day care center in Los 
Angeles. It is time for this institution to be able to say that we 
abhor hate crimes.
  I join Senator Robb in the offering of Senate Resolution 92 that will 
ask or state the sense of this House or the sense of the Senate is to 
oppose hateful acts, and I will offer such a resolution in this House.
  Let me also end by simply saying I applaud as well on another topic 
Tipper Gore's message and effort to provide more mental health 
resources for Americans and America's children. I held a hearing in my 
district that indicates that children need to be listened to and heard 
and that children have depression and mental health needs as well.
  Let us pass a bipartisan Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
