        BRING HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT TO THE FLOOR FOR DEBATE

  (Mr. FOLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FOLEY. Mr. Speaker, I, too, join today in urging Congress to, not 
only debate the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, but pass it. We should no 
longer in America tolerate racial hatred, bigotry, crimes against 
persons because of their sexual orientation.
  We are America. We are a proud country. But, regrettably, deaths like 
James Byrd, which occurred 2 years ago today, still occur in America, 
the death of Matthew Shepard, the death of so many others based on 
their color, their race, their ethnicity, or their orientation. 
Shamefully, America witnesses once again every day another dimension of 
killing in this country.
  But only if Congress speaks loudly against violence and specifically 
against violence perpetrated because of hate will we only cleanse our 
souls and urge our Nation to move forward in a better, more positive 
spirit.

[[Page H3935]]

  So I urge my leaders to consider bringing the Hate Crimes Prevention 
Act to the floor so that we can debate this in the well, in this 
Chamber, and pass it on behalf of all Americans.
