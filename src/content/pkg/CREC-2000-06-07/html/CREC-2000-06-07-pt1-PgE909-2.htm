                 HONORING THE CAREER OF GINGER BREMBERG

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JAMES E. ROGAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 7, 2000

  Mr. ROGAN. Mr. Speaker, last month, the City of Glendale witnessed 
the end of an era in local politics: longtime public servant Ginger 
Bremberg retired from office. Ginger is a seasoned politician, more 
focused on doing what was right than doing what is easy.
  After nearly a decade and a half, she has left her mark on Glendale. 
Today, my hometown is one of the most prosperous and fiscally healthy 
cities in the region. In recognition of Ginger's service and dedication 
to our community, I ask my colleagues here with me today to join me in 
saluting Ginger Bremberg.
  Ginger did not come to elected office early in life, or out of 
aspirations of higher office. After graduating from Beloit College in 
Wisconsin, she moved across the country with her husband Bruce and 
their young family. She focused on raising her two sons Chuck and 
Blair. In her spare time, she volunteered with community or education 
organizations.
  More than two decades ago, Ginger moved to Glendale, California, 
bringing with her this solid background of service. In 1981, she was 
elected to the Glendale City Council, as the largest single vote-
getter. She served on the council until this year, including three 
terms as mayor.
  On the Glendale City Council, Ginger built a reputation as a 
straight-talking official, willing to stand for principle before 
politics. She immersed herself in policy details, studying for hours 
how potential decisions would affect not just her city, but each of its 
residents.
  At City Hall, Ginger focused on revitalizing Glendale's economic 
base, bringing in new businesses, corporate headquarters and thousands 
of new jobs. Working overtime every week, she put her constituents 
first--she kept her telephone number and home address listed, and 
frequently talked from home with area residents who were pleased when 
their mayor answered her home phone.
  Ginger also worked as a member of President Reagan's National Council 
on Historic Preservation. She worked tirelessly to preserve open space 
and historic resources in Glendale, while working to make the city 
friendly to homeowners and businesses alike. Ginger has built a 
reputation for fairness, honesty and service with integrity.
  In recognition of her two decades of service to our community, and in 
gratitude for her commitment to making the City of Glendale the best it 
can be, I ask my colleagues here today to join me in saluting the 
career of Ginger Bremberg.
