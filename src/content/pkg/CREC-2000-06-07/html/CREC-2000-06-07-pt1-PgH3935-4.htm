                       SUPPORT ESTATE TAX RELIEF

  (Mr. KINGSTON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, in 1978, Susan Tagera left her corporate 
job at IBM and decided to pursue her American dream of owning her own 
business, a bicycle shop. She worked real hard over the 21 years to 
build up this shop and get a good clientele. Unfortunately, now she has 
breast cancer. She has to do something about the shop. She is passing 
it on to her son.
  Only one problem. It has got an estate tax problem. See Uncle Sam has 
got it so that enterprising businesswoman like Susan cannot 
successfully pass their business on to the next generation.
  That is why we need estate tax relief so that small business owners 
like Susan and millions all over America and family farmers can pass on 
what they have worked hard and struggled for and dreamed about, just 
pass it on to the next generation.
  At the same time, they will be economically independent so that they 
will not have to depend on tax dollars for their livelihood and long-
term care in the future. They have become independent. Why does our Tax 
Code penalize them?
  This week, Congress has a chance to help Susan out by voting for 
estate tax relief. I hope that all Members on both sides support this 
legislation.
