    MARKING THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE MURDER OF JAMES BYRD, JR.

  (Mr. DELAHUNT asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. DELAHUNT. Mr. Speaker, I join with my colleagues in marking the 
solemn anniversary of the senseless murder of James Byrd. Random acts 
of violence have become a tragic part of modern American life, but 
James Byrd was not selected at random. No, he was singled out for death 
solely because of his race.
  Just as the youngsters at the Jewish day school in Los Angeles County 
were singled out because of their religion. Just as Matthew Shepard and 
Private First Class Barry Winchell were singled out because of their 
sexual orientation. They were not random victims. They were targeted 
not because of what they did or where they were, but because of who 
they were.
  Each of these vicious acts was intended to send a message, a message 
of hatred and intimidation. Well, it is time for us to send a message 
in response. It is time to pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
