  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today to commend John 
Fridley of New Baden, IL. John has devoted his time and energy to being 
a servant and volunteer in his community. Besides the demand of a full-
time job and continuing education, John has spent hours volunteering 
for youth sports, educational, church, and charity work.
  He is now a member of the Wesclin Community Unit School board, as 
well as the board of the Kaskaskia Special School District and the 
advisory board at Belleville Area College for Office Administration and 
Technology. John is also very involved in his local church, St. 
George's Catholic Church.
  John understands what it means to serve others, and because of this I 
want to recognize his efforts to make his community a better place to 
live. I thank him for his dedication and commitment.
