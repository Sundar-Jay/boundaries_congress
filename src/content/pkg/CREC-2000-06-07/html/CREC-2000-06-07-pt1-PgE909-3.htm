                  SALUTE TO THE MAKE-A-WISH FOUNDATION

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 7, 2000

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to salute the 20th anniversary 
of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, which has brought happiness and joy to 
thousands of children around the world. On April 29, a seven-year-old 
boy in Arizona had one wish: he wanted to become a police officer. 
Friends and neighbors granted his wish. The boy became an honorary 
state trooper and received his own uniform. From this boy's experience 
arose the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
  Twenty years later, the organization has fulfilled the wishes of more 
than 500 District of Columbia children and more than 80,000 worldwide. 
In the last year alone, the Foundation has granted the wishes of 70 
District children who are fighting life-threatening illnesses.
  This year, the Make-A-Wish Foundation will grant the wishes of 
approximately 8,000 children. Some of the popular wishes, of course, 
include a trip Walt Disney World, computers, shopping sprees and visits 
with celebrities. But each year, about 25 children ask for trips to our 
nation's capital, where they witness what District residents have 
always known--that Washington, D.C., is a beautiful city with kind and 
generous citizens.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in this 20th anniversary 
salute to the Make-A-Wish Foundation for a job well done.
