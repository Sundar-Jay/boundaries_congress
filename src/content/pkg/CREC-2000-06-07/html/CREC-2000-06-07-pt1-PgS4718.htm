  HONORING THOSE LOST ABOARD THE U.S.S. ``THRESHER'' ON APRIL 10, 1963

  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 318, 
submitted earlier by Senator Snowe, for herself and others.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.
  The legislative clerk read as follows:

       A resolution (S. Res. 318) honoring the 129 sailors and 
     civilians lost aboard the USS THRESHER on April 10, 1963, and 
     for other purposes.

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the 
resolution.
  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion 
to reconsider be laid upon the table, and finally, any statements 
relating to the resolution be printed in the Record.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The resolution (S. Res. 318) was agreed to.
  The preamble was agreed to.
  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:

                              S. Res. 318

       Whereas this is the 100th year of service to the people of 
     the United States by the United States Navy submarine force, 
     the ``Silent Service'';
       Whereas this is the 200th year of service to the Nation of 
     the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard;
       Whereas Portsmouth Naval Shipyard launched the first Navy 
     built submarine, the L-8, on April 23, 1917;
       Whereas 52 years and 133 submarines later, on November 11, 
     1969, Portsmouth Naval Shipyard launched the last submarine 
     built by the Navy, the U.S.S. Sand Lance;
       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher was launched at Portsmouth 
     Naval Shipyard on July 9, 1960;
       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher departed Portsmouth Naval 
     Shipyard on April 9, 1963, with a crew of 129 composed of 16 
     officers, 96 sailors, and 17 civilians;
       Whereas the mix of that crew reflects the unity of the 
     naval submarine service, military and civilian, in the 
     protection of the Nation;
       Whereas at approximately 7:45 a.m. on April 10, 1963, at a 
     location near 41.46 degrees North latitude and 65.03 degrees 
     West longitude, the U.S.S. Thresher began her final mission;
       Whereas the U.S.S. Thresher was declared lost with all 
     hands on April 10, 1963;
       Whereas from the loss of that submarine, there arose the 
     SUBSAFE program which has kept America's submariners safe at 
     sea ever since as the strongest, safest submarine force in 
     history;
       Whereas from the loss of the U.S.S. Thresher, there arose 
     in our Nation's universities the ocean engineering curricula 
     that enables America's preeminence in submarine warfare; and
       Whereas the ``last full measure of devotion'' shown by the 
     crew of the U.S.S. Thresher characterizes the sacrifice of 
     all submariners, past and present, military and civilian, in 
     the service of this Nation: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) remembers with profound sorrow the loss of the U.S.S. 
     Thresher and her gallant crew of sailors and civilians on 
     April 10, 1963;
       (2) expresses its deepest gratitude to all submariners on 
     ``eternal patrol'', forever bound together by their dedicated 
     and honorable service to the United States of America;
       (3) recognizes with appreciation and respect the commitment 
     and sacrifices made by the Naval Submarine Service for the 
     past 100 years in providing for the common defense of the 
     United States; and
       (4) offers its admiration and gratitude for the workers of 
     the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard whose 200 years of dedicated 
     service to the United States Navy has contributed directly to 
     the greatness and freedom of the United States.

     SEC. 2. TRANSMISSION OF RESOLUTION.

       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit this resolution 
     to the Chief of Naval Operations and to the Commanding 
     Officer of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard who shall accept 
     this resolution on behalf of the families and shipmates of 
     the crew of the U.S.S. Thresher.
