               INSTRUCTIONAL FACILITY AT FORT LEAVENWORTH

  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am concerned that the current primary 
instructional facility, Bell Hall, at the Command & General Staff 
College, U.S. Army Combined Arms Center, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, is 
becoming incapable of performing its mission of preparing officers for 
positions of increased complexity and responsibility within the United 
States Army and other services. Bell Hall is the central academic and 
instructional facility of the C&GSC but the building's deteriorating 
physical plant and patchwork communication infrastructure can no longer 
support the instructional requirements contained in current and 
evolving Army curriculum. I am concerned that if a replacement facility 
is not constructed as soon as possible maintenance costs will continue 
to increase while Army Operation and Maintenance resources decline and 
student access to state-of-the-art technology required to teach 
advanced warfighting skills will remain limited.
  Mr. WARNER. I believe construction of a new Command & General Staff 
College instruction facility will be included in the FY 2003 through 
2007 Military Construction Future Years Defense Plan and I would 
certainly encourage the Army to execute this project as soon as 
possible.
  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee for his consideration and ask that the conferees 
include language in the conference report noting the need to execute 
this essential project as soon as possible.
