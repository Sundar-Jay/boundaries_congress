                      PRESERVATION OF STILTSVILLE

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. Hansen), the chairman of the Subcommittee on National 
Parks and Public Lands for holding a hearing calling for the 
preservation of Stiltsville.
  Stiltsville is a group of seven homes located south of Key Biscayne, 
Florida, located in my congressional district that has been part of the 
landscape and seascape of our young community since the 1930s.
  Mother Nature has destroyed many of these homes, but now the Federal 
bureaucracy seeks to do what previous hurricanes have not succeeded in 
doing, which is to tear down these beautiful homes.
  The homeowners have gathered a powerful coalition to help them with 
the causes of saving Stiltsville, and they obtained over 60,000 
signatures and resolutions of support from the Dade Heritage Trust, 
almost all of the municipalities in the Miami-Dade County, the Dade 
County Commission, the Florida House of Representatives, and the South 
Florida Congressional Delegation.
  Governor Jeb Bush also supports the preservation of Stiltsville, and 
I thank the gentleman from Utah (Chairman Hansen) for his help to our 
cause.
  We will continue to negotiate with the Department of Interior on 
finding a solution that meets the goals of the National Park Service 
while saving this remarkable landmark that we call Stiltsville.
