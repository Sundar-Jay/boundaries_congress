              AMERICANS NEED AFFORDABLE, QUALITY DAY CARE

  (Mrs. MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.)
  Mrs. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, in 7 out of 10 families, both 
parents work. The supply of day care is not adequate to the need. In 
New York City alone, over 37,000 families are on the waiting list for 
subsidized day care.
  Yesterday, I joined Vice President Gore, Mrs. Gore, and Rosie 
O'Donnell at a day care center in my district where Vice President Gore 
outlined his plans to expand access and quality of day care. Vice 
President Gore would help parents afford child care by expanding the 
child care tax credit for families with two working parents and where 
one parent stays at home. He would increase the child care development 
block grant so that more families could afford child care. His Ready to 
Learn plan would provide funding for States that develop better 
training and raise standards.
  Mr. Speaker, difficult challenges require creative solutions. The 
Vice President's plan, his 4-year plan, would expand affordable, 
available, quality day care.
