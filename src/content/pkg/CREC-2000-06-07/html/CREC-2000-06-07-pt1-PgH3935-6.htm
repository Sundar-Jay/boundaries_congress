      WORKING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS WITH USE AND ABUSE OF PUBLIC LANDS

  (Mr. CANNON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. CANNON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to invite our colleagues to 
join with us and listen to the debate on what I think is a remarkable 
piece of legislation that will, I believe, significantly affect the 
course of public lands and legislation in America.
  I want to thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Hansen), the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands for his work on 
this bill. I encourage all of our colleagues to take a look at what we 
can actually do to solve the problems of use and abuse of our public 
lands.
