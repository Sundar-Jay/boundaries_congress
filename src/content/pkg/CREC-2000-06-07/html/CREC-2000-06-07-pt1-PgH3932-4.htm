   WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION SIDES WITH JAPAN ON ILLEGAL STEEL DUMPING

  (Mr. TRAFICANT asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. TRAFICANT. Mr. Speaker, the World Trade Organization ruled that 
an 84-year-old American law duly passed by Congress, designed to stop 
illegal dumping was, in fact, no longer legal. The WTO sided with 
Japanese steel imports saying that the American law is a violation of 
international trade.
  Unbelievable. Illegal steel-dumping is killing America, and these 
sons of bachelors, believe me, side with Japan dumping.
  Beam me up, Mr. Speaker. I thought America won the war. I yield back 
a $320 billion trade deficit, most of it going to Japan, and the 
Chinese Red Army.
