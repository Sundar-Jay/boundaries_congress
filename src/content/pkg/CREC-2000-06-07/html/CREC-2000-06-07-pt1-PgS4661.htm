                 BIRTH OF SENATOR LEVIN'S GRANDDAUGHTER

  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one of the reasons I left the floor with 
great joy during the day was to greet the arrival of my granddaughter, 
Bess Rachel--who was delivered today. Bess is named after my mother. I 
am sure she will forgive me for doing this because she is too young to 
know the difference. Her mother, my daughter Kate, and my son-in-law 
Howard Markel, may be looking at us now. If they are, I hope they will 
forgive me, too. I am just a proud grandpa, with grandma Barbara there 
at the hospital in New York. That is why I disappeared for a few 
minutes.
  As always, Harry Reid does yeoman work on this floor for all of us on 
this side of the aisle, obviously, but really for every Member of the 
Senate. I thank him for filling in.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
