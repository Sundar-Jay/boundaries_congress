              A SALUTE TO REPRESENTATIVE STEPHEN S.F. CHEN

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. WILLIAM O. LIPINSKI

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 7, 2000

  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, since the Republic of China moved its seat 
of government to Taiwan in 1949, it has overcome many difficulties and 
achieved many successes. Where Taiwan was once a war-torn island with a 
per capita annual income of less than $300, today that figure has 
surpassed $13,000. Taiwan is now an economic powerhouse and one of the 
largest markets for U.S. products in the world. Already, Taiwan holds 
the third largest foreign exchange reserves in the world, and this 
year, its economy is expected to grow by another 6.7 percent.
  Taiwan's successes have not been limited strictly to the realm of 
economics. Over the last few decades, Taiwan has consolidated its 
status as one of Asia's most vibrant and viable democracies. Following 
the lifting of bans on the creation of new political parties and the 
growth of the free media in the 1980s, Taiwan has gradually expanded 
the scope of its electoral politics by holding direct elections for the 
President and the Parliament. This year, on March 18, the people of 
Taiwan once again exercised their democratic rights and elected a new 
administration that will take office on May 20.
  This unprecedented development will mark the first peaceful exchange 
of ruling power from one political party to another in the history of 
Chinese civilization and will enhance

Taiwan's role as a model of democracy for the people of mainland China. 
It is my hope that as the powerful influence of Taiwan's democracy 
grows, so too will the momentum for the peaceful resolution of issues 
between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait.
  At this time of great hope and opportunity, Taiwan's principal 
representative to the U.S. and the head of the Taipei Economic and 
Cultural Representative Office in Washington, D.C., Representative 
Stephen S.F. Chen, has announced his retirement after 40 years of 
service in Taiwan's corps. It is because of his efforts that Taiwan has 
maintained its prestige and standing in the international community. 
His steady hand has helped steer Taiwan through the good times and the 
bad, and it is clear that the international community has been enriched 
by his work. Representative Chen's professionalism and diplomatic 
skills are second to none, and I wish to thank him for his tireless 
efforts to further strengthen the close and friendly ties between 
Taiwan and the U.S.
  Mr. Speaker, I wish to salute the 23 million people who live in the 
prosperous democracy on Taiwan. I also salute Representative Chen for 
his patriotism, dedication, and friendship. On the occasion of his 
retirement, I invite my colleagues to join me in extending our best 
wishes and sincere appreciation for all that Stephen Chen has done, and 
most importantly, for all that he will continue to do as he moves on to 
write the next brilliant chapter of his life's work.
