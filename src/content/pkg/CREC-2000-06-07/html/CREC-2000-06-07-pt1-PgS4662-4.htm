          PENNSYLVANIANS RAISE FUNDS FOR WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL

  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 
accomplishments of 30,020 Pennsylvanian Wal-Mart associates. These 
dedicated individuals, along with 870,000 other Wal-Mart associates 
nationwide, raised more than $14 million for the National World War II 
Memorial Campaign.
  This outstanding achievement brought the World War II Memorial

[[Page S4663]]

Fund to more than $90 million. This donation brings the fund 
increasingly closer to its goal of $100 million. On June 6, 2000, 
Barbara Ritenour and Bonnie Cowell from Belle Vernon, PA joined 40 
other Wal-Mart associates to present this contribution to former 
Senator Robert Dole, National Chairman of the World War II Memorial 
Campaign on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
  The purpose of this event on June 6 was to thank those who went above 
and beyond the call of duty to help meet this financial goal. It was 
the small contributions of bake sales and parking lot carnivals that 
made such a difference.
  Wal-Mart employs over 1,900 World War II veterans. They recognize the 
importance of constructing a memorial to salute the men and women who 
fought in the war as well as those who supported it from the home 
front.
  I commend the efforts of those so dedicated to the memory of those 
who served in World War II, and I wish the World War II Memorial 
Campaign continued success as they work to meet the remainder of their 
$100 million goal.
