                    NO TAXATION WITHOUT RESPIRATION

  (Mr. SCHAFFER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. SCHAFFER. Mr. Speaker, we associate many symbols with death such 
as the Grim Reaper, tombstones, coffins, hearses and, of course, the 
IRS standing by any ordinary American who draws on his last breath.
  Americans who work their entire lives to leave their families a 
savings account, farm, or small business are robbed at death by Federal 
taxes that devour 37 to 55 percent of everything they created. In the 
cruelest of ironies, families are often forced to sell these well-
intentioned gifts in order to afford the taxes.
  Mr. Speaker, this week the Congress will decide on whether to repeal 
the death tax. It is an issue that transcends party politics.
  The Colonists rallied around the slogan, ``No taxation without 
representation.'' This week let us agree: No taxation without 
respiration. May the death tax rest in peace.
