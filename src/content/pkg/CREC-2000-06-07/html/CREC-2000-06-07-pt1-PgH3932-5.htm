       PRESERVE THE AMERICAN DREAM BY VOTING TO REPEAL DEATH TAX

  (Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, in a movie called Meet Joe 
Black, Death disguises himself as a young man named Joe Black so as to 
better observe life on Earth. While watching a dinner party, one guest 
remarks to another that the only 2 certainties in life are death and 
taxes. Joe Black responds, death and taxes, what an interesting 
pairing.
  For years, the IRS has thought so too. Americans are currently 
subjected to the death tax, a law that taxes families up to 60 percent 
of their loved one's savings, or the worth of their farm or family 
business, upon their death. This unfair tax prevents more than 70 
percent of America's small businesses and family farms being passed 
from one generation to the text.
  This week, the House will vote on legislation to repeal the death 
tax. I urge my colleagues to support preserving the American dream by 
voting to end the death tax.
