reception held in the rotunda of the State Capitol in Springfield.
  Connie was honored for demonstrating excellence in her professional 
and volunteer work and committing herself to enhancing her community. 
She was recognized for founding the Housing Rehabilitation Program and 
for serving as the secretary/treasurer of Bonnie for many years.
  I want to thank Connie for her commitment to serve her community. She 
is an example for all of us to follow.
