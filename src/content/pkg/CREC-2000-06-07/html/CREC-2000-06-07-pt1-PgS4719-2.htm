  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, for the information of all 
Senators, on behalf of the leader, I announce that the Senate will

authorization bill. Under the order, at 1 p.m. there will be 2 hours of 
debate on the McCain-Feingold amendment regarding soft money

consideration of the Kennedy HMO amendment for up to 2 hours. Votes on 
the McCain and Kennedy amendments will be stacked to occur at 5 p.m.
