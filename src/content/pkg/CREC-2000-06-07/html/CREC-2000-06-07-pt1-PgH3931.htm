House of Representatives

  The House met at 10 a.m.
  The Chaplain, the Reverend Daniel P. Coughlin, offered the following 
prayer:
  Lord, You have said:
  ``Whoever believes shall not be put to shame.''
  Strengthen us in faith, O Lord.
  May we hold in high value the faith of Your people.
  May the laws of this land and the concerns of this chamber protect 
and never diminish the free exercise of the faith of this Nation.
  Make us steadfast in addressing doubt and confusion.
  Give us compassion so as to guide those who are weak in their 
convictions.
  Form out of us a haven for those who lose hope because of injustice.
  Lord, may we be creative in restoring hope, persistent in making 
right judgments, and persevering in speaking the truth.
  For You are the perfector of our faith now and forever. Amen.
