           COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION RULE CHANGE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to give notice to Members 
and staff of the Senate that the Committee on Rules and Administration 
has approved the following change to its Rules of Procedure.
  The Committee's rules approved at the beginning of the 106th Congress 
require 4 members of the committee to constitute a quorum for the 
purpose of taking testimony under oath and 2 members of the committee 
to constitute a quorum for the purpose of taking testimony not under 
oath.
  The Committee intends to amend paragraph 3 of Title II of the Rules 
of Precedure for the Committee on Rules and Administration to state:

       3. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(2) of rule XXVI of the 
     Standing Rules, 2 members of the committee shall constitute a 
     quorum for the purpose of taking testimony under oath and 1 
     member of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the 
     purpose of taking testimony not under oath; provided, 
     however, that once a quorum is established for the purpose of 
     taking testimony under oath, any one member can continue to 
     take such testimony.

  This amendment shall be effective on June 8, 2000, and will make the 
Rules Committee's quorum rules more consistent with the quorum rules of 
most other standing committees.

                          ____________________
