TRIBUTE TO THE CREWS OF SUBMARINES ``DARTER'' AND ``DACE'' AND ALL NAVY 
                              SUBMARINERS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BART STUPAK

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 7, 2000

  Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, on May 27 in Marquette, Michigan, a 
community in my congressional district a special ceremony was held to 
honor the officers and crew members of the submarines Darter and Dace, 
SS227 and SS247. These two submarines played a decisive role in what 
has been called the greatest naval battle of all time, the Battle of 
Leyte Gulf in October 1943.
  The opening shots of that battle were fired by Marquette native Cdr. 
David McClintock, skipper of the Darter, who had positioned his sub to 
penetrate a powerful Japanese fleet, one that included the famous 
Japanese super-battleship Yamato.
  As commander of the two-sub squadron, Captain McClintock had also 
helped position the Dace to make an independent attack on the 31-ship 
Japanese battle fleet.
  Firing torpedoes from both his forward and stern tubes, Captain 
McClintock sank the heavy cruiser Atago, flagship of the Japanese 
Navy's Second Fleet, and he disabled another heavy cruiser. The Dace 
also sank one heavy cruiser. Two Japanese destroyers were forced to 
leave the battle fleet to guard the disabled cruiser, bringing to five 
the number of ships impacted by the Darter-Dace attack.
  The daring combat actions of these two submarine crews and the 
essential naval intelligence they provided, were pivotal in helping to 
prevent a crushing blow to American forces that had just returned a few 
days earlier to the Philippines under the command of General Douglas 
MacArthur.
  Mr. Speaker, this ceremony included a dedication of a new submarine 
exhibit at the Marquette Maritime Museum. This exhibit, which includes 
a submarine conning tower, is intended to honor not only the Darter and 
Dace crews but all U.S. Navy submariners, that special group of young 
heroes who have chosen to go ``in harm's way'' in dangerous and 
solitary service beneath the waves. A diorama of the battle, a three-
foot scale model of the Darter, and a working periscope are also part 
of the exhibit.
  Captain McClintock, who completed a career in the Navy before 
returning to Marquette after retirement, attended Saturday's service. 
His classmate at the Naval Academy, Captain B.D. Claggett, who 
commanded the companion submarine, the Dace, also attended the 
ceremony.
  This was an extremely fitting way to commemorate Memorial Day, 
because it honored this special group of Americans, both living and 
dead. Perhaps one day, Mr. Speaker, you and our colleagues may have an 
opportunity to visit Marquette, Michigan and see this special permanent 
tribute to the unique individuals who have given so much on behalf of 
our country.
