                 BIPARTISAN HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT

  (Mr. LAMPSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. LAMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a bipartisan 
Hate Crimes Prevention Act and also to mark the second anniversary of 
the murder of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas. We must continue to fight to 
end the racial stereotypes that create misunderstanding and prejudice 
that lead to such acts of violence. Congress must work to change 
attitudes, laws, and institutions for the good of all Americans and 
reject the voices of hate and separatism.
  By passing H.R. 1082, Congress can reaffirm our Nation's commitment 
to the true American dream: an integrated society rich in diversity and 
open equally to all. Thank goodness that we no longer see signs that 
read ``white'' and ``colored.'' The voters' booth and the schoolhouse 
door now swing open for everyone. However, while much has been 
accomplished, more needs to be done.
  Mr. Speaker, we cannot rest until we solve the oldest, most stubborn, 
most painful challenge of our Nation: the continuing challenge of race. 
We must not be finished with seeking peace or justice or freedom 
equality, human dignity or reconciliation. We must continue to cry out 
for equality and justice. Because if we are silent, another innocent 
citizen like James Byrd, Jr., may be brutally beaten or savagely 
murdered.
  We must not rest, nor must we fail to act. Passing H.R. 1082 will be 
a victory for every American and bring our Nation one step closer to 
the American dream. Mr. Speaker, it is a Federal crime to seize an 
automobile. Let us make it one to kill a man because of the color of 
his skin.
