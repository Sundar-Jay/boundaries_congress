                    RETIREMENT OF RICHARD W. CANNON

<bullet> Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, on June 16th, family, friends 
and colleagues will gather to honor Richard W. Cannon, who has served 
the Social Security Administration for 39 years, and is retiring as 
District Manager of the Providence, RI office.
  Mr. Cannon has demonstrated an exemplary record of service to New 
England and the Social Security Administration (SSA). He began his 
career with SSA as a Claims Representative in the Pawtucket, RI office 
in September, 1961. He quickly rose through the ranks, receiving 
promotions to field Representative, Operations Supervisor, Branch 
Manager, Assistant District Manager, and finally to District Manager by 
1976. He has held the position of District Manager for 24 years in 
three offices: New London, CT; Cambridge, MA; and since May 1987, 
Providence.
  Not only has Rhode Island benefited from Richard's services, but 
regions across the country have as well. He served stints in Social 
Security Administration offices in New York, California, and Hawaii, 
But, it has been our good fortune that he continues to return to his 
home state of Rhode Island.
  He has shared his knowledge and expertise not only with his office 
colleagues, but with members of the Rhode Island Federal Executive 
Council, which he led as chairman for two years, and the New England 
Social Security Managers Association, where he also held office.
  Lest we think that Richard's life was dedicated solely to the Social 
Security Administration, he also enjoys the outdoors. I have it on good 
authority that he can often be seen leaving his home in Snug Harbor to 
cruise the waters of Narrangansett Bay, hoping to entice a fish or two 
to join him in his boat.
  As Richard prepares for his private life away from the duties of his

demanding job, I want to congratulate and thank him for all that he has 
given to the Social Security Administration and his community.<bullet>
