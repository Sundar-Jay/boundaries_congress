  SALUTING KELLY AND JOHN THOMAS: TODAY'S STUDENTS, TOMORROW'S LEADERS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JAMES E. ROGAN

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 7, 2000

  Mr. ROGAN. Mr. Speaker, too often, we in Congress take to heart the 
negativity so often seen in the news, on television, and in popular 
culture. It is refreshing however, to return home to our districts and 
see stories that inspire, motivate and remind us that this is not the 
case. Indeed, as I have recently seen, today's students are tomorrow's 
leaders.
  In my home district, two local students, John and Kelly Thomas have 
taken their compassion for older Americans and united it with some 
technological know-how. Their efforts are proving that they are indeed 
shining examples of tomorrow's leaders. In honor of their recent 
accomplishments, and in recognition of their commitment to older 
Americans, I ask my colleagues here today to join me in saluting John 
and Kelly Thomas.
  Kelly is a senior at Flintridge Preparatory School in La Canada 
Flintridge, California. As part of her community service requirement at 
school, she began playing the piano in area senior centers. And, as the 
Glendale News-Press recently reported, Kelly with the help of her 
younger brother John harnessed the power of a new home computer and 
began to reach out to seniors all across the country.
  The brother and sister team had noticed that seniors throughout the 
community were often isolated and alone living in retirement homes. 
John and Kelly's new Internet site became a launching pad uniting 
seniors who are too often lonely with concerned neighbors online and in 
person. Their web site <a href="http://">http://</a>come.to/writeseniors.com, has brought 
people together and proved that John and Kelly, while still in high 
school are successful not just as businesspeople, but as concerned 
citizens as well.
  In recognition of their accomplishments and with gratitude for their 
commitment to others in the community, I ask my colleagues to join me 
in saluting Kelly and John Thomas: Today's students, tomorrow's 
leaders.
