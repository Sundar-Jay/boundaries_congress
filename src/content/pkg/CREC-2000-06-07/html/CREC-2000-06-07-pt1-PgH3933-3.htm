        HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT: AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COME

  (Mr. DAVIS of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge the House to 
take action on the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999.
  Today marks the second anniversary of the death of James Byrd, Jr., 
who was maliciously dragged from a speeding car along a back road in 
Jasper, Texas. His murderers had no problem with him other than the 
fact that he was black.
  The Hate Crimes Act will protect individuals like James Byrd and 
others who have been attacked because of race, color, sexual 
orientation, religion, gender, or disability. In our society, rich with 
diversity, the desire for peaceful living is uppermost. It is past time 
for Congress to set and maintain civilized standards of peaceful 
diversity.
  Hate crimes, like any other crime, should be unallowable and 
punished. Innocent people should not be allowed to be reaped upon just 
because of their race, color or gender.
  Mr. Speaker, this is an idea whose time has come. I urge its 
immediate consideration and passage.
