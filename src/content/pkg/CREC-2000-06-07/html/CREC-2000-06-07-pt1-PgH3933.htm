             CONGRESS MUST MAKE EDUCATION OUR TOP PRIORITY

  (Mr. ETHERIDGE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on this Congress to 
get its priorities straight and invest in public education to 
strengthen America.
  Yesterday, Microsoft's Bill Gates told the Joint Economic Committee, 
and I quote, ``Among the many high-tech issues before this Congress, 
none carries greater importance for our future economic vitality than 
education.'' I couldn't agree more.
  But this week, Mr. Speaker, this House will consider a bill that guts 
education funding to finance a massive irresponsible tax package. We 
should be investing in education so that America can compete and win in 
the New Economy, but this misguided bill cuts education by $2.9 
billion, with a ``b.''
  The bill cuts $1 billion in targeted investments to improve teacher 
quality and recruit new teachers. The bill repeals 100,000 new teachers 
planned to reduce class sizes, many of whom are now teaching. The bill 
rejects the administration's plan to renovate 5,000 school facilities 
that need urgent safety and health repairs. It cuts 53,000 poor 
children from Head Start, and the list goes on.
  Mr. Speaker, I am for responsible tax relief for our families, but we 
ought not to cut taxes on the backs our children and jeopardize 
America's competitive economic opportunities.
