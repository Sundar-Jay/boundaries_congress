             HONORING STUDENTS FROM GREEN RIVER HIGH SCHOOL

<bullet> Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on May 6-8, 2000, more than 1200 
students from across the United States came to Washington, D.C. to 
compete in the national finals of the We the People . . . The Citizen 
and the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that the class 
from Green River High School in Green River, Wyoming, represented my 
state in this national event. These young scholars worked diligently to 
reach the national finals and through their experience have gained a 
deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and 
values of our constitutional democracy.
  The participating students were Richard Baxter, Natalie Binder, 
Katharine Bracken, Cameron Kelsey, Sandra Newton, Jacque Owen, Jeremy 
Pitts, Benjamin Potmesil, Meagan Reese, Rachel Ryckman, Ryan Stewart, 
and Steven Ujvary. I also want to recognize their teacher, Dennis 
Johnson, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the team.
  The We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution program is 
the most extensive educational program in the country developed 
specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the 
Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after 
hearings in the United States Congress, during which a panel of judges 
from a variety of appropriate professional fields probes the students 
for their depth of understanding and ability to apply their 
constitutional knowledge.
  The class from Green River represented the state of Wyoming well 
during the finals, and I wish these ``constitutional experts'' the best 
of luck as they continue to cultivate their interest in the principles 
upon which our great country was founded.<bullet>
