                           NOTICE OF HEARING


               committee on energy and natural resources

  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to announce for the 
information of the Senate and the public that a hearing has been 
scheduled before the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
  The hearing will take place Thursday, June 15, 2000, at 9:30 a.m. in 
room SD-366 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C.
  The purpose of this hearing is to receive testimony on the goals and 
specific legislative provisions of S. 2557, the National Energy 
Security Act of 2000. The bill would protect the energy security of the 
United States and decrease America's dependency on foreign oil sources 
to 50 percent by the year 2010 by enhancing the use of renewable energy 
resources, conserving energy resources, improving energy efficiencies, 
and increasing domestic energy supplies, mitigating the effect of 
increases in energy prices on the American consumer, including the poor 
and elderly, and for other purposes.
  Presentation of oral testimony is by Committee invitation only. 
However, those who wish to submit written testimony for the hearing 
record should send two copies of their testimony to the Committee on 
Energy and Natural Resources, United States Senate, 364 Dirksen Senate 
Office Building, Washington, D.C. 20510-6150. For further information, 
please contact Brian Malnak at (202) 224-4971.
