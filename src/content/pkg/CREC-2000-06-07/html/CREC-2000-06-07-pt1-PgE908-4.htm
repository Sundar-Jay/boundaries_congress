  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to two longtime 
educators who are retiring

[[Page E909]]

from the Chicago Public School system (CPS) this year. After several 
years of tremendous service, Mary Ann Bartusch and Roseann Palladino 
will be leaving Byrne Elementary School in Southwest Chicago. These 
teachers are perfect examples of the continuously hardworking, but 
often-unrecognized efforts of teachers in the 3rd Congressional 
District of Illinois. It gives me great pride to share with you their 
stories and accomplishments.
  Mary Ann Bartusch graduated from Bradley University in Peoria, 
Illinois, majoring in Speech Language Pathology. For 34 years, Mary Ann 
served the Chicago Public Schools as a speech language pathologist. She 
began her career at Baum Elementary School (now Tonti Elementary 
School). In addition to John F. Kennedy High School, she then served at 
John C. Dore, Blair, Kinzie, Francis McKay, Mark Twain, Sawyer, and 
Michael M. Byrne Elementary Schools. For over three decades, Mary Ann 
gained the trust and love of her often disadvantaged students who found 
communication with her remarkably easy.
  Mary Ann's avocations included volunteering for local Brownies and 
Girl Scouts organizations. Her daughters were active in 4H and received 
several awards, gaining their mother's pride. In Mary Ann's well-
deserved leisure time, she pursues gardening and air-travel.
  Roseann Palladino spent over 35 years in Chicago as a distinguished 
science teacher. In 1964, she graduated from Chicago Teacher's College 
with a Bachelors of Education (B.E.) degree. Eleven years later, she 
received a Master of Arts (M.A.) degree from the Illinois Institute of 
Technology's (IIT) Design program.
  Her service to Chicago's youth began at Gershwin Elementary School, 
where she served for 8\1/2\ years. After 15 years at Morrill, she spent 
the last 12 years at Byrne Elementary.
  Over the years, Roseann participated in several school trips, and 
appropriately received numerous awards and recognition. Commenting on 
her retirement, Roseann humbly stated: ``My thanks for all my years of 
service in Chicago is the love and success I see in all the children I 
have taught.''
  Again, I was pleased to learn of the retirement and wonderfully 
productive lives of Mary Ann Bartusch and Roseann Palladino. In a time 
when these educators are receiving numerous recognition and praise, I 
gladly echo my own thanks from the halls of the U.S. Congress. These 
two educators represent the day-to-day hard work and compassion that 
steer Chicago's youth toward successful futures. Mr. Speaker, I wish 
Mary Ann Bartusch and Roseann Palladino a well-deserved long and happy 
retirement.
