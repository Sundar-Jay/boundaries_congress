           IRAQ SOLUTION LIES WITH UNITED NATIONS INVOLVEMENT

  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. McHenry). Under a previous order of the 
House, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott) is recognized for 
5 minutes.
  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to amplify on the Iraq 
proposal that I made last night in the House. I believe the solution in 
Iraq lies with the United Nations and that it is time for direct U.N. 
involvement to replace U.S. forces and to allow our troops to return 
home safely and in an orderly way.
  The evidence is mounting that America's current approach in Iraq will 
not work. When was the last time anybody heard the word ``coalition'' 
to describe the military activity in Iraq? The world largely perceives 
the United States as going it alone in Iraq. Furthermore, large 
portions of the Arab world believe in the insurgency rhetoric that 
America is an occupier in Iraq for selfish oil reasons and not to serve 
the needs of the Iraqi people.
  Administration claims about the insurgency do not square with the 
news coming out of Iraq every day or with the sober assessment by 
America's best military leaders. U.S. and Iraq civilian casualties are 
mounting. That is what Americans see every night on the news. What 
Americans want is a sober assessment of Iraq that reflects reality and

for the Congress and the administration to work together to come up 
with a solution. Americans are sick of the politics. They want a 
solution that will protect U.S. soldiers and make what they are 
fighting and dying for, and what has taken untold numbers of Iraqi 
lives, worth the enormous sacrifice.
  We need a new strategy in Iraq. We need a new plan. This one is not 
working. The more the administration denies it, the more time we waste 
and the more lives we lose because we do not do what we need to do. We 
do not need permanent bases in Iraq. Every day that goes by with the 
current war scenario, this country loses credibility around the world.
  Every concrete block that we lay is sowing seeds of mistrust, anger, 
and resentment that will affect us for generations. Consider that we 
are still dealing with Vietnam 30 years later trying to establish 
relationships with them. It is time to involve the rest of the world in 
Iraq and stop anyone from calling this is the U.S.-Iraq war. Only the 
United Nations has the international imprimatur to lead an 
international coalition in Iraq. Only the United Nations can credibly 
install a peace-enforcing force in Iraq that is seen as such by the 
entire world.
  We did a similar thing under UNTAC in Cambodia. We have done it 
before. I have never supported this war, but I would gratefully support 
a Republican resolution to get the U.N. into Iraq. This would be a 
positive development to safeguard U.S. ground forces and send a 
positive signal to a skeptical Arab world that America's intentions are 
not what the insurgents claim them to be.
  We need a bold stroke in Iraq if we are to succeed in stopping the 
loss of lives and spread of terror. We cannot just fight insurgents in 
the streets day by day if there is any hope of peace in Iraq. The world 
has to believe we are only there to benefit Iraq. As long as the war is 
called and perceived as the U.S.-Iraq war, the insurgents have new 
ammunition to recruit, terrorize, maim, and kill.
  We have an opportunity to work together as Americans, not Democrats 
and Republicans, but to create a plan that creates a new role for the 
U.S. in Iraq, contributing to the U.N. peace-enforcing force. We have 
an opportunity to safeguard American lives we are replacing, not 
withdrawing U.S. soldiers from Iraq.
  Today, too many military experts in our country quietly say that the 
Iraq war could go on for the indefinite future. David Hackworth, the 
most decorated Vietnam veteran, said we are going to be there 30 years. 
We cannot afford the price in dollars, and more importantly, in loss or 
shattered lives for our soldiers.
  The way to win the war in Iraq is to allow the world, not the United 
States, to lead the war in Iraq. Since the Republicans are the majority 
party in the House, I willingly submit my proposal to the Republicans 
to call their own, get the President on board, turn it into legislation 
that we can pass by unanimous consent.
  The best military option for the United States in Iraq is to act 
under the command and direction of the United Nations. U.N. leadership 
offers the best chance for a lasting peace and the fastest orderly way 
for American troops to return home.
  Mr. Speaker, please put politics aside and let us act together. 
Yesterday, 82 members of the Iraq parliament submitted a letter to 
their speakers saying get the troops out of Baghdad. We ought to be 
working with them and make it happen, but it will take both Republicans 
and Democrats to do it.
