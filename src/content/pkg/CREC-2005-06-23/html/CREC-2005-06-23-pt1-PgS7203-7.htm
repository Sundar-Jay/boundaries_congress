                          IRAQI PRIME MINISTER

  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning I have the honor of meeting 
with Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari. The Prime Minister is in 
the United States to meet with President Bush and other Washington 
leaders to discuss the next steps in Iraq's transition to a free and 
democratic society. I have not yet met the Prime Minister. I look 
forward to doing so in the next couple of hours.
  The Prime Minister deserves great praise for his leadership. He has 
worked hard as Prime Minister to reach out across ethnic and religious 
lines. Because of his efforts, Iraq is led by a transitional government 
that includes ministers from each of Iraq's ethnic and religious 
groups.
  The Prime Minister's steady leadership has been inspiring. Next 
Tuesday, 5 days from now, June 28, will mark the 1-year anniversary of 
the transfer of sovereignty from the Coalition Provisional Authority to 
a sovereign Iraqi Government. Since then, Iraq has fought the 
insurgency with determination as it has undergone truly remarkable 
changes. Perhaps none was more remarkable than the elections on January 
31. On that day, 8 million Iraqis cast their votes for the first 
democratically elected national assembly in more than 50 years. They 
came on foot, they came by car and some even came by wagon. They defied 
all manner of terrorist threat and terrorist intimidation.
  It was truly extraordinary. No one who saw the images of those brave 
citizens emerging from the polling stations, holding aloft those 
stained, blue-inked fingers, could help but be moved and inspired. 
While the task of forming

a government has taken much longer than any of us would have hoped, the 
Iraqi people now turn to the task of drafting a constitution and laying 
the groundwork for a new round of elections at this year's end.

  Last week, leaders of the 55-member committee charged with drafting 
the new constitution reached a compromise with the Sunni Arab groups. 
Together, they decided on the number of Sunni representatives to serve 
on that committee. This was a major step forward and a significant 
effort on the part of the majority to reach out to the Sunni 
leadership. It was also significant because of the impact it could have 
on the ground.
  As we have seen political progress slow, we have watched 
unfortunately the violence increase. Building and sustaining momentum 
in the political process is clearly linked to undermining the 
terrorists and their support. During their low turnout in the January 
elections and the current spate of violence, the Sunnis realized they 
cannot achieve their aims by standing outside the process or by failing 
to face down the insurgents.
  Like all Iraqis, they have a tremendous stake in the success of Iraq 
becoming a peaceful and prosperous democracy. They know the best way to 
ensure the outcome and to ensure their rightful place is to work 
constructively with their fellow Iraqis. I am heartened by the efforts 
of the Shi'a and Kurd leaders to include the Sunnis in the political 
process.
  These are difficult times, and they require thoughtful leadership. 
The efforts of all parties to reach out and be inclusive deserves our 
praise and our steadfast support, as do the brave Iraqis who have 
stepped forward to defend and protect their country. The Iraqi forces 
have suffered more deaths and casualties than coalition forces. Despite 
repeated direct attacks on their ranks, every day thousands of young 
Iraqis continue to volunteer for service. The Defense Department 
reports that, as of June 8, more than 160,000 Iraqi security forces 
have been trained and equipped.
  Yes, many of them have much experience to gain and much more to learn 
before they will be able to act independently, but this will take time 
as we strive to get 270,000 Iraqis in uniform by July 2006.
  Progress is being made. Two or three months ago, I had the 
opportunity to travel to Jordan and visited one of the Iraqi-Jordanian 
police training academies. They are on the ground. One can see the 
progress that is being made in Iraq and with the Iraqi police recruits. 
One can see their commitment to seeing the job through.
  It is all a difficult task, and it is going to take a lot of 
determination, but I am confident the Iraqi forces will continue to 
improve and continue to demonstrate their bravery in the days ahead.
  As Iraqis assume a greater responsibility for their own defense, the 
pace of Iraq's reconstruction should also gain speed. After decades of 
corruption and mismanagement by Saddam's regime, many of Iraq's towns 
and cities were in shambles, sewage in the streets, tumbled-down 
schools, unreliable electricity and unreliable and unpotable water. 
Coalition forces have been working hard to help the Iraqis rebuild and 
retool.
  We are also helping the Iraqis strengthen the rule of law, a civil 
society, and private enterprise. A strong economy means more 
opportunities, better jobs, more jobs and a brighter future. Opinion 
polls show a majority of Iraqis remain optimistic about their economic 
future despite ongoing security concerns. It is all hard work, and it 
is made much harder by foreign interference.
  The State Department reports that while Syria has taken some steps to 
improve border security, supporters of the terrorists continue to use 
Syrian territory as a staging ground. On the Iranian front, Secretary 
of Defense Rumsfeld and CIA Director Goss report that Iran has sent 
money and fighters to proteges in Iraq. The fact is, some of Iraq's 
neighbors fear a large, prosperous democracy on their borders. They 
fear that a democratic Iraq will export freedom and liberty to their 
lands. But fear will not stop freedom's progress. Iraq will succeed and 
will become a beacon of hope throughout the region and throughout the 
world.
  We have already seen the beginnings in the Cedar Revolution in 
Lebanon. Freedom is on the march, and the Iraqi people are leading the 
way.
  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to continue to offer our steadfast 
support. This is an extraordinary opportunity to change the course of 
history and bring peace and stability to the heart of the Middle East. 
Such steadfastness will not be easy and will not be without cost, but 
we must succeed. We cannot allow the terrorists to win, and we cannot 
allow Iraq to fall into chaos, sectarian violence or the rule of 
extremists. This is going to take a lot of time. It is going to take a 
lot of money. It is going to take a lot of patience.
  The American people need to understand that we will be in Iraq for 
some time to come. It is vital to the Iraqis that we be there. It is 
critical to the region that we be there. It is essential to our own 
security that we be there. Our time line will be driven by success and 
our exit will depend on the security situation. It will depend on 
democracy's advance and the wishes of a sovereign Iraq.

  It is clear to me that as Iraqis are able to stand up and provide 
their own security, without coalition assistance and without foreign 
intervention, we should be able to begin withdrawing personnel from 
that region.
  When I meet with the new Iraqi Prime Minister later this morning, we 
will discuss all of these pressing matters. I will let him know America 
is fully committed to Iraq's success. I will also tell him we expect 
continued progress on security, on reconstruction, and the formation of 
a functioning democracy.
  In the end, Iraq, the region, and the United States will be more safe 
and more secure.
  I ask unanimous consent that the time just consumed be counted 
against the majority's allocated time prior to the cloture vote.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
  Mr. FRIST. I yield the floor.
