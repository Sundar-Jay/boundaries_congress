                          HONORING GRACE SIERS

<bullet> Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise 
today to publicly commend Grace Siers, charter member of Marshall Post 
No. 3507 Ladies Auxiliary in Britton, SD, for her many years of devoted 
service to our Nation's veterans.
  Sixty years ago, in 1945, Grace joined the VFW Ladies Auxiliary, and 
has been an irreplaceable asset to the organization ever since. Grace 
is part of a long line of military patriots, as she joined the 
auxiliary under the sponsorship of her husband, William Siers, who 
served in WWI, as well as her three brothers, Vance, John, and Clarence 
Hunscher, all veterans of WWII. Not surprisingly, the tradition of 
serving our country continues with Grace's five sons, Le Roy, Donald, 
Virgil, Gary, and Robert, and even her grandson and granddaughter, all 
of whom served in the military. Regrettably, her son, Robert, died 
while fighting in Vietnam.
  Although decades have passed and auxiliary members are no longer as 
active as they once were, Grace's hard work and dedication over the 
years enabled the auxiliary to raise thousands of dollars, bring smiles 
to the faces of countless injured and recovering veterans, and educate 
innumerable South Dakotans about the importance of supporting America's 
brave veterans.
  In early years, Grace recalls hosting Post Suppers, serving banquets, 
selling poppies, organizing bake sales, compiling and selling 
cookbooks, and even manning the post during the annual Turkey Raffle on 
Thanksgiving, all to raise money for the auxiliary. In turn, the funds 
were donated to VA hospitals and used to buy supplies so the women 
could bake cookies and cakes and then personally deliver the goodies to 
veterans in hospitals throughout South Dakota.
  Grace's tremendous contributions to the Britton community set her 
apart from other outstanding citizens. Her extraordinary service and 
commitment to Marshall Post No. 3507 Ladies Auxiliary is to be 
commended. Through Grace's remarkable community involvement and 
dedication to America's veterans, the lives of countless South Dakotans 
have been enormously enhanced. Her wonderful example serves as a model 
for other hardworking and dedicated individuals throughout South Dakota 
to emulate.
  Grace Siers is an extraordinary woman who richly deserves this 
distinguished recognition. I strongly commend her years of hard work 
and dedication, and I am very pleased that her substantial efforts are 
being publicly honored and celebrated. It is with great pleasure that I 
share her impressive accomplishments with my colleagues.<bullet>
