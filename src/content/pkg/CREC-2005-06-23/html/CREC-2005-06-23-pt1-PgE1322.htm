                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 22, 2005

  Mr. WALDEN of Oregon. Mr. Speaker, colleagues, I rise today in honor 
of a dedicated public servant and inspirational teacher, Mr. Merle 
Saunders, on his induction into The National Teachers Hall of Fame. Mr. 
Saunders teaches Automotive Technology at Vale High School in Vale, 
Oregon, a rural town of approximately 1,000 located in eastern Oregon. 
This tremendous honor is well-deserved and I am proud to recognize him 
for this achievement.
  One of only five individuals nationwide to be inducted into the Hall 
of Fame this year, Mr. Saunders has been recognized for his 25 years 
educating students in Vale. During his career, he has received numerous 
awards, including six teacher-of-the year awards, from organizations 
such as AAA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Vale Chamber of 
Commerce and the prestigious Milken Family Foundation.
  His excellence in instruction extends beyond the walls of Vale High 
School's classrooms. The school's automotive troubleshooting team, 
which Mr. Saunders advises, has won 14 State championships and has 
received several national trophies.
  Mr. Speaker, great teachers possess a valuable combination of 
intelligence, talent, patience and a genuine compassion for their 
students. The mission of The National Teachers Hall of Fame is to 
``recognize and honor exceptional teachers.'' They have accomplished 
this with the induction of Mr. Saunders.
  I would like to formally thank him for his service, commitment and 
dedication to young people at Vale High School and congratulate him on 
the receipt of this prestigious honor. He is an inspiration to his 
students, his colleagues and to us all.

                          ____________________
