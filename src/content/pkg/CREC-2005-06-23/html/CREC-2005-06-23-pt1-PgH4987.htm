                        House of Representatives

  The House met at 10 a.m.
  The Chaplain, the Reverend Daniel P. Coughlin, offered the following 
prayer:
  Eternal God, guide and protector of Your people, grant us unfailing 
respect for Your holy name and for Your holy presence in the people we 
meet today.
  Consecrate the work of this Congress. Raise up statesmen here and 
abroad who will recognize Your holy will in the waves of history and 
the will of the people whom they serve.
  May the peace and prosperity of this Nation be secured, while our 
attention is expanded and genuine concern for others is deepened by 
sincerity.
  Your bountiful resources of the Earth are plentiful enough, Lord, and 
can even be multiplied by the ingenuity and cooperative labor of people 
working together.
  For Your many gifts, we give You praise, honor and thanksgiving now 
and forever. Amen.
