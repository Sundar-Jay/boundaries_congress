              CONCERNING THE ROLE OF GUANTANAMO BAY PRISON

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, the detention facility at Guantanamo 
Bay is of strategic importance in winning the global war against 
terrorism. Guantanamo provides the United States with a secure 
interrogation center to gain essential intelligence information from 
terrorists. Illegal enemy combatants held at Guantanamo Bay include 
terrorist trainers, bombmakers, would-be suicide bombers and terrorist 
financiers. Through the detainees held at this facility, we have 
learned about the detonation system used in roadside bombs in Iraq by 
the insurgency, bombs that have killed our troops and innocent Iraqi 
citizens. Detainees include 20 of Osama bin Laden's personal bodyguards 
as well as one of the architects of the September 11 attacks and 
suspected 20th hijacker in the attack on our country on September 11.
  GITMO is designed to save the lives of our citizens and our service 
men and women from future acts of terror. Let us continue to support 
this important mission to protect the safety of our constituents and 
our Nation.
