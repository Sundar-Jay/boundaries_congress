                        Wednesday, June 22, 2005

  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to vote on four 
amendments to H.R. 2863, Defense Appropriations for FY 2006, on Monday, 
June 20 due to a travel delay.
  I would like the Record to reflect that I would have voted ``aye'' on 
agreeing to the Velazquez amendment; ``aye'' on agreeing to the DeFazio 
amendment; ``aye'' on agreeing to the Doggett amendment; and ``aye'' on 
agreeing to the Obey amendment.
