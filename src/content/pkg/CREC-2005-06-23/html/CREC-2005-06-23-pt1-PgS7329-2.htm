                              S. Res. 181

       Whereas Congress established the Forest Service in 1905 to 
     provide quality water and timber for the benefit of the 
     United States;
       Whereas the mission of the Forest Service has expanded to 
     include management of national forests for multiple uses and 
     benefits, including the sustained yield of renewable 
     resources such as water, forage, wildlife, wood, and 
     recreation;
       Whereas the National Forest System encompasses 192,000,000 
     acres in 44 States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, 
     including 155 national forests and 20 national grasslands;
       Whereas the Forest Service significantly contributes to the 
     scientific and technical knowledge necessary to protect and 
     sustain natural resources on all land in the United States;
       Whereas the Forest Service cooperates with State, Tribal, 
     and local governments, forest industries, other private 
     landowners, and forest users in the management, protection, 
     and development of forest land the Federal Government does 
     not own;
       Whereas the Forest Service participates in work, training, 
     and education programs such as AmeriCorps, Job Corps, and the 
     Senior Community Service Employment Program;
       Whereas the Forest Service plays a key role internationally 
     in developing sustainable forest management and biodiversity 
     conservation for the protection and sound management of the 
     forest resources of the world;
       Whereas, from rangers to researchers and from foresters to 
     fire crews, the Forest Service has maintained a dedicated 
     professional workforce that began in 1905 with 500 employees 
     and in 2005 includes more than 30,000; and
       Whereas Gifford Pinchot, the first Chief of the Forest 
     Service, fostered the idea of managing for the greatest good 
     of the greatest number: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate--
       (1) recognizes July 1, 2005 as the 100th Anniversary of the 
     Forest Service;
       (2) commends the Forest Service of the Department of 
     Agriculture for 100 years of dedicated service managing the 
     forests of the United States;
       (3) acknowledges the promise of the Forest Service to 
     continue to preserve the natural legacy of the United States 
     for an additional 100 years and beyond; and
       (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
     the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
