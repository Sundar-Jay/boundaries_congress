                        Wednesday, June 22, 2005

  Mr. TAYLOR of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute 
and to recognize the outstanding service of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph 
W. Corrigan, who retires this July after twenty-three years of selfless 
and dedicated service while working for the United States Army, the 
Army Corps of Engineers, and Army Legislative Liaison. Lieutenant 
Colonel Corrigan is a decorated Iraqi Freedom combat veteran who has 
not only demonstrated his courage in a hostile fire zone but his 
fervent compassion for people suppressed by years of tyranny and his 
untiring love of Country as he dedicated over twenty years of voluntary 
service to our Nation.
  Lieutenant Colonel Corrigan began his career as a United States 
Military Academy graduate, Class of 1982, and was immediately selected 
to lead our Nation's Sons and Daughters, an honor he accepted with 
great pride. During his superb career he has met the call of our Nation 
in both positions of leadership and staff while both he and his family 
endured the hardships of deployments and separation. As a testament to 
his professionalism, in 2002 he was awarded the Pace Award as the 
Department of the Army Staff Officer of the Year.
  Recently, Lieutenant Colonel Corrigan proudly served the citizens of 
our great State

of Mississippi in his capacity as the Deputy Director, U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers--Mobile Engineer District where he managed all the Corps 
of Engineer programs for five Southeastern States as well as Central 
and South America. Lieutenant Colonel Corrigan has spent a major 
portion of his career with Army Legislative Liaison providing both the 
Army and Congress with valuable professional insights and advice that 
have had a direct and positive impact on transforming the Army to meet 
the current and future requirements of a Nation at War.
  Mr. Speaker, as Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Corrigan leaves twenty-
three years of Military Service to our Country, I offer not only 
congratulations on his accomplishments but heartfelt thanks for his 
selfless service to our great Nation and a wish for his continued 
success.
