                            LOBBYING REFORM

  (Mr. EMANUEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. EMANUEL. Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the Senate we heard testimony 
of blatant fraud masquerading as a legitimate lobbying operation. And 
also yesterday, the Washington Post ran a front page story detailing 
the excesses of K Street, known as Lobbyists Avenue.
  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that these are gold rush times for 
professional lobbyists in Washington, DC. Since 2000, the number of 
professional lobbyists has more than doubled, to 34,000. Professional 
lobbyists have become the full service ``back office'' to Congress, 
arranging lavish fact-finding trips, writing legislation, and 
functioning as an employment agency for Members and staff.
  Just as we put distance between donors and Members of Congress when 
they run for office, we need to do the same when it comes to 
professional lobbyists and Members of Congress who write the laws. Our 
bill, the Meehan-Emanuel bill, slows the revolving door between 
government and lobbying, enhances disclosure and transparency, curbs 
privately funded congressional junkets and gives teeth to enforcement 
mechanisms. With congressional approval at all-time lows, we must act 
now to restore public confidence.
  Mr. Speaker, when your gavel comes down, it should mark the opening 
of the people's house, not the auction house.
