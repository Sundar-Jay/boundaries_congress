                         SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM

  (Mr. PENCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PENCE. Mr. Speaker, it is time to turn down the rhetoric and to 
stop the raid on the Social Security trust fund and start allowing 
Americans to invest their Social Security taxes in personal savings 
accounts.
  For more than 40 years, the United States Congress has shamelessly 
used payroll taxes intended for Social Security to fund Big Government 
spending. Thanks to the leadership of President George W. Bush, 
Congress has undertaken a national discussion about how we deal with 
the inevitable insolvency in the program. And while there are multiple 
plans for reforms, several of my colleagues yesterday offered a 
thoughtful approach.
  The Ryan-Johnson-McCrery-Shaw plan is a good start down the right 
path for form, first and foremost by stopping the raid on the Social 
Security fund, by requiring that any surplus in Social Security taxes 
be returned to the American people in personal savings accounts. The 
plan ensures that Social Security taxes will be used for Social 
Security.

  Let us stop the raid, start the accounts. Let us move forward with 
this commonsense plan.
  I urge all my colleagues to give thoughtful consideration to the 
Ryan-Johnson-McCrery-Shaw plan for beginning the reform of Social 
Security.
