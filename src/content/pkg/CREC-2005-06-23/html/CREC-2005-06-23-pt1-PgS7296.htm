          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      Mr. McCAIN:
  S. 1291. A bill to provide for the acquisition of subsurface mineral 
interests in land owned by the Pascua Yaqui Tribe and land held in 
trust for the Tribe; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.
  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Pascua Yaqui 
Mineral Rights Act of 2005 to provide for acquisition of subsurface 
mineral interests in land owned by the Pascua Yaqui tribe and land held 
in trust for the Tribe.
  The Pascua Yaqui tribe has purchased in fee four parcels of land, 
totaling approximately 436 acres, from the State of Arizona. These 
parcels are adjacent to the Tribe's reservation near Tucson, AZ. The 
Tribe subsequently applied to have these lands taken into trust 
pursuant to the 25 CFR Part 151 process. The Bureau of Indian Affairs 
approved the trust application. However, the State of Arizona objected 
because it still owns the subsurface mineral rights when it conveys its 
Trust lands. Based on the State of Arizona's objection, the Tribe's 
trust application was stayed pending resolution of the mineral rights 
title issue. Arizona law prevents the State from selling these mineral 
interests and I understand that the only way they can be acquired is 
through an act of condemnation brought by the United States pursuant to 
40 U.S.C. Sec. 3113. The State of Arizona has conditionally consented 
to a condemnation action.
  It has since been discovered that an additional 140 acres of the 
reservation was also former State of Arizona trust land that was 
purchased in fee by the Tribe and taken into trust without obtaining 
the mineral estate. The State of Arizona has also conditionally 
consented to a condemnation action with regard to these additional 140 
acres.
  In additional to the mineral interests condemnation, this legislation 
covers another subject. Under 360 acres of the reservation, the United 
States owns the mineral interests for itself, rather than in trust for 
the tribe. Although that acreage was originally purchased in fee, it 
was previously patented by the U.S. and the U.S. retained the mineral 
interests to that property for its own benefit, currently administered 
by the Bureau of Land Management. This legislation would authorize the 
Bureau of Land Management to transfer those mineral interests to the 
U.S., to be held in trust for the Pascua Yaqui tribe.
  The result of the legislation I introduce today would be to allow the 
United States to obtain and/or consolidate ownership of the mineral 
interest only, in its name, in trust for the Pascua Yaqui tribe. These 
mineral interests are under the surface of land already either owned by 
the Pascua Yaqui tribe, or held in trust for the Tribe by the United 
States.
  Finally, under the terms of its current gaming compact with the State 
of Arizona, the Tribe has already constructed the maximum number of 
casinos it can operate on its reservation at this time. This bill will 
not authorize additional reservation casinos.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this 
legislation.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. SANTORUM:
  S. 1292. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a 
credit against income tax for expenses incurred in tele-working; to the 
Committee on Finance.
  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that 
would help people who ``telework'' or work from home, to receive a tax 
credit. Teleworkers are people who work on-line from home--whether a 
few days a week or their entire work schedule--using computers and 
other information technology tools. Nearly 40 million Americans 
telework today, and according to experts, 40 percent of the nation's 
jobs are compatible with telework.
  I am introducing the Telework Tax Incentive Act to provide a $500 tax 
credit for telework. The legislation provides an incentive to encourage 
more employers to consider telework for their employees. Telework 
should be a regular part of the 21st century workplace.
  The best part of telework is that it improves the quality of life for 
everyone--both the employee, the employer and the community. Telework 
reduces traffic congestion and air pollution. It reduces gas 
consumption and our dependency on foreign oil. Encouraging telework is 
good for families--giving working parents the flexibility to meet 
everyday demands. Telework provides people with disabilities greater 
job opportunities. It can also be a good option for retirees and others 
who choose to work part-time.
  A task force on telework initiated by former Virginia Governor James 
Gilmore recommended the establishment of a tax credit toward the 
purchase and installation of electronic and computer equipment that 
allow an employee to telework. For example, the cost of a computer, fax 
machine, modem, phone, printer, software, copier, and other expenses 
necessary to enable telework could count toward a tax credit, provided 
the person worked at home a minimum number of days per year.
  My legislation would provide a $500 tax credit ``for expenses paid or 
incurred under a teleworking arrangement for furnishings and electronic 
information equipment which are used to enable an individual to 
telework.'' An employee must telework a minimum of 75 days per year to 
qualify for the tax credit. Both the employer and employee are eligible 
for the tax credit, but the tax credit goes to whomever absorbs the 
expense for setting up the at-home worksite.
  On October 9, 1999, President Clinton signed into law legislation 
that I introduced in coordination with Representative Frank Wolf from 
Virginia as part of the annual Department of Transportation 
appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2000. S. 1521, the National 
Telecommuting and Air Quality Act, created a pilot program to study the 
feasibility of providing incentives for companies to allow their 
employees to telework in five major metropolitan areas including 
Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, Houston and Denver.
  President Bush signed legislation on July 14, 2000, that included an 
additional $2 million to continue telework efforts in the 5 pilot 
cities, including Philadelphia, to market, implement, and evaluate 
strategies for awarding telecommuting, emissions reduction, and 
pollution credits established through the National Telecommuting and 
Air Quality Act. I am excited that Philadelphia continues to use this 
opportunity to help to get the word out about the benefits of 
telecommuting for many employees and employers.
  Telecommuting improves air quality by reducing pollutants, provides 
employees and families flexibility, reduces traffic congestion, and 
increases productivity and retention rates for businesses while 
reducing their overhead costs. It's a growing opportunity and option 
which we should all include in our effort to maintain and improve 
quality of life issues in Pennsylvania and around the Nation. According 
to statistics available from 1996, the Greater Philadelphia area ranked 
number 10 in the country for annual person-hours of delay due to 
traffic congestion. Because of this reality, all options including 
telecommuting should be pursued to address this challenge.
  The 1999 Telework America National Telework Survey, conducted by Joan 
H. Pratt Associates, found that today's 19.6 million teleworkers 
typically work 9 days per month at home with an average of 3 hours per 
week during normal business hours. Teleworkers seek a blend of job-
related and personal benefits to enable them to better handle their 
work and life responsibilities; however these research findings 
demonstrate the impact on the bottom line for employers as well. 
Employers may save more than $10,000 per telework employee simply from 
reduced absenteeism and increased employee retention. Thus an 
organization with 100 employees, 20 of whom telework, could potentially 
realize a savings of $200,000 annually, or more, when productivity 
gains are added.
  When I introduced this legislation in the 107th Congress, it was 
endorsed by a number of groups including including the International 
Telework Association and Council (ITAC), Covad Communications, National 
Town Builders Association, Litton Industries, Orbital Sciences 
Corporation, Consumer Electronic Association, Capnet, BTG Corporation, 
Electonic Industries Alliance, Telecommunications Industry Association, 
American Automobile Association Mid-Atlantic, Dimensions International 
Inc., Capunet, TManage, Science Applications International Corporation, 
AT&T, Northern Virginia Technology Council, Computer Associates 
Incorporated, and Dyn Corp.
  Work is something you do, not someplace you go. There is nothing 
magical about strapping ourselves into a car and driving sometimes up 
to an hour and a half, arriving at a workplace and sitting before a 
computer, when we can access the same information from a computer in 
our homes. Wouldn't it be great if we could replace the evening rush 
hour commute with time spent with the family, coaching little league or 
volunteering at a local charity?
  I urge my colleagues to consider cosponsoring this legislation that 
promotes telework and helps encourage additional employee choices for 
the workplace.
                                 6_____
                                 
      By Mr. BUNNING (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Lott, Mr. Smith, and 
        Mrs. Lincoln):
  S. 1293. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit 
the consolidation of life insurance companies with other companies; to 
the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to 
allow affiliated life and non-life insurance companies to file 
consolidated tax returns. The current outdated rules do not allow such 
consolidation.
  Consolidated return provisions under current law were enacted so that 
the members of an affiliated group of corporations could file a single 
tax return. The right to file a ``consolidated'' return is generally 
available to businesses of all natures conducted by the affiliated 
corporations. The purpose behind consolidated returns is simply to tax 
a complete business as a whole rather than its component parts 
individually. Whether an enterprise's businesses are operated as 
divisions within

[[Page S7298]]

one corporation or as subsidiary corporations with a common parent 
company, a business entity should generally be taxed as a single entity 
and be allowed to file its return accordingly.
  Corporate groups which include life insurance companies are denied 
the ability to file a single consolidated return until they have been 
affiliated for at least 5 years. Even after this 5-year period, they 
are subject to two additional limitations that are not applicable to 
any other type of group. First, non-life insurance companies must be 
members of the affiliated group for five years before their losses may 
be used to offset life insurance company income. Second, non-life 
insurance affiliate losses, including current year losses and any 
carryover losses, that may offset life insurance company taxable income 
are limited to the lesser of 35 percent of life insurance company's 
taxable income or 35 percent of the non-life insurance company's 
losses.
  There are no clear reasons why affiliated groups that include life 
insurance companies are denied the same unrestricted ability to file 
consolidated returns that is available to other financial 
intermediaries, and corporations in general. Allowing members of an 
affiliated group of corporations to file a consolidated return prevents 
the business enterprise's structure from obscuring the fact that the 
true gain or loss of the business enterprise is the conglomeration of 
each of the members of the affiliated group. The limitations contained 
in current law are clearly without policy justification and should be 
repealed.
  Our legislation will repeal the two 5-year limitations for taxable 
years beginning after this year, and it will phase out the 35 percent 
limitation over 7 years. The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation 
has recommended repeal of two of the three limitations addressed by my 
bill on the grounds of needless complexity. The third limitation is, in 
effect, merely a minimum tax on life insurance company income. That 
limitation should have been repealed when the alternative minimum tax 
was enacted, and certainly has no place in the current tax laws. I 
should also note that Congress included in the tax cut vetoed by then-
President Clinton in 1999 much of what is contained in this 
legislation.
  I thank Senators Conrad, Lott, Smith and Lincoln for joining me in 
sponsoring this legislation. We hope you will join us as cosponsors of 
this bipartisan, much-needed legislation.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. McCain):
  S. 1294. A bill to amend the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to 
preserve and protect the ability of local governments to provide 
broadband capability and services; to the Committee on Commerce, 
Science, and Transportation.
  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Community 
Broadband Act of 2005.'' I am pleased to be joined in this effort by 
Senator McCain of Arizona.
  This legislation will promote economic development, enhance public 
safety, increase educational opportunities, and improve the lives of 
citizens in areas of the country that either do not have access to 
broadband or live in a location where the cost for broadband is simply 
not affordable.
  A recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development shows that the United States has dropped to 12th place 
worldwide in the percentage of people with broadband connections. Many 
of the countries ahead of the United States have successfully combined 
public and private efforts to deploy municipal networks that connect 
their citizens and businesses with high-speed Internet services.
  It is in this context that President Bush has called for universal 
and affordable broadband in the United States by the year 2007. If we 
are going to meet President Bush's goals, we must not enact barriers to 
broadband development and access. Unfortunately, fourteen States have 
passed legislation to prohibit or significantly restrict the ability of 
local municipalities and communities to offer high-speed Internet to 
their citizens. More States are considering such legislation. The 
``Community Broadband Act'' is in response to those efforts by States 
to tell local communities that they cannot establish networks for their 
citizens even in communities that either have no access to broadband or 
where access is prohibitively expensive.
  The ``Community Broadband Act'' is a simple bill. It says that no 
State can prohibit a municipality from offering high-speed Internet to 
its citizens; and when a municipality is a provider, it cannot abuse 
its governmental authority as regulator to discriminate against private 
competitors. Furthermore, a municipality must comply with Federal and 
state telecommunications laws.
  Mr. President, this bill will allow communities to make broadband 
decisions that could: Improve their economy and create jobs by serving 
as a medium for development, particularly in rural and underserved 
urban areas; aid public safety and first responders by ensuring access 
to network services while on the road and in the community; strengthen 
our country's international competitiveness by giving businesses the 
means to compete more effectively locally, nationally, and 
internationally; encourage long-distance education through video 
conferencing and other means of sharing knowledge and enhancing 
learning via the Internet; and create incentives for public-private 
partnerships.
  A century ago, there were efforts to prevent local governments from 
offering electricity. Opponents argued that local governments didn't 
have the expertise to offer something as complex as electricity. They 
also argued that businesses would suffer if they faced competition from 
cities and towns. But local community leaders recognized that their 
economic survival depended on electrifying their communities. They knew 
that it would take both private investment and public investment to 
bring electricity to all Americans.
  We face a similar situation today. Municipal networks can play an 
essential role in making broadband access universal and affordable. We 
must not put up barriers to this possibility of municipal involvement 
in broadband deployment.
  Some local governments will decide to do this; others will not. Let 
me be clear this is not going to be the right decision for every 
municipality. But there are clearly examples of municipalities that 
need to provide broadband, and those municipalities should have the 
power to do so.
  Today's Wall Street Journal notes the small town of Granbury, TX, 
population 6,400, that initiated a wireless network after waiting years 
for private industry to take an interest. In Scottsburg, IN, a city and 
its 6000 residents north of Louisville, KY, could not get broadband 
from an incumbent telephone company. When two important businesses 
threatened to leave unless they could obtain broadband connectivity, 
municipal officials stepped forward to provide wireless broadband 
throughout the town. The town retained the two businesses and gained 
much more. There are many Granburys and Scottsburgs across the country.
  There are also underserved urban areas, where private providers may 
exist, but many in the community simply cannot afford the high prices. 
Dianah Neff, Philadelphia's chief information officer, knows this all 
too well. ``The digital divide is local,'' Neff has said, commenting 
that while 90 percent Philadelphia's affluent neighborhoods have 
broadband, just 25 percent in low-income areas have broadband. When the 
city of Philadelphia announced plans for wireless access, it 
immediately faced opposition and the Pennsylvania legislature passed 
legislation to counter this municipal power.
  Community broadband networks have the potential to create jobs, spur 
economic development, and bring a 21st century utility to everyone. I 
hope my colleagues will join Senator McCain and me in our effort to 
enact the Community Broadband Act of 2005.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1294

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Broadband Act of 
     2005''.

[[Page S7299]]

     SEC. 2. COMMUNITY BROADBAND CAPABILITY AND SERVICES.

       Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (47 
     U.S.C. 157 note) is amended--
       (1) by redesignating subsection (c) as subsection (d) and 
     inserting after subsection (b) the following:
       ``(c) Local Government Provision of Advanced 
     Telecommunications Capability and Services.--
       ``(1) In general.--No State statute, regulation, or other 
     State legal requirement may prohibit or have the effect of 
     prohibiting any public provider from providing, to any person 
     or any public or private entity, advanced telecommunications 
     capability or any service that utilizes the advanced 
     telecommunications capability provided by such provider.
       ``(2) Antidiscrimination safeguards.--To the extent any 
     public provider regulates competing private providers of 
     advanced telecommunications capability or services, it shall 
     apply its ordinances and rules without discrimination in 
     favor of itself or any advanced telecommunications services 
     provider that it owns.
       ``(3) Savings clause.--Nothing in this section shall exempt 
     a public provider from any Federal or State 
     telecommunications law or regulation that applies to all 
     providers of advanced telecommunications capability or 
     services using such advanced telecommunications 
     capability.''; and
       (2) by adding at the end of subsection (d), as 
     redesignated, the following:
       ``(3) Public provider.--The term `public provider' means a 
     State or political subdivision thereof, any agency, 
     authority, or instrumentality of a State or political 
     subdivision thereof, or an Indian tribe (as defined in 
     section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and Education 
     Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450b(e)), that provides advanced 
     telecommunications capability, or any service that utilizes 
     such advanced telecommunications capability, to any person or 
     public or private entity.''.
  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in sponsoring the 
Community Broadband Act of 2005. In the simplest of terms, this bill 
would ensure that any town, city, or county that wishes to offer high-
speed Internet services to its citizens can do so. The bill also would 
ensure fairness by requiring municipalities that offer high-speed 
Internet services do so in compliance with all Federal and State 
telecommunications laws and in a nondiscriminatory manner.
  This bill is needed if we are to meet President Bush's call for 
``universal, affordable access for broadband technology by the year 
2007.'' When President Bush announced this nationwide goal in 2004, the 
country was ranked 10th in the world for high-speed Internet 
penetration. Today, the country is ranked 16th. This is unacceptable 
for a country that should lead the world in technical innovation, 
economic development, and international competitiveness.
  Many of the countries outpacing the United States in the deployment 
of high-speed Internet services, including Canada, Japan, and South 
Korea, have successfully combined municipal systems with privately 
deployed networks to wire their countries. As a country, we cannot 
afford to cut off any successful strategy if we want to remain 
internationally competitive.
  I recognize that our Nation has a long and successful history of 
private investment in critical communications infrastructure. That 
history must be respected, protected, and continued. However, when 
private industry does not answer the call because of market failures or 
other obstacles, it is appropriate and even commendable, for the people 
acting through their local governments to improve their lives by 
investing in their own future. In many rural towns, the local 
government's high-speed Internet offering may be its citizens only 
option to access the World Wide Web.
  Despite this situation, a few incumbent providers of traditional 
telecommunications services have attempted to stop local government 
deployment of community high speed Internet services. The bill would do 
nothing to limit their ability to compete. In fact, the bill would 
provide them an incentive to enter more rural areas and deploy services 
in partnership with local governments. This partnership will not only 
reduce the costs to private firms, but also ensure wider deployment of 
rural services. Additionally, the bill would aid private providers by 
prohibiting a municipality when acting as both ``regulator'' and 
``competitor'' from discriminating against competitors in favor of 
itself.
  Several newspapers have endorsed the concept of allowing 
municipalities to choose whether to offer high speed Internet services. 
USA Today rightfully questioned in an editorial, ``Why shouldn't 
citizens be able to use their own resources to help themselves?'' The 
Washington Post editorialized that the offering of high speed Internet 
services by localities is, ``. . . the sort of municipal experiment we 
hope will spread.'' The San Jose Mercury News stated that a ban on 
localities ability to offer such services is ``bad for consumers, bad 
for technology and bad for America's hopes of catching up to other 
countries in broadband deployment.'' Finally, the Tampa Tribune 
lectured Federal and State legislators, ``don't prohibit local elected 
officials from providing a service their communities need.''
  My home State of Arizona boasts the largest approved municipal 
broadband system in the United States, for example. The city of Tempe's 
wireless system will serve all of the city's 40 square miles and a 
population of 159,000, including the campus of Arizona State 
University. Citizens will have Internet access from anywhere at any 
time, and police, fire, water and traffic services personnel will use 
the system to enhance their efficiency.
  In addition to Tempe, several Native American tribal governments 
offer high-speed Internet access services to their citizens. This bill 
would ensure that such offerings could continue to assist Indian 
country and their ability to connect to the Internet.
  Our country faces some real challenges. We need to find ways to use 
technology to help our citizens better compete. We need to help our 
businesses capitalize on their ingenuity so that they can become more 
internationally competitive. That is why we need to do all we can to 
eliminate barriers to competition and create incentives for the 
delivery of high-speed Internet services for public suppliers of 
broadband services, private suppliers of broadband services, and 
public-private partnerships as well.
  I hope my colleagues will join us in sponsoring the Community 
Broadband Act of 2005.

      By Mr. McCAIN:
  S. 1295. A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act to provide 
for accountability and funding of the National Indian Gaming 
Commission; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.
  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the National 
Indian Gaming Commission Accountability Act of 2005 to amend provisions 
of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act regarding NIGC funding and 
accountability.
  The Indian gaming industry has undergone tremendous growth since the 
enactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988. The regulatory 
responsibilities of the NIGC, the Federal agency responsible for 
oversight of the industry, has likewise grown. In recent years the 
NIGC's budgeting needs have consistently exceeded the $8 million 
statutory cap, necessitating short-term authorizations to exceed the 
cap to enable it to adequately enforce the Act.
  Rather than merely raising the cap on funding, this legislation 
amends IGRA's equation for funding the NIGC by allowing the funding to 
adjust in direct proportion to the revenues of the Indian gaming 
industry, with funding expanding or contracting as the Indian gaming 
industry grows or recedes. Under that equation--which provides that 
fees cannot exceed .08 percent of gross gaming revenues--the NIGC's 
budget for fiscal 2007 would be capped at approximately $14.5 million.
  As the agency's needs have grown, so has the scrutiny of the 
regulated community and affected parties. It is therefore appropriate 
that the agency's budgetary choices and program plans be subject to 
transparency. Therefore, this legislation increases not only the 
agency's funding, but also its accountability by directing that the 
NIGC be subject to the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA). 
As a result, the agency would be required to develop a Strategic Plan, 
and annual performance plans and performance reports, all of which will 
provide critical information to the regulated stakeholders.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle to enact this timely and balanced legislation. I ask unanimous 
consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. Landrieu):
  S. 1297. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to 
reduce the work hours and increase the supervision of resident 
physicians to ensure the safety of patients and resident-physicians 
themselves; to the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce my 
legislation, the Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of 
2005, to limit medical resident work hours to 80 hours a week and to 
provide real protections for patients and resident physicians who are 
negatively affected by excessive work hours. I feel strongly that as 
Congress begins to consider proposals to reduce medical malpractice 
premiums and improve quality of care, we must consider the role that 
excessive work hours play in exacerbating medical liability problems 
and reducing quality of care.
  It is very troubling that hospitals across the Nation are requiring 
young doctors to work 36 hour shifts and as many as 120 hours a week in 
order to complete their residency programs. These long hours lead to a 
deterioration of cognitive function similar to the effects of blood 
alcohol levels of 0.1 percent. This is a level of cognitive impairment 
that would make these doctors unsafe to drive--yet these physicians are 
not only allowed but in fact are required to care for patients and 
perform procedures on patients under these conditions. In fact, a study 
by Harvard Medical School researchers published in the October 28, 2004 
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine found that medical 
residents made 35.9 percent more serious medical errors when they 
worked extended shifts of more than 24 hours.
  The Patient and Physician Safety and Protection Act of 2005 will 
limit medical resident work hours to 80 hours a week. Not 40 hours or 
60 hours--80 hours a week. It is hard to argue that this standard is 
excessively strict. In fact, it is unconscionable that we now have 
resident physicians, or any physicians for that matter, caring for very 
sick patients 120 hours a week and 36 hours straight with fewer than 10 
hours between shifts. This is an outrageous violation of a patient's 
right to quality care.
  In addition to limiting work hours to 80 hours week, my bill limits 
the length of any one shift to 24 consecutive hours, while allowing for 
up to three hours of patient transition time, and limits the length of 
an emergency room shift to 12 hours. The bill also ensures that 
residents have at least one out of seven days off and `on-call' shifts 
no more often than every third night.

  Since I first introduced the Patient and Physician Safety and 
Protection Act in the 107th Congress, the medical community and the 
Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, ACGME, 
specifically have taken critical steps to address the problem of 
excessive work hours. On July 1, 2003, the ACGME issued resident work-
hour guidelines aimed at addressing this important issue. While I 
commend ACGME leadership for taking the initiative, I remain very 
concerned that the ACGME's policy lacks the enforcement mechanisms that 
are essential to ensure compliance with the new work hour rules. The 
ACGME's only sanction against hospitals that overwork residents or 
provide inadequate supervision is the threat of lost accreditation of 
residency programs. Medical residents who have already ``matched'' into 
a program and invested years there are understandably reluctant to 
report violations that might result in the closure of their residency. 
Furthermore, the ACGME usually gives hospital administrators 90-100 
days notice before inspecting a residency program. While the ACGME 
policy establishes more stringent work hours regulations, it fails to 
create effective enforcement and oversight tools. These rules are 
meaningless without enforcement mechanisms.
  That is why Federal legislation is necessary. The Patient and 
Physician Safety and Protection Act of 2005 not only recognizes the 
problem of excessive work hours, but also creates strong enforcement 
mechanisms. The bill also provides funding support to teaching 
hospitals to implement new work hour standards. Without enforcement and 
financial support, efforts to reduce work hours are not likely to be 
successful.
  Finally, my legislation provides meaningful enforcement mechanisms 
that will protect the identity of resident physicians who file 
complaints about work hour violations. The ACGME's guidelines do not 
contain any whistleblower protections for residents that seek to report 
program violations. Without this important protection, residents will 
be reluctant to report these violations, which in turn will weaken 
enforcement.
  My legislation also makes compliance with these work hour 
requirements a condition of Medicare participation. Each year, Congress 
provides $8 billion to teaching hospitals to train new physicians. 
While Congress must continue to vigorously support adequate funding so 
that teaching hospitals are able to carryout this important public 
service, these hospitals must also make a commitment to ensuring safe 
work conditions for these physicians and providing the highest quality 
of care to the patients they treat.
  In closing I would like to read a quote from an Orthopedic Surgery 
Resident from Northern California, which I think illustrates why we 
need this legislation.
  I quote, ``I was operating post-call after being up for over 36 hours 
and was holding retractors. I literally fell asleep standing up and 
nearly face-planted into the wound. My upper arm hit the side of the 
gurney, and I caught myself before I fell to the floor. I nearly put my 
face in the open wound, which would have contaminated the entire field 
and could have resulted in an infection for the patient.''
  This is a very serious problem that must be addressed before medical 
errors like this occur. I hope every member of the Senate will consider 
this legislation and the potential it has to reduce medical errors, 
improve patient care, and create a safer working environment for the 
backbone of our Nation's healthcare system.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1297

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient and Physician Safety 
     and Protection Act of 2005''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) The Federal Government, through the medicare program, 
     pays approximately $8,000,000,000 per year solely to train 
     resident-physicians in the United States, and as a result, 
     has an interest in assuring the safety of patients treated by 
     resident-physicians and the safety of resident-physicians 
     themselves.
       (2) Resident-physicians spend as much as 30 to 40 percent 
     of their time performing activities not related to the 
     educational mission of training competent physicians.
       (3) The excessive numbers of hours worked by resident-
     physicians is inherently dangerous for patient care and for 
     the lives of resident-physicians.
       (4) The scientific literature has consistently demonstrated 
     that the sleep deprivation of the magnitude seen in residency 
     training programs leads to cognitive impairment.
       (5) A substantial body of research indicates that excessive 
     hours worked by resident-physicians lead to higher rates of 
     medical error, motor vehicle accidents, depression, and 
     pregnancy complications.

[[Page S7302]]

       (6) The medical community has not adequately addressed the 
     issue of excessive resident-physician work hours.
       (7) The Federal Government has regulated the work hours of 
     other industries when the safety of employees or the public 
     is at risk.
       (8) The Institute of Medicine has found that as many as 
     98,000 deaths occur annually due to medical errors and has 
     suggested that 1 necessary approach to reducing errors in 
     hospitals is reducing the fatigue of resident-physicians.

     SEC. 3. REVISION OF MEDICARE HOSPITAL CONDITIONS OF 
                   PARTICIPATION REGARDING WORKING HOURS OF 
                   MEDICAL RESIDENTS, INTERNS, AND FELLOWS.

       (a) In General.--Section 1866 of the Social Security Act 
     (42 U.S.C. 1395cc) is amended--
       (1) in subsection (a)(1)--
       (A) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (U);
       (B) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (V) 
     and inserting ``, and''; and
       (C) by inserting after subparagraph (V) the following new 
     subparagraph:
       ``(W) in the case of a hospital that uses the services of 
     postgraduate trainees (as defined in subsection (k)(4)), to 
     meet the requirements of subsection (k).''; and
       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
       ``(k)(1)(A) In order that the working conditions and 
     working hours of postgraduate trainees promote the provision 
     of quality medical care in hospitals, as a condition of 
     participation under this title, each hospital shall establish 
     the following limits on working hours for postgraduate 
     trainees:
       ``(i) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), postgraduate

     designate an individual within the Department of Health and 
     Human Services to handle all complaints of violations that 
     arise from a postgraduate trainee (as defined in paragraph

     by subsection (a), who reports that the hospital operating 
     the medical residency training program for which the trainee 
     is enrolled is in violation of the requirements of such 
     section.
       (2) Grievance rights.--A postgraduate trainee may file a 
     complaint with the Secretary concerning a violation of the 
     requirements under such section 1886(k). Such a complaint may 
     be filed anonymously. The Secretary may conduct an

     training program operated by the hospital in any 6-month 
     period. The provisions of section 1128A of the Social 
     Security Act (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply 
     to civil money penalties under this paragraph in the same 
     manner as they apply to a penalty or proceeding under section

       (B) Corrective action plan.--The Secretary shall establish 
     procedures for providing a hospital that is subject to a

     individual designated under paragraph (1) shall--
       (A) provide for annual anonymous surveys of postgraduate 
     trainees to determine compliance with the requirements under 
     such section 1886(k) and for the disclosure of the results of 
     such surveys to the public on a medical residency training 
     program specific basis;
       (B) based on such surveys, conduct appropriate on-site 
     investigations;

     compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, 
     who in good faith (as defined in paragraph (2)), individually 
     or in conjunction with another person or persons--
       (A) reports a violation or suspected violation of such

     shall take effect on the first July 1 that begins at least 1

     SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR HOSPITAL COSTS.

       There are hereby appropriated to the Secretary of Health 
     and Human Services such amounts as may be required to provide 
     for additional payments to hospitals for their reasonable 
     additional, incremental costs incurred in order to comply 
     with the requirements imposed by this Act (and the amendments 
     made by this Act).
  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today about a 
very serious issue that is threatening the disbursal of justice in the 
western United States.
  My home State of Nevada, along with eight other States, has been part 
of an unbelievable population boom over the last several decades. As a 
result, we face the frustrating challenges of increased traffic 
congestion, crowded schools, and a shortage of many services. However, 
there is one consequence of that growth that has reached a critical 
level because it is delaying and denying justice for too many 
Americans.
  That is the situation with the Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. The largest circuit in the country, it encompasses 20 percent 
of the entire Nation's population. The Ninth Circuit has the highest 
cases per jurist ratio. And the trend is not changing. The Circuit is 
just too large. Each of the States covered by the Ninth Circuit saw 
population growths over the last decade, and three of the States--
Nevada, Idaho, and Arizona--are in the top five in the country for 
population growth. Something must be done, or the Ninth Circuit will 
continue to bust at the seams.
  That is why I am introducing legislation today that would divide the 
current Ninth Circuit into 3 new circuits. The new Ninth Circuit would 
include California, Hawaii, Guam, and the Northern Marianas Islands. 
The new

[[Page S7303]]

Twelfth Circuit would be comprised of Arizona, Nevada, Idaho, and 
Montana. And the new Thirteenth Circuit would contain Oregon, 
Washington, and Alaska.
  This splitting of the Ninth Circuit is absolutely necessary if the 
residents of Nevada and the other western states are to have equal 
access to justice. Right now, citizens living under the Ninth Circuit 
face incomparable delays and judicial inconsistencies. Recently, the 
Ninth Circuit had more cases pending for more than one year than all 
other circuits combined.
  And because of the sheer magnitude of the number of judges in the 
Ninth Circuit, it has become increasingly difficult for judges to track 
the opinions of the other judges in the circuit. In fact, it happened 
that on the same day, 2 different 3-judge panels in the Ninth Circuit 
issued different legal standards to resolve the same issue. Can you 
imagine the headache this causes for district judges who are supposed 
to follow the standard set by the Ninth Circuit? It compromises the 
system of justice that is the cornerstone of our democracy.
  As a Nevadan, I am also angered by some of the decisions made by the 
Ninth Circuit Court. I know how Nevadans feel about issues such as the 
Pledge of Allegiance. Like me, they were outraged that the phrase 
``under God'' was ruled unconstitutional by the Ninth Circuit. This 
wasn't the only case of the Ninth Circuit misinterpreting the 
Constitution and our laws. In 1997 alone, the United States Supreme 
Court overruled 27 out of 28 Ninth Circuit decisions. I wish I could 
say that was just an ``off' year for the court, but their track record 
wasn't much better in the 6 years before that.
  Rather than continue down this path of judicial destruction, it is 
time to use a forward looking approach to the access of justice in the 
western United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in our 
Constitutional duty to establish courts for the sake of justice in this 
country. Failure to act will cost the citizens of my state, and many 
other western states, dearly.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. DeMINT (for himself, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Graham, Mr. Crapo, 
        Mr. Coburn, Mr. Sununu, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. 
        Lott, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Craig).
  S. 1302. A bill to amend the Social Security Act and the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to stop the Congress from spending Social Security 
surpluses on other Government programs by dedicating those surpluses to 
personal accounts that can only be used to pay Social Security 
benefits; to the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it's time to stop the raid on Social 
Security. For over twenty years, Congress has maintained the misguided 
practice of over-collecting Social Security taxes and spending them on 
other government programs. Congress has used the Social Security Trust 
Fund to promote the false notion that Social Security actually saves 
the money workers pay in, and it is time to end this abusive practice. 
It is time we start saving these resources in personal accounts that 
politicians cannot spend.
  Money cannot have 2 masters--it either belongs to the government or 
to individual Americans. The only way to prevent Congress from spending 
Social Security surpluses is to rebate these funds back to a worker in 
a personal account with their name on it. The only true lock-box is a 
personal account.
  President Bush has done a good job helping Americans understand the 
problem. Now it is up to Congress to build consensus around some 
solutions. Every American and nearly everyone in Congress agree on at 
least one core principle: Social Security money should only be spent on 
Social Security. Before we can have an honest debate on long-term 
solutions, we must restore trust with Americans.
  Stopping the raid will strengthen Social Security and is the first 
step toward long-term reform.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1302

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) President Franklin Roosevelt's January 17, 1935, 
     message on Social Security declared that, ``First, the system 
     adopted, except for the money necessary to initiate it, 
     should be self-sustaining in the sense that funds for the 
     payment of insurance benefits should not come from the 
     proceeds of general taxation.''.
       (2) Social Security's financial integrity is maintained by 
     requiring that benefit payments do not exceed the program's 
     dedicated tax revenues and the interest earned on the 
     balances in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust 
     Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund over the 
     long term.
       (3) The separation of Social Security from other budget 
     accounts also serves to protect Social Security benefits from 
     competing against other Federal programs for its funding 
     resources.
       (4) Comprehensive reforms should be enacted to--
       (A) fix Social Security permanently;
       (B) ensure that any use of general revenues for the program 
     is temporary; and
       (C) provide for the eventual repayment of any revenue 
     transfers from the general fund to the Federal Old-Age and 
     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability 
     Insurance Trust Fund.

     72(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) commences on

     substantially equal annual payments, subject to adjustment as 
     provided in subsection (d), payable monthly to the 
     participating individual during the life of the participating

     subsection, the term `minimum annuity amount' means an amount 
     equal to 100 percent of the poverty line for an individual 
     (determined under the poverty guidelines of the Department of 
     Health and Human Services issued under sections 652 and 
     673(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981).

     described in subsection (b) shall include provision for 
     increases in the monthly annuity amounts thereunder 
     determined in the same manner and at the same rate as primary

     accepted actuarial assumptions, except that no 
     differentiation shall be made in such assumptions on the 
     basis of sex, race, health status, or other characteristics 
     other than age. Such assumptions may include, for 
     determinations made prior to 2009, an assumed interest rate 
     reflecting investment earnings of the Federal Old-Age and 
     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund.

     provision of this title, in the case of a participating

     individual determined under subsection (a) shall be reduced 
     so that the amount of such monthly old-age insurance benefits 
     payable to the individual does not exceed the amount equal to 
     the difference between--
       ``(i) such monthly old-age insurance benefits (determined 
     without regard to a reduction under this subsection); and
       ``(ii) the ratio of--

       ``(I) what would have been the monthly annuity payment 
     payable to the individual from an annuity if the individual's 
     personal retirement account balance had earned the rate of 
     return specified in section 254(b)(2)(A); to
       ``(II) the expected present value of all future potential 
     benefits payable under section 202 on the basis of the wages 
     or self-employment income of the participating individual

     becomes entitled to old-age benefits under section 202(a)).

      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. 
        Corzine, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. Kerry):
  S. 1303. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to guarantee 
comprehensive health care coverage for all children born after 2006; to 
the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my friends and 
colleagues--Senators Reed, Lautenberg, Corzine, Sarbanes, and Kerry--to 
introduce an important piece of legislation, the MediKids Health 
Insurance Act of 2005. This legislation will provide health insurance 
for every child in the United States by 2012, regardless of family 
income. My long-time friend from California, Congressman Stark, is 
introducing a companion bill in the House. He has worked tirelessly to 
improve access to health care for all Americans, and I am pleased to be 
joining him once again to advocate on behalf of America's children.
  We have introduced this legislation in each of the last three 
Congresses because we know how vital health insurance is to a child. 
Children with untreated illnesses are less likely to learn and 
therefore less likely to move out of poverty. Such children have an 
inherent disadvantage when it comes to being productive members of 
society. We can have a positive impact on our children's lives today as 
well as tomorrow by guaranteeing health insurance coverage for all. 
Children are inexpensive to insure, but the rewards for providing them 
with health care during their early education and development years are 
enormous.
  Despite the well-documented benefits of providing health insurance 
coverage for children, there are still over 8 million uninsured 
children in America. We can and must do better. Our children are our 
future. No child in this country should ever be without access to 
health care. This is why I am proud to reintroduce the MediKids Health 
Insurance Act of 2005.
  This legislation is a clear investment in our future--our children. 
Every child would be automatically enrolled at birth into a new, 
comprehensive Federal safety net health insurance program beginning in 
2007. The benefits would be tailored to meet the needs of children and 
would be similar to those currently available to children through the 
Medicaid Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) 
program. Families below 150 percent of poverty would have no premiums 
or co-payments, and there would be no cost sharing for preventive or 
well-child visits for any child.
  MediKids children would remain enrolled in the program throughout 
childhood. When families move to another state, Medikids would be 
available until parents can enroll their children in a new insurance 
program. Between jobs or during family crises, Medikids would offer 
extra security and ensure continuous health coverage to our Nation's 
children. During that critical period when a family is just climbing 
out of poverty and out of the eligibility range for means-tested 
assistance programs, MediKids would fill in the gaps until the parents 
can move into jobs that provide reliable health insurance coverage. The 
key to our program is that whenever other sources of health insurance 
fail, MediKids would stand ready to cover the health needs of our next 
generation. Ultimately, every child in America would be able to grow up 
with consistent, continuous health insurance coverage.
  Like Medicare, MediKids would be independently financed, would cover 
benefits tailored to the needs of its target population, and would have 
the goal of achieving nearly 100 percent health insurance coverage for 
the children of this country--just as Medicare has done for our 
Nation's seniors and disabled population over its 40-year history. At 
the time we created Medicare, seniors were more likely to be living in 
poverty than any other age group. Most were unable to afford needed 
medical services and unable to find health insurance in the market even 
if they could afford it. Today, it is our Nation's children who 
shoulder the burden of poverty. Children in America are nearly twice as 
vulnerable to poverty as adults. It's time we make a significant 
investment in the future of America by guaranteeing all children the 
health coverage they need to make a healthy start in life.
  Congress cannot rest on the success we achieved by expanding Medicaid 
and passing the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). 
Although each was a remarkable step toward reducing the ranks of the 
uninsured, particularly uninsured children, we still have a long way to 
go. Even with perfect enrollment in CHIP and Medicaid, there would 
still be a great number of children without health insurance. What's 
more troubling is the fact that both Medicaid and CHIP are in serious 
jeopardy because of the budget cuts being proposed by the current 
Administration.
  It's long past time to rekindle the discussion about how we are going 
to provide health insurance for all Americans. The bill we are 
introducing today--the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2005--is a step 
toward eliminating the irrational and tragic lack of health insurance 
for so many children and adults in our country. I urge my colleagues to 
move beyond partisan politics and to support this critical step toward 
universal coverage.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1303

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; FINDINGS.

       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``MediKids 
     Health Insurance Act of 2005''.
       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act 
     is as follows:

Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents; findings
Sec. 2. Benefits for all children born after 2006

                     ``TITLE XXII--MEDIKIDS PROGRAM

``Sec. 2201. Eligibility
``Sec. 2202. Benefits
``Sec. 2203. Premiums

``Sec. 2205. Oversight and accountability

Sec. 3. MediKids premium
Sec. 4. Refundable credit for cost-sharing expenses under MediKids 
              program
Sec. 5. Report on long-term revenues

       (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       (1) More than 9 million American children are uninsured.
       (2) Children who are uninsured receive less medical care 
     and less preventive care and have a poorer level of health, 
     which result in

[[Page S7309]]

     lifetime costs to themselves and to the entire American 
     economy.
       (3) Although SCHIP and Medicaid are successfully extending 
     a health coverage safety net to a growing portion of the 
     vulnerable low-income population of uninsured children, they 
     alone cannot achieve 100 percent health insurance coverage 
     for our nation's children due to inevitable gaps during 
     outreach and enrollment, fluctuations in eligibility, 
     variations in access to private insurance at all income 
     levels, and variations in States' ability to provide required 
     matching funds.
       (4) As all segments of society continue to become more 
     transient, with many changes in employment over the working 
     lifetime of parents, the need for a reliable safety net of 
     health insurance which follows children across State lines, 
     already a major problem for the children of migrant and 
     seasonal farmworkers, will become a major concern for all 
     families in the United States.
       (5) The medicare program has successfully evolved over the 
     years to provide a stable, universal source of health 
     insurance for the nation's disabled and those over age 65, 
     and provides a tested model for designing a program to reach 
     out to America's children.
       (6) The problem of insuring 100 percent of all American 
     children could be gradually solved by automatically enrolling 
     all children born after December 31, 2006, in a program 
     modeled after Medicare (and to be known as ``MediKids''), and 
     allowing those children to be transferred into other 
     equivalent or better insurance programs, including either 
     private insurance, SCHIP, or Medicaid, if they are eligible 
     to do so, but maintaining the child's default enrollment in 
     MediKids for any times when the child's access to other 
     sources of insurance is lost.
       (7) A family's freedom of choice to use other insurers to 
     cover children would not be interfered with in any way, and 
     children eligible for SCHIP and Medicaid would continue to be 
     enrolled in those programs, but the underlying safety net of 
     MediKids would always be available to cover any gaps in 
     insurance due to changes in medical condition, employment, 
     income, or marital status, or other changes affecting a 
     child's access to alternate forms of insurance.
       (8) The MediKids program can be administered without 
     impacting the finances or status of the existing Medicare 
     program.
       (9) The MediKids benefit package can be tailored to the 
     special needs of children and updated over time.
       (10) The financing of the program can be administered 
     without difficulty by a yearly payment of affordable premiums 
     through a family's tax filing (or adjustment of a family's 
     earned income tax credit).
       (11) The cost of the program will gradually rise as the 
     number of children using MediKids as the insurer of last 
     resort increases, and a future Congress always can accelerate 
     or slow down the enrollment process as desired, while the 
     societal costs for emergency room usage, lost productivity 
     and work days, and poor health status for the next generation 
     of Americans will decline.
       (12) Over time 100 percent of American children will always 
     have basic health insurance, and we can therefore expect a 
     healthier, more equitable, and more productive society.

                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. 
        Feingold, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Dayton):
  S. 1304. A bill to amend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to protect pension 
benefits of employees in defined benefit plans and to direct the 
Secretary of the Treasury to enforce the age discrimination 
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of 
legislation to fix a huge oversight in pension policy.
  In the early 1990s, a large number of U.S. companies began a process 
of switching their traditional defined benefit pension plans to what's 
referred to as ``cash balance'' pension plans. A cash balance pension 
is insured, like a traditional plan, through the PBGC. However, it 
looks more like a defined contribution plan to participants because the 
benefit is expressed as some percent of play plus some guaranteed 
interest rate. This isn't necessarily a bad idea, in and of itself. 
However, in practice, many of the employees working for these companies 
were not told what these changes would mean for them. Some companies 
had their employees work for years without earning any more benefits. 
Many of those employees didn't figure that out for a very long time. 
Unfortunately, their lack of understanding in this situation was a key 
benefit to management. However, once they figured out what was 
happening, the retirees were furious.
  As two consultants who helped put these plans together said at an 
Actuaries conference in 1998:

       ``I've been involved in cash balance plans five or six 
     years down the road and what I have found is that while 
     employees understand it, it is not until they are actually 
     ready to retire that they understand how little they are 
     actually getting.''
       ``Right, but they're happy while they're employed.''

  One of the most abusive practices in cash balance conversions is 
known as ``wear away. `` The company freezes the value of the benefits 
employees already earned, which by law cannot be taken away once given. 
However, the employer opens a cash balance account for that worker at a 
much lower dollar level. So they end up working for years contributing 
to this lower cash balance account, not realizing that contribution is 
meaningless because their old benefits were higher. At the same time, 
younger workers do get money added to their account every day. This is 
clearly age discrimination, and bad pension policy.
  In 1999, I introduced a bill to make it illegal for corporations to 
wear away the benefits of older workers during conversions to cash 
balance plans. I offered my bill as an amendment. Forty-eight Senators, 
including 3 Republicans, voted to waive the budget point of order so we 
could consider this amendment. We did not have enough votes then, but I 
believe the tide is turning.
  After that vote, more and more stories came out about how many 
workers were losing their pensions. In September of 1999, the Secretary 
of the Treasury put a moratorium on conversions from defined benefit 
plans to cash balance plans. That moratorium has

[[Page S7313]]

been in effect now for over three years. In April of 2000, I offered a 
Sense-of-the-Senate resolution to stop this practice, and it passed the 
Senate unanimously.
  There are hundreds of age discrimination complaints currently pending 
before the EEOC based on some of these abusive cash balance 
conversions. Clearly, something must be done to address this issue 
that's been floating around now unresolved for over five years.
  Before, I said that wear-away is the least fair practice during 
conversion. And I have to say that now, public sentiment is really 
coming around to acknowledge that unfairness. However, aside from wear-
away, there's another problem in shifting from a traditional pension to 
cash balance. In a traditional plan, you accrue most of the benefits 
toward the end of your career, because there's usually some kind of 
formula that multiplies top pay times years of service. People tend to 
earn more salary toward the end of their careers, and if that is 
multiplied times more years served, the pension grows quickly in later 
years. But in a cash balance plan, younger workers do better because 
they are given a flat percent of pay plus some guaranteed interest 
credit. Interest is good for young people, they have many years to 
accrue and compound it. So if you get caught in mid-life, mid-career in 
one of these transitions, you get the downside of both plans.
  Before I go any further, I want to be clear on one point--cash 
balance pensions can be a great deal for workers. Some. And they may 
help fill a needed niche in the pension world to cover the half of the 
workforce that currently has no pension. But I will continue my long 
battle to oppose the unilateral decision of a company to cut off a 
promise for an older worker, give that money to a younger worker, and 
not view it as age discrimination.
  That is what this issue is all about. It is fairness. It is equity. I 
know discussion of pension law can become very convoluted. But this can 
be boiled down pretty simply. It is about what we think a promise from 
an employer ought to mean.
  There is one thing that has distinguished the American workplace from 
others around the world. We have valued loyalty. At least we used to. 
That is one of the reasons pension plans exist--the longer you work 
somewhere, the more you earn in your pension program. Obviously, the 
longer you work someplace, the better you do your job, the more you 
learn about it, the more productive you are. We should value that 
loyalty.
  But here, companies are able to take away the benefits of the longest 
serving workers. What kind of a signal does that send to the workers? 
It tells workers they are fools if they are loyal because if you put in 
20 or 25 years, the boss can just change the rules of the game, and 
break their promise. It tells younger workers that it would be crazy to 
work for a company for a long time, that it's best to hedge your bets 
and move on as soon as it is convenient. It's crazy to trade current 
pay for the promise of future benefits. So why even take into account 
the fact that you're being offered a pension plan? This is a very 
dangerous road to go down.
  This destroys the kind of work ethic we have come to value and that 
we know built this country. But some of these cash balance conversions 
counter all of that. Here is an analogy. Imagine I hire someone for 5 
years with a promise of a $50,000 bonus at the end of 5 years of 
service. At the end of 3 years, however, I renege on the $50,000 bonus. 
But the employee has 3 years invested. Had they known that the deal was 
going to be off, perhaps they would not have gone to work for me. They 
could have gone to work someplace else for a total higher compensation 
package. Now imagine that they hire a new guy to join the team, and 
they give him part of that $50,000 bonus they promised me. Is that the 
way we want to treat workers in this country, where the employer has 
all the cards and employees have none, and employers can make whatever 
deal they want, but can change the rules at any time?

  That is why I am introducing this legislation. It is simple. It says 
that you have to give older, longer serving employees a choice, at 
retirement, when their pension plan is converted to a cash balance plan 
to get the benefits earned in the old plan instead. It also says that 
employers must start counting the new cash balance benefits where the 
old defined benefit plan left off, instead of starting the cash balance 
plan at a lower level than an employee had already earned.
  This isn't a radical idea. I was very pleased that in February of 
2004, the Administration came out with a cash balance proposal that 
recognized that these transitions are hard on workers. It not only 
prohibits wear-away but provides for 5 year transition credits for 
workers caught in the middle of a conversion. Treasury reaffirmed its 
commitment to this approach in this year's budget request.
  I was excited when Treasury first came to the table with a proposal 
to do more to protect workers here. I was so encouraged by this that I 
convened a series of meetings over the course of last summer to get all 
interested parties to the table--everyone from participant rights 
advocates to industry groups to consultants. I heard some really great 
ideas, and some that I didn't agree with. But I think there is still 
room to find answers to this problem. So I'm putting my plan back on 
the table today. And I really hope that we can continue a meaningful 
dialog on this issue.
  If we do that, this year, we can enact meaningful participant 
protections moving forward so that there is another pension option out 
there to cover the roughly half of Americans with no pension at all. 
But I also want to make it clear that this Senator will never sit idly 
by as older workers get the rug pulled out from under them just as they 
thought they were on solid ground for their retirement. I won't stand 
idly by and watch their money redistributed in an age-discriminatory 
way. We can have this dialog and we can find a way to fix what's broken 
here, but not by blessing some of these blatant abuses.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. BROWNBACK:
  S. 1305. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to 
increase tax benefits for parents with children, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parents 
Tax Relief Act.
  The Parents Tax Relief Act would help restore to families the pride-
of-place, which they enjoyed during the early days of the income tax.
  This important legislation would relieve the growing tax burden on 
families with children; provide a realistic option for one parent to 
stay at home and care for the children; and acknowledge the 
indispensable social value of the time and effort that parents put into 
rearing and forming their children.
  Letting parents keep more of their hard-earned money for family-
related expenses leaves the childcare decision to parents. Given this 
opportunity to make their own decision about childcare, many will 
choose to stay at home and care for their children themselves.
  This legislation is necessary because parents have been hit 
especially hard by increasing taxes over the past half-century. In 
1948, the average family with children paid 3 percent of its income in 
Federal taxes; today, that same average family with children pays 
almost 25 percent of its income in Federal taxes.
  It is time for the Federal Government to step back and recognize the 
contributions of the American family. As a matter of policy, I believe 
we should work to further reduce taxes on families with children in 
order to make it easier for parents to be parents and care for their 
own children at home. Outside of abusive situations, nothing is better 
for our children than spending time with their parents.
  The Parents Tax Relief Act takes a modest step towards empowering and 
strengthening the family. It builds on Marriage Penalty Tax Relief and 
the Child Tax Credit, making both permanent. While the Child Tax Credit 
was significant in leveling a three-decade trend of an increasing 
percentage of married mothers with preschool children who work outside 
the home full-time, more needs to be done to give parents the chance to 
decrease this percentage.
  To accomplish this end, the Parents Tax Relief Act would increase 
deductions for young and elderly dependents.

[[Page S7314]]

It would equalize existing Federal preferences between parents who 
choose to stay at home with their children and parents Who choose to 
work outside of the home and place their children in paid daycare.
  The bill would make it easier for a parent to spend more time with 
their children through provisions that encourage telecommuting and home 
businesses. And it recognizes the societal contributions of parents by 
granting 10 years worth of Social Security credits to a spouse who 
leaves the workforce during their prime-earning years to care for a 
young child.
  The Parents Tax Relief Act is about investing in human capital. The 
hard-working American family, instilling traditional values to 
children, has been the bedrock of American society. As the family goes, 
so goes the Nation.
  In recent years, the Federal Government has engaged in a massive 
experiment with paid, out-of-home daycare. As a national policy, 
through Federal subsidies, we have encouraged parents to place their 
children in daycare, and further, we have increasingly become a Nation 
where it is necessary for both husband and wife to be in the workforce 
just to cover a family's basic needs. The end result is that children 
are getting less of their parents' time when they need their parents 
the most.
  Make no mistake, both men and women have made valuable contributions 
to our national workforce. Our Nation's productivity is strong, and we 
have enjoyed a great period of national prosperity. But how long will 
it last when our children are spending less time with mom and dad? 
Sociological data confirms time and again that children do best when 
raised by a mother and a father, where one spouse works and the other 
spouse stays at home with the children.
  Unfortunately--and I believe that most mothers, especially, would 
tend to agree--we have reached a point where a family has to make a 
truly great sacrifice for one parent to stay at home to raise the 
children. I have heard so many stories of mothers wanting to stay home 
with their children, but between paying a mortgage and taxes, they feel 
helpless. They feel that they must work in order that their family can 
enjoy and maintain a middle-class lifestyle.
  It is time for us to acknowledge, through Federal policy, the 
sacrifices that parents make to invest in the upbringing of their 
children when they stay at home. That is goal of the Parents Tax Relief 
Act, and it is the reason why I am introducing this important measure.
  It costs a great sum to raise children these days, and it is 
essential to our Nation's social and economic welfare that we ensure 
Federal tax policy does not infringe on a parent's ability to afford 
that great sum.
  The Parents Tax Relief Act would establish a new national tax policy 
that would allow parents to invest more time and effort in the 
formation of their children. In the end, this type of investment in 
human capital may be the most effective way for the Federal Government 
to ensure our future economic growth and competitiveness.
  The legislative road to this new policy begins today, and I look 
forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
make it a reality.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:
  S. 1306. A bill to provide for the recognition of certain Native 
communities and the settlement of certain claims under the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources.
  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the very beginning of the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 there are a series of findings and 
declarations of Congressional policy which explain the underpinnings of 
this landmark legislation.
  The first clause reads, ``There is an immediate need for a fair and 
just settlement of all claims by Natives and Native groups of Alaska, 
based on aboriginal land claims.'' The second clause states, ``The 
settlement should be accomplished rapidly, with certainty, in 
conformity with the real economic and social needs of Natives.''
  Thirty three years have passed since the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act became law and still the Native peoples of five 
communities in Southeast Alaska--Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee 
and Wrangell--the five ``landless communities'' are still waiting for 
their fair and just settlement.
  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act awarded approximately $1 
billion and 44 million acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for 
the establishment of Native Corporations to receive and manage such 
funds and lands. The beneficiaries of the settlement were issued stock 
in one of 13 regional Alaska Native Corporations. Most beneficiaries 
also had the option to enroll and receive stock in a village, group or 
urban corporation.
  For reasons that still defy explanation the Native peoples of the 
``landless communities,'' were not permitted by the Alaska Native 
Claims Settlement Act to form village or urban corporations. These 
communities were excluded from this benefit even though they did not 
differ significantly from other communities in Southeast Alaska that 
were permitted to form village or urban corporations under the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act. This finding was confirmed in a February 
1994 report submitted by the Secretary of the Interior at the direction 
of the Congress. That study was conducted by the Institute of Social 
and Economic Research at the University of Alaska.
  The Native people of Southeast Alaska have recognized the injustice 
of this oversight for more than 33 years. An independent study issued 
more than 11 years ago confirms that the grievance of the landless 
communities is legitimate. Legislation has been introduced in the past 
sessions of Congress to remedy this injustice. Hearings have been held 
and reports written. Yet legislation to right the wrong has inevitably 
stalled out. This December marks the 34th anniversary of Congress' 
promise to the Native peoples of Alaska--the promise of a rapid and 
certain settlement. And still the landless communities of Southeast 
Alaska are landless.
  I am convinced that this cause is just, it is right, and it is about 
time that the Native peoples of the five landless communities receive 
what has been denied them for more than 30 years.
  The legislation that I am introducing today would enable the Native 
peoples of the five ``landless communities'' to organize five ``urban 
corporations,'' one for each unrecognized community. These newly formed 
corporations would be offered and could accept the surface estate to 
approximately 23,000 acres of land. Sealaska Corporation, the regional 
Alaska Native Corporation for Southeast Alaska would receive title to 
the subsurface estate to the designated lands. The urban corporations 
would each receive a lump sum payment to be used as start-up funds for 
the newly established corporation. The Secretary of the Interior would 
determine other appropriate compensation to redress the inequities 
faced by the unrecognized communities.
  It is long past time that we return to the Native peoples of 
Southeast Alaska a small slice of the aboriginal lands that were once 
theirs alone. It is time that we open our minds and open our hearts to 
correcting this injustice which has gone on far too long and finally 
give the Native peoples of Southeast Alaska the rapid and certain 
settlement for which they have been waiting.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed 
in the Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1306

       (1) In 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims 
     Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (referred to in this 
     section as the ``Act'') to recognize and settle the 
     aboriginal claims of Alaska Natives to the lands Alaska 
     Natives had used for traditional purposes.
       (2) The Act awarded approximately $1,000,000,000 and 
     44,000,000 acres of land to Alaska Natives and provided for 
     the establishment of Native Corporations to receive and 
     manage such funds and lands.
       (3) Pursuant to the Act, Alaska Natives have been enrolled 
     in one of 13 Regional Corporations.

[[Page S7315]]

       (4) Most Alaska Natives reside in communities that are 
     eligible under the Act to form a Village or Urban Corporation 
     within the geographical area of a Regional Corporation.
       (5) Village or Urban Corporations established under the Act 
     received cash and surface rights to the settlement land 
     described in paragraph (2) and the corresponding Regional 
     Corporation received cash and land which includes the 
     subsurface rights to the land of the Village or Urban 
     Corporation.
       (6) The southeastern Alaska communities of Haines, 
     Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell are not listed 
     under the Act as communities eligible to form Village or 
     Urban Corporations, even though the population of such 
     villages comprises greater than 20 percent of the 
     shareholders of the Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska 
     and display historic, cultural, and traditional qualities of 
     Alaska Natives.
       (7) The communities described in paragraph (6) have sought 
     full eligibility for lands and benefits under the Act for 
     more than three decades.
       (8) In 1993, Congress directed the Secretary of the 
     Interior to prepare a report examining the reasons why the 
     communities listed in paragraph (6) had been denied 
     eligibility to form Village or Urban Corporations and receive 
     land and benefits pursuant to the Act.
       (9) The report described in paragraph (8), published in 
     February, 1994, indicates that--
       (A) the communities listed in paragraph (6) do not differ 
     significantly from the southeast Alaska communities that were 
     permitted to form Village or Urban Corporations under the 
     Act;
       (B) such communities are similar to other communities that 
     are eligible to form Village or Urban Corporations under the 
     Act and receive lands and benefits under the Act--
       (i) in actual number and percentage of Native Alaskan 
     population; and
       (ii) with respect to the historic use and occupation of 
     land;
       (C) each such community was involved in advocating the 
     settlement of the aboriginal claims of the community; and
       (D) some of the communities appeared on early versions of 
     lists of Native Villages prepared before the date of the 
     enactment of the Act, but were not included as Native 
     Villages in the Act.
       (10) The omissions described in paragraph (9) are not 
     clearly explained in any provision of the Act or the 
     legislative history of the Act.
       (11) On the basis of the findings described in paragraphs 
     (1) through (10), Alaska Natives who were enrolled in the 
     five unlisted communities and their heirs have been 
     inadvertently and wrongly denied the cultural and financial 
     benefits of enrollment in Village or Urban Corporations 
     established pursuant to the Act.
       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to redress the 
     omission of the communities described in subsection (a)(6) 
     from eligibility by authorizing the Native people enrolled in 
     the communities--
       (1) to form Urban Corporations for the communities of 
     Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and Wrangell under 
     the Act; and
       (2) to receive certain settlement lands and other 
     compensation pursuant to the Act.

     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF ADDITIONAL NATIVE CORPORATIONS.

     Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and 
     Wrangell, Alaska, may organize as Urban Corporations.
       ``(2) Nothing in this subsection shall affect any 
     entitlement to land of any Native Corporation previously 
     established pursuant to this Act or any other provision of 
     law.''.

     Petersburg, Tenakee, or Wrangell, respectively.
       ``(2) Those Natives who are enrolled to an Urban

     on or before March 30, 1973, shall receive 100 shares of 
     Settlement Common Stock in such Urban Corporation.
       ``(3) A Native who has received shares of stock in the 
     Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska through inheritance 
     from a decedent Native who originally enrolled to the Native 
     Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, or 
     Wrangell, which decedent Native was not a shareholder in a 
     Village or Urban Corporation, shall receive the identical 
     number of shares of Settlement Common Stock in the Urban 
     Corporation for Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, or 
     Wrangell as the number of shares inherited by that Native 
     from the decedent Native who would have been eligible to be 
     enrolled to such Urban Corporation.
       ``(4) Nothing in this subsection shall affect entitlement 
     to land of any Regional Corporation pursuant to section 12(b) 
     or section 14(h)(8).''.

     SEC. 5. DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS.

       Section 7 of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 
     U.S.C. 1606) is amended--

     following new sentence: ``Native members of the Native 
     Villages of Haines, Ketchikan, Petersburg, Tenakee, and 
     Wrangell who become shareholders in an Urban Corporation for 
     such a community shall continue to be eligible to receive 
     distributions under this subsection as at-large shareholders 
     of the Regional Corporation for Southeast Alaska.''; and
       (2) by adding at the end thereof the following new 
     subsection:

     among the Regional Corporations or among Village Corporations 
     under subsection (j).''.

       The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et 
     seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof the following

     SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

       There is authorized to be appropriated such sums as shall 
     be necessary to carry out this Act and the amendments made by 
     this Act.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. BAUCUS:
  S. 1308. A bill to establish an Office of Trade Adjustment 
Assistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Trade Adjustment 
Assistance for Firms Reorganization Act.
  The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms program assists hundreds of 
mostly small and medium-sized manufacturing and agricultural companies 
in Montana and nationwide when they face layoffs and lost sales due to 
import competition. Qualifying companies develop adjustment plans and 
receive technical assistance to become more competitive, so that they 
can retain and expand employment.
  The program is very cost effective. It requires the firms being 
helped to match the Federal assistance with their own funds, and it 
pays the government back in federal and State tax revenues when the 
firms succeed.
  For example, TAA for Firms is helping Montola Growers from 
Culbertson, Montana, to develop cosmetic applications for its safflower 
oil. And it is helping Porterbilt Company of Hamilton to expand its 
product line.
  Currently, TAA for Firms clients receive assistance preparing 
petitions and adjustment plans from twelve Trade Adjustment Assistance 
Centers, which are Commerce Department contractors. Program and policy 
decisions are made by a small headquarters staff in the Commerce 
Department's Economic Development Administration.
  In the Trade Act of 2002, Congress voted to reauthorize this 
important program for seven years and to increase its authorized 
funding level. The program seemed headed toward some years of smooth 
sailing. But it turns out that is not the case.
  For reasons unrelated to TAA for Firms, EDA began more than a year 
ago to move all its headquarters programs to its six regional offices. 
For TAA for Firms, that means clients will still get the same local 
services from the TAACs, but decisions will be made in six regional 
offices plus a national policy office. The likely result is more 
personnel needed to run the program, more layers of government, less 
centralized and consistent decision making, and less accountability--
all without any likely improvement in customer service.
  In preparation for this reorganization, EDA transferred or otherwise 
eliminated most of its experienced TAA staff in the Washington office. 
But to date it has not completed the transfer and hired or trained the 
necessary regional staff. So the program is in limbo.
  Meanwhile, the President recently announced a multi-agency 
consolidation of economic development programs that will eliminate EDA 
and its regional offices. Not surprisingly, the latest word from EDA is 
that plans to complete the move of TAA for Firms to the regional 
offices are now on indefinite hold. The President's fiscal year 2006 
budget zeroes out TAA for Firms, even though Congress has authorized 
the program through fiscal year 2007. With funding in doubt and the 
Washington-based management structure for TAA for Firms already largely 
dismantled, this program is on the verge of a crisis.
  TAA for Firms was not broken until someone decided to fix it. Now it 
is doomed to stay in limbo unless Congress acts to clean up the mess.
  The bill I am introducing today solves these problems by moving 
administration of the TAA for Firms program from EDA into a different 
part of the Commerce Department--the International Trade 
Administration. I introduced this same bill last year with 15 co-
sponsors.
  Relocating the program to ITA makes sense. ITA has experience running 
this program, which was located there prior to 1990. Relocating TAA for 
Firms to ITA will result in fewer lays of government and more 
centralized and accountable program management than running it through 
EDA's regional offices or some new economic development agency.
  Relocating the program also creates synergies by allowing better 
coordination of the TAA for Firms program with other trade and trade 
remedy programs administered by ITA. And it enhances the ability of the 
Finance Committee to carry out its oversight responsibilities for this 
program and for trade policy in general.
  I do not want to see this important TAA program die of neglect. This 
legislation is a simple matter of good, sensible government. I 
encourage my colleagues to lend it their support.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1308

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Coleman, and Mr. Wyden):
  S. 1309. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to extend the trade 
adjustment assistance program to the services sector, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I introduce the Trade Adjustment 
Assistance Equity for Service Workers Act.
  Frankly, I am disappointed to be here introducing this bill yet 
again.
  Just last week, the substance of the bill was adopted by a majority 
of members of the Finance Committee as an amendment to the implementing 
legislation for the United States-Central America-Dominican Republic 
Free Trade Agreement. But today, the administration sent us the final 
implementing bill with the amendment stripped out.
  President Bush likes to say that trade is for everyone. That we all 
share the benefits, including workers. And he claims to care a lot 
about having a skilled workforce that can keep American businesses 
competitive in global markets.
  This amendment presented the President with the perfect opportunity 
to put his money where his mouth is.
  He could have said to the American people--as President Clinton did 
when Congress considered the NAFTA--that just as all Americans share in 
the benefits of trade, we all bear a responsibility for its costs. 
Trade liberalization and trade adjustment go hand in hand. And then he 
could have provided America's service sector workers with access to the 
one program designed to make that happen--Trade Adjustment Assistance.
  But by submitting the CAFTA implementing bill stripped of the Trade 
Adjustment Assistance amendment passed by the Finance Committee, he 
chose not to.

[[Page S7317]]

  Since 1962, Trade Adjustment Assistance--what we call ``TAA''--has 
provided retraining, income support, and other benefits so that workers 
who lose their jobs due to trade can make a new start.
  The rationale for TAA is simple. When our government pursues trade 
liberalization, we create benefits for the economy as a whole. But 
there is always some dislocation from trade.
  When he created the TAA program, President Kennedy explained that the 
Federal Government has an obligation ``to render assistance to those 
who suffer as a result of national trade policy.''
  For more than 40 years, we have met that obligation through TAA, 
which is principally a retraining program designed to update worker 
skills.
  The TAA program has not been static over time. Congress periodically 
revises the program to meet new economic realities. Most recently, in 
the Trade Act of 2002, Congress completed the most comprehensive 
overhaul and expansion of the TAA program since its inception.
  I am proud to have played a leading role in passing this landmark 
legislation. But I am also the first to admit that our work is not 
done. Economic realities continue to change, and TAA must continue to 
change with them.
  One fundamental aspect of TAA that has remained unchanged since 1962 
is its focus on manufacturing. We only give TAA benefits to workers who 
make ``articles.''
  Excluding service workers from TAA may have made sense in 1962, when 
most non-farm jobs were in manufacturing and most services were not 
traded across national borders.
  But today, most American jobs are in the service sector. And the 
market for many services is becoming just as global as the market for 
manufactured goods.
  In 2002, the service sector accounted for three quarters of U.S. 
private sector gross domestic product and nearly 80 percent of non-farm 
private employment.
  Trade in services is a net plus for the U.S. economy. Although trade 
in goods continues to dominate, services accounted for 29 percent of 
the value of total U.S. exports in 2002 and the service sector 
generated a trade surplus of $74 billion.
  Just as we have seen with trade in manufactured goods, however, there 
are winners and losers from trade. Trade in services will inevitably 
cost some workers their jobs.
  Indeed, there have been some well-publicized examples in the papers. 
Software sign. Technical support. Accounting and tax preparation 
services. Not long ago, a group of call center workers in Kalispell, MT 
saw their jobs move to Canada and India.
  Examples abound of service sector jobs--even high tech jobs--
relocating overseas. A series of studies estimate that between a half 
million and over 3 million U.S. service sector jobs would be moved 
offshore in the next 5 to 10 years.
  That doesn't mean the total number of jobs in the U.S. economy is 
shrinking. But the fact that jobs may be available in a different field 
is cold comfort to a worker whose own skills are no longer in demand.
  That is why this legislation is so important. It is a simple matter 
of equity.
  When a factory relocates to another country, those workers are 
eligible for TAA. But when a call center moves to another country, 
those workers are not eligible for TAA. They should be.
  The benefits service workers will receive under this legislation 
would be exactly the same as those that trade-impacted manufacturing 
workers now receive. They include retraining, income support, job 
search and relocation allowance, and a health coverage tax credit.
  Hard working American service workers deserve this safety net. These 
benefits will always be second best to a job. But they can really make 
a difference in helping workers make a new start.
  Truthfully, I am mystified by why the President so cavalierly dropped 
the TAA for Services amendment and let this opportunity pass him by. 
His actions are entirely inconsistent with his stated desire to make 
trade benefit all Americans. But, sadly, this has become a pattern.
  Despite the obvious benefits of the TAA program, the Bush 
Administration fought tooth and nail against every penny, and against 
every provision in what became the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform 
Act of 2002. Extending TAA to service workers was one of many needed 
improvements that was struck in the final version of the bill.
  Again in the last Congress, the extension of TAA to service workers 
was offered as an amendment to the JOBS Act and opposed by the 
Administration. It garnered 54 votes from both sides ofthe aisle--
failing only on a technicality.
  The world is changing and TAA must keep up with the times. Last 
year's Senate vote and this year's Finance Committee vote make clear 
that there is wide support for extending TAA to service workers. I 
truly believe this bill's time has come. I will work hard to move this 
legislation this year.
  I want to thank Senators Coleman and Wyden for co-sponsoring this 
legislation. They have been stalwart supporters in the fight to bring 
equity to service workers. I look forward to working with them to make 
TAA for service workers a reality.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1309
