                     ON THE ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX

  (Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to

honor the 33rd anniversary of title IX. Title IX creates opportunities 
for female athletes. Since its inception in 1972, female participation 
in sports has increased 400 percent in colleges and 800 percent in high 
schools. As a young girl, I played on several sports teams. These 
experiences fostered my love of competition. But they have far greater 
benefits. Girls who play sports are less likely to have an unplanned 
pregnancy, more likely to leave an abusive relationship, and are less 
likely to suffer from depression.
  Unfortunately, under President Bush's administration, the Department 
of Education has created a huge title IX loophole. By bending title IX 
rules, it is now easier for schools to evade their responsibilities to 
provide opportunities for female athletes. It is wrong for this 
administration to reverse the progress made over the last three 
decades.
  Tonight, I will be joining my colleagues in the annual congressional 
baseball game and when I join the line-up in RFK Stadium, I will be on 
the line for title IX.
  Mr. President, I hope you can join us in supporting title IX by 
repealing these damaging new rules instead of slamming the door of 
opportunity in the face of women.
