                      TITLE IX'S 33RD ANNIVERSARY

  (Ms. WOOLSEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WOOLSEY. Mr. Speaker, 33 years ago, Title IX, written by our dear 
friend, Patsy Mink, became law. Title IX recognizes that only when all 
Americans have opportunity to reach their potential can our country 
reach its potential.
  Recently, the Bush administration said that if a school's women 
students do not respond to an e-mail from the school asking if they are 
interested in sports, then the school would be in compliance with Title 
IX.
  That is ridiculous. There are acceptable standards to measure 
compliance that are accurate and must be used.
  The lesson of Title IX is that interest flows from opportunity. That 
is why women's participation in sports has increased 800 percent in 
high school and 400 percent in college since 1972.
  Moreover, if we are going to make policy based on how many people 
ignore one of the dozens of e-mails in their in-box, we will be in huge 
trouble with Title IX.
  I hope that the President will heed the letter from the gentlewoman 
from California (Leader Pelosi), the gentleman from California (Ranking 
Member Miller), and myself and 140 other Members, and rescind this 
clarification.
