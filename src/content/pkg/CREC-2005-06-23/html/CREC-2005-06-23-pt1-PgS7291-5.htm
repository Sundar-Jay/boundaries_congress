  LEGISLATION AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS TO IMPLEMENT THE UNITED STATES-
    DOMINICAN REPUBLIC-CENTRAL AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT--PM 14

  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:

To the Congress of the United States:
  I am pleased to transmit legislation and supporting documents to 
implement the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free 
Trade Agreement (the ``Agreement''). The Agreement represents an 
historic development in our relations with Central America and the 
Dominican Republic and reflects the commitment of the United States to 
supporting democracy, regional integration, and economic growth and 
opportunity in a region that has transitioned to peaceful, democratic 
societies.
  In negotiating this Agreement, my Administration was guided by the 
objectives set out in the Trade Act of 2002. Central America and the 
Dominican Republic constitute our second largest export market in Latin 
America and our tenth largest export market in the world. The Agreement 
will create significant new opportunities for American workers, 
farmers, ranchers, and businesses by opening new markets and 
eliminating barriers. United States agricultural exports will obtain 
better access to the millions of consumers in Central America and the 
Dominican Republic.
  Under the Agreement, tariffs on approximately 80 percent of U.S. 
exports will be eliminated immediately. The Agreement will help to 
level the playing field because about 80 percent of Central America's 
imports already enjoy duty-free access to our market. By providing for 
the effective enforcement of labor and environmental laws,

combined with strong remedies for noncompliance, the Agreement will 
contribute to improved worker rights and high levels of environmental 
protection in Central America and the Dominican Republic.
  By supporting this Agreement, the United States can stand with those 
in the region who stand for democracy and freedom, who are fighting 
corruption and crime, and who support the rule of law. A stable, 
democratic, and growing Central America and Dominican Republic 
strengthens the United States economically and provides greater 
security for our citizens.
  The Agreement is in our national interest, and I urge the Congress to 
approve it expeditiously.
                                                      George W. Bush.  
The White House, June 23, 2005.
