                       150TH ANNIVERSARY TREATIES

  (Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this weekend marks the 150th anniversary 
of the Treaty with the Tribes of Middle Oregon and today I have 
introduced legislation to commemorate that event. There were a number 
of important treaties signed in 1855 which included the Cayuse, 
Umatilla, Walla Walla and ultimately the Warm Springs. These treaties 
helped guide and shape the management of land, water, wildlife and 
fisheries of the Pacific Northwest now and into the future. The 
treaties were understood by their signers to ensure the unique quality 
of life of native peoples in middle Oregon.
  Unfortunately, the United States' history of honoring its commitments 
to Native Americans leaves much to be desired. In honor of the 
anniversary of these treaties, we should reaffirm and support the 
promises made 150 years ago between the Pacific Northwest tribes and 
the United States of America. Together, we have a rich legacy and a 
bright future to protect, and I urge my colleagues in joining me in 
supporting this resolution.
