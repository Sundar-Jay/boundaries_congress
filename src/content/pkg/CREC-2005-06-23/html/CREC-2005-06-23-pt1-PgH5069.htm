  LIMITATION ON AMENDMENTS DURING FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3010, 
  DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND 
               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2006

  Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, during further 
consideration in the Committee of the Whole of H.R. 3010 pursuant to 
House Resolution 337, notwithstanding clause 11 of rule XVIII, no 
further amendment to the bill, as amended, may be offered except pro 
forma amendments offered at any point in the reading by the chairman or 
ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations or their 
designees for the purpose of debate, the additional amendments 
specified in this order, and amendments en bloc specified in this 
order; it shall be in order at any time for the chairman of the 
Committee on Appropriations or a designee, after consultation with the 
ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations, to offer 
amendments en bloc as follows: Amendments en bloc shall consist of 
amendments that may be offered under this order, or germane 
modifications of any such amendment; such amendments en bloc shall be 
considered as read, except that modifications shall be reported, shall 
be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the 
chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations 
or their designees, shall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be 
subject to a demand for division of the question in the House or in the 
Committee of the Whole; all points of order against such amendments en 
bloc are waived; the original proponent of an amendment included in 
such amendments en bloc may insert a statement in the Congressional 
Record immediately before the disposition of the amendments en bloc.
  The additional amendments specified in this order are as follows:
  amendments printed in the Congressional Record and numbered 1, 2, 4, 
5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 24;
  an amendment by the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) regarding coverage 
of certain drugs;
  an amendment by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) 
regarding enforcement of certain compliance agreements;

regarding United Airline pension plans;

the content or distribution of public telecommunications programs and

or a limitation on the use of certain education funds; and
  an amendment by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Price) regarding 
funding for certain education programs.
  Each additional amendment may be offered only by the Member named in 
this request or a designee, or by the Member who caused it to be 
printed in the Record or a designee, shall be considered as read, shall 
be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and controlled by the 
proponent and an opponent, shall not be subject to amendment except 
that the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations and the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education, and Related Agencies each may offer one pro forma 
amendment for the purpose of debate; and shall not be subject to a 
demand for division of the question in the House or in the Committee of 
the Whole; and an amendment shall be considered to fit the description 
stated in this request if it addresses in whole or in part the object 
described.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Ohio?
  Mr. OBEY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. Speaker, I think the 
Members need to understand what is happening. As we indicated at the 
beginning of the debate, the gentleman from Ohio and I were trying to 
work things out so that we could finish debate on this bill this 
afternoon. That, unfortunately, has not been possible. We have had 
quite a bit of cooperation from some Members and quite a bit less from 
others. As a result, it appears that at this moment we still have 26 
amendments to consider. As you know, there is an event which some 
Members of the Congress feel required to attend tonight, not the 
gentleman from Ohio and not the gentleman from Wisconsin, but because 
of that event, we are going to be required to begin voting very 
shortly. An offer was made to continue to debate this bill throughout 
that event, allowing Members to return afterwards, but that offer was 
not accepted, and so the problem we have now is that, despite our best 
efforts, we will be here tomorrow, and, if this unanimous consent 
agreement is accepted, we might be finished by 3 or 4 o'clock.
  Mr. Speaker, I want to say one other thing. I would ask Members in 
the future if they are offering amendments

[[Page H5070]]

to any appropriations bill to please be attentive enough to what is 
going on on the floor so that we do not pass their amendment in the 
reading of the bill. If we do that, then there are misunderstandings, 
somebody thinks somebody else was double-crossed or misled, and we wind 
up with frayed tempers. The committee cannot be expected to take care 
of Members who do not take care of their own interests.
  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from Ohio?
  There was no objection.
