                                 GITMO

  (Ms. PRYCE of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. PRYCE of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of our 
military. It has been 4 years since terrorists killed more than 3,000 
innocent people and it seems that Democrats still do not understand who 
the enemy is.
  They have turned their rhetoric to the American soldiers who guard 
the prison at Guantanamo Bay which houses some of the world's most 
wanted and is vital to the war on terror. Their efforts have provided 
some very valuable intelligence, intelligence that will save countless 
lives and keep our country secure. Yet some would rather use it as a 
political tool than honor those who serve there.
  I hope our troops cannot hear them.
  What is more, they would rather focus this Congress on investigating 
our own troops than on investigating enemy combatants, would-be 
terrorists, and threats to our homeland. You would think that the party 
of Truman and FDR would reserve comparisons to Nazis, the Holocaust and 
Pol Pot for al Qaeda, Saddam's ethnic cleansing, or Osama bin Laden.
  But no. Those are the words they use to describe our troops in the 
field, our military command, and our soldiers at Guantanamo.
  I hope our men and women in uniform cannot hear them.
