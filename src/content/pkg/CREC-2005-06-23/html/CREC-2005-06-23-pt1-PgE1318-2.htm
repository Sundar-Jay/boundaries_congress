                     A TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM R. RUTTER

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MARILYN N. MUSGRAVE

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 22, 2005

  Mrs. MUSGRAVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a true hero, 
William R. Rutter. Mr. Rutter is a proud American who served our 
country in two major wars. After serving in World War II, Bill Rutter 
entered the U.S. Army Reserves, however, when the Korean conflict began 
he immediately volunteered again for active duty. After the Korean War 
he returned to the Reserves, serving a total of 37 years.
  On December 15, 1950 in Korea when Bill Rutter was a Sergeant First 
Class with Fox Company, 7th Infantry, 3rd Regiment I.D., he volunteered 
to take a combat patrol out to probe and locate the enemy position and 
strength. Easy Company, 7th Infantry Regiment was pinned down. When 
they reached a position approximately opposite Easy Company they drew 
extremely heavy fire from the enemy force. There appeared to be two 
reinforced rifle companies with attached units. All of this patrol, 
with the exception of Sergeant Rutter, sustained wounds. He located a 
position that was protected where they couldn't be hit. He instructed 
his men to start walking back down the hill slowly one at a time while 
he and one of his men who was unable to walk provided cover fire. When 
they were all down the hill, Mr. Rutter strapped the wounded young 
Private on his back with his rifle belt and ran down the hill under 
extremely heavy fire. Sergeant Rutter was able to get all his men out 
alive that day.
  Following his heroic service Bill Rutter served as a Deputy Federal 
Marshall and spent time working with the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 
several locations, including Alcatraz in California. He concluded his 
service in Colorado working for the Youth Conservation Core under the 
Bureau of Land Management. He retired in 1981 and lives the small 
Eastern Colorado community of Fleming.
  Mr. Speaker, we are so fortunate to live in this great country where 
freedom is something that we rarely have to think about and often take 
for granted. It is simply a way of life for us, and we are truly 
blessed to live in a country with citizens who willingly volunteer to 
put themselves in harm's way to defend and protect our great Nation.
  I am proud to honor Bill for his courage and sacrifice on behalf of 
all Americans. I applaud Bill for his courage and selfless dedication 
to duty. He has helped protect our democracy and kept our homeland safe 
by placing his life on the line. Bill truly is the embodiment of all 
the values that have molded America into the great Nation it is today.
  We can maintain the blessings of our freedoms only because we have 
citizens like Bill Rutter.
