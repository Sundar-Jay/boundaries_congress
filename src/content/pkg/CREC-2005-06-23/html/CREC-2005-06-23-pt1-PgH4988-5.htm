   STOP USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO SUBSIDIZE VIAGRA FOR SEX OFFENDERS

  (Mr. DOOLITTLE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. DOOLITTLE. Mr. Speaker, we must stop using taxpayer dollars to 
subsidize Viagra for sex offenders. It was recently revealed that 
almost 800 convicted sex offenders in 14 States have received Medicaid 
funded Viagra and other similar drugs. This practice is a disgusting 
abuse of taxpayer dollars and must be stopped now.
  On today's calendar, an amendment in the Labor-HHS appropriations 
bill prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to reimburse sex 
offenders for Viagra and similar drugs. This amendment does not just 
address Medicaid but it also prevents Medicare and any other public 
health service from reimbursing convicted sex offenders for these types 
of drugs. It is the responsibility of Congress to take action to close 
this loophole immediately which we in the House shall do today.
