                      33RD ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX

  (Ms. SOLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, today I also rise with my colleagues who are 
here from the Women's Caucus to pay tribute to a historic occasion, the 
celebration of the 33rd anniversary of Title IX that seeks to achieve 
fairness among student athletes, both men and women.
  For 33 years, Title IX has expanded opportunities for young women and 
girls to participate in athletic programs in schools across the 
country. Since it was enacted in 1972, women's participation in these 
sports has increased by 400 percent at college level and about 800 
percent in high schools. Title IX's fundamental intent is significant 
because it ensures equal access and opportunity to all women and 
especially women of color.
  And yesterday I had the opportunity of joining with Members of the 
Senate and the House to celebrate this very important occasion and to 
also make very clear that we are in opposition to this clarification, 
or notion of clarification, that the Secretary of the Department of 
Education would like to somehow implement, which would actually create 
a big loophole so that we would not be able to account for those young 
women participating in these sports. It would keep scholarships from 
them and the ability to participate in sports. So, please, I ask the 
Members to contact the President.
