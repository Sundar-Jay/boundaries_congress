Appropriations and the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human 
Services, Education, and Related Agencies each may offer one pro forma 
amendment for the purpose of debate; and shall not be subject to a 
demand for division of the question.
  Mr. REGULA. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word and yield to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Jindal).
  Mr. JINDAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to request that in lieu of 
offering my amendment, which will provide that a small portion of the 
$50 million in health information technology grants that are already 
allocated to the agency for health care research and quality are 
designated to small and rural hospitals to implement bedside bar-coded 
medication technology, that we agree to work together to achieve 
improvements in health care quality by implementing technology 
initiatives in our small and rural hospitals.
  Mr. Chairman, quality of health care is the driving force for 
implementing technological changes in the administration of medications 
in hospitals. More than one-third of adverse drug events occur during 
the administration to patients.
  The estimated cost of preventable errors in the inpatient setting is 
a staggering $2 billion annually. Hand-held devices that scan bar codes 
on medication bags, patient wristbands, and nurse badges can help 
eliminate those errors by tracking medical information and alerting 
hospital staff before a mistake is made.
  In fact, a study by the University of Wisconsin shows that 
medication-dispensing errors can be reduced from 1.43 percent 0.13 
percent with the use of bar code technology. Unfortunately, the 
penetration of these devices is small. Less than 10 percent of 
hospitals have implemented such systems.
  The second driving force for implementing bar code technology is 
cost. The cost burden relative to the ever-rising demand for health 
care is not going to be met without implementing

[[Page H5073]]

technological advancements in health care organizations.
  The United States spends over $1.2 trillion a year on health care. We 
could have a dramatic impact on reducing the amount of paperwork on the 
administrative side by using bar code technology that automatically 
captures patient data and eliminates some of the costly administrative 
burdens that take hospital staff away from patient care.
  Moreover, the quality of life in rural America depends on having 
access to quality, affordable health care.
  Mr. Chairman, will you agree to work with me to improve the quality 
of health care in small and rural hospitals as this bill moves forward 
in the legislative process?

                              {time}  1730

  Mr. REGULA. Yes. I thank the gentleman for bringing this important 
issue to my attention and to the attention of the House of 
Representatives.
  I agree that the quality of health care in rural America is an 
important issue. And regrettably in a tight fiscal environment, some 
reductions have been made to rural health care programs. I look forward 
to working with the gentleman to help find funding streams from which 
to draw from to help improve the technology available to patients of 
health care providers in rural America.
  Mr. JINDAL. I thank the gentleman.
  Mr. REGULA. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.
  The motion was agreed to.
  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
Marchant) having assumed the chair, Mr. Terry, Acting Chairman of the 
Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that 
that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 3010) 
making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human 
Services, and Education, and Related Agencies for the fiscal year 
ending September 30, 2006, and for other purposes, had come to no 
resolution thereon.
