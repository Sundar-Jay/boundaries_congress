     treatment of all regions of the coastal zone, including the 
     Southeastern States and the Great Lakes States.

  SA 990. Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Lott, and Mr. Schumer) 
submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the bill H.R. 
6, to ensure jobs for our future with secure, affordable, and reliable 
energy; as follows:

       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert the 
     following:

     SEC. 621. MEDICAL ISOTOPE PRODUCTION: NONPROLIFERATION, 
                   ANTITERRORISM, AND RESOURCE REVIEW.

       (a) Definitions.--In this section:
       (1) Highly enriched uranium for medical isotope 
     production.--The term ``highly enriched uranium for medical 
     isotope production'' means highly enriched uranium contained 
     in, or for use in, targets to be irradiated for the sole 
     purpose of producing medical isotopes.
       (2) Medical isotopes.--The term ``medical isotopes'' means 
     radioactive isotopes, including molybdenum-99, that are used 
     to produce radiopharmaceuticals for diagnostic or therapeutic 
     procedures on patients.
       (b) Study.--
       (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of 
     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall enter into an 
     arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences for the 
     conduct of a study of issues associated with section 134 of 
     the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2160d), including 
     issues associated with the implementation of that section.
       (2) Contents.--The study shall include an analysis of--
       (A) the effectiveness to date of section 134 of the Atomic 
     Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2160d) in facilitating the 
     conversion of foreign reactor fuel and targets to low-
     enriched uranium, which reduces the risk that highly enriched 
     uranium will be diverted and stolen;
       (B) the degree to which isotope producers that rely on 
     United States highly enriched uranium are complying with the 
     intent of section 134 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 
     U.S.C. 2160d) to expeditiously convert targets to low-
     enriched uranium;
       (C) the adequacy of physical protection and material 
     control and accounting measures at foreign facilities that 
     receive United States highly enriched uranium for medical 
     isotope production, in comparison to Nuclear Regulatory 
     Commission regulations and Department administrative 
     requirements;
       (D) the likely consequences of an exemption of highly 
     enriched uranium exports for medical isotope production from 
     section 134(a) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 
     2160d(a)) for--
       (i) United States efforts to eliminate highly enriched 
     uranium commerce worldwide through the support of the Reduced 
     Enrichment in Research and Test Reactors program; and
       (ii) other United States nonproliferation and antiterrorism 
     initiatives;
       (E) incentives that could supplement the incentives of 
     section 134 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 
     2160d) to further encourage foreign medical isotope producers 
     to convert from highly enriched uranium to low-enriched 
     uranium;
       (F) whether implementation of section 134 of the Atomic 
     Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2160d) has ever caused, or is 
     likely to cause, an interruption in the production and supply 
     of medical isotopes in needed quantities;
       (G) whether the United States supply of isotopes is 
     sufficiently diversified to withstand an interruption of 
     production from any 1 supplier, and, if not, what steps 
     should be taken to diversify United States supply; and
       (H) any other aspects of implementation of section 134 of 
     of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (42 U.S.C. 2160d) that have 
     a bearing on Federal nonproliferation and antiterrorism laws 
     (including regulations) and policies.
       (3) Timing; consultation.--The National Academy of Sciences 
     study shall be--
       (A) conducted in full consultation with the Secretary of 
     State, the staff of the Reduced Enrichment in Research and 
     Test Reactors program at Argonne National Laboratory, and 
     other interested organizations and individuals with expertise 
     in nuclear nonproliferation; and
       (B) submitted to Congress not later than 18 months after 
     the date of enactment of this Act.
                                 ______
