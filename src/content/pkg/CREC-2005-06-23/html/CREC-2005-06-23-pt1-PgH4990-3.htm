                      TITLE IX AND SOCIAL SECURITY

  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, this morning I rise to speak 
about two wrong-headed policies.
  First of all, let me honor and celebrate Title IX: remember the U.S. 
soccer team, women's soccer team, the WMBA; and then of course the 
assault on Title IX to allow the schools to send an e-mail to determine 
whether students, young women want to participate in sports. Do the 
Members know what that means? No women's sports. I stand here today to 
support a full funding of Title IX. Get rid of the loophole.
  And then, Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my friends who think that we 
are going to accept the smoke and mirrors on the new Social Security 
plan, let us let me tell them that it is the same old plan. It 
privatizes Social Security, raids the trust fund, and weakens Social 
Security because what it does is it takes money from the trust fund and 
puts it in private accounts. Democrats stand for a solvent Social 
Security. Social Security is not a policy issue. It is a personal 
issue. It is an umbrella. It is the wind beneath the wings of those who 
work every day. Do not buy the smoke and mirrors of Social Security and 
support Title IX with no changes.
