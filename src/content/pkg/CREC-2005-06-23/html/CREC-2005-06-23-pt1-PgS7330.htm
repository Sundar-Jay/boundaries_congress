                                PROGRAM

  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, tomorrow, the Senate will begin 
consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. Under a previous 
agreement, we will consider amendments to the bill tomorrow and Monday, 
and we will begin votes in relation to amendments to the bill on 
Tuesday of next week. Therefore, there will be no rollcall votes during 
tomorrow's session. Senators who have amendments to the Interior 
appropriations bill, however, should make themselves available to come 
to the floor tomorrow and Monday to offer their first-degree 
amendments.
  Mr. President, we had a great success today in the completion of the 
Energy bill, although we will not have the final vote on that bill 
until Tuesday morning. I congratulate the chairman and ranking member 
of the Energy Committee for their tremendous work--tremendous work--in 
getting the Energy bill to the finish line. Through their hard work and 
with the cooperation and hard work of our colleagues, we were able to 
dispose of all amendments and take the bill to third reading in 2 
weeks, just as we had planned. We had said that was our goal about a 
month ago. And, indeed, that goal has been accomplished.
  We will have the vote on passage on Tuesday morning of next week. The 
vote on passage will occur between 9:45 a.m. and 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 
and that will be our next vote. Both the chairman and ranking member of 
the Energy Committee will be there for that vote on Tuesday morning.
  Tomorrow, Mr. President, I will update everyone with respect to next 
week's schedule. It will be the last week of our session prior to the 
Fourth of July holiday, and thus we can expect a very busy week.
  At the beginning of this 4-week block, we said we would spend the 
last week on appropriations bills. And, indeed, with the completion of 
the Energy bill, we will do just that--in fact, starting a day early by 
beginning the Interior appropriations bill tomorrow. Also during the 
week, we will have other legislative or executive matters we will deal 
with once they have been cleared.
