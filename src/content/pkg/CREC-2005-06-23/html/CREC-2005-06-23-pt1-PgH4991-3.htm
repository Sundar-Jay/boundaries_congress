                         IN SUPPORT OF TITLE IX

  (Ms. BORDALLO asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the 
Title IX program which created equality, equality for young men and 
women in our Nation's schools.
  As Title IX celebrates its 33rd anniversary today, I am concerned 
with recent attempts to undermine the program that will reverse the 
progress Title IX has made in enabling young women to participate in 
sports.
  The Department of Education recently issued its ``Additional 
Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletics Policy: Three-Part Test, 
Part Three'' which changes the way schools determine female interest in 
athletics by making an e-mail survey the sole interest indicator.
  This new policy harms the Title IX program because it prevents 
schools from using a multi-method approach to assess female sports 
programs. By deciding to base the future of women's athletic programs 
on e-mail surveys, the Department of Education is denying women the 
same opportunities as men to participate in sports.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue to support equal rights 
for men and women in every arena of public life, including sports. I 
strongly urge the Department of Education to rescind its policy. Title 
IX opened the doors for women; let us not close them now.
