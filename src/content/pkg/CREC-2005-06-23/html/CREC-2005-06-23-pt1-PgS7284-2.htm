                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES


                      First Lieutenant Noah Harris

  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise today to read from an e-mail sent 
to me in May of this year:

       Our presence here is not just about Iraq. It is sending a 
     message to the oppressed peoples of the world that freedom 
     can be a reality. Freedom is the greatest gift that we, the 
     U.S., have been granted, and as such, it is our 
     responsibility to spread it. For it to become a permanent 
     fixture in our future and our children's future, we must give 
     it to all those that desire it.

  Mr. President, that is an e-mail to me from 1LT Noah Harris, of 
Ellijay, GA, from Baghdad, Iraq.
  On Saturday of this past week, First Lieutenant Harris died in the 
service of his country. His e-mail to me expressed democracy and 
freedom far better than I am capable of doing.
  Noah Harris served as an intern in Congressman Deal's office 2 years 
ago, which is where I had the occasion to meet him.
  When I received his e-mail, I sat down at my desk in my office and 
wrote him a note thanking him for his service to his country and his 
fellow man.
  This morning, I rise to pay tribute to the life that has been given 
on behalf of the greater good. Noah Harris was the type of young man 
who serves without desire for credit or acclaim in Iraq today but on 
behalf of his country and everything we stand for.
  At the age of 23, he embodied the hope of the future. His sacrifice, 
in fact, ensures that the future for others will be brighter.
  He captained his high school football team, was never beaten in the 
State in wrestling, went to the University of Georgia and captained the 
cheerleaders at that institution.
  He came to Washington to serve as an intern. Shortly after September 
11, 2001--struck, as all of us were, by the tragedy of that day--Noah 
Harris volunteered to serve in the U.S. military and, to the greater 
good, the people of the world.
  On Saturday, at noon of this week, in Ellijay, GA, I and hundreds of 
other Georgians will pause in the northwest Georgia mountains to pay 
tribute to the life of Noah Harris.
  I am privileged and pleased to stand on the floor of the Senate today 
in advance of that to acknowledge our thanks, on behalf of this Senate, 
and all who serve in this Congress, and our President, for the life, 
the times, the service, and the gift of 1LT Noah Harris.
  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I stand before this body tonight with a 
heavy heart. One of Georgia's best and brightest young soldiers has 
paid the ultimate sacrifice in the service of his country in the War on 
Terror. Tonight the people of Ellijay, GA are grieving the loss of one 
of their bravest sons on the battlefield of freedom.
  In our Nation's noble struggle to spread democracy, First Lieutenant 
Noah Harris gave his life in Baqubah, Iraq.
  Noah, a member of the 2nd Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 3rd 
Infantry Division, died of wounds suffered as a result of an explosion 
near his armored vehicle around midnight, June 17, 2005.
  Noah's death came one week before his birthday. Most young men his 
age would be making plans for a celebration; however, this young hero 
choose the battlefield instead.
  Nearly 24 years old, this brave patriot was eager to serve his 
country and to spread our message of freedom and democracy to oppressed 
nations. His tragic and untimely death is a testimony of his passion 
and dedication to freedom's call.
  The only child of Rick and Lucy Harris, Noah was a state champion 
wrestler and the captain of his high school football team. A natural 
leader and athlete, Noah took these skills to the University of Georgia 
where he was the captain of the cheerleading squad.
  As a 1999 graduate of Gilmer High School, Noah's gifts were not 
merely athletic. He was honored as a scholar athlete during the Peach 
Bowl. These are but a few of the admirable accomplishments and 
achievements that endeared Noah to all of those with whom he came in 
contact.
  While a student at UGA, Noah was motivated by the attack on our 
country on September 11th. Noah walked in to the ROTC office 
immediately after
9/11 asking to serve. Told he was too far along in his studies, Noah 
persisted until he was allowed to join the ROTC. You see, Noah believed 
passionately that there were no exemptions from serving in the cost of 
freedom.
  A personal longing to promote liberty and help the Iraqi people who 
had long suffered under Saddam Hussein were a constant theme in Noah's 
letters home to his family and friends, but ever humble, Noah shrugged 
off the gravity of his commitment adopting the simple mantra ``I do 
what I can'' in response to being called a hero.
  Noah believed that a greater good was worth fighting for and 
recognized the power of leading by example which exemplifies the 
qualities in each one of our Nation's treasured soldiers.
  Noah's vision and passion to achieve a greater good for the people of 
Iraq is an excellent model for those who come after him to continue the 
fight against freedom's foes.
  Noah aspired to serve in public office, and he was also interested in 
real estate as a personal career. A passionate advocate for the mission 
in Iraq, Noah expressed the urgency of the cause

when he was home visiting friends and family during his leave in May.
  It is clear that Noah had a caring heart, as his friends recount that 
he was known to give Beanie Babies to the children in Iraq.
  In tribute to Noah, members of the Gilmer County community will 
assemble at Gilmer High School Friday June 24 at 2 p.m. to distribute 
yellow ribbons across Gilmer County in preparation for the celebration 
of Noah's life on Saturday June 25, what would be his 24th birthday.
  The ribbons will line highway 52 East in Ellijay to Highway 515, 
which stretches from the county line to the Ellijay First United 
Methodist Church, the site of the memorial service.
  Another soldier in the vehicle was killed, and the driver was injured 
severely in the explosion. Noah and his fellow soldiers were 
transporting two captured insurgents during night operations in the 
Baquba neighborhood of Buhritz.
  Noah's fellow soldier, Corporal William A. Long of Lilburn, GA, also 
died from injuries sustained in the blast. Three years ago, after 
talking with his stepfather and stepbrother, who are former members of 
the military, William joined the Army.
  After his enlistment expired, he was very aware that his unit would 
be deployed to Iraq. His desire to serve our country and free the Iraqi 
people, however, led him to re-enlist.
  A resident of Atlanta for most of his life and a Berkmar High School 
alumnus, William was well-mannered and well-liked by all. His family 
describes him as a ``perfectionist'' and ``basketball-lover.''
  Ironically, before going to Iraq, William participated in more than 
700 funerals as a member of the prestigious ``Old Guard.'' Many of 
those funerals were held at Arlington National Cemetery, the cemetery 
where William will be buried.
  President Ronald Reagan once said:

       Putting people first has always been America's secret 
     weapon.

  That secret weapon drives the American spirit to dream and dare, and 
take great risks for a greater good. Noah and William represented the 
true heart of servant leadership. Their desire was to first, serve 
others, not themselves.
  My wife Julianne and I wish to extend our sympathies and our prayers 
to both Noah's and William's family, friends, and fellow soldiers. 
Their sacrifice will not be lost or forgotten. May God bless Noah 
Harris and William Long.
