                  CELEBRATING ANNIVERSARY OF TITLE IX

  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate the 33rd anniversary of 
Title IX and pay tribute to the significant advancements made for 
women's educational and athletic opportunities. Not coincidentally, 
this year is also the 33rd anniversary of the UC Santa Barbara Lady 
Gauchos basketball team, this year's Big West Conference champions.
  I hold a basketball signed by the team members of the 1997 team who 
participated in the NCAA tournament here in Washington, DC. Any woman 
who has played for this team can attest to the numerous benefits 
afforded to them by receiving the same opportunity as men to 
participate in college athletics.

                              {time}  1030

  There is a clear interest for women to play sports, and schools must 
respond.
  To anyone who disagrees, I would like you to know that the UCSB 
women's basketball team sells more season tickets than the men's team.
  So I am appalled that the Bush administration is trying to weaken the 
enforcement of Title IX in our Nation's colleges and universities.
  On this anniversary of Title IX, we must stand up and protect it.
