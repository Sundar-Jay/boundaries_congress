                   REMEMBERING ANTHONY ``TONY'' HOSEY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. TIMOTHY V. JOHNSON

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 22, 2005

  Mr. JOHNSON of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, on April 25, 2005, the Illinois 
State University (ISU) Police lost one of its finest when Anthony 
``Tony'' Hosey tragically died at the young age of 37. Yet in those 37 
years Tony accomplished a great number of deeds significantly 
benefiting the safety and the welfare of his community.
  Tony Hosey twice received his department's highest honor, the 
``Chief's Award of Merit-Meritorious Service Medal.'' In 2003, Tony 
played a strong role in ``Operation Shakespeare,'' which led to the 
seizure of over 2,000 tablets of Ecstasy, 121 grams of Ketamine, and 
931 grams of GHB. The individuals arrested were responsible for the 
distribution of over 9,000 tablets of ``Ecstasy'' on the Illinois State 
University Campus.
  In 2004, he received the award for arresting 5 individuals 
responsible for the selling of 500 tablets of Ecstasy on the ISU 
campus: At the time of the arrest, they possessed 200 tablets of the 
drug. His work has allowed for a safer University and community, and 
has saved many individuals from falling victim to the devastating 
effects of drugs.
  While Tony's record speaks for itself, his numerous contributions to 
the community have impacted not only his fellow citizens, but also his 
peers. Illinois State Police Special Agent and friend Earl Chandler put 
it best when he said, ``I've never met or known anybody that was more 
of the epitome of what a good police officer should be.'' Yet beyond 
the job, Tony was a caring husband and father of four. He was a 
bodybuilder and motorcycle rider, but was described as being a ``gentle 
giant.'' His memorial website has been flooded with hundreds of 
reflections and it is with a thankful heart that I rise to pay tribute 
to Tony. His impact and sacrifice for his neighbors, friends, family, 
and community will never be forgotten.
