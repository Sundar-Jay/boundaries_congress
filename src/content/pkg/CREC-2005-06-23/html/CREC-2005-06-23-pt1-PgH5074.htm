          HONORING ARMY SPECIALIST STANLEY ``STOSH'' LAPINSKI

  (Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy 
heart that I rise today to express condolences of a grateful Nation.
  I rise to honor the life of Army Specialist Stanley, also known as 
Stosh, Lapinski. Specialist Lapinski was a recent victim of a terrorist 
roadside bomb.
  During his last conversation before he was killed, Sergeant Lapinski 
told his parents not to worry about him and he would be fine.
  While Stosh did not make it home from Iraq, I am honored to join the 
Lapinski family for his burial at Arlington National Cemetery next 
week.
  A grateful Nation has brought him home to the honors and accolades he 
well deserves.
  Nothing I could say today would heal the wounds of the Lapinski 
family. After speaking to them, however, I can tell you that they want 
their son's sacrifice to be remembered for the good and honorable 
actions he was doing in Iraq.
  His service showed the true American spirit. While the Lapinskis lost 
their son, they know that he died preserving and fighting for 
democracy.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask all Americans to join me in honoring a true 
American hero.
