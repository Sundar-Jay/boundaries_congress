   RECOGNIZING FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH YOUTH CHOIR--SULPHUR SPRINGS, TX

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RALPH M. HALL

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 22, 2005

  Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, today I am honored to pay tribute to the First 
Baptist Church Youth Choir in Sulphur Springs, Texas. The choir is made 
up of 84 high school students. They have traveled to New York City, San 
Diego, San Francisco, Washington DC, Canada, the Bahamas, Disney World, 
Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Mexico, and this year will be traveling to 
Ireland. On these trips, the choir performs concerts in areas approved 
by the city, usually outdoors where anyone who is walking by can stop 
and listen. While the students are performing, the adult sponsors talk 
to those who are listening and distribute free Bibles to anyone who 
asks for one. These high school students have been able to reach the 
hearts of thousands of people in a variety of places.
  The youth choir began in 1981 under the leadership of the Minister of 
Music of First Baptist Church, Fred Randles, and his wife, Jane. The 
students meet every Sunday evening for rehearsal. Throughout the year, 
they perform at church services and at Holiday in the Park at Six Flags 
over Texas to help them prepare for their summer trip. During the 
spring, they begin to learn choreography for the songs they sing.
  The choir has received certificates of appreciation from four 
different Presidents, the U.S. Congress, and Disney World Entertainment 
Industry. They have also been recognized by the Governor of Cozumel, 
Mexico, and the Bahamas tourist board, and they have had appearances on 
Good Morning America and The Early Show on CBS.
  In addition to performing, the students also participate in a number 
of ministry activities. In Hawaii, for example, they conducted Vacation 
Bible School and Sports Camp, worked with people who needed help around 
their house, helped at homeless missions, and shared the gospel with 
people who live on the beach.
  The First Baptist Church Youth Choir of Sulphur Springs, TX has not 
only been blessed by the opportunities they have had, but also by the 
people whom they have met and associated with in their travels, and in 
turn the choir has been a blessing to their church and to multitudes of 
people around the world. As they travel to Ireland in July, I ask my 
colleagues to join me in recognizing these outstanding young people and 
commending them for the great work they are doing.
