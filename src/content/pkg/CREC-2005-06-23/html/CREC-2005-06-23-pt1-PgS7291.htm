                          HONORING HAZEL HANON

<bullet> Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I 
rise today to honor Mrs. Hazel Hanon and the incredible work that she 
has done over these past 60 years with the Marshall Post No. 3507 
Ladies Auxiliary of Britton, SD.
  Hazel gained membership to the auxiliary sponsorship of both her 
husband, Leon, who served in the U.S. Navy during WWII, and her 
brother, Dempsy, also a WWII veteran and member of the U.S. Air Force. 
As one of the auxiliary's charter members, save for a short hiatus in 
her membership, Hazel as been with Marshall Post No. 3507 since is 
founding in 1945. Despite the auxiliary's declining membership over the 
past few years, it is clear the organization and Hazel are still 
wholeheartedly committed to supporting America's brave war heroes.
  Over the years the auxiliary has hosted Post Suppers, served 
banquets, sold poppies, organized bake sales, compiled and sold 
cookbooks, and even run an annual Turkey Raffle during Thanksgiving, 
all to raise money for our Nation's veterans. Proceeds from these 
events are then donated to VA Hospitals or used to buy supplies so the 
women can bake cookies and cakes and then personally deliver the 
goodies to veterans in hospitals throughout South Dakota.
  Since the post's founding, Hazel has been extremely giving of her 
time, and her generosity will forever be appreciated. I am pleased that 
her dedication and patriotism are being publicly recognized, and I am 
certain that Hazel's achievements and commitment to the auxiliary will 
serve as inspiration to future generations of passionate and patriotic 
South Dakotans.
  Mr. President, Hazel Hanon is a remarkable person who richly deserves 
this distinguished recognition. I strongly commend her years of work 
and dedication, and it is with great honor that I share her impressive 
accomplishments with my colleagues.<bullet>
