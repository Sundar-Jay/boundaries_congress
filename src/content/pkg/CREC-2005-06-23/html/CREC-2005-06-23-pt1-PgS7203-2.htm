                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Your name in all the Earth. You 
have set Your glory above the Heavens. Lord, we thank You for blessing 
our land with productivity and protection. May we never take these 
gifts for granted.
  Use our Senators as Your instruments across the world to fill the 
emptiness in the lives of others. Lead them to make sacrifices that 
others may find freedom. Open their minds to divine principles, holy 
directives, and undeniable truths as they seek to respond to a world in 
need.
  Lord, move each of us with Your power to comfort the sorrowful, 
strengthen the tempted, inspire the faithful and to save the lost. We 
pray this in Your Holy Name. Amen.
