  Ms. GINNY BROWN-WAITE of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
Keisha Cason of Brooksville, Florida.
  Keisha Cason is a high school senior, who was recently recognized by 
the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) as a 2005 NFIB 
Free Enterprise Scholars Award Program.
  Created in 2002, the award identifies high school seniors from all 
around the country who demonstrate scholarship and entrepreneurial 
achievement. From the 2,100 applicants nominated by NFIB members, an 
independent selection committee selected 378 rising scholars to each 
receive a $1,000 scholarship.
  Keisha Cason represents the future voice of small business in 
America. As one of these gifted youth, she has displayed a sense of 
scholarship and understanding of free enterprise far beyond her years. 
As she makes the transition to college, she will continue to perform at 
the highest standards.
  Mr. Speaker, ambitious young men and women like Keisha Cole should be 
congratulated for their accomplishments. It is truly a privilege to 
honor Keisha Cason for her achievement as a National Federation of 
Independent Business Free Enterprise Scholar.
