                  THE REPUBLICANS AND SOCIAL SECURITY

  (Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, what is it that the 
Republicans really do not like about Social Security? The Social 
Security system has provided retirement security for millions of 
Americans. But every time these Republicans start talking about Social 
Security, things get worse for those retirees. In the Senate the other 
day they talked about a new plan for Social Security that drastically 
cuts the benefits of future retirees and current retirees.
  Then the Republicans on the House side here decided they had a new 
plan yesterday, and what did they decide? After borrowing $700 billion 
from the Social Security trust fund, yesterday the Republicans in the 
House decided to end that trust fund, to get rid of that trust fund, to 
make the solvency of Social Security worse now than it is today. That 
was their plan.
  In the Senate, they cut the benefits and here they end the solvency 
of Social Security by ending the trust fund. They have taken $700 
billion out of the trust fund since George Bush was elected. Bill 
Clinton left them a $5.6 trillion surplus. They squandered it. It is 
gone. And the President has suggested he is not planning to pay it 
back, the first President in the history of the country that said he 
would not pay back the Social Security trust fund, and now these boys 
want to end the whole thing.
