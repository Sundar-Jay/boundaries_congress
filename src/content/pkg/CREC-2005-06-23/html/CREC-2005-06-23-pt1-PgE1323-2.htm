                    NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. BETTY McCOLLUM

                              of minnesota

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 22, 2005

  Ms. McCOLLUM of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the 
Congressional Arts Caucus, I rise today in support of the amendment to 
increase funds by $10 million to the National Endowment for the Arts 
and $5 million to the National Endowment for the Humanities.
  The value of Federal arts programs lies in their ability to nurture 
the growth and artistic excellence of thousands of arts organizations 
and millions of artists throughout the Nation, making a variety of 
arts--performance, graphic, literature, and media--available to 
millions of Americans.
  The NEA is the Nation's largest annual funder of the arts, bringing 
great art--both new and established--to all 50 States, including rural 
communities, inner-city neighborhoods, schools, and military bases.
  Support for the arts is a critical investment in the economic growth 
of every community in this country. The nonprofit arts industry 
generates $134 billion annually in economic activity, supports 4.85 
million jobs, and returns $10.5 billion to the Federal government in 
income taxes.
  Minnesota's 4th Congressional District alone is home to over 1,200 
arts-related businesses that employ nearly 9,000 people. These 
businesses range from theaters, arts schools, museums, architecture 
firms, and advertising agencies. In addition, unnumbered individual and 
freelance artists call my district their home. I am proud to represent 
these artists and their families.
  I appreciate how the arts deeply enrich Minnesota. The educational, 
cultural, and economic impact of the arts is very measurable. Not only 
do 95% of Minnesotans believe that the arts are an important or 
essential part of the education of Minnesota children, but 67% of 
Minnesotans have attended an arts activity themselves within the past 
year. In addition, the arts in Minnesota have over a $1 billion 
economic impact annually.
  Arts education has also been proven to help students increase 
cognitive development, inspire creativity, and enhance problem-solving 
skills. At a time when students are expected to take more high stakes 
tests, we must support the activities, such as the arts, that encourage 
their success.
  It is with a commitment to the economic, social, and cultural well-
being of my district, and of the Nation, that I rise today in support 
of the National Endowment for the Arts.
