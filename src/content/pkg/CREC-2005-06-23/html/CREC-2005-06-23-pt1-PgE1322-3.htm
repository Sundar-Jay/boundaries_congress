                                 ______
                                 

                    HON. F. JAMES SENSENBRENNER, JR.

                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 22, 2005

  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing a bill to 
codify and enact certain existing laws related to National and 
Commercial Space Programs as Title 51 of the United States Code. The 
bill was prepared by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel as part of 
that office's ongoing responsibility to prepare, and submit to the 
Committee on the Judiciary one Title at a time, a complete compilation, 
restatement, and revision of the general and permanent laws of the 
United States.
  All changes in existing law made by this bill are purely technical in 
nature. The bill was prepared in accordance with the statutory standard 
for codification legislation, which is that the restatement of existing 
law shall conform to the understood policy, intent, and purpose of the 
Congress in the original enactments, with such amendments and 
corrections as will remove ambiguities, contradictions, and other 
imperfections.
  The bill, along with a detailed section-by-section explanation of the 
bill, can be accessed on the Internet site of the Office of the Law 
Revision Counsel (<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/">http://uscode.house.gov/</a>). Persons interested in 
obtaining a printed copy of the bill and explanation, and persons 
interested in submitting comments on the bill, should contact Rob 
Sukol, Assistant Counsel, Office of the Law Revision Counsel, U.S. 
House of Representatives, H2-304 Ford House Office Building, 
Washington, DC, 20515. The telephone number is 202-226-9060. Comments 
on the bill should be submitted to the Office of the Law Revision 
Counsel no later than 60 days after date of introduction.

                          ____________________
