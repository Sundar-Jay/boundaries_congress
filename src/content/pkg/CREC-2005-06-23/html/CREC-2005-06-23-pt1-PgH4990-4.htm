             CELEBRATING A CENTURY OF ROTARY INTERNATIONAL

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, more than 40,000 business 
and professional leaders from 150 countries have come together this 
week to attend Rotary International's Centennial Convention led by 
President Glenn Estess, Sr., in Chicago.
  During their first 100 years, Rotary International grew from a small 
club established by Paul Harris in Chicago to a diverse international 
network of community volunteers who are dedicated to building peace and 
goodwill in the world. Today, approximately 1.2 million Rotarians 
belong to more than 32,000 Rotary Clubs in 161 countries.
  Rotarians are carrying out humanitarian projects in their own 
neighborhoods, promoting youth exchanges, and raising money to 
eradicate polio worldwide.
  As a former Rotary Club president, I am proud to recognize the 
organization's distinguished record of volunteerism and thank all 
Rotarians who contribute to the success of this vital organization. I 
also appreciate my district director, Butch Wallace, as president of 
the West Metro Rotary Club; and my chief of staff, Eric Dell, as 
president of the Capitol Hill Rotary Club.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget 
September 11.
