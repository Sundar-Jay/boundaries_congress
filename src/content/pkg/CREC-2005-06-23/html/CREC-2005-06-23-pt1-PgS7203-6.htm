                                SCHEDULE

  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this morning we will resume debate on the 
Energy bill, with the time equally divided until the cloture vote, 
which is scheduled for 10 a.m., about an hour from now. I expect that 
cloture will be invoked on the bill today. We have now debated the bill 
and the amendments for almost 2 weeks, and it is time that we move 
toward final passage, which I hope and believe will be today.
  Senators Domenici and Bingaman have been on the floor and available 
to consider amendments during the entire 2-week process. I congratulate 
them on moving this bill forward in a very efficient and timely way.
  I do hope that once cloture is invoked, we will find a way to bring 
this bill to completion this afternoon or evening. As I mentioned last 
night before closing, if Members do cooperate and show restraint with 
their amendments, we could certainly finish at a reasonable hour, and I 
hope we will accomplish that. If Members wait and come forward at the 
very last minute, it will be necessary to stay here until very late 
tonight, indeed until tomorrow. So it really is up to us how we handle 
it. I encourage our colleagues to come to the floor and talk to the 
managers as soon as possible if they wish to offer their amendments.
  I do think we are on the glidepath to completing this bill. As I 
mentioned last night, following completion of the bill, hopefully 
tomorrow, we would begin the Interior appropriations bill. The 
Democratic leader and I will be having more to say about that.
