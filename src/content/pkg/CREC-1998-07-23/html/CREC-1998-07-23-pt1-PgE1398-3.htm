         DISAPPROVAL OF MOST-FAVORED-NATION TREATMENT FOR CHINA

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. CASS BALLENGER

                           of north carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 22, 1998

  Mr. BALLENGER. Mr. Speaker, once again, legislation to overturn our 
current trade relations with the People's Republic of China has reached 
the House floor. This annual exercise divides our nation over our 
relationship with the most populous nation in the world. The only thing 
which has changed is the terminology. We now refer to Most Favored 
Nation (MFN) trading status as simply Normal Trade Relations (NTR), a 
more accurate description of this annual trade vote.
  I will reluctantly vote against the resolution, Disapproving the 
Extension of Nondiscriminatory Treatment to the Products of the 
People's Republic of China (H.J. Res. 121), before us toady. I do 
recognize China's deplorable record on human rights and our moral 
obligation to speak out for the weak and voiceless in China. However, 
in reaching my decision, I again asked myself these questions, ``In the 
long run, will revoking China's trade status be good or harmful to the 
Chinese and the American people, and will it improve human rights in 
China?'' I must conclude that revoking China's trade status would be 
counterproductive to these objectives.
  As I have stated previously, the U.S. can do more to advance the 
cause of human rights and foster religious, economic and political 
freedom if we continue to engage the Chinese in economic cooperation. 
Social freedom--like freedom of religion--are a direct result of 
economic liberalization. If we remove all of China's trade privileges, 
we are not only isolating that country, but we are losing any 
opportunity to improve the human condition there.
  Terminating normal trade relations with China will hurt the American 
worker and consumer as well. From 1991 to 1997, U.S. exports to China 
rose 71% from $7.5 billion to $12.8 billion. In addition, exports of 
U.S. goods and services to China and Hong Kong support an estimated 
450,000 American jobs. From an agricultural perspective, the American 
Farm Bureau has called China ``the most important growth market for 
U.S. agriculture in the twenty-first century.'' The United States 
Department of Agriculture estimates that China could account for one-
third of future growth in u.S. farm exports in the years ahead.
  Despite my position on NTR with China, I remain concerned about 
allegations that the Clinton White House violated existing campaign 
finance laws by accepting illegal foreign contributions from China. In 
return, the Clinton administration sacrificed American national 
security by allowing the Loral Space and Communications Ltd. and 
another U.S. company to provide China's space industry with specific 
technological expertise, strengthening its nuclear and missile 
capabilities. I believe the Congress has an obligation to look into 
these critical charges, and I support all efforts to continue House and 
Senate investigations.
  In conclusion, if we choose to cut off our ties with China, we end up 
harming those who need our help the most--the Chinese people. Just as 
important, we hurt American workers, farmers and businesses which would 
export to china, now and in the future. I urge my colleagues to vote 
down H.J. Res. 121.
