                     RESULTS OF MANAGED CARE REFORM

  (Ms. SANCHEZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Ms. SANCHEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today to share with my colleagues 
the success of a forum I hosted in my district on managed care reform. 
Since I came to Congress, I have listened closely to the managed care 
reform debate. I have also read the newspapers, I have seen the polls, 
and I have heard the horror stories.
  This past weekend I did what every Member of this Congress should do, 
I heard from my communities. I learned that my communities do want 
reform and do want some type of Patients' Bill of Rights. They want 
Congress to initiate reform and to keep the interest of the patients in 
mind.
  My constituents believe that HMOs are the future of health care, but 
they want to make sure that care is put above profits. Any bill that we 
pass is going to affect each one of these people, millions of Americans 
and thousands of Orange County residents.
  Now, we may have to take some votes this week on the managed care 
bill offered by the Republicans. Let me tell you, they are not very 
happy about that bill. But before you decide to vote for any bill, I 
want to encourage my colleagues to host similar forums in their 
districts. By listening to your constituents, you will learn what 
changes are really needed. It is time that we give our constituents a 
voice before their choice is taken away.
