     of local government that has submitted an application under

     assurances required by section 4(c).
       (d) Adjustments.--
       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), the Director 
     shall adjust a payment under this Act to a unit of local 
     government to the extent that a prior payment to the unit of

     be paid.
       (2) Considerations.--The Director may increase or decrease 
     under this subsection a payment to a unit of local government 
     only if the Director determines the need for the increase or

     not later than 1 year after the end of the payment period for 
     which a payment was made.
       (e) Reservation for Adjustment.--The Director may reserve a 
     percentage of not more than 2 percent of the amount under 
     this section for a payment period for all units of local 
     government in a State if the Director considers the reserve 
     is necessary to ensure the availability of sufficient amounts

     among the units of local government in the State.
       (f) Repayment of Unexpended Amounts.--
       (1) Repayment required.--A unit of local government shall 
     repay to the Director, by not later than 27 months after 
     receipt of funds from the Director, any amount that is--
       (A) paid to the unit from amounts appropriated under the 
     authority of this section; and
       (B) not expended by the unit within 2 years after receipt 
     of such funds from the Director.
       (2) Penalty for failure to repay.--If the amount required 
     to be repaid is not repaid, the Director shall reduce payment 
     in future payment periods accordingly.
       (3) Deposit of amounts repaid.--Amounts received by the 
     Director as repayments under this subsection shall be 
     deposited in a designated fund for future payments to units 
     of local government. Any amounts remaining in such designated 
     fund after 5 years following the date of enactment of this 
     Act shall be applied to the Federal deficit or, if there is 
     no Federal deficit, to reducing the Federal debt.
       (g) Nonsupplanting Requirement.--Funds made available under 
     this Act to units of local government shall not be used to 
     supplant State or local funds, but shall be used to increase 
     the amount of funds that would, in the absence of funds made 
     available under this Act, be made available from State or 
     local sources.
       (h) Matching Funds.--The Federal share of a grant received 
     under this Act may not exceed 90 percent of the costs of a 
     program or proposal funded under this Act. No funds provided 
     under this Act may be used as matching funds for any other

       (3) Proportional reduction.--If amounts available to carry 
     out paragraph (2) for any payment period are insufficient to 
     pay in full the total payment that any State is otherwise 
     eligible to receive under paragraph (1) for such period, then 
     the Director shall reduce payments under paragraph (1) for 
     such payment period to the extent of such insufficiency. 
     Reductions under the preceding sentence shall be allocated 
     among the States (other than States whose payment is 
     determined under paragraph (2)) in the same proportions as 
     amounts would be allocated under paragraph (1) without regard 
     to paragraph (2).
       (b) Local Distribution.--
       (1) In general.--From the amount reserved for each State 
     under subsection (a), the Director shall allocate among units 
     of local government an amount that bears the same ratio to 
     the aggregate amount of such funds as
       (A) the product of--
       (i) two-thirds; multiplied by
       (ii) the ratio of the average annual number of part 1 
     violent crimes in such unit of local government for the 3 
     most recent calendar years for which such data is available, 
     to the sum of such violent crime in all units of local 
     government in the State; and
       (B) the product of--
       (i) one-third; multiplied by
       (ii) the ratio of the law enforcement expenditure, for such 
     unit of local government for the most recent year for which 
     such data are available, to such expenditures for all units 
     of local government in the State.
       (2) Expenditures.--The allocation any unit of local 
     government shall receive under paragraph (1) for a payment 
     period shall not exceed 100 percent of law enforcement 
     expenditures of the unit for such payment period.
       (3) Reallocation.--The amount of any unit of local 
     government's allocation that is not available to such unit by 
     operation of paragraph (2) shall be available to other units 
     of local government that are not affected by such operation 
     in accordance with this subsection.
       (4) Local governments with allocations of less than 
     $10,000.--If under paragraph (1) a unit of local government 
     is allotted less than $10,000 for the payment period, the 
     amount allotted shall be transferred to the chief executive 
     officer of the State who shall distribute such funds among 
     State police departments that provide law enforcement 
     services to units of local government and units of local 
     government whose allotment is less than such amount in a 
     manner that reduces crime and improves public safety.
       (5) Special rule.--If a unit of local government in the 
     State has been annexed since the date of the collection of 
     the data used by the Director in making allocations pursuant 
     to this section, the Director shall pay the amount that would 
     have been allocated to such unit of local government to the 
     unit of local government that annexed it.
       (c) Grants to Indian Tribes.--Notwithstanding subsections 
     (a) and (b), of the amount appropriated under section 3(a) in 
     each of fiscal years 1998 through 2003, the Attorney General 
     shall reserve 0.3 percent for grants to Indian tribal 
     governments performing law enforcement functions, to be used 
     for the purposes described in section 2. To be eligible to 
     receive a grant with amounts set aside under this subsection, 
     an Indian tribal government shall submit to the Attorney 
     General an application in such form and containing such 
     information as the Attorney General may by regulation 
     require.
       (d) Unavailability and Inaccuracy of Information.--
       (1) Data for states.--For purposes of this section, if data 
     regarding part 1 violent crimes in any State for the 3 most 
     recent calendar years is unavailable, insufficient, or 
     substantially inaccurate, the Director shall utilize the best 
     available comparable data regarding the number of violent 
     crimes for such years for such State for the purposes of 
     allocation of any funds under this Act.
       (2) Possible inaccuracy of data for units of local 
     government.--In addition to the provisions of paragraph (1), 
     if the Director believes that the reported rate of part 1 
     violent crimes or legal expenditure information for a unit of 
     local government is insufficient or inaccurate, the Director 
     shall--
       (A) investigate the methodology used by such unit to 
     determine the accuracy of the submitted data; and
       (B) when necessary, use the best available comparable data 
     regarding the number of violent crimes or legal expenditure 
     information for such years for such unit of local government.

     SEC. 6. UTILIZATION OF PRIVATE SECTOR.

       Funds or a portion of funds allocated under this Act may be 
     utilized to contract with private, nonprofit entities or 
     community-based organizations to carry out the purposes 
     specified under section 2(a)(2).

     SEC. 7. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION.

       (a) In General.--A unit of local government expending 
     payments under this Act shall hold not less than 1 public 
     hearing on the proposed use of the payment from the Director 
     in relation to its entire budget.
       (b) Views.--At the hearing, persons shall be given an 
     opportunity to provide written and oral views to the unit of 
     local government authority responsible for enacting the 
     budget.
       (c) Time and Place.--The unit of local government shall 
     hold the hearing at a time and place that allows and 
     encourages public attendance and participation.

     SEC. 8. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS.

       The administrative provisions of part H of the Omnibus 
     Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3782 et 
     seq.), shall apply to this Act and for purposes of this 
     section any reference in such provisions to title I of the 
     Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 
     3711 et seq.) shall be deemed to be a reference to this Act.

     SEC. 423. TEMPORARY PROHIBITION ON IMPLEMENTATION OR 
                   ENFORCEMENT OF PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM TREATMENT 
                   REQUIREMENTS FOR COPPER ACTION LEVEL.

       (a) In General.--None of the funds made available by this 
     or any other Act for any fiscal year may be used by the 
     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to 
     implement or enforce the national primary drinking water 
     regulations for lead and copper in drinking water promulgated 
     under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), 
     to the extent that the regulations pertain to the public 
     water system treatment requirements related to the copper 
     action level, until--
       (1) the Administrator and the Director of the Centers for 
     Disease Control and Prevention jointly conduct a study to 
     establish a reliable dose-response relationship for the 
     adverse human health effects that may result from exposure to 
     copper in drinking water, that--
       (A) includes an analysis of the health effects that may be 
     experienced by groups within the general population 
     (including infants) that are potentially at greater risk of 
     adverse health effects as the result of the exposure;
       (B) is conducted in consultation with interested States;
       (C) is based on the best available science and supporting 
     studies that are subject to peer review and conducted in 
     accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; and
       (D) is completed not later than 30 months after the date of 
     enactment of this Act; and
       (2) based on the results of the study and, once peer 
     reviewed and published, the 2 studies of copper in drinking 
     water conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and 
     Prevention in the State of Nebraska and the State of 
     Delaware, the Administrator establishes an action level for 
     the presence of copper in drinking water that protects the 
     public health against reasonably expected adverse effects due 
     to exposure to copper in drinking water.
       (b) Current Requirements.--Nothing in this section 
     precludes a State from implementing or enforcing the national 
     primary

[[Page S8930]]

     drinking water regulations for lead and copper in drinking 
     water promulgated under the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 
     U.S.C. 300f et seq.) that are in effect on the date of 
     enactment of this Act, to the extent that the regulations 
     pertain to the public water system treatment requirements 
     related to the copper action level.

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This title may be cited as the ``National Whale 
     Conservation Fund Act of 1998''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds that--
       (1) the populations of whales that occur in waters of the 
     United States are resources of substantial ecological, 
     scientific, socioeconomic, and esthetic value;
       (2) whale populations--
       (A) form a significant component of marine ecosystems;
       (B) are the subject of intense research;
       (C) provide for a multimillion dollar whale watching 
     tourist industry that provides the public an opportunity to 
     enjoy and learn about great whales and the ecosystems of 
     which the whales are a part; and
       (D) are of importance to Native Americans for cultural and 
     subsistence purposes;
       (3) whale populations are in various stages of recovery, 
     and some whale populations, such as the northern right whale 
     (Eubaleana glacialis) remain perilously close to extinction;
       (4) the interactions that occur between ship traffic, 
     commercial fishing, whale watching vessels, and other 
     recreational vessels and whale populations may affect whale 
     populations adversely;
       (5) the exploration and development of oil, gas, and hard 
     mineral resources, marine debris, chemical pollutants, noise, 
     and other anthropogenic sources of change in the habitat of 
     whales may affect whale populations adversely;
       (6) the conservation of whale populations is subject to 
     difficult challenges related to--
       (A) the migration of whale populations across international 
     boundaries;
       (B) the size of individual whales, as that size precludes 
     certain conservation research procedures that may be used for 
     other animal species, such as captive research and breeding;
       (C) the low reproductive rates of whales that require long-
     term conservation programs to ensure recovery of whale 
     populations; and
       (D) the occurrence of whale populations in offshore waters 
     where undertaking research, monitoring, and conservation 
     measures is difficult and costly;
       (7)(A) the Secretary of Commerce, through the Administrator 
     of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has 
     research and regulatory responsibility for the conservation 
     of whales under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 
     U.S.C. 1361 et seq.); and
       (B) the heads of other Federal agencies and the Marine 
     Mammal Commission established under section 201 of the Marine 
     Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1401) have related 
     research and management activities under the Marine Mammal 
     Protection Act of 1972 or the Endangered Species Act of 1973 
     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.);
       (8) the funding available for the activities described in 
     paragraph (8) is insufficient to support all necessary whale 
     conservation and recovery activities; and
       (9) there is a need to facilitate the use of funds from 
     non-Federal sources to carry out the conservation of whales.

     SEC. 3. NATIONAL WHALE CONSERVATION FUND.

       Section 4 of the National Fish and Wildlife Establishment 
     Act (16 U.S.C. 3703) is amended by adding at the end the 
     following:
       ``(f)(1) In carrying out the purposes under section 2(b), 
     the Foundation may establish a national whale conservation 
     endowment fund, to be used by the Foundation to support 
     research, management activities, or educational programs that 
     contribute to the protection, conservation, or recovery of 
     whale populations in waters of the United States.
       ``(2)(A) In a manner consistent with subsection (c)(1), the 
     Foundation may--
       ``(i) accept, receive, solicit, hold, administer, and use 
     any gift, devise, or bequest made to the Foundation for the 
     express purpose of supporting whale conservation; and
       ``(ii) deposit in the endowment fund under paragraph (1) 
     any funds made available to the Foundation under this 
     subparagraph, including any income or interest earned from a 
     gift, devise, or bequest received by the Foundation under 
     this subparagraph.
       ``(B) To raise funds to be deposited in the endowment fund 
     under paragraph (1), the Foundation may enter into 
     appropriate arrangements to provide for the design, 
     copyright, production, marketing, or licensing, of logos, 
     seals, decals, stamps, or any other item that the Foundation 
     determines to be appropriate.
       ``(C)(i) The Secretary of Commerce may transfer to the 
     Foundation for deposit in the endowment fund under paragraph 
     (1)--
       ``(I) any amount (or portion thereof) received by the 
     Secretary under section 105(a)(1) of the Marine Mammal 
     Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1375(a)(1)) as a civil 
     penalty assessed by the Secretary under that section; or
       ``(II) any amount (or portion thereof) received by the 
     Secretary as a settlement or award for damages in a civil 
     action or other legal proceeding relating to damage of 
     natural resources.
       ``(ii) The Directors of the Board shall ensure that any 
     amounts transferred to the Foundation under clause (i) for 
     the endowment fund under paragraph (1) are deposited in that 
     fund in accordance with this subparagraph.
       ``(3) It is the intent of Congress that in making 
     expenditures from the endowment fund under paragraph (1) to 
     carry out activities specified in that paragraph, the 
     Foundation should give priority to funding projects that 
     address the conservation of populations of whales that the 
     Foundation determines--
       ``(A) are the most endangered (including the northern right 
     whale (Eubaleana glacialis)); or
       ``(B) most warrant, and are most likely to benefit from, 
     research managment, or educational activities that may be 
     funded with amounts made available from the fund.

       ``(g) In carrying out any action on the part of the 
     Foundation under subsection (f), the Directors of the Board 
     shall consult with the Administrator of the National Oceanic 
     and Atmospheric Administration and the Marine Mammal 
     Commission.''.

                LIEBERMAN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMNT NO. 3280

  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Graham, Mr. Lugar, Mr. 
Bingaman, Mr. Mack, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Reid, Mr. 
Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Smith of Oregon) proposed an 
amendment to the bill, S. 2260, supra; as follows:

       At the appropriate place in title VI, insert the following 
     new section:

     SEC. 6____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING JAPAN'S RECESSION.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) The United States and Japan share common goals of 
     peace, stability, democracy, and economic prosperity in East 
     and Southeast Asia and around the world.
       (2) Japan's economic and financial crisis represents a new 
     challenge to United States-Japanese cooperation to achieve 
     these common goals and threatens the economic stability of 
     East and Southeast Asia and the United States.
       (3) A strong United States-Japanese alliance is critical to 
     stability in East and Southeast Asia.
       (4) The importance of the United States-Japanese alliance 
     was reaffirmed by the President of the United States and the 
     Prime Minister of Japan in the April 1996 Joint Security 
     Declaration.
       (5) United States-Japanese bilateral military cooperation 
     was enhanced with the revision of the United States 
     Guidelines for Defense Cooperation in 1997.
       (6) The Japanese economy, the second largest in the world 
     and over 2 times larger than the economy in the rest of East 
     Asia, has been growing at a little over 1 percent annually 
     since 1991 and is currently in a recession with some 
     forecasts suggesting that it will contract by 1.5 percent in 
     1998.
       (7) The estimated $574,000,000,000 of problem loans in 
     Japan's banking sector and other problems associated with an 
     unstable banking sector remain the major roadblock to 
     economic recovery in Japan.
       (8) The recent weakness in the yen, following a 10 percent 
     depreciation of the yen against the dollar over the last 5 
     months and a 45 percent depreciation since 1995, has placed 
     competitive price pressures on United States industries and 
     workers and is putting downward pressure on China and the 
     rest of the economies in East and Southeast Asia to begin 
     another round of competitive currency devaluations.
       (9) Japan's current account surplus has increased by 60 
     percent over the last 12 months from 71,579,000,000 yen in 
     1996 to 114,357,000,000 yen in 1997.
       (10) A period of deflation in Japan would lead to lower 
     demand for United States products.
       (11) The unnecessary and burdensome regulation of the 
     Japanese market constrains Japanese economic growth and 
     raises costs to business and consumers.
       (12) Deregulating Japan's economy and spurring economic 
     growth would ultimately benefit the Japanese people with a 
     higher standard of living and a more secure future.
       (13) Japan's economic recession is slowing the growth of 
     the United States gross domestic product and job creation in 
     the United States.
       (14) Japan has made significant efforts to restore economic 
     growth with a 16,000,000,000,000 yen stimulus package that 
     includes 4,500,000,000,000 yen in tax cuts and 
     11,500,000,000,000 yen in government spending, a Total Plan 
     to restore stability to the private banking sector, and joint 
     intervention with the United States to strengthen the value 
     of the yen in international currency markets.
       (15) The people of Japan expressed deep concern about 
     economic conditions and government leadership in the Upper 
     House elections held on July 12, 1998.
       (16) The Prime Minister of Japan tendered his resignation 
     on July 13, 1998, to take responsibility for the Liberal 
     Democratic Party's poor election results and to acknowledge 
     the desire of the people of Japan for new leadership to 
     restore economic stability.
       (17) Japan's economic recession is having an adverse effect 
     on the economy of the United States and is now seriously 
     threatening the 9 years of unprecedented economic expansion 
     in the United States.
       (18) Japan's economic recession is having an adverse effect 
     on the recovery of the East and Southeast Asian economies.
       (19) The American people and the countries of East and

     that--
       (1) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the 
     United States Trade Representative should emphasize the 
     importance of financial deregulation, including banking 
     reform, market deregulation, and restructuring bad bank debt 
     as fundamental to Japan's economic recovery; and
       (2) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the 
     United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of 
     Commerce, and the Secretary of State should communicate to 
     the Japanese Government that the first priority of the new 
     Prime Minister of Japan and his Cabinet should be to restore 
     economic growth in Japan and promote stability in 
     international financial markets.

       In implementing this title, the President of the United

     the least burdensome for growers;
       Which assures an adequate labor supply for growers in a 
     predictable and timely manner;

     U.S. farm workers and a means for mitigating against the 
     development of a structural dependency on foreign workers in 
     an area or crop;
       Which avoids the transfer of costs and risks from 
     businesses to low wage workers;
       That encourages longer periods of employment for legal U.S.

       Which assures decent wages and working conditions for

     conditions.

     of this Act; or
       (ii) the date on which the Secretary sets the amount of the 
     fee or surcharge in accordance with paragraph (3).
       (2) Period of validity of visas.--
       (A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), if 
     the fee for a machine readable combined border crossing card 
     and nonimmigrant visa issued under section 101(a)(15)(B) of 
     the Immigration and Nationality Act has been waived under 
     paragraph (1) for a child under 15 years of age, the machine 
     readable combined border crossing card and nonimmigrant visa 
     shall be issued to expire on the earlier of--
       (i) the date on which the child attains the age of 15; or
       (ii) ten years after its date of issue.
       (B) Exception.--At the request of the parent or guardian of

2260, supra; as follows:

       On page 100, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:
       Sec. 407. (a) The purpose of this section is to protect the 
     national security interests of the United States while 
     studying the appropriate level of resources to improve the 
     issuance of visas to legitimate foreign travelers.
       (b) Congress recognizes the importance of maintaining 
     quality service by consular officers in the processing of 
     applications for nonimmigrant visas and finds that this 
     requirement should be reflected in any timeliness standards 
     or other regulations governing the issuance of visas.
       (c) The Secretary of State shall conduct a study to 
     determine, with respect to the processing of nonimmigrant 
     visas within the Department of State--
       (1) the adequacy of staffing at United States consular 
     posts, particularly during peak travel periods;
       (2) the adequacy of service to international tourism;
       (3) the adequacy of computer and technical support to 
     consular posts; and
       (4) the appropriate standard to determine whether a country 
     qualifies as a pilot program country under the visa waiver 
     pilot program in section 217 of the Immigration and 
     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187).
       (d)(1) Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment 
     of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a report to 
     Congress setting forth--
       (A) the results of the study conducted under subsection

     the Secretary of State shall submit a report to Congress 
     describing the implementation of timeliness standards during 
     the preceding year.
       (e) In this section--
       (1) the term ``nonimmigrant visas'' means visas issued to 
     aliens described in section 101(a)(15) of the Immigration and 
     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)); and
       (2) the term ``timeliness standards'' means standards

                        BIDEN AMENDMENT NO. 3294

  Mr. GREGG (for Mr. Biden) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 2260, 
supra; as follows:


[[Page S8934]]


       On page 96, strike lines 3 through 16.

                              AN AMENDMENT

       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:
       Sec. ____. (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the 
     ``American Competitiveness Act''.
       (b) References in Act.--Except as otherwise specifically 
     provided in this Act, whenever in this Act an amendment or 
     repeal is expressed as an amendment to or a repeal of a 
     provision, the reference shall be deemed to be made to the 
     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.).
       (c) Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) American companies today are engaged in fierce 
     competition in global markets.
       (2) Companies across America are faced with severe high 
     skill labor shortages that threaten their competitiveness.
       (3) The National Software Alliance, a consortium of 
     concerned government, industry, and academic leaders that 
     includes the United States Army, Navy, and Air Force, has 
     concluded that ``The supply of computer science graduates is 
     far short of the number needed by industry.''. The Alliance 
     concludes that the current severe understaffing could lead to 
     inflation and lower productivity.
       (4) The Department of Labor projects that the United States 
     economy will produce more than 130,000 information technology 
     jobs in each of the next 10 years, for a total of more than 
     1,300,000.
       (5) Between 1986 and 1995, the number of bachelor's degrees 
     awarded in computer science declined by 42 percent. 
     Therefore, any short-term increases in enrollment may only 
     return the United States to the 1986 level of graduates and 
     take several years to produce these additional graduates.
       (6) A study conducted by Virginia Tech for the Information 
     Technology Association of America estimates that there are 
     more than 340,000 unfilled positions for highly skilled 
     information technology workers in American companies.
       (7) The Hudson Institute estimates that the unaddressed 
     shortage of skilled workers throughout the United States 
     economy will result in a 5-percent drop in the growth rate of 
     GDP. That translates into approximately $200,000,000,000 in 
     lost output, nearly $1,000 for every American.
       (8) It is necessary to deal with the current situation with 
     both short-term and long-term measures.
       (9) In fiscal year 1997, United States companies and 
     universities reached the cap of 65,000 on H-1B temporary 
     visas a month before the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal 
     year 1998 the cap is expected to be reached as early as May 
     if Congress takes no action. And it will be hit earlier each 
     year until backlogs develop of such a magnitude as to prevent 
     United States companies and researchers from having any 
     timely access to skilled foreign-born professionals.
       (10) It is vital that more American young people be 
     encouraged and equipped to enter technical fields, such as 
     mathematics, engineering, and computer science.
       (11) If American companies cannot find home-grown talent, 
     and if they cannot bring talent to this country, a large 
     number are likely to move key operations overseas, sending 
     those and related American jobs with them.
       (12) Inaction in these areas will carry significant 
     consequences for the future of American competitiveness 
     around the world and will seriously undermine efforts to 
     create and keep jobs in the United States.
       (d) Establishment of H1-C Nonimmigrant Category.--
       (1) In general.--Section 101(a)(15)(H)(i) (8 U.S.C. 
     1101(a)(15)(H)(i)) is amended--
       (A) by inserting ``and other than services described in 
     clause (c)'' after ``subparagraph (O) or (P)''; and
       (B) by inserting after ``section 212(n)(1)'' the following: 
     ``, or (c) who is coming temporarily to the United States to 
     perform labor as a health care worker, other than a 
     physician, in a specialty occupation described in section 
     214(i)(1), who meets the requirements of the occupation 
     specified in section 214(i)(2), who qualifies for the 
     exemption from the grounds of inadmissibility described in 
     section 212(a)(5)(C), and with respect to whom the Attorney 
     General certifies that the intending employer has filed with 
     the Attorney General an application under section 
     212(n)(1).''.
       (2) Conforming amendments.--

     of enactment of this Act, for issuance of a visa under 
     section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) of the Immigration and 
     Nationality Act on behalf of an alien described in the 
     amendment made by paragraph (1)(B) shall, on and after that 
     date, be treated as a petition filed under section 
     101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) of that Act, as added by paragraph (1).
       (e) Annual Ceilings for H1-B and H1-C Workers.--
       (1) Amendment of the INA.--Section 214(g)(1) (8 U.S.C. 
     1184(g)(1)) is amended to read as follows:

     or otherwise provided nonimmigrant status during any fiscal 
     year--
       ``(A) under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b)--
       ``(i) for each of fiscal years 1992 through 1997, and for 
     any other fiscal year for which this subsection does not 
     specify a higher ceiling, may not exceed 65,000,
       ``(ii) for fiscal year 1998, may not exceed 95,000,
       ``(iii) for fiscal year 1999, may not exceed the number 
     determined for fiscal year 1998 under such section, minus 
     10,000, plus the number of unused visas under subparagraph 
     (B) for the fiscal year preceding the applicable fiscal year, 
     and
       ``(iv) for fiscal year 2000, and each applicable fiscal 
     year thereafter through fiscal year 2002, may not exceed the 
     number determined for fiscal year 1998 under such section, 
     minus 10,000, plus the number of unused visas under 
     subparagraph (B) for the fiscal year preceding the applicable 
     fiscal year, plus the number of unused visas under 
     subparagraph (C) for the fiscal year preceding the applicable 
     fiscal year;
       ``(B) under section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b), beginning with 
     fiscal year 1992, may not exceed 66,000; or
       ``(C) under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c), beginning with 
     fiscal year 1999, may not exceed 10,000.

     For purposes of determining the ceiling under subparagraph 
     (A) (iii) and (iv), not more than 20,000 of the unused visas 
     under subparagraph (B) may be taken into account for any 
     fiscal year.''.
       (2) Transition procedures.--Any visa issued or nonimmigrant 
     status otherwise accorded to any alien under clause (i)(b) or 
     (ii)(b) of section 101(a)(15)(H) of the Immigration and 
     Nationality Act pursuant to a petition filed during fiscal 
     year 1998 but approved on or after October 1, 1998, shall be 
     counted against the applicable ceiling in section 214(g)(1) 
     of that Act for fiscal year 1998 (as amended by paragraph (1) 
     of this subsection), except that, in the case where counting 
     the visa or the other granting of status would cause the 
     applicable ceiling for fiscal year 1998 to be exceeded, the 
     visa or grant of status shall be counted against the 
     applicable ceiling for fiscal year 1999.
       (f) Degrees in Mathematics, Computer Science, and 
     Engineering.--Subpart 4 of part A of title IV of the Higher 
     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070c et seq.) is amended in 
     section 415A(b) (20 U.S.C. 1070c(b)), by adding at the end 
     the following new paragraph:
       ``(3) Mathematics, computer science, and engineering 
     scholarships.--It shall be a permissible use of the funds 
     made available to a State under this section for the State to

     through ``an application--'' and inserting ``a willful 
     failure to meet a condition in paragraph (1) or a willful

     212(a)(5)(A) in the case of an employee of--
       ``(A) an institution of higher education (as defined in 
     section 1201(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965), or a 
     related or affiliated nonprofit entity, or

     wheat industries; and

     the requirements for cross-border transportation of grain 
     between Canada and the United States.

       (1) In general.--If, based on the investigation conducted 
     pursuant to this section, there is an affirmative 
     determination under subsection (b) with respect to any act,

     of 1930, or title II or III of the Trade Act of 1974.
       (2) Correction of harmonization problems.--If, based on the 
     investigation conducted pursuant to this section, there is a

     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(m)) is amended to read as 
     follows:
       ``(m)(1) The qualifications referred to in section 
     101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c), with respect to alien who is coming to 
     the United States to perform nursing services for a facility, 
     are that the alien--

     practice professional nursing in the country where the alien 
     obtained nursing education or has received nursing education 
     in the United States;

     registered nurses who are United States citizens or 
     immigrants who are authorized to perform nursing services, in

     dependence of the facility on nonimmigrant registered nurses.
       ``(v) There is not a strike or lockout in the course of a 
     labor dispute, and the employment of such an alien is not 
     intended or designed to influence an election for a

     registered nurses under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c), notice

     representative, notice of the filing has been provided to the 
     registered nurses employed at the facility through posting in 
     conspicuous locations.

     of aliens issued visas or otherwise provided nonimmigrant 
     status under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(c) that exceeds 33

     facility to have taken significant steps described in such 
     clause before the date of the enactment of the Health 
     Professional Shortage Area Nursing Relief Act of 1998. A copy 
     of the attestation shall be provided, within 30 days of the 
     date of filing, to registered nurses employed at the facility 
     on the date of the filing.
       ``(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iv), each of the

     training program for registered nurses elsewhere.

     admission it was applied (in accordance with clause (ii)); 
     and
       ``(ii) shall apply to petitions filed during the one-year 
     period beginning on the date of its filing with the Secretary 
     of Labor if the facility states in each such petition that it

     the facility's attestation under subparagraph (A) (and 
     accompanying documentation) and each such petition filed by 
     the facility.
       ``(ii) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a process, 
     including reasonable time limits, for the receipt, 
     investigation, and disposition of complaints respecting a 
     facility's failure to meet conditions attested to or a

     attestation. Complaints may be filed by any aggrieved person 
     or organization (including bargaining representatives, 
     associations deemed appropriate by the Secretary, and other 
     aggrieved parties as determined under regulations of the 
     Secretary). The Secretary shall conduct an investigation 
     under this clause if there is reasonable cause to believe 
     that a facility fails to meet conditions attested to. Subject 
     to the time limits established under this clause, this 
     subparagraph shall apply regardless of whether an attestation 
     is expired or unexpired at the time a complaint is filed.
       ``(iii) Under such process, the Secretary shall provide, 
     within 180 days after the date such a complaint is filed, for 
     a determination as to whether or not a basis exists to make a 
     finding described in clause (iv). If the Secretary determines 
     that such a basis exists, the Secretary shall provide for 
     notice of such determination to the interested parties and an 
     opportunity for a hearing on the complaint within 60 days of 
     the date of the determination.

     opportunity for a hearing, that a facility (for which an 
     attestation is made) has failed to meet a condition attested 
     to or that there was a misrepresentation of material fact in 
     the attestation, the Secretary shall notify the Attorney 
     General of such finding and may, in addition, impose such an 
     administrative remedies (including civil monetary penalties 
     in an amount not to exceed $1,000 per nurse per violation,

     as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Upon receipt 
     of such notice, the Attorney General shall not approve 
     petitions filed with respect to a facility during a period of 
     at least one year for nurses to be employed by the facility.
       ``(v) In addition to the sanctions provided for under
