                               HMO REFORM

  (Ms. SLAUGHTER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Madam Speaker, Americans are frustrated with their 
managed care plans. It is no wonder; HMO horror stories abound. Every 
day we hear stories of people being denied care, doctors being 
forbidden from discussing treatment options, and patients unable to get 
justice when things go wrong.
  Americans want a few simple things from their HMOs. In an emergency, 
they want care without having to worry about whether all necessary 
treatments will be covered. They want the right to visit the specialist 
who can address their health problems and the right to get prescription 
drugs they need.
  They want accountability from HMOs and insurance companies when they 
are injured by abusive practices. They want absolute privacy in their 
medical records and protection from discrimination on the basis of 
their genetic information.
  Unfortunately, we have not been given the opportunity to have any 
hearings or a markup on these issues, and, therefore, I encourage my 
colleagues to carefully consider the great need for legislation that 
will guarantee patient protection and put the emphasis on managing care 
rather than managing costs. I urge us to settle for nothing less.
  We have a historic opportunity to end these horror stories. Let us 
not waste this opportunity on half-baked attempts at reform. Let us 
take this chance to guarantee the protections that Americans want and 
need in their health care plans.
