               BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN INTEGRITY ACT OF 1997

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                        HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Monday, July 20, 1998

       The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of 
     the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2183) to 
     amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to reform the 
     financing of campaigns for elections for Federal office, and 
     for other purposes:

  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment by 
Mr. Paxton to the bill being discussed on campaign finance reform. This 
amendment would require labor unions to report all financial activities 
under current labor laws by categories, such as organizing activities 
and strike activities and political activities. The amendment further 
requires that reports be posted on the Internet.
  These provisions single out unions for special treatment. They would 
impose expensive, burdensome regulations upon the organizations that 
represent working people. Companies are not subject to such treatment. 
This would further tilt the political playing field towards 
corporations and against working families.
  The amendment imposes a substantial accounting burden on union 
members. It is the responsibility of the Department of Labor to 
determine the appropriate level of accounting that is needed to fulfill 
the requirements of American labor laws. This measure amounts to 
harassment and discrimination against labor unions.
  Also, Mr. Chairman, this amendment is clearly a ``poison pill.'' It 
is part of a continuing effort to load up the major, bipartisan 
campaign finance reform proposal with provisions that will drive away 
certain categories of supporters. The attempt is NOT to further 
campaign finance reform for the good of the American people. The 
purpose is to obstruct the process. I therefore urge my colleagues to 
defeat this destructive amendment.
