                            CLIFFORD J. GROH

<bullet> Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, a good friend of the State of 
Alaska passed away on Sunday evening, Clifford Groh. He was a well-
respected member of the Anchorage community and a leader in the 
Republican Party. He was educated in New York and New Mexico before 
settling in Alaska. He served his country in the Navy and plied his 
trade as a lawyer. Cliff served our state as a member of the Alaska 
Constitutional Research Committee, Chairman of the Anchorage Charter 
Commission, the Anchorage City Council, the Borough Assembly, and also 
as a State Senator. In 1967 he was appointed Honorary Chief by the 
Alaska Federation of Natives and in 1972, he was voted Outstanding 
Legislator of the Year by the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers 
University. Cliff served as our State Party National Committeeman from 
1976-78 and General Counsel from 1978 to 1990. President Bush appointed 
Cliff to the Arctic Reserach Commission. In 1977, I had the pleasure of 
presenting him with the Republican Party of Alaska's Life Service 
Award. He is survived by his wife, Lucy and their three children.
  Mr. President, we share the family's grief at their great loss and 
take solace in the fact that this talented, highly respected man will 
live on in the memory of all who had the pleasure to know him.<bullet>
