                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                          HON. EARL BLUMENAUER

                               of oregon

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, July 22, 1998

       The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of 
     the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4193) making 
     appropriations for the Department of the Interior and related 
     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and 
     for other purposes:


  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chairman, last night the House voted on Mr. 
Parker of Mississippi's amendment No. 18 to strike certain provisions 
of the Interior Appropriations bill, H.R. 4193. These provisions direct 
the Indian Health Service to allocate contract support costs funding on 
a pro rata basis to all tribal contractors. I voted against that 
amendment in error. Removal of this provision is vitally important to 
the Tribes in my district and throughout the Northwest which are 
working to identify thoughtful, participatory solutions to an 
inadequate system of health care provision. I wish the record to 
reflect my support for the Parker amendment and the tribal self-
determination it encourages.
