                         TRIBUTE TO FOCUS: HOPE

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN D. DINGELL

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 23, 1998

  Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an organization 
that is near and dear to my heart. They are celebrating their 30th 
anniversary this year and on July 25, 1998, they will celebrate another 
triumph over adversity as they cut the ribbon to re-open their resource 
center which was badly damaged last year by a tornado. This civil and 
human rights organization was created by my beloved friends Father 
William T. Cunningham (1930-1997) and Ms. Eleanor M. Josaitis, and 
since Father Cunningham's passing, Ms. Josaitis has valiantly continued 
their work assisting those in need in our community.
  Its name is Focus: HOPE, and it unites our multi-cultural community 
with common efforts

to overcome injustice and build racial harmony. This organization is an 
important part of our great city of Detroit promoting social justice 
and practical solutions to the problems that plague our inner-cities 
like: hunger, economic disparity, inadequate education, and racial 
divisiveness. Focus: Hope combats these problems with technical 
training, educational and corporate partnerships, and food programs. 
These are not handouts but a helping hand to give people the tools and 
means to rejoin society.
  This wonderful organization came into being as a result of the riots 
of 1967 which caused such turmoil in our community. Out of all this 
Focus: Hope was created like the Phoenix rising from the ashes to turn 
a city that was ravaged by civil disturbance and racism into a city 
that has so much to offer for everyone who lives within its borders--a 
city I am proud to call home.
  Focus: Hope's food program helps feed and provide nutrition to 
pregnant women, post-partum mothers, children from infancy to six and 
senior citizens 60 years and older. It pays particular attention to at-
risk mothers by providing free food, nutritional education and food 
demonstrations on how to prepare various dishes for the mother and her 
baby with the monthly food they receive.
  Academic skills and job training are an important aspect of Focus: 
Hope's mission. Fast Track and First Step are two successful programs 
which help people get back on their feet and learn to advance into good 
paying technical jobs. First Step works to upgrade the math, 
communications and computer skills of trainees so that they may enroll 
in Fast Track or the Machinist Training Institute. Fast Track focuses 
on academic skills and the disciplines of high school to give folks the 
tools they need to pursue further technical training or higher 
educational pursuits.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by reading Focus:Hope's mission 
statement that describes so well what they have done, do and will 
continue to do hopefully for many more years to come.
  ``Recognizing the dignity and beauty of every person, we pledge 
intelligent and practical action to overcome racism, poverty and 
injustice, and to build a metropolitan community where all people may 
live in freedom, harmony, trust and affection. Black and white, yellow, 
brown and red from Detroit and its suburbs of every economic status, 
national origin and religious persuasion we join in this covenant.''
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that all my colleagues join me in paying tribute 
to this wonderful organization which gives people a second chance and 
also, gave the city of Detroit a second chance.
