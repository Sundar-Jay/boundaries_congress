                 IN RECOGNITION OF KATHLEEN S. BLACKMAR

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. PATRICK J. KENNEDY

                            of rhode island

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 23, 1998

  Mr. KENNEDY of Rhode Island. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to 
your attention the recognition of a Warren post office employee who was 
recently recognized as the Federal Employee of the Year in Rhode 
Island. Kathleen S. Blackmar was honored at the 27th annual awards 
ceremony held at the BankBoston Operations Center in East Providence by 
the Federal Executive Council of Rhode Island. She was nominated for 
the award by Warren postmaster Erick B. Lawson.
  Kathy has become known as a very valuable asset to the Warren post 
office. In her job as custodian, she is responsible for making building 
repairs, performing janitorial duties, and assisting customers with 
lost or broken post office box keys. Her fellow workers share the 
belief that she has a work ethic that cannot be identified by level of 
job title. She has educated herself about boiler repair and diagnosis 
and she makes minor repairs to the office's fleet of vehicles. On top 
of this, Ms. Blackmar maintains and landscapes the grounds and clears 
snow. She readily has given her time to serve as coordinator for the 
Combined Federal Campaign, the annual drive for the contribution to 
community organizations. She has also coordinated the post office's 
Toys for Tots campaign and the annual ``Christmas Wish List.''
  I am proud to recognize Kathleen Blackmar as an outstanding 
individual and to commend her for her contribution to public service.
