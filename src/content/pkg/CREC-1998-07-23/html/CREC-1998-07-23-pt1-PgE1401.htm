DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND 
             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                           HON. EARL POMEROY

                            of north dakota

                    in the house of representatives

                         Friday, July 17, 1998

       The House in Committee of the Whole House on the State of 
     the Union had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4194) making 
     appropriations for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and 
     Housing and Urban Development, and for sundry independent 
     agencies, boards, commissions, corporations, and offices for 
     the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other 
     purposes:

  Mr. POMEROY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Lazio 
Amendment to the VA-HUD Appropriations bill. While I supported H.R. 2, 
the housing reform bill when it was brought to the floor last year, I 
do not believe the appropriations bill before us in an appropriate 
vehicle to move the bill forward. I am supportive of reforming our 
public housing, however, reform needs to take place in the proper 
forum.
  Attaching a complicated bill like H.R. 2 to an appropriations bill 
has the potential to delay critical funding for our nation's veterans, 
housing for low income families and other vital programs. Conference 
negotiations on the bill could even be delayed to the point of another 
government shutdown. After witnessing the negative effects of the 
government shutdown in 1995, we must ensure that we never face that 
situation again.
  I have concerns about the provision in H.R. 2 dealing with the 
untested home rule provision. The home rule provision would essentially 
eliminate the role of housing authorities in any decision affecting 
Section 8 and public housing programs by turning the administration of 
these programs over to local governments. This and other modifications 
to public housing need to be thought through carefully. Unfortunately, 
an appropriations bill does not provide for that type of comprehensive 
consideration.
