DEMOCRATIC PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS VERSUS REPUBLICAN INSURERS' BILL OF 
                                 RIGHTS

  (Mr. ENGEL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, this week we will be voting on a Patients' 
Bill of Rights, something that all our constituents want. The 
Republican plan as put forth in the House does not do anything, does 
not protect people, and I think it is time to take a look at the 
difference between the Democratic plan and the Republican plan.
  The Republican plan fails to protect every American in a private 
insurance plan. Their plan only applies to 50 million people and leaves 
everyone else out in the cold. The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights 
protects at least 140 million people, every American who is covered by 
a private insurance plan.
  The Republican plan does not return health care decisions to health 
care professionals and their patients. The Democratic Patients' Bill of 
Rights does. The Republican plan does not guarantee patients the right 
to see a specialist when they need to do so. The Democratic Patients' 
Bill of Rights does. The Republican plan does not allow for access to 
OB-GYN for all women or emergency room coverage for all patients. The 
Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights does. The Republican plan does not 
hold insurance companies responsible for their actions denying patients 
the care they need. The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights does.
  When you stack the two up, Madam Speaker, there is no comparison. The 
Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights protects the American people, 
guarantees access to health care, and guarantees that this coverage 
will be there for all Americans. The Republican plan is just a public 
relations gimmick and a sham.
