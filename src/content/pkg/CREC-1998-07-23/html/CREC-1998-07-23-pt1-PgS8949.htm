                        TRIBUTE TO THOMAS ESTES

<bullet> Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay 
tribute to the life and accomplishments of Thomas Clifford Estes, of 
New Ipswich, New Hampshire, who recently passed away at the age of 66.
  The family of Tom Estes can take comfort and pride in the way that he 
lived his life. Born on November 28, 1931, to the late Bedford and 
Emily Estes of New York, Tom graduated from Erasmus Hall High School 
and later studied at RCA Institute.
  Following his father's distinguished example in serving this country 
in the armed forces. Tom joined the United States Navy in 1951, shortly 
after the outbreak of the Korean War. For three of his four years of 
active duty, Tom served on the U.S.S. Tarawa, a Navy aircraft carrier 
that entered the Asian war zone. He earned a number of Navy awards, 
including the Korean Service Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, 
the China Service Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, the Good 
Conduct Medal and the Navy Occupation Service Medal.
  Tom's service to the nation was commendable, not just during the 
Korean War, but throughout his thirty-two years of Federal civil 
service. He began his career as a quality assurance engineer for the 
United States military in Florida and later moved to Dallas, Texas, 
before settling in New Hampshire in 1967. Upon his retirement, Tom was 
recognized by the Defense Logistics Agency for his contributions.
  Tom was admired for his integrity, dedication to his community and 
positive demeanor. He remained a devoted husband to his wife, Mary, 
throughout almost thirty-five years of marriage and helped care for his 
disabled sister for many years. An accomplished chess player, Tom also 
enjoyed baseball and studied the law. He and his wife ran a small, 
twenty-acre farm in New Ipswich for many years. He was a man who cared 
about the needs of others and his community, whose sense of humor, 
cheery smile and knack for storytelling will be missed by all who knew 
him.
  Tom will be buried with military honors at Arlington National 
Cemetery on Monday, August 3, 1998. I extend my deepest sympathies to 
his wife, Mary, his daughter, Evelyn, his sons Thomas and Peter, and 
his sister, Nancy. It is my great pleasure to pay tribute to this 
special American in the official Record of the annals of 
Congress.<bullet>
