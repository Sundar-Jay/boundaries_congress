     available by this Act or any other Act for fiscal year 1999 
     or any fiscal year thereafter should be expended for the 
     operation of a United States consulate or diplomatic facility 
     in Jerusalem unless such consulate or diplomatic facility is

     Israel.
       Sec.   . None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made 
     available by this Act of any other Act for fiscal year 1999 
     or any fiscal year thereafter may be expended for the

     countries and their capital cities unless the publication 
     identifies Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
       Sec.   . For the purposes of the registration of birth, 
     certification of nationality, or issuance of a passport of 
     the United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the
