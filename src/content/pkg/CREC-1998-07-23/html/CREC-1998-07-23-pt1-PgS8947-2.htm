TRIBUTE TO ALAN SHEPARD: NEW HAMPSHIRE NATIVE AND FIRST AMERICAN TO FLY 
                                IN SPACE

<bullet> Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay 
tribute to Alan Shepard, the first American to fly in space, and a 
native of Derry, New Hampshire. On Tuesday, this American hero fell 
victim to leukemia at the age of 74, and leaves behind his widow, 
Louise, two daughters and six grandchildren.
  As the first American to fly in space, Alan Shepard was a pioneer for 
manned space exploration as we know it. On May 5, 1961, at a time when 
the American space program was marked by many failures and setbacks, 
Shepard courageously made a 15-minute suborbital flight, spending five 
of those minutes in space, and forever distinguishing himself as an 
American hero. Shepard was also one of the seven original Mercury 
astronauts, NASA's first space pioneers.
  On January 31, 1971, Shepard returned to space for his second and 
last flight as the commander of Apollo 14. This trip allowed Shepard to 
become the fifth of only twelve Americans ever to walk on the moon, and 
the only man to hit golf balls playfully on the lunar surface.
  In addition to his space endeavors, Shepard headed NASA's astronaut 
office in the years between his two flights, and he began investing in 
banks, oil wells, quarter horses and real estate. Shepard was also a 
Navy test pilot, sacrificing a great deal for the future of his 
country. He retired from the space agency and from the Navy as a rear 
admiral in 1974, in pursuit of many and varied interests.
  Alan Shepard was known for his determination and ready wit. He never 
backed down from a challenge, and was characterized as the most eager 
to be picked from among three astronauts who were finalists for the 
historic first flight. These traits are exactly what make Alan Shepard 
nothing short of a hero in American history. Without his willingness to 
make sacrifices for the good of his country, the United States of 
America never could have achieved such glorious accomplishments in its 
space programs. He was a modest explorer, a man of integrity, a modern 
role model and one for ages to come. The bravery of this man gave 
Americans the confidence to continue pursuing the space program, in 
spite of the enormous challenges that were in sight.
  Alan Shepard will be missed dearly across the nation, and especially 
in Derry, New Hampshire, the town of his birth. His motivation and 
dedication to the American space program and the American people serve 
to encourage all to welcome challenges and follow dreams to whatever 
heights they may soar. Let us mark the passing of this great leader not 
with sadness, but with gratitude and deep appreciation for being such a 
valiant American.<bullet>
