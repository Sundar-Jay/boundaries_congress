 OUR WAR ON DRUGS BEST WEAPON: GOOD PERSONNEL--HELP, DON'T HINDER, OUR 
                           CUSTOMS EMPLOYEES

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BOB FILNER

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 23, 1998

  Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, this morning, I had the honor and privilege 
to speak to the National Treasury Employees Union and other national 
law enforcement groups. I outlined the successes that Customs employees 
have had in our War on Drugs and spoke of my opposition to H.R. 3809, 
which would undermine that success.
  In my own district, Robert Hood, a Customs inspector, is considered 
one of the ``Best of the West'' in Operation Brass Ring, a concerted 
effort to increase drug seizures among all agencies policing the 
border. From February through June of this year, Robert lead the San 
Diego region in drug interdiction, seizing more than 8,745 pounds of 
marijuana and 11 pounds of methamphetamine. Robert Hood is joined by 
other heroes--in the San Diego Customs area, the valiant men and women 
policing the border have been responsible for nearly tripling the 
amount of cocaine and methamphetamine seized, while the number of 
seizures of marijuana have nearly doubled.
  In just the past six months, Customs personnel have made an 
incredible impact on the amount of drugs getting to our streets and 
into our children's pockets! That is why the Fraternal Order of Police, 
the National Association of Police Organizations, and the Border Patrol 
Council, among others, join me in opposing H.R. 3809 and asking those 
who support it, ``What could you be thinking?''
  The bill undermines the partnership that has flourished between 
Customs personnel and their managers in the successful drug 
interdiction efforts. it would restrict employees' rights to have 
significant input on safety issues--and it would cut their pay. How 
does cutting Custom's employees' pay for working their regular night 
shifts help to bolster our War on Drugs? I simply don't understand it.
  I support the provisions in H.R. 3809 that boost 1999 funding for 
Customs, and I urge the Senate and the President to also support an 
increase in Customs funding, while rejecting the provisions that cut 
Customs personnel negotiating rights and their hazard pay for essential 
nighttime shifts.
  H.R. 3809 gives us tools to fight the War on Drugs, but puts those 
who will use the tools in straightjackets. We will lose the War on 
Drugs and waste taxpayers' money if we spend money on expensive, 
cutting-edge equipment at the same time we undermine employee morale 
and labor standards.
  Listen to the partners in the War on Drugs--police officers know they 
cannot win the war if Customs efforts to keep drugs from entering the 
country are thwarted. I support the frontline soldiers in the War on 
Drugs--our Customs personnel--and urge support only for legislation 
that enhances, rather than detracts, from their good work.
