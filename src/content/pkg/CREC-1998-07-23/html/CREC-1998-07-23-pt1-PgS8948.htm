                     RETIREMENT OF MR. CLARK BURRUS

<bullet> Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few 
moments to honor Mr. Clark Burrus, a distinguished professional and a 
citizen par excellence. Mr. Burrus has recently announced his 
retirement from First Chicago Capital Markets, Inc. Although it was 
with great sadness that I heard of Mr. Burrus' retirement, this 
milestone provides an opportune moment to praise him for his long 
record of achievements. He has served Chicago and our nation in so many 
different ways that it is almost impossible to enumerate them all.
  Mr. Burrus was born in Chicago and attended Englewood High School on 
the city's South side. Following high school, Mr. Burrus matriculated 
at Texas State University where he excelled in both academics and 
athletics. After his studies at Texas State University, Mr. Burrus 
returned to his hometown and continued his education at Roosevelt 
University, where he received both a Masters Degree in Public 
Administration and a Bachelor of Science Degree in Accounting.
  Clark Burrus began his five decades of service to the City of Chicago 
during the administration of Mayor Martin Kenelley, and continued to 
serve under Mayors Richard J. Daley, Michael Bilandic and Jane Byrne. 
The hard work and dedication of Mr. Burrus were recognized when the 
late Mayor Richard J. Daley named him City Comptroller in 1973. As City 
Comptroller, Mr. Burrus was the Chief Fiscal Officer of the city and 
supervised the Department of Finance. Under his able guidance, the 
status of city-issued bonds climbed to its first Double-A rating. Mr. 
Burrus is also credited with engineering the low-interest rate mortgage 
revenue bond program of Chicago, the first such program in the United 
States.
  In 1979, Mr. Burrus left public life and joined the First Bank of 
Chicago as a Senior Vice President in the Asset and Liability 
Management Department. Almost twenty years later, Mr. Burrus has risen 
to the position of Vice Chairman of First Chicago Capital Markets, 
Inc., a subsidiary of First Chicago NBD Corporation. Mr. Burrus also 
serves as the head of the Public Banking Department. The departments 
under the supervision of Mr. Burrus provide critical commercial banking 
services to a wide array of fields, including health care, higher 
education, governmental and cultural institutional markets.
  Although he left public life in 1979, Mr. Burrus's commitment to the 
welfare of his hometown and fellow citizens did not end. Mr. Burrus has 
since served as Chairman of the Board of the Chicago Transit Authority 
and of its Deferred Compensation Committee. Additionally, Mr. Burrus 
was a board member of the Regional Transportation Authority, a member 
of its Strategic Planning Committee, and a member of the Chairman's 
Coordinating Committee. Recently, Mr. Burrus was appointed to the Cook 
County Deferred Compensation Committee. He is also a current member and 
past chairman of the Chicago Transit Authority's Pension Board of 
Trustees, and has served as a trustee of five other public pension 
funds. In addition, Mr. Burrus presently serves on a remarkable twenty 
eight boards and commissions. I never cease to be amazed at how well 
Clark Burrus is able to perform so many professional and civic duties 
simultaneously.
  Mr. President, the civic service and public achievements of Mr. Clark 
Burrus are of breathtaking dimensions. Indeed, they serve as an 
enduring testament of his passionate commitment to the betterment of 
his community. As Mr. Burrus retires to private life, he leaves behind 
a record of excellence that will long be appreciated, and is model of 
service for all Americans to follow. I wish him Godspeed and hope that 
his years of retirement will be as enriching as his years of public 
service.<bullet>
