         VOTE TO OVERRIDE VETO OF BAN ON PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION

  (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PITTS. Madam Speaker, today is the day that the House will vote 
to override the veto of the partial-birth abortion ban. I want to 
illustrate here why President Clinton's position is the extremist 
position. This is a baby that could be born. But let me show you what 
happens. The doctor reaches in and turns this baby around so that the 
baby is born breech first. The head is still within the birth canal. 
Then at this time, the doctor inserts scissors into the back of the 
neck of the baby and then puts a suction tube in to suck out the brains 
of a live baby. Do you think this baby does not have pain and feel 
pain? This is a baby that could be delivered as a live baby boy or 
girl.
  We need to vote to override this veto of the partial-birth abortion 
ban which is a horrific procedure in America.
