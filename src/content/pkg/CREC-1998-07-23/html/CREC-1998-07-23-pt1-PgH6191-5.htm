                 VETO OF EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNT BILL

  (Mr. GIBBONS asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GIBBONS. Madam Speaker, once again, the counterfeit logic of the 
Democrats and this President have put the children of America at risk.
  I am not talking about the sale of classified military technology to 
China. I am talking about the President's veto of the Education Savings 
Account bill. Put aside for the moment that this bill would have 
allowed parents to save for the future education of their children. The 
bill he just vetoed would have given schools greater leeway to expel 
and discipline students who bring guns or other weapons to school.
  The bill he vetoed would have permitted school officials to implement 
safety measures to protect innocent children. How many times have we 
all heard the President state that safety at schools was one of his top 
priorities?
  Madam Speaker, we can no longer sit idly by while the violence in 
schools continues to rise. Congress must override his veto and pass 
legislation that will enable our schools to develop local policies that 
end school violence.
  Parents, teachers, and especially students all across America should 
not have to wait one more hour, one more day, or one more week for 
safer schools. Our children should be working on their education, not 
worrying about their safety.
  I urge the President to reconsider and retract his veto and start 
protecting our children.
