                        CORRECTION OF THE RECORD

  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in my speech of July 16, 1998, titled 
``Anniversary of the Great Compromise,'' on page S. 8295, in the first 
column thereof, the word ``unilateral'' in the second line of the 
second full paragraph should be ``unicameral.'' ``Unicameral,'' instead 
of ``unilateral.''
  I ask unanimous consent the permanent Record show the correction.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________
