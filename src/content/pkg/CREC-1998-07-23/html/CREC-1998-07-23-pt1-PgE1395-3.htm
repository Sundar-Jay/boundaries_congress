        HAPPY 100TH ANNIVERSARY, ST. VALENTINE'S PARISH--BEAVER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JAMES A. BARCIA

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 23, 1998

  Mr. BARCIA. Mr. Speaker, the stability of one's church is a source of 
strength for many people. The members of St. Valentine's Parish--
Beaver, located in Beaver Township, Michigan, this weekend are 
celebrating their centennial of being a positive influence in the 
community.
  Prior to 1888, Catholic pioneers who came to Kawkawlin, Michigan, had 
to travel ten to fifteen miles to St. Joseph Church in Auburn. Father 
Szulak, a Jesuit missionary from Detroit, began offering monthly 
services in 1888 at the home of John Nowak. On St. Valentine's Day that 
year, Bartholomew Zboralski donated five acres of land which were used 
for a school where church services were also held. Students were taught 
in both English and Polish. The first teacher at the school was Miss 
Cecilia Warczynski. Bishop Henry Richter of Detroit then asked Rev. 
Joseph Lewandowski, the administrator of St. Stanislaus Parish, and his 
assistant, Father Bieniawski, to attend to the needs of the people of 
this area. This action resulted in the formal establishment of St. 
Valentine's Parish--Beaver, 100 years ago.
  Since the first official act at St. Valentine's--a baptism on 
February 14, 1898, the first marriage of John Rozek and Mary 
Grzegorczyk on September 27, 1898, and the first funeral of Victor 
Milkowski with burial in the church cemetery in the spring of 1898, 
this institution has been of great importance to the community.
  A new church was built in 1909 during the pastorship of Father John 
Kaplanowski. The first baptism at the new facility took place on 
February 4. Lucy Tomczak was baptized just three days after her birth. 
The first funeral was for Anna Hyrek, who died on August 24 at the age 
of three. The first wedding was November 22, joining Anthony Solinski 
and Helen Kukla.
  In 1947, Father Joseph Kaminski began the efforts to construct a new 
school. This modern four room school was completed in the fall of 1948, 
and is celebrating its own fiftieth anniversary this year as well. 
Sister Mary Angelica served as the first Principal. A new convent was 
built in 1959, and with its completion, more room was also available 
for the expanding needs of the school.
  The church has had its own tragic events. A fire in the early 1920's 
destroyed the altar, which was replaced at a cost of $600. And then on 
February 22, 1991, the church was hit by a truck, and suffered 
extensive damage. Repairs this time cost $571,411. Religious 
celebrations again returned to the parish center until a replacement 
facility was completed in 1993. In an ironic fashion, while Father 
Kaminski had celebrated the first mass in the church in 1908, the last 
mass celebrated before the accident was for the repose of his soul.
  Father Richard Ratajczak, the current pastor, is originally from St. 
Valentine's Parish, having had the good fortune to live through much of 
its wonderful history. Father Ratajczak also celebrated his 40th 
anniversary as a priest last month.
  Mr. Speaker, St. Valentine's Parish--Beaver has been a wonderful 
influence for the past 100 years. I urge you and all of our colleagues 
to join me in wishing the parish many more blessed years to come.
