  So the amendment was rejected.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.


                          personal explanation

  Mr. DOOLITTLE. Mr. Chairman, on rollcall No. 329, I was unavoidably 
detained in a discussion with the Speaker concerning a matter of utmost 
importance to my constituents. Had I been present, I would have voted 
``no'' on this rollcall.


                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Pappas

  The CHAIRMAN. The unfinished business is the demand for a recorded 
vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
Pappas) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the 
noes prevailed by voice vote.
  The Clerk will designate the amendment.
  The text of the amendment is as follows:

       Amendment offered by Mr. Pappas:
       Insert after the final section the following:
       Sec.   . The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are 
     revised by increasing the amount for ``land acquisition and 
     state assistance'' under the heading ``National Park 
     Service'' (to provide funds for the State assistance program) 
     and reducing the amount for ``grants and administration'' 
     under the heading ``National Endowment for the Arts'', by 
     $50,000,000.


                             Recorded Vote

  The CHAIRMAN. A recorded vote has been demanded.
  A recorded vote was ordered.

  Mr. BROWN of Ohio changed his vote from ``aye'' to ``no.''
  Messrs. KASICH, SCARBOROUGH and SANFORD changed their vote from 
``no'' to ``aye.''
  So the amendment was rejected.
  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.
  Mr. ETHERIDGE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the necessary 
level of $98 million in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts 
(NEA).
  As an advocate of quality educational opportunities for all our 
children, it is my belief that adequate funding of the Arts is 
important to providing a well rounded education. If you have seen a 
play, visited a museum, read a book of poetry or short stories, chances 
are you have participated in an event made possible through the NEA. 
Learning is a lifelong journey, and learning the arts begins early. It 
is nourished through quality programs in schools, homes and the 
communities, and continues to the very end of our days.
  The NEA costs each American about 36 cents per year, less than one-
hundredth of 1% of the federal budget. Its mission is designed to 
foster the excellence, diversity and vitality of the arts in the US, 
and to broaden public access to the arts. The NEA makes the Arts 
accessible to more Americans, promotes Arts education, and forges 
partnerships with local, state, regional, and federal arts 
organizations. Millions of children, regardless of their economic 
background, now receive formal arts education in local public school 
systems, helping to improve their overall academic performance. In 
North Carolina, the NEA has supported many wonderful projects of great 
cultural and educational value to the citizens of my great State 
including the American Dance Festival and the North Carolina Symphony 
Society.
  Mr. Speaker, as we approach the 21st Century, we need to be sure that 
we provide every necessary tool to encourage creativity in our 
children. Exposure to the Arts provides access to the rich history of 
the past and the key to the future. We must continue to support this 
effort and ensure funding for this important agency.
  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4193--
Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 
1999. This bill appropriates $40,812,000 in funding for the Historic 
Preservation Fund which is an essential element in the preservation and 
restoration of historic buildings and structures at Historically Black 
Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). These buildings will be ranked and 
receive funding in accordance to actual need.
  The National Park Service has ranked twelve HBCUs that are considered 
to have the most endangered historic sites. Those HBCUs, in order of 
rank are:
  1. Allen University (SC)
  2. Tougalo College (MS)
  3. Knoxville University (TN)
  4. Fisk University (TN)
  5. Claflin University (SC)
  6. Talladega College (AL)
  7. Rust College (MS)
  8. Stillman College (AL)
  9. Concordia College (AL)
  10. Miles College (AL)
  11. Voorhees College (SC)
  12. Selma College (AL)
  The preservation and restoration of the historical sites at the 
campuses of Rust College and Tougaloo College, both located in 
Mississippi, have been a personal endeavor of mine for many years. 
These institutions have historically educated African-Americans and 
other disadvantaged populations of this country as well as produced a 
large percentage of our nation's minority doctors, lawyers, educators 
and other professionals.
  HBCUs also address and intervene in issues of violence, hopelessness, 
poverty, and illiteracy through research, community service and other 
projects. I, myself, am a graduate of an HBCU, Tougaloo College, which 
has notably been the site of many significant events in America's 
history. Consequently, I have seen first hand the need for safe, 
sanitary, and appropriate facilities and acknowledge the insufficient 
endowments for the restoration and maintenance of buildings at HBCUs.
  All of the many HBCUs will continue to make valuable and much needed 
contributions to all of our citizens with the continued investments and 
support from federal agencies and departments through the passage of 
this bill.
  The CHAIRMAN. No further amendments being in order, under the rule, 
the Committee rises.
  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. 
LaHood) having assumed the chair, Mr. LaTourette, Chairman of the 
Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that 
that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4193) 
making appropriations for the Department of the Interior and related 
agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, and for other 
purposes, pursuant to House Resolution 504, he reported the bill, as 
amended pursuant to that rule, back to the House with further sundry 
amendments adopted by the Committee of the Whole.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is 
ordered.
  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment? If not, the Chair will 
put them en gros.
  The amendments were agreed to.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third 
reading of the bill.
  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was 
read the third time.


                 Motion to Recommit Offered By Mr. Obey

  Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I offer a motion to recommit.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?
  Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, in its present form, I certainly am.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to 
recommit.
  The Clerk read as follows:

       Mr. Obey moves to recommit the bill, H.R. 4193, to the 
     Appropriations Committee with instructions to report the same 
     back to the House forthwith with the following amendment:
       At the end of the bill add the following new section:
       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none 
     of the funds made available in this Act (and especially no 
     funds for the National Endowment for the Arts) shall be made 
     available unless Sidney R. Yates stands for election to the 
     106th Congress from the 9th District of Illinois.

  Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio reserves a point of 
order.
  The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) is recognized for 5 minutes.
  Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, since the day I came here, Sid Yates, more 
than anyone else, has been associated with this bill year after year. I 
think it is safe to say that, without Sid Yates' leadership, there 
would be no funding for the arts and humanities in this bill.
  On the environmental front, in dealing with public lands, no one can 
question that Sid Yates has, indeed, been Mr. Public Interest on those 
issues. In so many fields, he has set the highest example of what 
public service is supposed to be all about. He has been fighting for 
justice. He has been fighting for humanity and decency in the actions 
that our government takes both at home and abroad. In defense of the 
individual against both government and corporate power, Sid has had no 
peer.
  He has graced this institution and honored this country with his 
service here. He has enriched the lives of each and every one of us who 
have served with him. He is indeed the Gentleman from Illinois.
  I want to say to the House the greatest debate that I ever saw in 
this place never took place in this Chamber. It took place in the full 
Committee on Appropriations, a debate of titans between Sid Yates and 
Eddie Boland on the SST many years ago.
  I remember Sid opening up that debate with a magnificent attack on 
the committee position. Eddie Boland responded with an incredibly able 
and eloquent defense of the committee position. With each speaker, we 
knew that the other could not possibly top what had just been said; 
and, yet, they continued to do so for well over an hour.
  At the end of that debate--and this is the only time I have ever seen 
this in all of the years I have served here--the committee stood and 
gave each of them a standing ovation. In my view, that is what the 
gentleman from Illinois deserves right now.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula) is 
recognized for 5 minutes.

[[Page H6218]]

  Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
Livingston), the chairman of the full committee.
  Mr. LIVINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I have served in the Congress for the 
last 21 years. I have served on the Committee on Appropriations since 
1980 and have been involved in lots of controversial, sometimes 
partisan, sometimes not altogether clear debates about one issue or 
another.
  But when one thinks in terms of the orderliness of this House, of the 
decorum, of the presentation of cogent incisive arguments, the ability 
to present those arguments without rancor and without excessive 
partisanship, one has to think of Sid Yates.
  Sid has been a gentleman for as long as I have known him and for a 
lot longer than that. He has been an outstanding Member of this 
Congress. I dare say, except for one short, brief time that he stepped 
down and ran for Senate and then came back 2 years later, he is 
currently the longest-serving Member of Congress. He is also one of the 
most exemplary and one of those with whom I am proudest to serve. We 
wish you well, Sid.
  Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
Armey).
  Mr. ARMEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I 
might address my comments to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Yates). 
Every summer of my life since 1985, I have found myself in a contest 
with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Yates). We have never been in 
anything other than rigorous disagreement on the subject at hand.
  But in all those summers and in all those contests, while I cannot 
recall Mr. Yates ever did a kind thing to me, he was never unkind in 
the manner in which we dealt with one another. He was a gentleman. He 
was considerate.
  On occasions, he even gave me advice, perhaps what might have been 
good advice, like ``young man, you talk too much,'' but he was kind 
even when making that point.
  Now I find myself realizing that, in the next summer I come to, I 
will not have my opportunity for the continuing contest with the 
distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Yates). If I may, let me 
say, I will miss you, but I will enjoy my summer or two. Thank you, and 
I hope you do the same.
  Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, before I make the final comments, I also 
want to mention that this will be the last time working on the Interior 
bill for the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. McDade), one of our 
really cherished Members, one that we all care a lot about and all 
respect. Where is he at?
  Also, a last time for a rather recent vintage member of our 
committee, but a very thoughtful Member and one that I have treasured, 
the representative from Colorado (Mr. David Skaggs).

                              {time}  1530

  Mr. Speaker, let me say about Sid, we have said a lot. Words cannot 
describe him. He is fair, he is a gentleman, he is thoughtful and he is 
a person of absolute integrity. He has a wonderful helpmate, his wife, 
Addie, and I want to mention her because she has been very much a part 
of Sid's life.
  I want to thank you, Sid. I enjoy symphonies a lot more than I did 
when I started on the committee 24 years ago.
  We wish you well.
  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my point of order.
  Mr. OBEY. Mr. Speaker, I most reluctantly withdraw my motion to 
recommit.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on passage of the bill.
  Pursuant to clause 7, rule XV, the yeas and nays are ordered.
  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 245, 
nays 181, not voting 8, as follows:

                             [Roll No. 331]
