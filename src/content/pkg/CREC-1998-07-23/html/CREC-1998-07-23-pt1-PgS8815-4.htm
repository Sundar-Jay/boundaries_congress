                                SCHEDULE

  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume 
consideration of the Commerce/Justice/State bill. At 9:15 a.m. the 
Senate will vote in relation to the Craig amendment followed by a vote 
in relation to the underlying Kyl amendment. Following those votes, 
under a previous consent agreement, the Senate will debate several 
amendments to be offered to the C.J.S. bill. At the conclusion of that 
debate, which is expected by early afternoon, the Senate will proceed 
to a stacked series of votes in relation to those amendments. Following 
disposition of all amendments in order, it is expected that the Senate 
will quickly proceed to final passage of the Commerce/Justice/State 
appropriations bill. Upon completion of the C.J.S. bill it is hoped 
that the Senate will begin consideration of the transportation 
appropriations bill. Therefore Members should expect another late night 
session with votes as the Senate attempts to make progress on the 
remaining appropriations bills. I thank my colleagues for their 
attention.
