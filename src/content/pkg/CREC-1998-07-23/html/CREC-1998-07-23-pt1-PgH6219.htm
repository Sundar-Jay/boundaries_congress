                             GENERAL LEAVE

  Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that 
all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and 
extend their remarks on further consideration of the bill H.R. 4194, 
and that I be permitted to include tables, charts and other extraneous 
material.
  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the 
gentleman from California?
  There was no objection.
