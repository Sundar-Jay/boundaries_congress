                         PATIENT PROTECTION ACT

  (Ms. DUNN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Ms. DUNN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Patient 
Protection Act, the Republican plan to provide greater accessibility, 
affordability, and accountability in our Nation's health care system.
  This plan will make a real difference in the lives of America's 
working women for a lot of reasons. Small businesses in this country 
are increasingly dominated by women who are looking to make their mark 
in a growing economy. Unfortunately, right now the cost of health care 
makes it very tough for them to purchase health care for themselves and 
their families.
  That is why the Republican plan makes the cost of health care for 
small businesses 100 percent deductible, and it allows small businesses 
to band together to purchase health care at the same discounted rates 
that are currently enjoyed by big business.
  These sensible reforms, combined with our plans giving a woman's 
right to choose an OB/GYN as her prime caregiver, are essential to 
improving access to health care for the many women in this country who 
are helping to drive this Nation's economy. They stand in stark 
contrast to the Democrat bill which does nothing to make health care 
more affordable or accessible to American women.
  I urge my colleagues to support the Patient Protection Act when it 
comes to the floor tomorrow.
