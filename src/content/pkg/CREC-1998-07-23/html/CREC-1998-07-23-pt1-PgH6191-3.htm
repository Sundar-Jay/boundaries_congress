                       PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN

  (Mr. RYUN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RYUN. Madam Speaker, no civilized society should condone or even 
tolerate a heinous procedure such as partial birth abortion. Congress 
will again pass a ban on partial birth abortion and this time the 
President should sign the ban.
  By his past veto, the President has demonstrated that he is out of 
step with 85 percent of the American people who support an end to this 
heinous procedure. With this in mind, I want to tell you about a 
miracle baby girl named Sarah.
  Sarah appeared last year on CBS's ``Mysteries and Miracles.'' When 
she was only four inches long, Sarah was taken briefly from her 
mother's womb to remove a growing tumor.
  Sarah's heart stopped beating during the surgery, and the surgeon 
performed CPR for 20 minutes to revive her. In July of 1996, Sarah was 
delivered by C-section and is now a healthy toddler.
  Unfortunately, even as lives like Sarah's are being saved by 
scientific breakthroughs, others are being extinguished through 
abortion. The care Sarah received from her surgeons provides a stark 
contrast to the treatment her mother might legally have chosen: a 
partial birth abortion.
