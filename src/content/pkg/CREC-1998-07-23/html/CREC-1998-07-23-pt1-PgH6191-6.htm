                          MANAGED CARE REFORM

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute.)
  Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, make no mistake, the differences between 
the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights and the Republican HMO proposal 
are major. The Republican bill excludes key provisions that are 
essential for consumer protection and includes provisions that would 
reduce current consumer protections.
  The Republican HMO plan seeks to give the appearance of reform 
without the reality. Among other gaps, the Republican plan still leaves 
medical decisions in the hands of insurance company accountants instead 
of doctors. It does not limit HMOs' and insurance companies' use of 
improper financial incentives to limit needed care. It allows drive-
through mastectomies and fails to contain a requirement for coverage 
for reconstructive surgery after mastectomy. It does not give access to 
specialty care where needed.
  The Republican bill does not guarantee patients access to needed 
drugs or clinical trials. And most important, the Republican bill 
provides no effective mechanism to hold plans accountable when plan 
abuse kills or injures someone.
  Democrats will insist on a bill that contains guarantees that are a 
significant gain for health care consumers. The Republican plan is 
basically a sham.
