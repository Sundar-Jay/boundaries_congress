     30TH ANNIVERSARY OF LOCKPORT HIGH SCHOOL 100-MILE RELAY RECORD

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. JOHN J. LaFALCE

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 23, 1998

  Mr. LaFALCE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to call to the attention of 
our colleagues the 30th anniversary of an extraordinary high school 
track and field record that still stands today. In June, 1968, eight 
members of Lockport Senior High School in Lockport, New York ran the 
100-mile relay in a time of seven hours, 27 minutes and 53.6 seconds. 
This mark beat the previous New York State record by a full nine 
minutes. It is also an astonishing 26 minutes 36.5 seconds faster than 
the existing world record as listed in the Guinness Book of Records. 
And that so-called world record involved 100 runners--not eight.
  Members of the record-setting relay team, led by Coach John Chew, 
were Jim Rycyna, Charlie Quagliano, Bob Brown, Brian Brooks, Jeff 
Helshoff, Frank Pfeil, George Bickford, and Jeff Watkins. Each of these 
student-athletes ran 12\1/2\ miles in spurts of 110 yards, 220 yards, 
and 440 yards. The overall average time was less than four minutes and 
30 seconds per mile.
  Mr. Speaker, the State of New York recently passed a resolution 
congratulating the 1968 Lockport High School relay team, and the Mayor 
of Lockport issued a proclamation commending their achievement. I too 
am pleased to recognize these eight men on the occasion of the 30th 
anniversary of their 100-mile relay record, and ask all Members to join 
me in congratulating them as they reunite this month to celebrate their 
tremendous athletic performance.

                          ____________________
