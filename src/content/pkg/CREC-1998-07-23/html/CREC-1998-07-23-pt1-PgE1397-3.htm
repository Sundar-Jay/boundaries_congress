            CONGRATULATIONS TO GETTYSBURG ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. GEORGE P. RADANOVICH

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thrusday, July 23, 1998

  Mr. RADANOVICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Clovis 
Unified's Gettysburg Elementary School for being nominated as a 
``California Distinguished School'' and for achieving the ``Clovis 
Distinguished School Award.'' Gettysburg Elementary has educated 
students with great success over the years and has served as a 
tremendous catalyst to the community. The faculty and students of 
Gettysburg Elementary exemplify excellence in student achievement and 
are very deserving of this recognition.
  Gettysburg Elementary School is located 10 miles east of Fresno in 
the heart of the San Joaquin Valley. The school has a student 
population of 691 students in Kindergarten through grade Six. The 
school has students who range from the middle to lower-middle class 
socio-economically, with actively involved parents that provide the 
critical link between the school and home.
  The foundation of Gettysburg Elementary School lies within the 
concept of being a community-centered school. Gettysburg enjoys an 
unusually high degree of volunteering and support from community based 
businesses. In the 1997-98 school year approximately 275 parents 
volunteered their time as classroom helpers and in the library. In a 
combined effort with teachers, students, parents and the community 
Gettysburg was recognized as a National Exemplary Safe and Drug Free 
School.
  Gettysburg prepares all students for the challenges of the 21st 
century by developing confidence and skills in critical thinking 
through participation in a wide range of goal oriented experiences. 
Gettysburg School's Administration concept of education is to nurture 
the whole child and is emphasized through focusing on development of 
each child's mind, body, and spirit. Each student participates with 
both parents and teachers in the ``Goal Sharing Programs,'' where they 
set both academic and behavioral goals. As a result, Gettysburg 
Elementary School was elected as a model program by Phi Delta Kappa and 
received the ``Award for Value and Character Education.''
  In the 1997-98 school year, the students achieved superior academic 
scores in reading, language, and mathematics on the California 
Assessment Tests. Gettysburg maintained an average daily attendance of 
99.78% last school year.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Clovis Unified School 
District's Gettysburg Elementary School for being nominated as a 
``California Distinguished School.'' I applaud both the school and the 
community for their commitment to their children's lives. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in wishing Gettysburg Elementary School many 
years of success.
