                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Rev. James David Ford, D.D., offered the following 
prayer:
  In addition to all we must know to do our work, all the facts, 
background, consequences, and magnitude of our action or inaction, we 
pray, gracious God, that we will also be blessed by the gift of wisdom. 
We pray that we will know discernment in our thoughts and sound 
judgement in our decisions as we weigh the worthiness and merit of what 
we do. We realize that facts and events gain meaning and power when 
they are blended with prudence and insight. As the scripture tells us, 
so teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom. Amen.
