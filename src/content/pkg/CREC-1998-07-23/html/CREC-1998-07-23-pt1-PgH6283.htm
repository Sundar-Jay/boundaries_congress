                       Subtitle A--Access to Care

     SEC. 101. ACCESS TO EMERGENCY CARE.

       (a) Coverage of Emergency Services.--
       (1) In general.--If a group health plan, or health 
     insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer, 
     provides any benefits with respect to emergency services (as 
     defined in paragraph (2)(B)), the plan or issuer shall cover 
     emergency services furnished under the plan or coverage--
       (A) without the need for any prior authorization 
     determination;
       (B) whether or not the health care provider furnishing such 
     services is a participating provider with respect to such 
     services;
       (C) in a manner so that, if such services are provided to a 
     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee by a nonparticipating 
     health care provider--
       (i) the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee is not liable 
     for amounts that exceed the amounts of liability that would 
     be incurred if the services were provided by a participating 
     health care provider, and
       (ii) the plan or issuer pays an amount that is not less 
     than the amount paid to a participating health care provider 
     for the same services; and
       (D) without regard to any other term or condition of such 
     coverage (other than exclusion or coordination of benefits, 
     or an affiliation or waiting period, permitted under section 
     2701 of the Public Health Service Act, section 701 of the 
     Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or section 
     9801 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and other than 
     applicable cost-sharing).
       (2) Definitions.--In this section:
       (A) Emergency medical condition based on prudent layperson 
     standard.--The term ``emergency medical condition'' means a 
     medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of 
     sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that a 
     prudent layperson, who possesses an average knowledge of 
     health and medicine, could reasonably expect the absence of 
     immediate medical attention to result in a condition 
     described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of section 
     1867(e)(1)(A) of the Social Security Act.
       (B) Emergency services.--The term ``emergency services'' 
     means--
       (i) a medical screening examination (as required under 
     section 1867 of the Social Security Act) that is within the 
     capability of the emergency department of a hospital, 
     including ancillary services routinely available to the 
     emergency department to evaluate an emergency medical 
     condition (as defined in subparagraph (A)), and
       (ii) within the capabilities of the staff and facilities 
     available at the hospital, such further medical examination 
     and treatment as are required under section 1867 of such Act 
     to stabilize the patient.
       (b) Reimbursement for Maintenance Care and Post-
     Stabilization Care.--In the case of services (other than 
     emergency services) for which benefits are available under a 
     group health plan, or under health insurance coverage offered 
     by a health insurance issuer, the plan or issuer shall 
     provide for reimbursement with respect to such services 
     provided to a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee other 
     than through a participating health care provider in a manner 
     consistent with subsection (a)(1)(C) if the services are 
     maintenance care or post-stabilization care covered under the 
     guidelines established under section 1852(d)(2) of the Social 
     Security Act (relating to promoting efficient and timely 
     coordination of appropriate maintenance and post-
     stabilization care of an enrollee after an enrollee has been 
     determined to be stable), or, in the absence of guidelines 
     under such section, such guidelines as the Secretary shall 
     establish to carry out this subsection.

     SEC. 102. OFFERING OF CHOICE OF COVERAGE OPTIONS UNDER GROUP 
                   HEALTH PLANS.

       (a) Requirement.--
       (1) Offering of point-of-service coverage option.--Except 
     as provided in paragraph (2), if a group health plan (or 
     health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance 
     issuer in connection with a group health plan) provides 
     benefits only through participating health care providers, 
     the plan or issuer shall offer the participant the option to 
     purchase point-of-service coverage (as defined in subsection 
     (b)) for all such benefits for which coverage is otherwise so 
     limited. Such option shall be made available to the 
     participant at the time of enrollment under the plan or 
     coverage and at such other times as the plan or issuer offers 
     the participant a choice of coverage options.
       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect 
     to a participant in a group health plan if the plan offers 
     the participant--
       (A) a choice of health insurance coverage through more than 
     one health insurance issuer; or
       (B) two or more coverage options that differ significantly 
     with respect to the use of participating health care 
     providers or the networks of such providers that are used.
       (b) Point-of-Service Coverage Defined.--In this section, 
     the term ``point-of-service coverage'' means, with respect to 
     benefits

[[Page H6284]]

     covered under a group health plan or health insurance issuer, 
     coverage of such benefits when provided by a nonparticipating 
     health care provider. Such coverage need not include coverage 
     of providers that the plan or issuer excludes because of 
     fraud, quality, or similar reasons.
       (c) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
     construed--
       (1) as requiring coverage for benefits for a particular 
     type of health care provider;
       (2) as requiring an employer to pay any costs as a result 
     of this section or to make equal contributions with respect 
     to different health coverage options; or
       (3) as preventing a group health plan or health insurance 
     issuer from imposing higher premiums or cost-sharing on a 
     participant for the exercise of a point-of-service coverage 
     option.
       (d) No Requirement for Guaranteed Availability.--If a 
     health insurance issuer offers health insurance coverage that 
     includes point-of-service coverage with respect to an 
     employer solely in order to meet the requirement of 
     subsection (a), nothing in section 2711(a)(1)(A) of the 
     Public Health Service Act shall be construed as requiring the 
     offering of such coverage with respect to another employer.

     SEC. 103. CHOICE OF PROVIDERS.

       (a) Primary Care.--A group health plan, and a health 
     insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage, shall 
     permit each participant, beneficiary, and enrollee to receive 
     primary care from any participating primary care provider who 
     is available to accept such individual.
       (b) Specialists.--
       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraph (2), a group health 
     plan and a health insurance issuer that offers health 
     insurance coverage shall permit each participant, 
     beneficiary, or enrollee to receive medically necessary or 
     appropriate specialty care, pursuant to appropriate referral 
     procedures, from any qualified participating health care 
     provider who is available to accept such individual for such 
     care.
       (2) Limitation.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to specialty 
     care if the plan or issuer clearly informs participants, 
     beneficiaries, and enrollees of the limitations on choice of 
     participating providers with respect to such care.

     SEC. 104. ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE.

       (a) Obstetrical and Gynecological Care.--
       (1) In general.--If a group health plan, or a health 
     insurance issuer in connection with the provision of health 
     insurance coverage, requires or provides for a participant, 
     beneficiary, or enrollee to designate a participating primary 
     care provider--
       (A) the plan or issuer shall permit such an individual who 
     is a female to designate a participating physician who 
     specializes in obstetrics and gynecology as the individual's 
     primary care provider; and
       (B) if such an individual has not designated such a 
     provider as a primary care provider, the plan or issuer--
       (i) may not require authorization or a referral by the 
     individual's primary care provider or otherwise for coverage 
     of routine gynecological care (such as preventive women's 
     health examinations) and pregnancy-related services provided 
     by a participating health care professional who specializes 
     in obstetrics and gynecology to the extent such care is 
     otherwise covered, and
       (ii) may treat the ordering of other gynecological care by 
     such a participating physician as the authorization of the 
     primary care provider with respect to such care under the 
     plan or coverage.
       (2) Construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1)(B)(ii) shall 
     waive any requirements of coverage relating to medical 
     necessity or appropriateness with respect to coverage of 
     gynecological care so ordered.
       (b) Specialty Care.--
       (1) Specialty care for covered services.--
       (A) In general.--If--
       (i) an individual is a participant or beneficiary under a 
     group health plan or an enrollee who is covered under health 
     insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer,
       (ii) the individual has a condition or disease of 
     sufficient seriousness and complexity to require treatment by 
     a specialist, and
       (iii) benefits for such treatment are provided under the 
     plan or coverage,
     the plan or issuer shall make or provide for a referral to a 
     specialist who is available and accessible to provide the 
     treatment for such condition or disease.
       (B) Specialist defined.--For purposes of this subsection, 
     the term ``specialist'' means, with respect to a condition, a 
     health care practitioner, facility, or center (such as a 
     center of excellence) that has adequate expertise through 
     appropriate training and experience (including, in the case 
     of a child, appropriate pediatric expertise) to provide high 
     quality care in treating the condition.
       (C) Care under referral.--A group health plan or health 
     insurance issuer may require that the care provided to an 
     individual pursuant to such referral under subparagraph (A) 
     be--
       (i) pursuant to a treatment plan, only if the treatment 
     plan is developed by the specialist and approved by the plan 
     or issuer, in consultation with the designated primary care 
     provider or specialist and the individual (or the 
     individual's designee), and
       (ii) in accordance with applicable quality assurance and 
     utilization review standards of the plan or issuer.
     Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing 
     such a treatment plan for an individual from requiring a 
     specialist to provide the primary care provider with regular 
     updates on the specialty care provided, as well as all 
     necessary medical information.
       (D) Referrals to participating providers.--A group health 
     plan or health insurance issuer is not required under 
     subparagraph (A) to provide for a referral to a specialist 
     that is not a participating provider, unless the plan or 
     issuer does not have an appropriate specialist that is 
     available and accessible to treat the individual's condition 
     and that is a participating provider with respect to such 
     treatment.
       (E) Treatment of nonparticipating providers.--If a plan or 
     issuer refers an individual to a nonparticipating specialist 
     pursuant to subparagraph (A), services provided pursuant to 
     the approved treatment plan (if any) shall be provided at no 
     additional cost to the individual beyond what the individual 
     would otherwise pay for services received by such a 
     specialist that is a participating provider.
       (2) Specialists as primary care providers.--
       (A) In general.--A group health plan, or a health insurance 
     issuer, in connection with the provision of health insurance 
     coverage, shall have a procedure by which an individual who 
     is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and who has an 
     ongoing special condition (as defined in subparagraph (C)) 
     may receive a referral to a specialist for such condition who 
     shall be responsible for and capable of providing and 
     coordinating the individual's primary and specialty care. If 
     such an individual's care would most appropriately be 
     coordinated by such a specialist, such plan or issuer shall 
     refer the individual to such specialist.
       (B) Treatment as primary care provider.--Such specialist 
     shall be permitted to treat the individual without a referral 
     from the individual's primary care provider and may authorize 
     such referrals, procedures, tests, and other medical services 
     as the individual's primary care provider would otherwise be 
     permitted to provide or authorize, subject to the terms of 
     the treatment plan (referred to in paragraph (1)(C)(i)).
       (C) Ongoing special condition defined.--In this paragraph, 
     the term ``special condition'' means a condition or disease 
     that--
       (i) is life-threatening, degenerative, or disabling, and
       (ii) requires specialized medical care over a prolonged 
     period of time.
       (D) Terms of referral.--The provisions of subparagraphs (C) 
     through (E) of paragraph (1) apply with respect to referrals 
     under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in the same manner 
     as they apply to referrals under paragraph (1)(A).
       (3) Standing referrals.--
       (A) In general.--A group health plan, and a health 
     insurance issuer in connection with the provision of health 
     insurance coverage, shall have a procedure by which an 
     individual who is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and 
     who has a condition that requires ongoing care from a 
     specialist may receive a standing referral to such specialist 
     for treatment of such condition. If the plan or issuer, or if 
     the primary care provider in consultation with the medical 
     director of the plan or issuer and the specialist (if any), 
     determines that such a standing referral is appropriate, the 
     plan or issuer shall make such a referral to such a 
     specialist.
       (B) Terms of referral.--The provisions of subparagraphs (C) 
     through (E) of paragraph (1) apply with respect to referrals 
     under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in the same manner 
     as they apply to referrals under paragraph (1)(A).

     SEC. 105. CONTINUITY OF CARE.

       (a) In General.--
       (1) Termination of provider.--If a contract between a group 
     health plan, or a health insurance issuer in connection with 
     the provision of health insurance coverage, and a health care 
     provider is terminated (as defined in paragraph (3)), or 
     benefits or coverage provided by a health care provider are 
     terminated because of a change in the terms of provider 
     participation in a group health plan, and an individual who 
     is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee in the plan or 
     coverage is undergoing a course of treatment from the 
     provider at the time of such termination, the plan or issuer 
     shall--
       (A) notify the individual on a timely basis of such 
     termination, and
       (B) subject to subsection (c), permit the individual to 
     continue or be covered with respect to the course of 
     treatment with the provider during a transitional period 
     (provided under subsection (b)).
       (2) Treatment of termination of contract with health 
     insurance issuer.--If a contract for the provision of health 
     insurance coverage between a group health plan and a health 
     insurance issuer is terminated and, as a result of such 
     termination, coverage of services of a health care provider 
     is terminated with respect to an individual, the provisions 
     of paragraph (1) (and the succeeding provisions of this 
     section) shall apply under the plan in the same manner as if 
     there had been a contract between the plan and the provider 
     that had been terminated, but only with respect to benefits 
     that are covered under the plan after the contract 
     termination.
       (3) Termination.--In this section, the term ``terminated'' 
     includes, with respect to a contract, the expiration or 
     nonrenewal of the contract, but does not include a 
     termination

[[Page H6285]]

     of the contract by the plan or issuer for failure to meet 
     applicable quality standards or for fraud.
       (b) Transitional Period.--
       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraphs (2) 
     through (4), the transitional period under this subsection 
     shall extend for at least 90 days from the date of the notice 
     described in subsection (a)(1)(A) of the provider's 
     termination.
       (2) Institutional care.--The transitional period under this 
     subsection for institutional or inpatient care from a 
     provider shall extend until the discharge or termination of 
     the period of institutionalization and also shall include 
     institutional care provided within a reasonable time of the 
     date of termination of the provider status if the care was 
     scheduled before the date of the announcement of the 
     termination of the provider status under subsection (a)(1)(A) 
     or if the individual on such date was on an established 
     waiting list or otherwise scheduled to have such care.
       (3) Pregnancy.--If--
       (A) a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee has entered the 
     second trimester of pregnancy at the time of a provider's 
     termination of participation, and
       (B) the provider was treating the pregnancy before date of 
     the termination,
     the transitional period under this subsection with respect to 
     provider's treatment of the pregnancy shall extend through 
     the provision of post-partum care directly related to the 
     delivery.
       (4) Terminal illness.--If--
       (A) a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee was determined 
     to be terminally ill (as determined under section 
     1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Social Security Act) at the time of a 
     provider's termination of participation, and
       (B) the provider was treating the terminal illness before 
     the date of termination,
     the transitional period under this subsection shall extend 
     for the remainder of the individual's life for care directly 
     related to the treatment of the terminal illness.
       (c) Permissible Terms and Conditions.--A group health plan 
     or health insurance issuer may condition coverage of 
     continued treatment by a provider under subsection (a)(1)(B) 
     upon the provider agreeing to the following terms and 
     conditions:
       (1) The provider agrees to accept reimbursement from the 
     plan or issuer and individual involved (with respect to cost-
     sharing) at the rates applicable prior to the start of the 
     transitional period as payment in full (or, in the case 
     described in subsection (a)(2), at the rates applicable under 
     the replacement plan or issuer after the date of the 
     termination of the contract with the health insurance issuer) 
     and not to impose cost-sharing with respect to the individual 
     in an amount that would exceed the cost-sharing that could 
     have been imposed if the contract referred to in subsection 
     (a)(1) had not been terminated.
       (2) The provider agrees to adhere to the quality assurance 
     standards of the plan or issuer responsible for payment under 
     paragraph (1) and to provide to such plan or issuer necessary

     appropriate Secretary shall establish standards to carry out 
     such requirements.
       (2) Externally appealable decision defined.--For purposes 
     of this section, the term ``externally appealable decision'' 
     means an appealable decision (as defined in section 
     132(a)(2)) if--

[[Page H6290]]

       (A) the amount involved exceeds a significant threshold; or
       (B) the patient's life or health is jeopardized as a 
     consequence of the decision.
     Such term does not include a denial of coverage for services 
     that are specifically listed in plan or coverage documents as 
     excluded from coverage.
       (3) Exhaustion of internal appeals process.--A plan or 
     issuer may condition the use of an external appeal process in 
     the case of an externally appealable decision upon completion 
     of the internal review process provided under section 132, 
     but only if the decision is made in a timely basis consistent 
     with the deadlines provided under this subtitle.
       (b) General Elements of External Appeals Process.--
       (1) Contract with qualified external appeal entity.--
       (A) Contract requirement.--Subject to subparagraph (B), the

     (as defined in subsection (c)).
       (B) Restrictions on qualified external appeal entity.--
       (i) By state for health insurance issuers.--With respect to 
     health insurance issuers in a State, the State may provide 
     for external review activities to be conducted by a qualified 
     external appeal entity that is designated by the State or 
     that is selected by the State in such a manner as to assure 
     an unbiased determination.
       (ii) By federal government for group health plans.--With 
     respect to group health plans, the appropriate Secretary may 
     exercise the same authority as a State may exercise with 
     respect to health insurance issuers under clause (i). Such 
     authority may include requiring the use of the qualified 
     external appeal entity designated or selected under such 
     clause.
       (iii) Limitation on plan or issuer selection.--If an 
     applicable authority permits more than one entity to qualify 
     as a qualified external appeal entity with respect to a group 
     health plan or health insurance issuer and the plan or issuer 
     may select among such qualified entities, the applicable 
     authority--

       (I) shall assure that the selection process will not create 
     any incentives for external appeal entities to make a 
     decision in a biased manner, and
       (II) shall implement procedures for auditing a sample of 
     decisions by such entities to assure that no such decisions 
     are made in a biased manner.

       (C) Other terms and conditions.--The terms and conditions 
     of a contract under this paragraph shall be consistent with 
     the standards the appropriate Secretary shall establish to 
     assure there is no real or apparent conflict of interest in 
     the conduct of external appeal activities. Such contract 
     shall provide that the direct costs of the process (not 
     including costs of representation of a participant, 
     beneficiary, or enrollee) shall be paid by the plan or 
     issuer, and not by the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee.
       (2) Elements of process.--An external appeal process shall 
     be conducted consistent with standards established by the 
     appropriate Secretary that include at least the following:
       (A) Fair process; de novo determination.--The process shall 
     provide for a fair, de novo determination.
       (B) Determination concerning externally appealable 
     decisions.--A qualified external appeal entity shall 
     determine whether a decision is an externally appealable 
     decision and related decisions, including--
       (i) whether such a decision involves an expedited appeal;
       (ii) the appropriate deadlines for internal review process 
     required due to medical exigencies in a case; and
       (iii) whether such a process has been completed.
       (C) Opportunity to submit evidence, have representation, 
     and make oral presentation.--Each party to an externally 
     appealable decision--
       (i) may submit and review evidence related to the issues in 
     dispute,
       (ii) may use the assistance or representation of one or 
     more individuals (any of whom may be an attorney), and
       (iii) may make an oral presentation.
       (D) Provision of information.--The plan or issuer involved 
     shall provide timely access to all its records relating to 
     the matter of the externally appealable decision and to all 
     provisions of the plan or health insurance coverage 
     (including any coverage manual) relating to the matter.
       (E) Timely decisions.--A determination by the external 
     appeal entity on the decision shall--
       (i) be made orally or in writing and, if it is made orally, 
     shall be supplied to the parties in writing as soon as 
     possible;
       (ii) be binding on the plan or issuer;
       (iii) be made in accordance with the medical exigencies of 
     the case involved, but in no event later than 60 days (or 72 
     hours in the case of an expedited appeal) from the date of 
     completion of the filing of notice of external appeal of the 
     decision;
       (iv) state, in layperson's language, the basis for the 
     determination, including, if relevant, any basis in the terms 
     or conditions of the plan or coverage; and
       (v) inform the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee of the 
     individual's rights to seek further review by the courts (or 
     other process) of the external appeal determination.
       (c) Qualifications of External Appeal Entities.--
       (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, the term 
     ``qualified external appeal entity'' means, in relation to a 
     plan or issuer, an entity (which may be a governmental 
     entity) that is certified under paragraph (2) as meeting the 
     following requirements:
       (A) There is no real or apparent conflict of interest that 
     would impede the entity conducting external appeal activities 
     independent of the plan or issuer.
       (B) The entity conducts external appeal activities through 
     clinical peers.
       (C) The entity has sufficient medical, legal, and other 
     expertise and sufficient staffing to conduct external appeal 
     activities for the plan or issuer on a timely basis 
     consistent with subsection (b)(3)(E).
       (D) The entity meets such other requirements as the 
     appropriate Secretary may impose.
       (2) Certification of external appeal entities.--
       (A) In general.--In order to be treated as a qualified 
     external appeal entity with respect to--
       (i) a group health plan, the entity must be certified (and, 
     in accordance with subparagraph (B), periodically 
     recertified) as meeting the requirements of paragraph (1) by 
     the Secretary of Labor (or under a process recognized or 
     approved by the Secretary of Labor); or
       (ii) a health insurance issuer operating in a State, the 
     entity must be certified (and, in accordance with 
     subparagraph (B), periodically recertified) as meeting such 
     requirements by the applicable State authority (or, if the 
     States has not established an adequate certification and 
     recertification process, by the Secretary of Health and Human 
     Services, or under a process recognized or approved by such 
     Secretary).
       (B) Recertification process.--The appropriate Secretary 
     shall develop standards for the recertification of external 
     appeal entities. Such standards shall include a specification 
     of--
       (i) the information required to be submitted as a condition 
     of recertification on the entity's performance of external 
     appeal activities, which information shall include the number 
     of cases reviewed, a summary of the disposition of those 
     cases, the length of time in making determinations on those 
     cases, and such information as may be necessary to assure the 
     independence of the entity from the plans or issuers for 
     which external appeal activities are being conducted; and
       (ii) the periodicity which recertification will be 
     required.
       (d) Continuing Legal Rights of Enrollees.--Nothing in this

     agreement, or the operation of any contract or agreement, 
     between a group health plan or health insurance issuer in

     quality and effective utilization of health care services (if 
     such utilization is according to guidelines or protocols that 
     are based on clinical or scientific evidence and the 
     professional judgment of the provider) but only if the 
     guidelines or protocols under such utilization do not 
     prohibit or restrict medical communications between providers 
     and their patients; or
       (2) to permit a health care provider to misrepresent the 
     scope of benefits covered under the group health plan or

       (1) In general.--No contract or agreement between a group 
     health plan or health insurance issuer (or any agent acting 
     on behalf of such a plan or issuer) and a health care 
     provider shall contain any provision purporting to transfer 
     to the health care provider by indemnification or otherwise

       (2) Application.--For purposes of carrying out paragraph 
     (1), any reference in section 1876(i)(8) of the Social 
     Security Act to the Secretary, an eligible organization, or

     SEC. 143. ADDITIONAL RULES REGARDING PARTICIPATION OF HEALTH 
                   CARE PROFESSIONALS.

       (a) Procedures.--Insofar as a group health plan, or health 
     insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage, 
     provides benefits through participating health care 
     professionals, the plan or issuer shall establish reasonable 
     procedures relating to the participation (under an agreement 
     between a professional and the plan or issuer) of such 
     professionals under the plan or coverage. Such procedures 
     shall include--
       (1) providing notice of the rules regarding participation;
       (2) providing written notice of participation decisions 
     that are adverse to professionals; and

     of information and views of the professional regarding such 
     decision.
       (b) Consultation in Medical Policies.--A group health plan,

     coverage, shall consult with participating physicians (if 
     any) regarding the plan's or issuer's medical policy, 
     quality, and medical management procedures.

     SEC. 144. PROTECTION FOR PATIENT ADVOCACY.

       (a) Protection for Use of Utilization Review and Grievance 
     Process.--A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer 
     with respect to the provision of health insurance coverage, 
     may not retaliate against a participant, beneficiary, 
     enrollee, or health care provider based on the participant's, 
     beneficiary's, enrollee's or provider's use of, or 
     participation in, a utilization review process or a grievance 
     process of the plan or issuer (including an internal or 
     external review or appeal process) under this title.
       (b) Protection for Quality Advocacy by Health Care 
     Professionals.--
       (1) In general.--A group health plan or health insurance 
     issuer may not retaliate or discriminate against a protected 
     health care professional because the professional in good 
     faith--
       (A) discloses information relating to the care, services, 
     or conditions affecting one or more participants, 
     beneficiaries, or enrollees of the plan or issuer to an 
     appropriate public regulatory agency, an appropriate private 
     accreditation body, or appropriate management personnel of 
     the plan or issuer; or
       (B) initiates, cooperates, or otherwise participates in an 
     investigation or proceeding by such an agency with respect to 
     such care, services, or conditions.
     If an institutional health care provider is a participating 
     provider with such a plan or issuer or otherwise receives 
     payments for benefits provided by such a plan or issuer, the 
     provisions of the previous sentence shall apply to the 
     provider in relation to care, services, or conditions 
     affecting one or more patients within an institutional health 
     care provider in the same manner as they apply to the plan or 
     issuer in relation to care, services, or conditions provided 
     to one or more participants, beneficiaries, or enrollees; and 
     for purposes of applying this sentence, any reference to a 
     plan or issuer is deemed a reference to the institutional 
     health care provider.
       (2) Good faith action.--For purposes of paragraph (1), a 
     protected health care professional is considered to be acting 
     in good faith with respect to disclosure of information or 
     participation if, with respect to the information disclosed 
     as part of the action--
       (A) the disclosure is made on the basis of personal 
     knowledge and is consistent with that degree of learning and 
     skill ordinarily possessed by health care professionals with 
     the same licensure or certification and the same experience;
       (B) the professional reasonably believes the information to 
     be true;
       (C) the information evidences either a violation of a law, 
     rule, or regulation, of an applicable accreditation standard, 
     or of a generally recognized professional or clinical 
     standard or that a patient is in imminent hazard of loss of 
     life or serious injury; and
       (D) subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph (3), 
     the professional has followed reasonable internal procedures 
     of the plan, issuer, or institutional health care provider 
     established or the purpose of addressing quality concerns 
     before making the disclosure.
       (3) Exception and special rule.--
       (A) General exception.--Paragraph (1) does not protect 
     disclosures that would violate Federal or State law or 
     diminish or impair the rights of any person to the continued 
     protection of confidentiality of communications provided by 
     such law.
       (B) Notice of internal procedures.--Subparagraph (D) of 
     paragraph (2) shall not apply unless the internal procedures 
     involved are reasonably expected to be known to the health 
     care professional involved. For purposes of this 
     subparagraph, a health care professional is reasonably 
     expected to know of internal procedures if those procedures 
     have been made available to the professional through 
     distribution or posting.
       (C) Internal procedure exception.--Subparagraph (D) of 
     paragraph (2) also shall not apply if--
       (i) the disclosure relates to an imminent hazard of loss of 
     life or serious injury to a patient;
       (ii) the disclosure is made to an appropriate private 
     accreditation body pursuant to disclosure procedures 
     established by the body; or
       (iii) the disclosure is in response to an inquiry made in 
     an investigation or proceeding of an appropriate public 
     regulatory agency and the information disclosed is limited to 
     the scope of the investigation or proceeding.
       (4) Additional considerations.--It shall not be a violation 
     of paragraph (1) to take an adverse action against a 
     protected health care professional if the plan, issuer, or 
     provider taking the adverse action involved demonstrates that 
     it would have taken the same adverse action even in the 
     absence of the activities protected under such paragraph.
       (5) Notice.--A group health plan, health insurance issuer, 
     and institutional health care provider shall post a notice, 
     to be provided or approved by the Secretary of Labor, setting 
     forth excerpts from, or summaries of, the pertinent 
     provisions of this subsection and information pertaining to 
     enforcement of such provisions.
       (6) Constructions.--
       (A) Determinations of coverage.--Nothing in this subsection 
     shall be construed to prohibit a plan or issuer from making a 
     determination not to pay for a particular medical treatment 
     or service or the services of a type of health care 
     professional.
       (B) Enforcement of peer review protocols and internal 
     procedures.--Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to 
     prohibit a plan, issuer, or provider from establishing and 
     enforcing reasonable peer review or utilization review 
     protocols or determining whether a protected health care 
     professional has complied with those protocols or from 
     establishing and enforcing internal procedures for the 
     purpose of addressing quality concerns.
       (C) Relation to other rights.--Nothing in this subsection 
     shall be construed to abridge rights of participants, 
     beneficiaries, enrollees, and protected health care 
     professionals under other applicable Federal or State laws.
       (7) Protected health care professional defined.--For 
     purposes of this subsection, the term ``protected health care 
     professional'' means an individual who is a licensed or 
     certified health care professional and who--
       (A) with respect to a group health plan or health insurance 
     issuer, is an employee of the plan or issuer or has a 
     contract with the plan or issuer for provision of services 
     for which benefits are available under the plan or issuer; or
       (B) with respect to an institutional health care provider, 
     is an employee of the provider or has a contract or other 
     arrangement with the provider respecting the provision of 
     health care services.

     insurance issuer in connection with the provision of health 
     insurance coverage, may not arbitrarily interfere with or 
     alter the decision of the treating physician regarding the

     treatment or diagnosis to the extent that such treatment or 
     diagnosis is otherwise a covered benefit.
       (2) Construction.--Paragraph (1) shall not be construed as 
     prohibiting a plan or issuer from limiting the delivery of 
     services to one or more health care providers within a 
     network of such providers.

[[Page H6292]]

       (3) Manner or setting defined.--In paragraph (1), the term 
     ``manner or setting'' means the location of treatment, such 
     as whether treatment is provided on an inpatient or

     coverage of a particular service or treatment.
       (b) No Change in Coverage.--Subsection (a) shall not be 
     construed as requiring coverage of particular services the 
     coverage of which is otherwise not covered under the terms of 
     the plan or coverage or from conducting utilization review 
     activities consistent with this subsection.
       (c) Medical Necessity or Appropriateness Defined.--In 
     subsection (a), the term ``medically necessary or 
     appropriate'' means, with respect to a service or benefit, a

     woman involved prior to the expiration of the minimum length 
     of stay otherwise required under paragraph (1)(A) is made by 
     the attending provider in consultation with the woman or in a 
     case involving a partial mastectomy without lymph node 
     dissection.
       (b) Prohibitions.--A group health plan, and a health 
     insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage in 
     connection with a group health plan, may not--
       (1) deny to a woman eligibility, or continued eligibility,

     encourage such women to accept less than the minimum 
     protections available under this section;

       (5) subject to subsection (c)(3), restrict benefits for any 
     portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required
