                          MANAGED CARE REFORM

  (Mr. EWING asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. EWING. Madam Speaker, it is much easier to be a liberal than to 
be a conservative. Just consider for a moment what has been said by our 
colleagues on the other side during the debate on managed care over the 
past 2 weeks. The pattern here, you can see on almost every public 
policy issue. First, declare a crisis. Really? Although we know there 
are problems with legitimate managed care, the polls show 90 percent of 
the people with this care are satisfied. Second, propose a solution 
that will make the problem worse, thus giving the Democrats more 
opportunity to declare a crisis. The solution for the other side is 
always the same, more mandates, more lawyers, and, let us not forget, 
more government. This will raise the price, making health care less 
affordable than it was before. The final step is to deny that their 
proposal will do anything of the sort. Then in a few years when the 
problem is even worse, they will declare their outrage again, just as 
they are doing now.
