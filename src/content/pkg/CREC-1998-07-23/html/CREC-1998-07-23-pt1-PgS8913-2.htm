                      RECOGNITION OF NEWT HEISLEY

  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I begin my statement today describing a 
powerful and emotional sight that moves us to the core of our faith and 
beliefs about America and about those who have served in the Armed 
Forces of our nation.
  Many of us have visited one or more of the military academies that 
train our future military leaders. These academies have varied missions 
and yet all of them share in the critical task of developing leaders 
for their particular service and our country. On the grounds of each 
academy is a chapel, a spectacular place that at once identifies itself 
as a place of worship.
  In each chapel, a place has been reserved for the Prisoners of War 
and the Missing in Action from their particular branch of service. A 
pew has been set aside and marked by a candle, a powerful, symbolic 
reminder that not all have returned from battle. This hallowed place 
has been set aside so that all POWs and MIAs are remembered with the 
dignity and honor they deserve. It is a moving and emotional moment to 
pause at this reserved pew, to be encouraged by the burning candle, to 
recall the valor and sacrifice of those soldiers, sailors or pilots, 
and to be inspired today by what they have done.
  Back in 1970, a wife of a soldier missing in action made a simple 
request to have a flag designed for a small group of families whose 
loved ones were prisoners or missing in action in Southeast Asia. As a 
member of the National League of Families she felt the organization 
needed a symbol. This symbol, a black and white flag, with a silhouette 
of a bowed head set against a guard tower and a single strand of barb 
wire, was designed by Newt Heisley.
  Congress has officially recognized the National League of Families 
POW/MIA flag. This flag has become a powerful symbol to all Americans 
that we have not forgotten--and will not forget. Since its creation, 
the flag has flown over numerous state and federal buildings, and has 
even been adopted by similar organizations in Kuwait, Chechnya, Bosnia, 
and other countries.
  Newt Heisley made the sketch of this symbol over a couple of days in 
a New Jersey advertising studio, never imagining the impact the design 
he created almost 27 years ago would have. Mr. Heisley used the 
inspiration of his ill son returning from Marine training at Quantico, 
Virginia for the silhouette. Otherwise the flag was just a quick sketch 
that wasn't even supposed to be black and white. Mr. Heisley planned on 
adding colors but the black and white motif remained.
  Mr. Heisley, first realized how popular the symbol had become when he 
moved to Colorado Springs in 1972. Only two years after he made the 
design he was touring the Air Force Academy when he saw the flag on 
display at the visitors center. Today, the flag is a national symbol 
that is seen on everything from ball caps to bumper stickers.
  A veteran of World War II, Mr. Heisley knows of the importance of his 
design. We must never forget those who gave their lives for our 
country. Mr. Heisley never felt the need to profit from the POW/MIA 
flag design. The image was never copyrighted and today is used by many 
companies and organizations. Mr. Heisley was simply glad to create a 
symbol that honors veterans and the sacrifices they made for our 
country and freedom.
  Mr. President, the United States has fought in many wars and 
thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured by the 
enemy or listed as missing in action. In 20th Century wars alone, more 
than 147,000 Americans were captured and became Prisoners of War; of 
that number more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to 
this number those who are still missing in action, we realize the 
tremendous importance of their presence through the POW/MIA flag. The 
POW/MIA flag is a forceful reminder that we care not only for them, but 
also for their families who personally carry with them the burden of 
sacrifice. We want them to know that they do not stand alone, that we 
stand with them and beside them, and remember the loyalty and devotion 
of those who served.
  As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the 
remembrance of another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and 
most noble acts we can offer. Newt Heisley has inspired this 
remembrance and honor and I thank him, personally, for this tremendous 
symbol that shall endure forever.
