                          MANAGED CARE REFORM

  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, everyone is talking about patients' rights. 
It is simple to talk about wanting patients to have rights and access 
to care. It is another thing, however, to provide for that in 
legislation.
  There are two contending bills. Let me go through them. Access to 
enforcement in State courts: The Democratic bill, yes; the Republican 
bill, no. Protection for women after mastectomy: Democratic bill, yes; 
Republican bill, no. Choice of doctors within the plan: Democratic 
bill, yes; Republican bill, no. Access to specialty care: Democratic 
bill, yes; Republican bill, no. Direct access to OB/GYNs: Democratic 
bill, yes; Republican bill, no.
  There are other provisions that I will not be able to cover in this 1 
minute. But as we hear this debate and people talk about patients' 
rights, hold them to the criteria of not just talking about patients' 
rights, but ensuring patients' rights.
