                          MANAGED CARE REFORM

  (Ms. WOOLSEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. WOOLSEY. Madam Speaker, last week a very good friend of mine went 
to the hospital to have a malignant tumor removed from his bladder. It 
was extensive surgery. It was outpatient surgery. He was sent home 5 
hours after the surgery with a catheter and a bag at his waist line. 
This is outrageous. Later in the week, he did get a fever from an 
infection.
  We cannot let this happen to the people in our country. We must have 
real patient reform. We have to protect the patients in our health care 
system. Do not vote today for a faux reform, or tomorrow, faux 
Republican reform. We need the Dingell-Ganske bill. We need to let 
doctors and patients decide when to send a cancer patient home from the 
hospital after extensive surgery.
