1995. In this capacity he was responsible for ensuring that issues and 
programs of interest to Raytheon in supporting national security 
requirements were communicated to members and staff of Congress in an 
effective manner. Mr. President, I can tell you, I know of no one more 
professional than Mr. Fox. In all his dealings with the Congress, he 
was a true professional, dedicated to ensuring national security 
interests, and the security of our country were always well served.
  Prior to joining Raytheon, Chuck served a distinguished career of 
more than twenty seven years in the United States Air Force, retiring 
as a Colonel. He served in a variety of staff, operations and command 
positions around the world. He served as both a base and wing 
commander, as well as the Chief of Staff of the Pacific Air Forces. In 
the two years prior to his retirement from the Air Force, Mr. Fox was 
the Deputy Director of Legislative Liaison for the Secretary of the Air 
Force in the Pentagon. He was responsible for managing all 
Congressional actions for the Secretary of the Air Force and the Air 
Force Chief of Staff, and supervised a staff of 90 personnel.
  Mr. Fox holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Seattle University with 
a major in Political Science. He received a Master of Arts degree in 
International Relations from the University of Washington.
  Chuck and his wife Marilyn will reside in Charleston, South Carolina. 
Mr. Fox has two married daughters, Rachel and Sarah.
  Mr. President, fellow colleagues, please join me in paying tribute to 
the exemplary accomplishments of Mr. Charles L. Fox, for a lifetime of 
achievements as a business and military leader, patriot and servant of 
the United States of America.<bullet>
