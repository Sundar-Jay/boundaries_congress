            IN HONOR OF PUERTO RICO ON ITS CONSTITUTION DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. DENNIS J. KUCINICH

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 23, 1998

  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the citizens of Puerto 
Rico on Constitution Day, July 24, 1998. The people of Puerto Rico 
established the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for the 
very same reasons our forefathers wrote the Constitution of the United 
States of America, to establish themselves as a democracy.
  The Puerto Rican Constitution ensures basic welfare and human rights 
for the people, ensconces the idea of a government which reflects the 
will of the people, and pays tribute and loyalty to the Constitution of 
the United States of America.
  The Puerto Rican culture is a distinctly unique culture. By pledging 
allegiance to the Constitution of the United States of America, the 
people of Puerto Rico celebrate shared beliefs and the co-existence of 
both cultures. By ratifying their own Constitution, the people of 
Puerto Rico retain and honor their original heritage while expressing 
the desire to pursue democracy and happiness for themselves.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the following individuals for 
their contributions to

the Greater Cleveland community. Dr. Milagros Acevedo Cruz, Michelle 
Melendez, Mario Ortiz, David Plata, Raquel Santiago, Lydia Esparra, 
Orlando Salinas, Ana Garcia, Yolanda Perdomo, and Jundy Caraballo. I 
hope that my fellow colleagues will join me in honoring these 
individuals and praising the Puerto Rican people as they celebrate 
Constitution Day.
