            THANK YOU TO PATTON LANE FOR SERVICE ON MY STAFF

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BART GORDON

                              of tennessee

                    in the house of representatives

                        Thursday, July 23, 1998

  Mr. GORDON. Mr. Speaker, at the end of this month, Mr. Joe Patton 
Lane III will leave my office to enter the School of Law at Roger 
Williams University in Rhode Island.
  Patton has been a loyal and effective member of my congressional 
staff for the past three years. However, I have known Patton for over a 
decade. As a college student, he assisted with my re-election 
campaigns. My then-campaign manager made the statement, ``Come election 
time, I wish I had fifteen Patton Lanes working for me!''
  In a congressional personal staff office, there are thousands of 
demands made on hundreds of issues. Success in this environment 
requires attention to detail and conscientiousness. These are Patton's 
strengths. He has been a hard-working, dedicated employee.
  Patton is part of a rare breed, one of which should be required in 
each congressional office. A native of Carthage, Tennessee, he knows 
every town, every zip code, and most of the elected officials in Middle 
Tennessee. He is well-regarded by his co-workers and is recognized as 
someone who willingly undertakes any assignment without complaint.
  Patton is from a long line of attorneys recognized in the state of 
Tennessee for their competence and ability. With his commitment to 
public service and his abilities, I am confident he will do well in his 
new endeavor.
  It has been a pleasure to have Patton serve in my office and I join 
my staff in wishing him the best of fortune in his new undertaking.
