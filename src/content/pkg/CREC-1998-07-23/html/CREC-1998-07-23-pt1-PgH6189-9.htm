minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, Mrs. Margaret Barnett has a distinction 
no other woman in Illinois has. She was the first female high school 
band director in Illinois. Mrs. Barnett studied piano and received her 
Bachelor's Degree from Shurtleff College in 1930. She played trombone 
with the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra and earned a Master of Arts 
Degree from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.
  In addition, Mrs. Barnett studied clarinet at the Western Military 
Academy. Fortunately, Mrs. Barnett did not keep all her musical talent 
to herself. She taught every child the proper techniques on his or her 
instrument, leading her bands at Alhambra High School and Bethalto High 
School to win many contests and awards.
  However, music was not the only subject Mrs. Barnett could teach. She 
taught English, mathematics and Latin at both Alhambra and Bethalto 
High Schools. She even served as librarian and assistant to the 
superintendent at Bethalto. Earlier in her career in 1932 she was Vice 
President of the Illinois State Teachers Association.
  I applaud Mrs. Barnett for her dedication to teaching young people. 
She is definitely a pioneer and an inspiration for women in high school 
band positions. Most importantly, Mrs. Barnett is a role model for all 
teachers to follow.
