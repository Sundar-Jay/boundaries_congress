            VETO OF EDUCATION SAVINGS ACCOUNT BILL WAS WRONG

  (Mr. ROGAN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ROGAN. Madam Speaker, the President's late night, quiet veto this 
week of Education Savings Accounts--timed in order to miss the evening 
news--means that those that produced generations of education failure 
have dodged the bullet again.
  The other side should explain to America why encouraging parents to 
save for their children's education is a bad thing. Oh, they are long 
on heart-warming rhetoric about their care and compassion for ``the 
children'' and for ``education;'' but when it comes to education reform 
legislation that threatens the special interests that gave us these 
failing schools in the first place, they are woefully short on action.
  They send their own kids to private schools, but then they tell 
working parents who want to save for their children's education ``no.''
  Madam Speaker, Republicans in Congress are not content to simply talk 
about ``the children,'' we will fight for children, and for the world-
class education they deserve. We will continue the fight for working 
parents who want to be able to save for their children's education 
through Education Saving Accounts.
