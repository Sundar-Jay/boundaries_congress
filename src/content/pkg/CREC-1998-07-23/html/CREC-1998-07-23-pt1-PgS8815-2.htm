                                 prayer

  The guest Chaplain, Rev. David W. Anderson, Faith Baptist Ministry, 
Sarasota, FL, offered the following prayer:
  Almighty Creator and Giver of life, we bow before You with thankful 
hearts for the innumerable blessings bestowed upon America. Your wisdom 
guides us to truth, and Your power sustains our freedom. Your 
forgiveness cleanses our transgressions, and Your Spirit calls us to be 
a righteous and just Nation.
  Wonderful Counselor, enable the men and women of this Senate to 
balance the pressures of their individual lives with the demands of 
their offices. Comfort their hearts in times of personal crisis and 
protect their families. Grant them time with their loved ones and 
remind them of their need for faith. Strengthen their character and 
clarify their vision that they might address the complex issues facing 
our Nation with wisdom, courage, and compassion.
  Lord, bless the talents that You have bestowed upon these Your 
servants. Reward them for the leadership they exercise. Give them the 
courage to do what is right, the conviction to resist what is wrong, 
and the counsel to discern the difference. Help them to discuss issues 
of national concern in a spirit of unity and cooperation, knowing that 
together they serve the same people and the same sovereign God. In 
Jesus' Name, I pray. Amen.
