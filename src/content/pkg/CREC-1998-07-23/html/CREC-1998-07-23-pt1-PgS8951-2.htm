       AFRICAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1998

  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 39, Calendar No. 435.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The clerk will report.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A bill (H.R. 39) to reauthorize the African Elephant 
     Conservation Act.

  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.
  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is 
considering H.R. 39, the African Elephant Conservation Reauthorization 
Act. The bill was introduced by Congressmen Young on January 7, 1997, 
favorably reported by the House Resources Committee on April 21, 1997, 
passed by the House the same day, and referred to the Committee on 
Environment and Public Works. Senator Jeffords introduced a companion 
bill, S. 627, on April 22, 1997. The Committee held a hearing on both 
bills on November 4, 1997, and favorably reported them on May 21, 1998. 
Today we take up the House passed bill to expedite Congressional action 
on this important legislation.
  The bill reauthorizes the African Elephant Conservation Act for four 
years, through 2002, at the current authorization level of $5 million 
annually. The current law was enacted in 1989, in response to a sharp 
decline in many populations of African elephants due primarily to 
poaching for ivory. Population estimates vary widely across its range, 
but the total population is estimated to have declined by as much as 50 
percent, from 1.3 million elephants in the late 1970's, to less than 
700,000 in 1987. The species continues to decline, with a population of 
about 540,000 elephants in 1996.
  The Act established a process for implementing strict ivory import 
controls, and established a dedicated fund for cooperative conservation 
projects in African countries. The Act has been tremendously effective 
in assisting in conservation efforts worldwide. Under the authority of 
the Act, President Bush established a moratorium on all ivory imports 
into the United States, which served as the impetus for the worldwide 
ban on trade in elephant parts and products, approved by the Parties to 
the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora 
(CITES) one year later.
  Through the Act, the Fish and Wildlife Service has funded 60 projects 
in 19 countries since 1990. The law has generated approximately $22 
million for elephant conservation programs, of which $6.8 million has 
been provided by the U.S. Government, with $15.8 million from other 
sources. Indeed, the success of this law has led to similar laws for 
Asian elephants, rhinos and tigers.
  Again, I am pleased that the Senate is considering this legislation, 
and I hope that the President will sign it into law soon. Thank you, 
Mr. President. I yield the floor.
  Mr. SHELBY. I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, 
and that any statements relating to the bill be printed at the 
appropriate place in the Record.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The bill (H.R. 39) was considered read the third time and passed.
