           REPUBLICAN MANAGED CARE REFORM DOES NOT MEASURE UP

  (Mr. STUPAK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute.)
  Mr. STUPAK. Madam Speaker, tomorrow we are scheduled to begin the 
debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I ask the American people to 
look at both plans, the Democratic plan and the Republican plan. As you 
do, you will see point by point the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights 
bill is far superior in reform that will guarantee that doctors and 
patients and not insurance executives will decide your medical future. 
The right to have protection for women after mastectomies and 
reconstructive surgery is in the Democratic bill, not in the Republican 
bill. Democrats provide for a choice of doctor within a plan, access to 
specialty care, and direct access to OB-GYN for women. These are all 
parts lacking in the Republican plan.
  To enforce your choice, and it is your choice and your access to your 
doctor, the Democrats allow enforcement in State courts if you are 
injured by your HMO plan. Why do you need that protection? Because in 
this country, two groups have immunity. They are HMOs and foreign 
diplomats. You pay for health insurance. You have the right to demand 
quality health insurance. Support the Democratic HMO Patients' Bill of 
Rights.
