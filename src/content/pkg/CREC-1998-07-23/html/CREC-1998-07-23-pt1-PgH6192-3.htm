             VIGILANCE OF BROWN TREE SNAKE NEEDED IN HAWAII

  (Mr. ABERCROMBIE asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. ABERCROMBIE. Madam Speaker, I rise this morning to express my 
support for provisions in the Interior Appropriations bill we are 
debating today for the funding of the Brown Tree Snake control efforts.
  The consequences of the Brown Tree Snake becoming established on any 
of the Hawaiian Islands would be devastating. We have only to look at 
Guam to understand the potential extinction of many species will, not 
might, result from the introduction of the snake to Hawaii.
  Guam now experiences an instance of more than 12,000 of these snakes 
per square mile. Entire species have disappeared from Guam since World 
War II when the snake was accidently brought to the island, most 
probably abroad military aircraft which had visited areas of the South 
Pacific in the snake's natural habitat.
  The Interior Appropriation bill contains $2.1 million for prevention, 
education, and inspection programs, an increase of $500,000 over last 
year. We need to step up our vigilance in Hawaii against this invasive 
species which has brought wildlife ruin elsewhere.
  The scientific community has not yet developed an effective 
eradication method. Although I hope we can soon understand how to 
control and eliminate the snake, until that time, the only action we 
can and must take is preventing its introduction into Hawaii.
  I am very pleased that the Committee on Appropriations has 
recommended an increase, and I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in achieving the highest funding level to achieve our goals.
