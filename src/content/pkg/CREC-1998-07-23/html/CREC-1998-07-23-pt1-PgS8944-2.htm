       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking the period and inserting 
     the following: ``, except that the Board of Directors may not

     indicated approval to provide) financing of the project.''; 
     and
       (2) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
       ``(3) G-7.--For purposes of this subsection, the term `G-7' 
     means the group consisting of France, Germany, Japan, the 
     United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Italy, 
     established in September, 1985, to facilitate economic 
     cooperation among the seven major non-Communist economic

     the Export-Import Bank should seek to reach an international 
     agreement with the export financing agencies of other G-7 
     countries regarding environmental policies and procedures for 
     the financing of projects; and
       (B) such agreement should be subject to Congressional 
     approval.

     means the group consisting of France, Germany, Japan, the 
     United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, and Italy,
