           SENATOR TIM HUTCHINSON RECEIVES GOLDEN GAVEL AWARD

  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Hutchinson presided his 
100th hour of this Congress and, therefore, is the latest recipient of 
the Senate's Golden Gavel Award.
  Senator Hutchinson and his scheduling staff have consistently 
adjusted their schedule to assist whenever presiding difficulties have 
occurred. For these honorable efforts and for the Senator's continued 
commitment to his presiding duties, we extend our thanks and 
congratulations.
