  MAIDEN SPEECH OF THE HONORABLE RANDY NEUGEBAUER AS NEWEST MEMBER OF 
                             108TH CONGRESS

  (Mr. NEUGEBAUER asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. Only the people 
sitting on this floor understand what I am feeling right now. It is a 
privilege and an honor to be a part of history and to be with this body 
today.
  I want to recognize my wife and my partner of 33 years who is up in 
the balcony there and my family. There is a scripture in Corinthians 
that says, ``I am what I am by the grace of God.'' I am here today 
because of the grace of God. I understand that, and I look forward to 
working with you.
  I have one regret. I would have really liked to have been here 
yesterday and voted on the partial-birth abortion. I would have voted 
an affirmative banning the partial-birth abortion. I am glad to see 
that you did that. It is a pleasure to be here.
  Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I look forward to working with you. I am the 
new kid on the block. I am the 435th ranking Member of the House of 
Representatives. I bumped some people up today, and I know they are 
glad of that. We certainly appreciate the Texas delegation and other 
Members being here today. We look forward to doing good work for the 
American people.
  Thank you and God bless you.
