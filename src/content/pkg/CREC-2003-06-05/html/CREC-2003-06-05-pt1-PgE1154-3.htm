                 PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 2003

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                           HON. BARBARA CUBIN

                               of wyoming

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mrs. CUBIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 760 and for 
our voiceless unborn children, who were merely inches away from their 
first breath, when their life was brutally ended. For them, partial-
birth abortion is not an option--it is a death sentence.
  It is truly shameful that we cannot protect the most innocent and 
vulnerable in our society from this gruesome medical procedure. 
Delivering a child up to its head and then using a syringe to suck out 
the child's brain and discard this miracle of life is revolting.
  Do not call that child a fetus. Do not elevate any personal freedom 
above that child's right to life. That fetus is a human baby--call it 
what it is.
  I hope the mental image this conjures disturbs everyone--and that I 
once again receive calls from those shaken by the mere description of 
this barbaric act. Be thankful you're not on the business end of that 
syringe.
  We have the responsibility to do everything in our power to put an 
end to this practice which has no place in a civilized society. We 
cannot remain silent while a procedure such as partial-birth remains an 
acceptable part of our society--after all, if done a short time later 
and a few inches further, it would be considered murder.
