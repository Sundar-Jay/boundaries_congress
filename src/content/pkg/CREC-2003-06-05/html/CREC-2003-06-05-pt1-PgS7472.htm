   IN CELEBRATION OF THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF MARIN SERVICES FOR WOMEN

<bullet> Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to 
recognize the 25th anniversary of Marin Services for Women.
  Since 1978, Marin Services for Woman MSW, has helped women recover 
from drug and alcohol abuse. It is the only agency in Marin County that 
provides alcohol and drug treatment programs designed to meet the 
specific needs of women and their families.
  MSW works tirelessly to ensure the physical and emotional health of 
Bay Area women by working one-on-one with individuals and providing 
them with specialized treatment. MSW's treatment philosophy is a 
comprehensive, gender-specific, culturally responsible approach to 
alcohol and drug recovery. MSW respects and encourages each client's 
strengths and provides social, economic and political empowerment.
  Throughout its 25 years of service, MSW has successfully provided a 
safe haven for women seeking recovery by providing female staff role 
models who reflect the diversity of the client population; residential 
and outpatient services that address the addiction patterns of women; 
and intensive case management to assist with employment status, access 
to housing, and use of outside health and social services. MSW's 
success in advancing community recovery by providing specialized 
treatment tailored to each individual woman has set a standard for care 
in the Bay Area.
  For 25 years, Marin Services for Women has served as a beacon for 
women who have nowhere else to turn. Their dedication to the community 
is inspiring and impressive. I congratulate Marin Services for Women on 
their 25th anniversary and wish them another 25 years of 
success.<bullet>
