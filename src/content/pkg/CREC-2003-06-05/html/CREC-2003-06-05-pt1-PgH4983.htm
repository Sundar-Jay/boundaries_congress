                 ENSURE HEAD START'S CONTINUED SUCCESS

  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate the 38th anniversary of the Head Start Program. As a former 
Head Start kid, I know firsthand the valuable, comprehensive education 
program that Head Start does for low-income families, and I celebrate 
the program's many achievements.
  The Republicans, on the other hand, will celebrate Head Start's 38 
years of success by pushing forward with the School Readiness Act. This 
legislation is not only a bad idea, it has the possibility of 
eliminating key services to nearly 1 million students by converting the 
Head Start Program to a block grant program. Block granting Head Start 
is a blockheaded idea that will undoubtedly hurt this very successful 
program.
  One problem in particular with this plan is that States are already 
dealing with huge budget deficits, and they may be tempted to divert 
Head Start funds to use for other purposes. How would that improve the 
Head Start Program?
  I urge my colleagues to celebrate Head Start's 38th anniversary by 
opposing this misguided legislation.
