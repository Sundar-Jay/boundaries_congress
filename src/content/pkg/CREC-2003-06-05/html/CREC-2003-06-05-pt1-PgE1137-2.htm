                         HONORING DOUGLAS PERRY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. BOB FILNER

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, I rise today to honor the 
life of Douglas Perry and to recognize his lifelong contributions to 
his community. He was born on February 8, 1920 in Somerville, 
Massachusetts and passed away earlier this week, on June 2, 2003.
  Doug was much more to me than a resident of my Congressional 
District, he was my friend. I first met Doug and worked with him when I 
served on the San Diego City Council. I immediately noticed his 
enthusiasm and his seemingly unlimited energy on behalf of the San 
Ysidro community where he lived. Because of his work, he was known as 
the unofficial ``Mayor of San Ysidro''.
  He moved to California in 1936 and served in the U.S. Navy, in North 
Africa and the Philippines, from 1942 to 1946. He met and married Jean 
Alexis Wadleigh in 1949, and they lived in the Inland Empire until 
their move to San Ysidro in 1974.
  He was involved in many roles in the activities and organizations of 
San Ysidro. He served as President, Executive Director, and Information 
Center Manager of the San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce and was 
instrumental in keeping the Chamber growing in membership. He organized 
and managed a Chamber Visitor's Information Center for several years, 
giving tourist information to thousands of visitors every month. It was 
through his efforts that the San Ysidro Chamber was designated the 
official Certificate of Origin supplier for the importation of goods by 
Mexican businesses--a vital part of the Chamber today. He took the lead 
in obtaining the first-ever fireworks in San Ysidro by developing plans 
for the Chamber to sponsor the first two years of exciting 4th of July 
displays and continuing to organize these yearly festivities.
  Doug was Chair of the San Ysidro Redevelopment Project Area 
Committee, Vice President of the San Ysidro Senior Center, Chair and 
Vice Chair of the Southern Area Committee, Board Member of the South 
Bay YMCA, and Vice President of the San Ysidro Senior Center. He made 
possible communication cable at the Senior Center, soliciting a free 
donation from Cox Cable.
  He was Treasurer of the San Ysidro Little League and was a member of 
Senior San Ysidrans. At the Sister of Nazareth, San Diego Mission, he 
was House Father for nine years.
  As a member of the Park and Recreation Council, Doug represented the 
San Ysidro Recreation Council, supported their Annual Christmas events, 
acquired a big screen TV by soliciting donations, and raised funds for 
the La Mirada School Joint Use Turf Project. He played a significant 
role in opening the building at Larsen Sports Field, Cesar Chavez 
Community Center. He worked in obtaining Beyer Undeveloped Park.
  He further obtained funding for the Coral Gate Neighborhood Park and 
the Larsen Field Parking Lot expansion, security lights and ball field 
renovation. All in all, he raised tens of thousands of dollars for 
projects and special events in San Ysidro. He worked to get donations 
for the Annual Food Drive. As you can see, Doug's commitment was to the 
community as a whole.
  Doug was joined in all of his endeavors by his wife of 52 years. 
Together, they had four children: Philip Perry of Escondido, 
California, Kim McCormick of Rancho Cucamonga, California, Brooke 
Barbee of Alta Loma, California, and Craig Perry of Upland, California. 
His six grandchildren are Steven Barbee, Paige Flick, Brandy Barbee, 
Michael Perry, Christopher McCormick, and Scott Perry--and his two 
great-grandchildren are Tessa and Jacob Weir.
  My condolences go to Doug's fine family. He will be missed, but his 
memory will live on in his beloved community of San Ysidro.
