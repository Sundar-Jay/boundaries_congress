                   TRIBUTE TO MRS. REBECCA SUE SPEARS

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. MAC COLLINS

                               of georgia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. COLLINS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize a remarkable 
woman on the occasion of a very special anniversary. In 1993, Mrs. 
Rebecca Sue Spears, of Fayetteville, Georgia, was diagnosed with breast 
cancer. This year marks the tenth anniversary of Mrs. Spears being 
``cancer free.''
  Today, a woman is diagnosed with breast cancer approximately every 2 
minutes. Thanks to the efforts of people like Mrs. Spears, we are 
making great strides to eradicate this devastating disease. As a breast 
cancer survivor, Mrs. Spears continues to raise money and awareness to 
fight breast cancer and is a true servant leader.
  In 2002, at the age of 59, Mrs. Spears participated in the Avon 3-Day 
Breast Cancer

Walk in Atlanta, Georgia. During this inspiring event, Mrs. Spears 
walked twenty-miles per day for 3 days and represented women everywhere 
that are battling this terrible disease. Recently, in Atlanta, she 
walked in the Susan G. Kormen Race For the Cure; an event that is 
celebrating its 20th Anniversary and is now the largest series of 5K 
races in the world. Thanks to dedicated volunteers like Mrs. Spears, 
the Susan G. Kormen Breast Cancer Foundation has raised over $250 
million for education, research, screening and treatment. On June 7, 
2003, Mrs. Spears will walk again in her quest to fight cancer, here in 
our Nation's Capital, in the National Race For the Cure.
  I am honored to recognize Mrs. Rebecca Sue Spears on this momentous 
occasion. She is an inspiration to her husband, James E. Spears, her 
two daughters, Kathryn and Karen, her two sons Jimmy and Steven, her 
six grandchildren, and countless others who are battling this disease. 
In her own words she describes her relentless determination by saying, 
``I walk and will continue to walk until a cure is found with hopes and 
prayers that my daughters, grandchildren, other family members and 
friends, as well as millions of others, will never have to be told--
`you have cancer.' ''
