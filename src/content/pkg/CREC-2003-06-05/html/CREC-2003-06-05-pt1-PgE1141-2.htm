                CONGRATULATING MISS UNIVERSE AMELIA VEGA

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. CHARLES B. RANGEL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Ms. Amelia Vega of 
the Dominican Republic on being crowned Miss Universe in ceremonies 
held in Panama City, Panama on June 3, 2003. She was selected for this 
honor in a competition that featured more than 70 of the most beautiful 
young women in the world.
  It was also a good night for the women of the Caribbean, who earned 
the pageant's other honors. Miss Dominican Republic, in addition to 
winning the big prize, was voted as the best dressed contestant while 
Miss Puerto Rico, Carla Tricoli, was awarded the title of Miss 
Photogenic and Miss Antigua and Barbuda, Kai Davis, was honored as Miss 
Congeniality.
  Miss Vega, who is the first Dominican to win the beauty pageant, won 
the crowd and the judges over with a humble confidence that extended 
beyond her 18 years of age. She intends to spend the next year pursuing 
her dreams of an entertainment career and leading fundraising efforts 
on behalf of AIDS research and awareness.
  The Miss Universe title opens doors for both its winner and her 
country of origin. As the native country of the current Miss Universe, 
Panama was able to host this year's pageant, helping to generate what 
government officials say could be as much as $60,000,000 in revenues. 
Perhaps as important, it is also a source of national pride and 
inspiration for all those associated with the Dominican community, 
abroad and in the United States. As a representative of a district that 
contains the largest concentration of Dominicans outside of Quisqueya, 
I join the people of Washington Heights as they bask in the joy of 
seeing one of their own succeed on such a competitive world stage.
  Miss Vega understands that alongside the numerous ``once in a 
lifetime opportunities,'' her fame will allow her to affect the image 
that the world has of the Dominican people and its culture. Although 
potentially daunting, it is a responsibility that she is excited to 
accept. As she told the crowd last night, ``I didn't come here just for 
the crown, but also to make my country proud.''
  Undoubtedly, she is on her way.
