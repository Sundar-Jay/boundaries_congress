                         HONORING BOB SCHROEDER

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JEB BRADLEY

                            of new hampshire

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. BRADLEY of New Hampshire. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to Bob Schroeder upon being named the Town of Hooksett's 
Citizen of the Year.
  Bob was instrumental in the restoration and revitalization of a truly 
historic local, state and national landmark. Robie's Country Store in 
Hooksett has a lengthy history of acting as the town's gathering spot, 
a place to argue politics, play checkers and buy groceries and homemade 
baked goods. Robie's was also a required stop for local politicians and 
presidential candidates visiting the first-in-the-nation primary state 
for over 30 years. The store closed in 1997 after the store's owners, 
Lloyd and Dorothy Robie, retired. After five years of dormancy and a 
lack of funds and dedicated owners, Robie's Country Store reopened, 
continuing its 30-year political tradition and its 110-year presence in 
the town.
  Bob saw an imperative need to preserve this cultural and political 
landmark and formed the Robie's Country Store Historic Preservation 
Association to spearhead the renovation effort. The Association has 
worked diligently to bring the store to life again, and on May 24, 
2003, Robie's Country Store reopened to an eager and proud community. 
Bob and the Preservation Association were careful to maintain Robie's 
historical accuracy by keeping the 97-year old building's original 
flooring, ceiling and picture wall of political memorabilia. Always 
humble, Bob refuses to take the credit for the grand reopening of the 
store, instead pointing the spotlight on the efforts of the entire 
community. Under Bob's leadership, people of all ages worked together 
to restore Robie's through fundraising and renovation efforts. The 
community's hard work will undoubtedly ensure that the rich heritage 
and traditions of the store will remain in tact for future generations 
to enjoy.
  Bob's tireless commitment to preserving this landmark and energizing 
the whole community to get involved is a wonderful example of his 
perseverance and dedication to improving the community and state in 
which he lives. I can think of no better person than Bob to receive the 
Hooksett Citizen of the Year Award. I am honored to represent concerned 
and conscientious citizens like Bob in the U.S. House of 
Representatives.
