                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity 
to pay tribute to Mr. David A. Lebow on the occasion of his retirement 
as the President of the Montebello Teachers Association. I also want to 
thank him for 39 years of distinguished and dedicated service to the 
Montebello Unified School District.
  David Lebow first joined the Montebello Unified School District in 
1964, as a teacher at Eastmont Junior High School. In 1971 he began 
enriching the minds of students at Schurr High School in the 
disciplines of Music, Theater Arts, Advanced Placement American 
History, and Advanced Placement American Government. Over the last 33 
years his service to the education community has been demonstrated 
through numerous positions including Fine Arts and Social Studies 
Department Chair, High Risk Academic Cluster Coordinator, Key Club 
Sponsor, National Honor Society Sponsor, Principal's Advisory Committee 
Chair, and Class Sponsor in 1974 and 1979.
  In 1981 David Lebow began dedicating his time and skills to the 
Montebello Teachers Association (M.T.A.), serving as High School 
Representative from 1981 through 1984, Vice President from 1984 through 
1985 and again in 1998 through 2000. He served as Treasurer from 1991 
through 1993. In 2001, the membership elected Mr. Lebow President, 
where he has served as the voice of over 1,600 teachers for the past 
two years.
  Mr. Lebow has also served as the M.T.A. Lifetime Health Benefits 
Trust Chairperson since 1987. Additionally, David Lebow's advocacy on 
behalf of teachers extends to the state level, where he has served on 
the California Teachers' Association (C.T.A.) Board of Directors from 
1990 through 2001. He has served as member and Chairperson of the 
Alliance of Urban Teachers from 1985 through 1989 as well as Liaison 
Coordinator to the C.T.A. Board of Directors.
  Mr. Lebow has lead with integrity and has enjoyed the respect of many 
in the field of education. So it is not surprising that his skills and 
devotion have earned him many awards and recognitions. He has been the 
recipient of the P.T.A. Founders Award, the Los Angeles County Bravo 
Award, the C.T.A. Local and State ``Who'' Award for outstanding work on 
behalf of members, and the C.T.A. Human Rights Award for work in 
fostering the advancement of women and minorities in leadership 
positions.
  Mr. Speaker, in closing I wish the very best to David Lebow as he is 
recognized for his years of service to the Montebello Unified School 
District. His strong leadership skills and devotion to the teaching 
profession and to children will be greatly missed. During the last 39 
years of service, he certainly has earned recognition, and I call upon 
all my colleagues to join me in applauding his tenure in education and 
wishing him all the best for his retirement.
