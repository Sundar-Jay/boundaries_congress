            EXTEND TAX CREDIT FOR CHILDREN TO ALL AMERICANS

  (Mr. PALLONE asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, the Democrats feel very strongly that we 
need to move to put back in place this tax credit for children and 
families of children at lower income levels. These are working people. 
The Republicans made a huge mistake, and it shows where they are coming 
from when they eliminated giving a child tax credit to these working 
families at the lower end of the income spectrum.
  But now what I hear is that the Republicans in the other body say, 
well, they are not going to do this unless we also give a child tax 
credit to people at a little higher income level. Now we hear that here 
in this House the Republican leadership says that they are probably not 
going to do it anyway, because they do not want to give the tax credit 
to the families of these lower-income working families.
  Once again, the Republicans created this problem because they would 
not include the child tax credit for these working families, and they 
are still trying to stop it from becoming law and demanding that more 
money go to higher income people in order to pay for it.
  When is this going to stop? When are we going to wake up and realize 
that what the Republican leadership is really all about in this tax 
bill and this series of tax bills is just helping the elite, the 
wealthy elite?
