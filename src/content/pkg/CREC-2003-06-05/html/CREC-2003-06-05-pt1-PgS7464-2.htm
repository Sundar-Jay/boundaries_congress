 CONGRATULATING ROBERT AND ERMA BYRD ON THEIR 66TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last Thursday marked an important--and

[[Page S7465]]

extraordinary--milestone in the lives of two very special members of 
our Senate family.
  On May 29, 1937--66 years and one week ago today--Robert Carlyle Byrd 
and Erma Ora James were married.
  The Senate was not in session on their actual anniversary, so I come 
to the floor today--one week later--to congratulate Senator and Mrs. 
Byrd on their remarkable achievement.
  Robert and Erma Byrd both grew up in the hardscrabble coal country of 
West Virginia. They were high school sweethearts.
  Of all of Senator Byrd's tremendous achievements--and there are 
many--I suspect the two that mean the most to him are convincing Erma 
James to marry him in the first place--and staying married to her all 
these years.
  I have heard Senator Byrd say often that he could not do this job 
were it not for his wife's love and support. In his words: ``She is not 
only my wife, but also my best counselor. She has been a strong pillar 
of support in all my endeavors.''
  The Byrds' marriage has brought them two wonderful daughters: Mona 
Byrd Fatemi and Marjorie Byrd Moore.
  They have also been blessed with six grandchildren and three great-
granddaughters.
  After Mrs. Byrd and their family, the Senate and the Constitution, 
one of the things that Senator Byrd loves best--as we all know--is 
history--especially ancient history. So I think he may appreciate this 
thought from Homer:

       There is nothing more admirable than two people who see 
     eye-to-eye keeping house as man and wife, confounding their 
     enemies, and delighting their friends.

  For 66 years, Robert and Erma Byrd have done for more than delight 
their friends.
  Together, they have created a full and rich life. They have raised a 
family. And they have served the people of West Virginia, and America, 
well. We wish them many more years of happiness together.
