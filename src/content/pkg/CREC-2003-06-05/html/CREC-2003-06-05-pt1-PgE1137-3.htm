                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Alajandra Pena in 
recognition of her outstanding accomplishment in this year's 75th 
Precinct Council Spelling Bee competition.

[[Page E1138]]

  Alajandra is currently in the fifth grade at P.S. 72 in Brooklyn, New 
York. She received a second place award in the spelling bee.
  Mr. Speaker, Alajandra Pena has demonstrated that she is committed to 
her academic studies and is an excellent speller. As such, she is more 
than worthy of receiving our recognition today and I urge my colleagues 
to join me in honoring her and her accomplishment.
