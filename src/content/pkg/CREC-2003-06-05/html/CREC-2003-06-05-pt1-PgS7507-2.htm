      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATION OF MICHAEL CHERTOFF

  Mr. BENNETT. As in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 
5:15 on Monday, June 9, the Senate proceed to executive session for the 
consideration of Calendar No. 201, the nomination of Michael Chertoff 
to be U.S. circuit judge for the Third Circuit; provided further that 
there then be 30 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form 
prior to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, with no 
intervening action or debate. I further ask consent that following the 
vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and 
the Senate then resume legislative session.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Nevada.
  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, this will be 
the 128th judge that this Senate has approved during the term of this 
President. This will be the 25th circuit judge that has been approved. 
I want the record to make sure everyone understands that, 128 to 2. Two 
have been held up.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is 
so ordered.
  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would make a comment before I proceed 
to the next consent request. With respect to Mr. Chertoff, I became 
well acquainted with Mr. Chertoff when he served as counsel to the 
special committee created by Senate resolution to investigate the 
Whitewater matter. I found him competent, direct, thorough, well 
prepared, and a delightful human being. I probably will not get into 
the debate, the amount of time being limited, but I want the record to 
show how highly I esteem him and how enthusiastically I will vote to 
confirm him for the circuit court position to which he has been 
nominated.
