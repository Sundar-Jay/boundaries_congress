                    TRIBUTE TO CONNIE ANN VEILLETTE

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RALPH REGULA

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. REGULA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Connie Veillette 
for her 20 years of dedicated public service in my Washington, D.C. 
office and to the people of Ohio's 16th Congressional district.
  Connie began her career in my office just after completion of her 
college degree from Ohio University in 1982. Over the next 20 years, 
she became a vital member of my office staff, handling policy issues as 
diverse as foreign affairs and transportation. Connie also served as a 
key staff person handling Appropriations Subcommittee work in my 
office. Over the past 10 years, Connie has served as my Chief of Staff. 
In this role she managed the Washington office and oversaw the District 
offices, she acted as my principal policy advisor and continued to 
advise me on foreign policy matters, she served as my press secretary 
and coordinated all Ohio Delegation matters. During her tenure in my 
office I have valued her excellent management skills and relied on her 
good judgment with regard to policy and political matters.
  During her tenure in my office, Connie also served as the 
Congressional manager of the Congress-Bundestag exchange, a 20 year 
program that promotes greater understanding of the U.S. legislative 
process and the German parliamentary system. This vital exchange 
program has allowed hundreds of Congressional staffers to visit Germany 
and hundreds of German Parliamentary staff to visit the U.S. The 
program has allowed participants to gain insights into our different 
political systems and to develop personal and professional 
relationships that benefit both nations.
  Throughout her service in my office, Connie pursued her higher 
education goals, completing both a Master's Degree and most recently 
completing course work toward her Ph.D. in Political Science from the 
George Washington University. We were very proud when she completed her 
doctoral exams with distinction. These experiences have enabled Connie 
to develop an expertise in Latin American affairs which she will use in 
her new position as Analyst for Latin America with the Congressional 
Research Service.
  We are glad that she has not traveled far and that we will still be 
able to call on her excellent research and analytical skills as will 
all Members and staff in Congress. We wish her much success in her new 
endeavors.
