  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. Neugebauer) be permitted to take the oath of office 
today.
  His certificate of election has not arrived; but there is no contest, 
and no question has been raised with regard to his election.
  The SPEAKER. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from 
Texas?
  There was no objection.
  The SPEAKER. Will the Representative-elect and the members of the 
Texas delegation present themselves in the well.
  Mr. NEUGEBAUER appeared at the bar of the House and took the oath of

  Do you solemnly swear that you will support and defend the 
Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and 
domestic; that you will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; 
that you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or 
purpose of evasion, and that you will well and faithfully discharge the 
duties of the office on which you are about to enter. So help you God.
  The SPEAKER. Congratulations, you are now a Member of the 108th 
Congress.
