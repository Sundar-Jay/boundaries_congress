   RECOGNIZING OFFICER CLAYTON HARMSTON, RECIPIENT OF THE CALIFORNIA 
  AMERICAN LEGION LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE YEAR FOR VALOR AWARD

<bullet> Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the 
Senate's attention the exemplary achievements and outstanding service 
of Officer Clayton Harmston of the San Francisco Police Department.
  The American Legion, Department of California has chosen Officer 
Clayton Harmston as its Law Enforcement Officer of the Year for Valor. 
Officer Harmston is receiving this award for the extraordinary heroism 
he displayed in the line of duty on July 7, 2002.
  On that day, Officer Harmston and his partner stopped a vehicle that 
was operating in a suspicious manner. During the vehicle stop, Officer 
Harmston approached the passenger, who was just paroled from State 
prison. The passenger refused to submit to a search and immediately 
attacked Officer Harmston. A struggle ensued, Officer Harmston was 
knocked to the ground face-first, and then the parolee drew his loaded 
weapon on Officer Harmston. Although injured and dazed, Officer 
Harmston demonstrated great presence of mind and warned his partner of 
the gun. When Harmston's partner distracted the parolee, Officer 
Harmston displayed remarkable courage by attempting to pull the gun 
away from the parolee. During the struggle, the parolee shot Officer 
Harmston who was able to roll away to cover, where a gun battle began. 
The gunman was struck and fell to the ground, refusing to release his 
weapon until it was taken from his grip.
  Officer Clayton Harmston, despite his injuries, used all his 
abilities and resources to protect his partner and ultimately end this 
dangerous situation. Officer Harmston is an inspiration to all. It is 
because of the courage and valor of police officers such as Clayton 
Harmston that our streets are safer.
  Californians are extremely proud of Officer Harmston. He is most 
deserving of the American Legion, Department of California's Law 
Enforcement Officer of the Year for Valor award and of the admiration 
that he receives from colleagues and friends. I am honored to pay 
tribute to him, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in wishing 
Officer Harmston much continued success in his law enforcement 
career.<bullet>
