                        House of Representatives

  The House met at 10 a.m.
  The Very Reverend Ernesto Medina, Provost, Cathedral Center of St. 
Paul, Los Angeles, California, offered the following prayer:
  Loving God, in Your word You have given us a vision of that holy city 
to which the nations of the world bring their glory. Behold and visit, 
we pray, the communities on this Earth. Renew the ties of mutual regard 
which form our civic life. Send us honest and able leaders. Enable us 
to eliminate poverty, prejudice and oppression, that peace may prevail 
with righteousness, and justice with order, and that men and women from 
different cultures and with differing talents may find with one another 
the fulfillment of their humanity.
  O God, the fountain of wisdom, whose will is good and gracious and 
whose law is truth: We pray You so to guide and bless our 
Representatives in Congress assembled, that they may enact such laws as 
shall please You, to the glory of Your name and the welfare of this 
people; in Your holy name we pray. Amen.
