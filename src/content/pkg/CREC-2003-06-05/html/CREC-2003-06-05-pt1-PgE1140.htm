      HONORING THE 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF GOUGLERSVILLE FIRE COMPANY

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JIM GERLACH

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. GERLACH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Gouglersville 
Fire Company of Gouglersville, PA during its 75th anniversary 
celebration.
  Without a fire company of its own, the people of Gouglersville, PA 
had to rely on companies located in neighboring communities. On March 
8, 1928, citizens of Gouglersville attended a town meeting to discuss 
the formation of their own company. Over the next few months, the 
Gouglersville Fire Company was created. Members were recruited, 
officers were elected and the company constitution and by-laws were 
adopted. Finally, on September 4, 1928, the Berks County Court of 
Common Pleas granted a charter to the Company.
  Over the next few years, the Company purchased a firehouse and its 
first apparatus. As time went on, the Company outgrew its original 
building and purchased a larger space to accommodate its increased 
membership and growing number of vehicles. The charter and by-laws of 
the Company were amended on August 3, 1950 to permit women to join. A 
Junior Brigade was started in 1972. As time has passed and the Company 
has changed, one thing that has not altered is the dedication of the 
firefighters to their duties.
  For the past 75 years, the citizens of Gouglersville have been able 
to depend on the courageous men and women of Gouglersville Fire 
Company. I encourage my colleagues to join me in saluting Gouglersville 
Fire Company on reaching this milestone.
