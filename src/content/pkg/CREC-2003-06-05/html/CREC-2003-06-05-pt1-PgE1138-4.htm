                         TRIBUTE TO DR. MATORY

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. DONNA M. CHRISTENSEN

                         of the virgin islands

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mrs. CHRISTENSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak of an 
outstanding doctor, educator, and mentor who is on the eve of his 
retirement as Director of Continuing Medical Education and Professor of 
Surgery at Howard University.
  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Matory has had a distinguished career as a surgeon 
and a researcher and is well known in the Washington, D.C. metro area 
for his contributions to trauma and burn care.
  His hospital activities included the directorship of the Emergency 
Care Area at both the Freedmen's Hospital and Howard University 
Hospital from 1960 to 1982, at a time when those facilities were the 
leading hospital emergency systems in Washington, D.C.
  During his tenure, Dr. Matory reorganized the ambulatory care system 
at Howard to ease emergency care follow-up and to facilitate continuity 
of patient care. He introduced vascular access as a service in 1970 in 
preparation for the Howard University Hospital chronic dialysis and 
renal transplantation programs.
  Dr. Matory received the Distinguished Surgeon Award from the 
Southeastern Surgical Congress in 1998. He has been a Member of the 
National Academy of Science, and the Robert Wood Johnson Committee 
which encouraged the establishment of the ``911'' emergency response 
system throughout the country.
  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Matory also developed the Howard University Family 
Practice Program, and served as its first chairman from 1970 to 1979; a 
program in which I had the honor of being a student, and the privilege 
of being taught and mentored by Dr. Matory, an experience which has 
shaped my medical and overall career. He was also co-founder of the 
Physician Assistant Training Program at Howard in 1972.
  As an educator, he has been a leader in the continuing medical 
education of physicians from all over the world, who attend Howard to 
keep abreast of the ever changing medical landscape. He is a founder of 
the CME program at Howard, the first in the Washington, D.C. area to be 
certified by the American Medical Association, the Liaison Council on 
Continuing Medical Education and currently the Accreditation Council 
for Continuing Medical Education.
  During his illustrious career, he has also served as Assistant Dean 
for Clinical Affairs at the College of Medicine, Assistant Medical 
Director for Postgraduate Affairs at Howard University Hospital and 
Chairman of the Washington, D.C. Board of Medicine.
  He has been a member of several medical societies to include the 
Medico-Chirurgical Society of the District of Colombia, the Medical 
Society of the District of Colombia, the American College of Surgeons, 
the National Medical Association and the American Medical Association.
  Mr. Speaker, aside from his medical accomplishments, Dr. Matory 
served as a captain in the U.S. Air Force in Japan from 1955 to 1957. 
He has also authored 16 publications and produced 130 surgical and 
general medical videotapes in continuing medical education.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a resounding thank you to Dr. 
William Earle Matory for his tireless dedication to his community and 
his inspiration to us all.
