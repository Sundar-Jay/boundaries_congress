                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand before this body of 
Congress today to recognize a man who exemplifies the heart, 
determination, and enthusiastic spirit that makes up the backbone of 
this great nation. Louis Martinez, a 57-year-old man from Grand 
Junction, Colorado, is an elementary school counselor who takes pride 
in helping to motivate and encourage his young students.
  The lessons in Louis's life started right away, as his parents showed 
him the determination it takes to succeed. Louis's father worked for 
the railroad laying track and his mother worked in a canning factory. 
They worked hard to provide for their children and instilled a similar 
work ethic in their son. Louis was responsible for duties all over the 
house, including cooking and cleaning. This work ethic led Louis down a 
path that he never dreamed he would take. Louis left high school his 
senior year and joined the Navy. He served three tours in Vietnam, 
traveling all over the Western Pacific. Louis returned to Grand 
Junction and a job at City Market in the bakery department.
  In the spirit of contributing to his community, Louis set his sights 
on becoming a police officer. His hard work paid off and he became the 
first Hispanic officer on the force. While on the police force, Louis 
decided to go back to school, enrolling at the University of Northern 
Colorado. It was at this time that Louis was injured in a car accident 
and once again was presented with the opportunity to overcome 
adversity. Louis was paralyzed in the accident, forcing him to work 
even harder to receive his degree. He continued through school with the 
support of his family, and received his diploma.
  With his degree in hand, Louis set off to help as many young people 
as possible. He

ended up at Tope and Wingate Elementary Schools, where he became a 
school counselor. He has worked for the schools for eleven years and 
hopes to work there for many more. Everyday on the job Louis provides 
the children with a positive influence, giving them a mentor they can 
respect and admire.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to pay tribute to Louis Martinez before this 
body of Congress and this nation. His determination and optimism are 
models for today's youth. I am pleased that Louis has chosen a career 
where he can extend his positive influence to our children. Thank you, 
Louis, for the outstanding example of hard work, determination, and 
optimism that you have given our children.
