                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, It is my privilege to pay tribute to 
the life of Joanne Carlin, a lifelong resident of the Cleveland area, 
who died on May 14 after a courageous battle against cancer.
  Joanne's giving spirit was shaped by her experiences growing up in 
Cleveland's Tremont area. A product of St. Augustine Catholic School, 
she eventually moved to Garfield Heights, where she graduated from high 
school.
  Joanne owned and operated a beauty salon on Cleveland's west side. 
Her former customers praised her as a loyal and generous person.
  She later sold her business and moved to Medina County to become a 
full-time homemaker. An excellent cook, Joanne enriched the lives of 
her family and friends as the consummate hostess during family 
gatherings and holidays.
  Our hearts go out to her husband and best friend, James; her four 
stepchildren and three stepgrandchildren; and legions of family and 
friends who recall the memories of these gatherings and the tremendous 
influence Joanne had in their lives.
