              TRIBUTE TO IMMANUEL UNITED METHODIST CHURCH

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. SANDER M. LEVIN

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the designation of 
Immanuel United Methodist Church in Roseville, Michigan as a Michigan 
Historical Site. The site will be dedicated on Sunday, June 8, 2003, 
when the Michigan Historical Marker is officially unveiled at the 
church.
  The criteria for becoming a Michigan Historical Site are strict. A 
site must possess integrity of location, design, materials, and 
workmanship. Additionally, a property's historical significance must 
reflect the distinctive characteristics of a type, period, or method of 
construction.
  The Immanuel United Methodist congregation has continuously 
ministered to this community for over 153 years. The congregation was 
established in November 1849 and moved to its present location in 1933. 
This Neo-Gothic sandstone church was designed by Merritt and Cole of 
Detroit and was dedicated on November 5, 1933.
  Many changes and improvement have been made to the church over the 
years. A thirteen room educational unit was added in 1956, and the 
existing rooms were refurbished to create a beautiful new church 
parlor. The church was also renovated in 1997 to include facilities for 
the physically handicapped. The new structure addition was named Peace 
Memorial Lobby in honor of the merger of Peace United Methodist Church 
with Immanuel in 1996.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the 
leadership and the entire congregation at Immanuel United Methodist 
Church, as they celebrate this important designation as a Michigan 
Historical Site.
