                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

  SENATE RESOLUTION 160--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE 
    FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD ACTIVELY PURSUE A UNIFIED APPROACH TO 
       STRENGTHEN AND PROMOTE THE NATIONAL POLICY ON AQUACULTURE

  Mr. AKAKA submitted the following resolution; which was referred to 
the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:

                              S. Res. 160

       Whereas the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United 
     Nations determined that aquaculture is the fastest growing 
     food sector that provides animal protein for citizens of the 
     world;
       Whereas global aquacultural production (including the 
     production of aquatic plants) has increased at an average 
     rate of 9.2 percent per year since 1970, compared with only 
     1.4 percent for capture fisheries and 2.8 percent for 
     terrestrial-farmed meat production systems;
       Whereas freshwater aquacultural production increased from 
     15,900,000 metric tons in 1996 to 22,600,000 metric tons in 
     2001, marine aquacultural production increased from 
     10,800,000 metric tons in 1996 to 15,200,000 metric tons in 
     2001, and total aquacultural production increased from 
     26,700,000 metric tons in 1996 to 37,800,000 metric tons in 
     2001;
       Whereas economic modeling predicts that global annual 
     consumption of fish and shellfish per person will increase 
     over time, from about 16 kilograms today to between 19 and 21 
     kilograms in 2030, due to increased health consciousness and 
     the stronger demand for seafood products;
       Whereas the United States imports more than 60 percent of 
     its seafood products, resulting in an annual seafood trade 
     deficit in excess of $7,000,000,000; and
       Whereas section 7109 of the Farm Security and Rural 
     Investment Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-171; 116 Stat. 436) 
     reauthorized the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 (16 U.S.C. 
     2801 et seq.) until 2007, but did not adequately address 
     emerging national issues

[[Page S7497]]

     such as offshore aquaculture development, water quality 
     concerns, invasive species impacts, and a coordinated siting, 
     permitting, and licensing process: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That the Senate calls on the Federal Government 
     to actively pursue a unified approach to strengthen and 
     promote the national policy on aquaculture, including as 
     priorities--
       (1) ensuring the sustainable development of production 
     where aquaculture is economically viable, environmentally 
     feasible, and culturally acceptable;
       (2) analyzing the supply and demand for domestic and 
     exported aquacultural products to enable the United States to 
     compete in the global marketplace;
       (3) increasing the availability of new technical and 
     scientific information that supports aquaculture development;
       (4) with regard to marine aquaculture, providing 
     encouragement and identification of marine zones favorable to 
     aquaculture that take into consideration desired 
     environmental conditions and potential use conflicts; and
       (5) establishing a goal of a 5-fold increase in United 
     States aquacultural production by 2025.
  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which 
calls upon the Federal Government to actively pursue a unified approach 
to strengthen our national policy on aquaculture. The United States has 
allowed its seafood trade deficit to reach $7 billion by importing over 
60 percent of its seafood products from foreign countries, a 
distressing statistic. My resolution calls for immediate action by 
local, State, and Federal agencies to cooperatively reduce this seafood 
trade deficit. The United States must step forward to meet the growing 
consumer demand for seafood products that are sustainable, economically 
viable, environmentally feasible, and culturally acceptable. In order 
to adequately address the seafood trade deficit, we must promote 
aquaculture by committing to a five fold increase in U.S. aquaculture 
production by the year 2025.
  As early as 1878, Congress supported the managed production of fish 
in the wake of a decrease in marine fisheries off the Atlantic Coast. 
Almost 100 years later, our Nation made important strides to encourage 
U.S. aquaculture by enacting the National Aquaculture Act of 1980 to 
coordinate all appropriate Federal programs and policies involving 
aquaculture. Even though the National Aquaculture Act was reauthorized 
by P.L. 107-171 until the year 2007, the legislation still falls short 
of its goal to ensure coordination and promote a strong aquaculture 
industry. Producers need improved guidance to clarify and simplify 
regulations pertaining to siting and environmental issues, particularly 
for the timely development of aquaculture in offshore waters. The level 
of funding for research and development has been very, very low and 
tangible incentives for marine aquaculture have been lacking compared 
to those of the agriculture and fishing industries. Therefore, a new, 
unified Federal policy promoting aquaculture is vitally needed to 
transform U.S. aquaculture into a major industry.
  The current trends in aquaculture both worldwide and in the United 
States necessitate prompt action by the Federal Government. The 
contribution of aquaculture to global supplies of fish, crustaceans, 
and mollusks is growing by 9.21 percent annually. But aquaculture 
industries in china, India, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia have greatly 
surpassed the United States due in part to less expensive labor, lower 
property values, and weaker environmental regulations. In fact, the 
total value of aquaculture production is approximately $61 billion 
worldwide; of this, the $0.5 billion U.S. aquaculture industry is far 
outpaced by nations that have a 1 to 28 billion dollar value. Although 
U.S. aquaculture has been considered a minor industry over the years, 
it is rapidly becoming one of the fastest-growing industries and has 
vast, vast potential. The U.S. has two choices. We can either stand by 
and watch our seafood trade deficit grow larger than $7 billion or we 
can seize this opportunity to promote a strong U.S. aquaculture 
industry to produce healthier foods and economic benefits for our 
citizens.
  U.S. aquaculture development can meet the growing consumer demand for 
quality seafood products and, at the same time, relieve the pressure on 
overfished stocks. More than one billion people currently derive at 
least 20 percent of their animal protein from fish, and studies have 
predicted that this demand for seafood will only increase over time. 
Meanwhile, half of the world's main fish stocks are fully exploited or 
producing catches that have reached their maximum sustainable limits. A 
strong U.S. aquaculture industry will result in a net contribution to 
worldwide food availability, economic growth, and improved living 
standards.

  In Hawaii, we are at the forefront of U.S. aquaculture through 
supportive research and production efforts for marine aquaculture. 
Hawaii first harvested offshore aquaculture products from sea cages in 
1999 and the State awarded its first commercial lease for offshore 
aquaculture in State waters in the year 2001. The aquaculture 
technologies developed in Hawaii with high environmental standards can 
help lead the world in economically and environmentally sound 
aquaculture practices.
  The U.S. needs to invest in our aquaculture industry today. This 
resolution recognizes the importance of aquaculture and calls for a 
coherent national approach to provide appropriate guidance for a 
sustainable aquaculture industry in different regions of the United 
States. This coherent, comprehensive strategy will contribute to 
worldwide food availability while providing much-needed economic growth 
within the United States. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.
