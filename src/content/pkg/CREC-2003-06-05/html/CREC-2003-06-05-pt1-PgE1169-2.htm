                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask that my colleagues here 
in the U.S. House of Representatives join me in congratulating a highly 
respected and accomplished professor, Dr. Ralph Nurnberger, on being 
selected as the recipient of the Excellence in Teaching Faculty Award 
at Georgetown University. Dr. Nurnberger received this outstanding 
honor at the University's 2003 commencement ceremonies.
  For over 2 decades, Dr. Nurnberger has taught courses in the Liberal 
Studies Degree Program focusing on an array of issues including 
American foreign policy, congressional relations, and international 
affairs. Most recently, he has been teaching a course on the aftermath 
of September 11, considering the domestic and international 
ramifications for the United States. His teaching has been marked with 
extensive experience in domestic and international affairs. Dr. 
Nurnberger has held positions with former Senator James Pearson, the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the American Israel Public Affairs 
Committee, the Center for Strategic and International Studies and the 
U.S. Department of Commerce. He currently holds the position of Counsel 
with the law firm Preston Gates Ellis and Rouvelas Meeds.
  Following the signing of the Oslo Accords, Dr. Nurnberger was 
appointed to the position of Executive Director of the organization 
``Builders for Peace'' to assist the Arab-Israeli peace process. Also 
an accomplished writer, his articles have appeared in The Washington 
Post, The Washington Times, Christian Science Monitor, Baltimore Sun 
and numerous journals.
  Dr. Nurnberger is popular with students because of his reputation as 
an insightful educator who promotes lively and thought-provoking 
discussions encouraging the expression of all points of view.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that we here in the U.S. House of Representatives 
join Georgetown University in commending Dr. Ralph Nurnberger for his 
excellence in teaching and congratulate him on receiving such a 
prestigious award.
