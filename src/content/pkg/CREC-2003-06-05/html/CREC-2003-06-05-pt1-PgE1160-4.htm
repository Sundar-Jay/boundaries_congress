                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. KUCINICH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and recognition of 
Frank G. Jackson, President of Cleveland City Council, as he was 
honored by the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party on May 18, 2003.
  Mr. Jackson is a United States veteran, having served our country in 
Vietnam. After being honorably discharged, he returned to his East 38th 
Street neighborhood and began attending classes at Cuyahoga Community 
College. In 1975, he graduated with a Bachelor's degree from Cleveland 
State University. In 1977, Mr. Jackson was awarded a Master's degree in 
Urban Studies from CSU. In 1983, after working his way through law 
school as a night clerk at Cleveland Municipal Clerk's Office, Mr. 
Jackson was awarded a law degree from the Cleveland-Marshall College of 
Law, and worked as an assistant county prosecutor until his 1990 
election to Cleveland City Council, representing Ward 5.
  For the past 13 years, Mr. Jackson has focused his efforts on 
revitalizing the housing and commercial aspects of the Ward 5 
community, and has done so by working closely with neighborhood leaders 
and development organizations, and by setting a tone of integrity, 
diligence, commitment and cooperation among City Council members and 
City administrators.
  Mr. Speaker and Colleagues, please join me in honor of Mr. Frank G. 
Jackson, President of Cleveland City Council, as we recognize his 
outstanding contribution to our community. Mr. Jackson's work, 
expertise and dedication have served to improve and strengthen our 
urban neighborhoods, bringing light and hope to the citizens of Ward 5, 
and to our entire community.

                          ____________________
