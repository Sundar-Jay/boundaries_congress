                     PAYING TRIBUTE TO BILL CORDOVA

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SCOTT McINNIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
pay tribute to Bill Cordova of Grand Junction, Colorado, who has been a 
profound inspiration to all who have known him. Bill worked tirelessly 
on behalf of those in need for decades, and it is my honor to recognize 
his service here, before this body of Congress and this nation.
  In his life, Bill has served his fellow neighbor in a number of 
capacities. Early on, Bill worked to provide adequate housing for 
migrant workers, which led to his working some years later for Colorado 
Housing Incorporated in order to provide homes for low-income families. 
Bill was instrumental in developing a community center in Montrose, and 
he has also had an enduring influence in the lives of local prisoners 
to whom he has ministered. Currently, Bill works six days a week at the 
Catholic Outreach Soup Kitchen, and serves on the board of Catholic 
Outreach as well.
  Mr. Speaker, in his lifetime, Bill has touched the lives of many. His 
numerous good works are an example of the benevolence and perseverance 
that have contributed to the strength of this nation. I commend Bill 
for his dedication and commitment to the less fortunate, and it is an 
honor to pay tribute to his selfless work today.
