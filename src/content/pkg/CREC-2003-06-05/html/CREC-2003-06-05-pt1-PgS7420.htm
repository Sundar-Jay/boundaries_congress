                    PRAISING SENATOR ELIZABETH DOLE

  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to join in the praise for the 
Senator from North Carolina. She reminds us today of what an advantage 
it is to have someone of such experience serving in our so-called 
freshman class. She has been a pioneer during her whole career, whether 
at Harvard Law School, the Nixon White House, or in the Cabinet of two 
Presidents. I have had the privilege of working with her all during 
that time on a parallel track.
  On two occasions, I competed in a Presidential race with another 
person named Dole. I am not embarrassed to say I did relatively better 
against her husband than I did against her. They are both here and I 
have enormous admiration for both her and her husband, and all of us 
are enriched by her membership in our class in the Senate.
