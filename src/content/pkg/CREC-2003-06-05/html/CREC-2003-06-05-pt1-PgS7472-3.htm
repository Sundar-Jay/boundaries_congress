 COMMEMORATING JOE CENOZ ON 50 YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE AMERICAN LEGION 
                         CALIFORNIA BOYS STATE

<bullet> Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes 
to recognize a constituent, Joe Cenoz, who will, at the end of the 
month, mark his 50th year of exemplary service to the American Legion 
California Boys State program.
  Since 1935, the Boys State program has brought together high school 
boys from across their States to immerse them in a week of education 
about, and simulation of, their State government. The California 
program began in 1938, and Mr. Cenoz is the first counselor in the 
history of the California Boys State program to reach 50 years of 
service. His work has touched the lives of nearly 50,000 young 
Californians and 3,000 staff members who have served with and under his 
guidance.
  Mr. Cenoz began his 50 years of service with the California Boys 
State program in 1951 as a city counselor. In 1955, he also assumed the 
role of political party counselor, helping to guide the Boys State 
delegates through the process of partisan politics. In 1961, Mr. Cenoz 
was elevated to the role of county counselor. In this role, he worked 
with the delegates of the three cities that made up the county, while 
continuing his role as political party counselor.
  In 1974, Mr. Cenoz moved to the role of assistant chief counselor, 
guiding the California Boys State counseling staff and delegates 
through the week-long program. He became the chief

counselor in 1981, assuming overall responsibility for the activities 
that make up the California Boys State program. The 2003 California 
Boys State session will be Mr. Cenoz's 23rd serving as chief counselor.
  In 1980, Mr. Cenoz was invited to join the staff of Boys Nation. Boys 
Nation is an extension of the Boys State program. Annually, two boys 
from each Boys State program around the country are selected to 
represent their home States at the 10-day Boys Nation program in 
Washington, DC.
  Mr. Cenoz has been a leader outside of the California Boys State 
program as well, serving in the U.S. Navy and the Navy Reserve as a 
submariner from 1941 to 1953. He served in both World War II and the 
Korean war. Additionally, Mr. Cenoz served as a police officer with the 
city of Pomona, beginning in 1951, and retiring at the rank of 
lieutenant in 1980.
  Mr. Cenoz's actions demonstrate his dedication to serving his country 
and the State of California, and I offer my hearty congratulations to 
him for his 50 years of service to the California Boys State 
program.<bullet>
