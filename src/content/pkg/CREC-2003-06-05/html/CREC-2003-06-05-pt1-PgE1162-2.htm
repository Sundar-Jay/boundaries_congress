                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my 
colleagues Mr. Platts, Mr. Kennedy of Rhode Island, Mr. Andrews, Mr. 
Serrano, Ms. DeLauro, Mr. Davis of Illinois, Ms. Solis, Mrs. Davis of 
California, Mr. Hinojosa, Mrs. McCarthy of New York, Mr. Kildee, and 
Mr. Sanders in introducing the FOCUS Act. This legislation would be an 
important step in increasing child care quality for all children.
  High-quality child care can play an important role in healthy child 
development and school-readiness. Just as it is the parents who matters 
at home, it is the teachers who matter in child care. One of the most 
critical components of quality child care is a stable and qualified 
teaching staff. Children learning from more highly educated teachers 
perform better on tests of verbal and match achievement. Yet, child 
care staff--who have the responsibility of helping guide children's 
development--are among the lowest paid workers in America. In 2000, the 
average hourly wage for a child care provider was $8.16, which is 
approximately $16,980 annually. Moreover, most providers do not receive 
health insurance or paid leave and the annual turnover rate is about 30 
percent. Academic and government studies conclude that low pay is one 
of the leading causes of poor quality child care. Low wages keeps 
qualified providers from remaining in the field and deters new 
providers from entering the field. A 2001 report by the Center for 
Child Care Workforce and the University of California Berkeley found 
that centers are losing qualified staff because of low wages and are 
forced to hire less qualified replacements. The study also found that 
not only are wages extremely low, but they are not keeping pace with 
cost of living increases. States report centers are closing or turning 
away children because they cannot properly staff their programs.
  FOCUS directly addresses the problems low pay creates by providing 
stipends to qualified child care staff based on the level of education. 
This legislation would be a mechanism to assist States increase the pay 
of child care workers and to improve the overall quality of child care. 
The bill would supplement wages by a minimum of $1000 per year for 
providers with child development associate credentials and a minimum of 
$3000 per year for providers with B.A.'s in the area of child 
development. These stipends will help attract new qualified workers to 
the field and increase the retention and skill level of current 
workers. FOCUS also would provide funds for scholarships so that we can 
continue to increase the qualifications of the child care workforce.
  Research on early childhood and brain development clearly 
demonstrates that the experiences children have early in life have a 
decisive, long-lasting impact on their later development and learning. 
We cannot expect children to transition to kindergarten and succeed in 
school if we do not take the necessary steps to provide quality care in 
the years prior to school entry. The average quality of child care is 
far poorer than what it should be in a country as wealthy and committed 
to our children's future as is ours. It is time we work to make quality 
child care for all children a national priority. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
Members of the House to join me and co-sponsor the Focus Act.
