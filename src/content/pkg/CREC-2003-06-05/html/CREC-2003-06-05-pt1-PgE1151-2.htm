                            HON. JEFF MILLER

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of our 
Nation's most distinguished and dedicated pastors, Dr. Herb Sadler. 
After 28 years of faithful service to the Northwest Florida community 
as pastor of the Gulf Breeze United Methodist Church, Dr. Sadler will 
leave Gulf Breeze to become the District Superintendent of the Dothan 
District in Dothan, AL, of the Alabama-West Florida Conference of The 
United Methodist Church. We are grateful for the time that Dr. Sadler 
has spent with us in Northwest Florida and we wish him the best in his 
future position.
  Born on February 7, 1942 in Montgomery, AL and raised in Thomasville, 
AL, Herb holds an undergraduate degree from Livingston University and 
both the Master of Divinity and Doctor of Ministry degrees from Emory 
University. Proudly married to his wife Barbara and the father of four 
wonderful children, Bert, Tracy, Stuart, and Scott, he has been blessed 
with three grandchildren, Brady, Breanna, and Jacob.
  Since 1975 Herb has been at the service of the Gulf Breeze United 
Methodist congregation, he has overseen the growth of the parish, from 
500 members to over 4,000 members, and has personally had a direct 
influence on the tremendous increase in worship attendance, from 100 
people to nearly 2,000 people.
  In addition to his duties at Gulf Breeze United Methodist, Herb has 
served his Annual Conference, Alabama-West Florida, as Chairperson of 
The Board of Ordained Ministry and as President of the Council on 
Finance and Administration. He has been a delegate to the 1988, 1992, 
1996, and 2000 Jurisdictional Conferences and the 1992, 1996, and 2000 
General Conferences. He has served as a member of the Board of Trustees 
of Birmingham-Southern College and from 1992 to 2000 he was a member of 
the General Board of Discipleship of The United Methodist Church. 
Currently, he serves as Chair of the Committee on Plan of Organization 
and Rules of Order of the Southeastern Jurisdictional Conference.
  The author of two books, ``We Can All Be Winners'' and ``Today is the 
Only Day'', Herb has previously been President of the Gulf Breeze 
Rotary Club and was a charter member of the Board of Gulf Breeze 
Hospital, a role he continues to serve in today.
  Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer my sincere and heartfelt 
congratulations to my good friend Dr. Herb Sadler on his new position 
with the Alabama-West Florida Conference of The United Methodist 
Church. Herb was recently named one of the top 11 leaders in Northwest 
Florida by Climate Magazine and I can think of no person that is more 
deserving of such an honor. We will be sad to see his him leave, but 
wish him all the best in his new journey. Mr. Speaker, on this such 
occasion, we honor one of America's greatest citizens.
