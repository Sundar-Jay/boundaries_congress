                      GREATEST BOOTLEG IN HISTORY

  (Mr. RYAN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, we witnessed one of the greatest 
bootlegs in the history of the tax code. We were told that every single 
person would be able to get something back in this tax code, but there 
are people making less than $27,000 a year who will not be getting a 
$400 check, but worse than that, these are families that have worked.
  This is not welfare. This is not a give away. These are people who 
put in 40 hours a week and have children and deserve the $400 back.
  In Youngstown, Ohio, where we have a reserve base, there will be one 
in five military workers who will not be able to qualify for this, 
putting their lives on the line, active duty members of the military 
that will not qualify.
  All we have to do is raise the top tax bracket. It has been lowered 
from 38 percent to 35 percent. From 35 percent, raise it to 35.3 
percent, and we would have enough money generated to take care of 
working parents, mostly single parent homes, many military homes that 
will not be able to utilize this tax credit.
  The greatest bootleg in the history of the Congress.
