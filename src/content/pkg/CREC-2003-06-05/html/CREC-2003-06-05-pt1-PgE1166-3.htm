HONORING SMALLWOOD DRIVE SCHOOL ON THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ITS PRESENT 
                                LOCATION

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. THOMAS M. REYNOLDS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, It is with great pleasure that I rise to 
pay tribute to the Smallwood Drive School for its excellence in 
pursuing its mission of ``Learning, Growing, and Changing'' in 
educating the children in its community. This year marks the fiftieth 
anniversary since the school's relocation to its current site on 
Smallwood Drive in Snyder, New York.
  Smallwood Drive School was founded in 1813. On January 5th, 1952, a 
groundbreaking ceremony was held for the creation of a new campus. On 
June 21st, 1952, the cornerstone was laid of what is the current 
Smallwood Drive School. And in February of 1953, the first principal, 
George Brighton, opened the classroom wings.
  Beyond providing students with an outstanding education, Smallwood 
Drive School has been looked upon as an innovative school--a pioneer on 
many educational fronts--such as learning style approaches and an 
inclusion program to serve children with special needs. The school has 
brought in authors, writers, and scientists, and planned special days 
centered on communication and science. The school has worked with 
numerous outside groups over the years including the Young Audience, 
the University of Buffalo, and the World University Games.
  Smallwood Drive School has also developed a number of unique and fun 
traditions that greatly benefit the children, such as bicycle safety 
rodeos, annual concerts, gym shows, class plays, annual craft shows, 
ice-cream socials, and a 5th grade operetta.
  On the whole, Smallwood Drive School provides an outstanding 
education and social environment in which children may learn, grow, and 
change--all for the better.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that this Congress join me in saluting the 
Smallwood Drive School as it marks its 50th Anniversary at its current 
location. For the past 50 years, Smallwood Drive School has excelled in 
educating our youth and made its surrounding community a better place.
