                       HONORING MELVIN E. OLSSON

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. ROB SIMMONS

                             of connecticut

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. SIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Melvin E. Olsson 
of Mystic, CT, for his dedicated service to the community throughout 
his 43-year career at Electric Boat in Groton, CT.
  Yesterday, for the first time in 13 years, Mel Olsson's name did not 
appear on the ballot for the Marine Draftsmen's Association, MDA, union 
elections at Electric Boat. Olsson is retiring from his post as 
president of the local 571 at Electric Boat and will return to his 
trade as piping designer.
  Mel began as an apprentice in the shipyard in 1962 and moved to the 
design force just 2 years later. Elected vice president of the local in 
1975, Olsson has dedicated much of his career to serving the MDA.
  I commend Mel Olsson for his dedicated service to the working men and 
women of Electric Boat who design the best submarines in the world. He 
has worked to establish a relationship with the company that is better 
than it has ever been. Mel is a true leader in his community and a role 
model for the future leaders of the MDA.
  Mr. Speaker, I encourage the Members of the House of Representatives 
to join me in honoring Melvin Olsson for his 13 years of service as 
head of the MDA. I wish him all the best.
