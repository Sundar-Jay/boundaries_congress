                        ALL AMERICAN CITY AWARD

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. DAVE WELDON

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the 
residents of Palm Bay, Florida Since 1949 the National Civic League has 
recognized great American cities from across the Nation. Palm Bay is 
among the 30 finalists that will compete for the title of ``All 
American City.''
  An All American City is a city that has addressed community issues 
through the strong collaborative efforts of its citizens. It is no 
surprise to me that Palm Bay, my hometown for many years, has been 
selected as a finalist for this honor.
  During the 1980s, Palm Bay's population more than tripled from just 
18,560 to 62,540. Then in the early '90s the General Development 
Corporation declared bankruptcy. Although this could have had a 
stagnating effect on city development, Palm Bay's grassroots rose to 
the occasion. Deteriorating infrastructure and poorly groomed public 
areas have been replaced by better roads, new parks and recreation 
areas, a community pool, the renewal of the U.S. 1 corridor and the 
continued efforts of ``Keep Brevard Beautiful'' and the Marine 
Resources Council.
  The All American City competition specifically seeks cities in which 
key civic projects are community and citizen driven. Palm Bay certainly 
has an abundance of community driven projects and organizations. These 
include the Volunteer Citizen Observer Program started in 1995 and the 
more than 100 Palm Bay Citizens who dedicate their time who assist the 
Palm Bay police force as volunteers.
  Next week nearly 100 residents of Florida's 15th district will travel 
here to Washington, DC to compete for the 54th Annual ``All American 
City'' Award. City employees, elected officials, activists, pastors, 
school children and other Palm Bay citizens will have an opportunity to 
share just a small piece of Palm Bay with the National Civic League. I 
commend the city and its citizens for all of the hard work that has 
made Palm Bay the wonderful place that it is today. I wish these 
delegates the best as they represent all of the great Floridians living 
in Palm Bay.
