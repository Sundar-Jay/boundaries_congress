                    CELEBRATING NATIONAL TRAILS DAY

  (Mr. BEREUTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Speaker, this Saturday, June 7, marks the 11th 
National Trails Day. This important event, held the first Saturday of 
every June, is coordinated nationally by the American Hiking Society 
and locally by trail clubs, parks, agencies and businesses.
  National Trails Day provides an outstanding opportunity to enjoy 
trails and thank the countless volunteers who build, maintain and 
protect them.
  As cochairman of the House Trails Caucus, this Member encourages his 
colleagues to show their support for trails on June 7 and throughout 
the year.
  The theme for National Trails Day 2003 is ``Healthy Trails, Healthy 
People.'' It will emphasize the many health benefits associated with 
trail use.
  The existing network of trails throughout the U.S. would not be 
possible without the assistance provided by grassroots trails groups 
and individuals who are determined to make a positive difference in 
their communities. The tireless efforts on behalf of trails by 
countless volunteers across the nation help to ensure that future 
generations will be able to discover the wonders of our country's rich 
diversity and history.
  In closing, Mr. Speaker, trails play an important role in communities 
throughout the country and this Member urges his colleagues to join in 
the celebration of National Trails Day on Saturday, June 7th.
  This effort fits well with President Bush's ``Healthier U.S. 
Initiative'' to encourage physical activity. In addition to promoting 
healthier and more active lifestyles, trails provide outstanding, 
family-oriented recreational opportunities to all Americans. They also 
offer important economic development benefits to nearby communities.
