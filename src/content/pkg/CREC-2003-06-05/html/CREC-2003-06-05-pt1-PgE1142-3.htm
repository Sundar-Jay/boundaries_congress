                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate an 
exceptional couple, Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Rose, Sr. as they celebrate 
their 50th Wedding Anniversary on Friday, June 6, 2003.
  Mr. Anthony Rose and his wife, Mrs. Francis Rose, are the proud 
parents of nine children, one of which lives in my Congressional 
District.
  Their children are outstanding members of the communities in which 
they reside. Several are business owners and one son is a professional 
basketball player. They have nineteen grandchildren and one great-
grandchild who are truly the ``apples of their eyes''.
  The Roses have made invaluable contributions to our society and are 
commended for their achievements and commitments.
  Mr. Rose is a decorated Veteran. He served with distinction in the 
United States Army, which included fighting in the Korean War. Mrs. 
Rose was employed for 18 years with Eastman Kodak where she worked in a 
lab until her retirement.
  Today, the Roses are active members of Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church in 
Rochester, NY where they have worshipped for the last 52 years. They 
are also weekly volunteers at the local Soup Kitchen and the YMCA.
  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Mr. and Mrs. Anthony 
Rose on 50 years of a loving relationship. They are truly examples of 
what all married couples strive for--a life-long partnership.
  I wish them continued success and more happy years.
