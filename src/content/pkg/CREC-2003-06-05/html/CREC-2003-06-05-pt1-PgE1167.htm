         TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE PETER RODINO ON HIS BIRTHDAY

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. DONALD M. PAYNE

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to honor my 
predecessor and one of the most outstanding members ever to serve in 
this body, the Honorable Peter Rodino, as he celebrates his 94th 
birthday on June 7th.
  As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee from the 93rd through 
the 100th Congress, former Representative Rodino set a standard for 
excellence which earned him a national reputation. While he is best 
known for presiding over the Watergate hearings with fairness, decorum, 
and a respect for history, he also had many other legislative 
accomplishments during his 40 years of service in the U.S. House of 
Representatives. He managed the historic 1966 Civil Rights Bill on the 
floor of the House. He was the author of the 1982 Voting Rights Act 
Extension and a leader in the successful effort to make Dr. Martin 
Luther King's birthday a national holiday.
  Chairman Rodino has been honored with numerous international, 
national and local awards, including Pope John Paul II's Pro Ecclesia 
et Pontifice Award; the Democratic Council on Ethnic Americans' 
Democratic Ethnic Heritage Award for Leadership, and the Rutgers 
University Award. He has received honorary degrees from more than 15 
colleges and universities, including Seton Hall, Princeton, Rutgers and 
Fairleigh Dickinson. He joined the Seton Hall Law School faculty in 
1988.
  Along with many others, as a youngster growing up and as a college 
student, I was inspired by Peter Rodino to enter public service. Many 
of us followed his work in Congress with great pride and admiration for 
his integrity and willingness to stand up for what was right. I was 
proud that he served as Chairman of a reception held in my honor during 
my reelection campaign for county office in 1976 at my alma mater, 
Seton Hall University.
  It has been a privilege for me to serve in the Congressional seat 
once held by Representative Rodino. I am always aware that I have big 
shoes to fill in replacing such a legendary public servant.
  I know that my colleagues here in the U.S. House of Representatives 
join me in sending best wishes for continued health and happiness to 
Chairman Rodino on his birthday.
