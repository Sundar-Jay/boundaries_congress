                                SCHEDULE

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, 
this morning Senator Dole will give her maiden speech in the Senate.
  When the Senate resumes consideration of the Energy bill, Senator 
Boxer will offer the first of her two amendments. The votes in relation 
to those amendments, as well as the pending Schumer amendment, will be 
stacked to occur later in the day. There are a number of scheduling 
conflicts, and we will be looking for the most appropriate time this 
afternoon for those votes to occur.
  In addition to the ethanol amendments, a LIHEAP amendment is pending. 
Members may want to speak on that issue as well. Therefore, the vote on 
first- and second-degree LIHEAP amendments may be stacked to occur 
later today as well.
  It is hoped that Senators who have additional amendments will make 
themselves available to offer those amendments so that further progress 
can be made on this important legislation.
  I also add that it is possible we could reach an agreement for the 
filing deadline for all first-degree amendments.
  Having said that, votes will occur on amendments throughout the day 
on the Energy bill, with the goal of making substantial progress 
towards its completion.
