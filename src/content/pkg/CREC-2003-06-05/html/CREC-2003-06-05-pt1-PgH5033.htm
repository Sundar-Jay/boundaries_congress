                     SENIOR CITIZENS NEED OUR HELP

  (Mr. FILNER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. FILNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for two bills 
to provide financial relief to our Nation's senior citizens. Both men 
and women will receive assistance with this legislation, but because 
older women are often with less financial resources, they will 
particularly benefit.
  My first bill, H.R. 1922, the Fair Taxes for Seniors Act, allows the 
fact that the current capital gains tax exemption on the sale of a home 
is not working for seniors who live in areas with higher housing 
prices. The bill provides a one-time increase in the capital gains 
exemption for sales of homes for citizens who are 50 years and older.
  My second bill, the Social Security Survivors Fairness Act, provides 
Social Security widows benefits for women under the age of 60. Mr. 
Speaker, I have stories about various seniors in my District talking 
about the need for this exemption for the capital gains of the sale of 
their home and also for the lowering of the age for which they can 
become eligible for Social Security.
  I will include my full statement at this point.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support for two bills to provide 
financial relief to our Nation's senior citizens. Both men and women 
will receive assistance with this legislation, but because older women 
are often with less financial resources, they will particularly 
benefit.
  My first bill is H.R. 1922, the Fair Taxes for Seniors Act. The 
current capital gains tax exemption on the sale of a home is not 
working for seniors who live in areas with higher housing prices. My 
bill provides a one-time increase in the capital gains tax exemption on 
the sale of a home for citizens who are 50 or older.
  Eleanor, a 78-year-old citizen, lives in Glen Ellyn, Illinois and 
bought her home 45 years ago with her husband, who has passed away. The 
combined Federal and State taxes on her home after the current capital 
gains exemption are $68,000. She needs this money from the sale of her 
house in order to move into a nursing home. Eleanor wants to stay in 
the Chicago area because her friends are there, but the price of 
nursing care there is high. Should a 78-year-old woman have to move 
from the city she has lived all her life because, as a widow, she is 
considered single and has to pay higher taxes?
  Marilyn is a single, professional woman who lives in Mission Hills, 
California--near my congressional district. She chose to become 
involved in her community and has stayed in the same house throughout 
her lifetime. Marilyn is now 60 years old and wants to sell her home 
and move to a smaller condo in the same area. Her combined Federal and 
State taxes are $169,940 after the current exemption. Should singles 
who remain in one house for many years be taxed for their stability--
and essentially for being single?
  Sally, a divorced, single mother in Seattle, Washington is 57 years 
old. She chose to stay in one home for 37 years so her children could 
stay in the same school system and she could live near her work and her 
church. One of her adult children has developed severe health problems 
and has to pay medical bills not covered by insurance. Sally is selling 
her home to pay some of the doctor's bills. Her combined Federal and 
State taxes are $64,000. This tax money is money that Sally should be 
able to use to pay off medical bills as well as to get ready for her 
own retirement.
  My bill would provide a one-time increase of $500,000 for a single 
person and $1 million for a couple in the amount excludable from the 
sale of a principal residence for taxpayers who have reached the age of 
50. Let us help our citizens over age 50 who have lived in one home for 
many years. Let them keep the proceeds from the sale of their homes for 
retirement and health care costs. An added benefit is that family 
members and perhaps the government will be relieved of the burden of 
caring for these individuals as they grow older.
  My second bill is H.R. 1923, the Social Security Survivors Fairness 
Act, to provide Social Security widows' benefits for women under the 
age of 60. Maria is a 58-year-old widow who lives in San Ysidro, 
California in my congressional district. Throughout her lifetime, she 
worked in the home, raising her children and supporting her husband. 
Now her husband, who received Social Security benefits, has passed 
away. There currently is a provision for Maria to receive Social 
Security widows' benefits, but to qualify she must be 60 years old.
  Social Security is telling Maria that she must find a way to support 
herself for 2 years. It will be difficult for her to find a job at her 
age, when she has never worked outside of her home. Women in their late 
50s who are dependent on their husband's Social Security are left with 
no means of support if their spouse dies. My bill would amend the 
Social Security Act to reduce from 60 to 55 the age at which an 
individual who is otherwise eligible may be paid widows' or widowers' 
insurance benefits.
  I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1922 and H.R. 1923 to 
provide financial assistance to our country's most vulnerable citizens.
