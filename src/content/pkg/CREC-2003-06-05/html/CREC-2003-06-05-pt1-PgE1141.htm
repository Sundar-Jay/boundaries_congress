INTRODUCING DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA DISTRICT ATTORNEY ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 
                                  2003

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, today I introduce the District of Columbia 
District Attorney Establishment Act of 2003 continuing a series of 
bills that I will introduce this session to ensure a continuation of 
the process of transition to full democracy and self-government for the 
residents of the District of Columbia.
  This bill will establish an Office of District Attorney for the 
District of Columbia, to be headed by a District Attorney elected by 
D.C. residents. Accordingly, this bill would move the city a quantum 
leap toward full home rule for the District of Columbia and equality 
with other Americans. This bill effectuates a November 2002 referendum 
where D.C. voters overwhelmingly (82%) approved a locally elected D.A.
  This important legislation is designed to put the District of 
Columbia on par with every other local jurisdiction in the country by 
allowing D.C. residents to elect an independent District Attorney to 
prosecute local criminal and civil matters now handled by the U.S. 
Attorney, a federal official. Instead the new District Attorney would 
become the city's chief legal officer.
  There is no issue of greater importance to our citizens and no issue 
on which residents have less say here than the prosecution of local 
crimes. A U.S. Attorney has no business in the local criminal affairs 
of local jurisdictions. No other citizens in the United States are 
treated so unfairly on an issue of such major importance. This bill 
would simply make the D.A. accountable to the people who elect him or 
her as elsewhere in the country.
  In addition to issues of democracy and self government, such as 
congressional voting rights and legislative and budget autonomy that we 
are entitled to as American citizens, district residents are determined 
to make every effort to achieve each and every other element of home 
rule. Amending the Home Rule Act with a local D.A. provision would be a 
dramatic development toward our goal of achieving true self-government. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.

                          ____________________
