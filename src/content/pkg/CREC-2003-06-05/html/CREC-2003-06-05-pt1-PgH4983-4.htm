                      BIRTHDAY WISHES TO BOB HOPE

  (Mr. DREIER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. DREIER. Mr. Speaker, at a very early point in my life, I was 
taught that you can celebrate your birthday the week before and the 
week after the actual date.
  A week ago today, we all know that Bob Hope celebrated his 100th 
birthday. We are actually in the midst of the celebration of the 50th 
birthday of our colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).
  When I think about Bob Hope, he is someone who I have been privileged 
to know for many years and have had the opportunity to spend time with 
him and his wonderful wife Delores and their family. But I will tell 
you, even when you are in small company with Bob Hope, you cannot help 
but be in awe of an individual who is virtually unparalleled in his 
commitment to the United States of America.
  A year ago we were able to honor him by naming the Chapel at the 
Veterans Cemetery in West Los Angeles, with the help of his friends, 
Mary Jane and Charles Wick. There are countless people all over this 
world who have to continue to be indebted to Bob Hope for the great 
sacrifice that he has made and the happiness that he has brought to so 
many millions of individuals.
  Happy birthday, Mr. Hope.
