                               of hawaii

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. CASE. Mr. Speaker, I am most pleased to introduce the Native 
American Languages Act Amendments of 2003, with Representatives Neil 
Abercrombie and Don Young as original cosponsors.
  This vital legislation will authorize the Secretary of Education to 
provide grants to or enter into contracts with Native American language 
educational organizations, Native American language colleges, Indian 
tribal governments, organizations that demonstrate the potential to 
become Native American language educational organizations, or consortia 
of such

entities, to establish Native American language ``nests'' for students 
under the age of 7 and their families. It will also authorize grants 
for these entities to operate, expand, and increase the number of 
Native American language survival schools throughout the country for 
Native American children and Native American language-speaking 
children. Finally, the bill will authorize the establishment of three 
demonstration projects that will provide assistance to Native American 
language survival schools and Native American language nests.
  Today's measure is a companion to S. 575, which was introduced by the 
senior member of Hawaii's delegation, Senator Daniel Inouye, and is 
cosponsored by Senators Daniel Akaka, Ben Nighthorse Campbell, and Tom 
Daschle. A hearing was held by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on 
May 15, 2003, at which there was broad-based support from native 
language speakers, educators, and supporters from across the country, 
including Hawaii, Alaska, California, New Mexico, Montana, Oklahoma, 
Minnesota, and Virginia.
  This proposal forwards current federal self-determination policies 
toward native peoples, which support the promotion of economic and 
social self-sufficiency, as well as the preservation and revitalization 
of native culture, languages, art, history, religion, and values. Since 
language is a significant factor in the perpetuation of native 
cultures, the federal government enacted the Native American Languages 
Act of 1990 urging federal support for Native American languages, and 
the Native American Languages Act Amendments of 1992 establishing a 
grant program at the Administration for Native Americans to fund the 
preservation of Native American languages. My bill continues this 
commitment by our federal government to ensure the survival of these 
unique cultures and languages.
  In my home state, I am proud that the people of Hawaii and the State 
of Hawaii have strongly supported the revitalization of Hawaiian 
culture, art, and language. In 1978, for example, the State of Hawaii 
wrote into its constitution a specific declaration that Hawaiian is one 
of our two official languages, along with English.
  There is also support for Hawaiian language programs in both our 
public and private schools. At the forefront of these efforts have been 
supporters of Aha Punana Leo, a Hawaiian language immersion program 
which has endeavored to include both students and parents in an 
exciting and innovative way to revitalize Hawaiian language and 
culture. Ms. Namaka Rawlins, Director of Aha Punana Leo, and her 
husband, Dr. William (Pila) Wilson, have been pivotal in these efforts. 
The lessons of family and community involvement in the preservation of 
the Hawaiian language that they and other have proven are and can be 
used by other native communities and cultures across the country.
  While the Aha Punana Leo program initially started with pre-school 
students, Hawaiian language survival schools were also established to 
allow for students to graduate from high school. Over 2,000 students 
are currently enrolled in Hawaiian language nests and survival schools. 
A Hawaiian language center--Hale Kuamoo--was eventually established at 
the University of Hawaii at Hilo with the collaboration of Aha Punana 
Leo as well as a Native College--Ka Haka Ula O Keelikolani College. 
Both programs have been crucial in providing training to teachers in 
Hawaiian language, college courses in Hawaiian, and graduate education 
in Hawaiian language and culture.
  The revitalization of the Hawaiian language in my state has been 
instrumental in the preservation of Hawaiian culture, which is 
important to all of us who call Hawaii home. Today's legislation will 
take this lesson nationwide in continuing the commitment made by the 
federal government in 1990 and the progress that has been made since 
that time to preserve Native American languages, including the Hawaiian 
language.
