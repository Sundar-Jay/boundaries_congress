                        HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure and honor that 
I congratulate Assistant Superintendent Dr. Gary E. Jones of the School 
City of Hammond on his retirement. Dr. Jones has made many 
distinguished contributions to the City of Hammond and all of Northwest 
Indiana during his 41 years of dedicated service.
  Dr. Jones earned his bachelor's degree in education at Youngstown 
State University, and then went on to earn his master's degree and 
Doctorate in education from Indiana University, Bloomington. He began 
his career in education in 1962 as the Administrative Assistant to the 
Superintendent of Schools in the Geneva Area School System in Ohio. He 
has been involved as a principal in the Hammond School System from 1976 
through 1986. He was the first person to ever be awarded the 
Outstanding Principal award for his notable achievements. He has served 
as the Assistant Superintendent for Hammond Schools since 1986. His 
history of service to the education of our youth is apparent in all 
facets of his prestigious career.
  Of the many outstanding accomplishments made by Dr. Jones, one of his 
proudest contributions has been the amazing vision of a robotics 
program that brought about the design of Team Hammond. Team Hammond has 
competed competitively at the US FIRST National Competition for the 
past several years. US FIRST is an organization dedicated to motivating 
America's youth about science, technology, and engineering through 
hands-on methods. The program involves a unique blend of problem 
solving and competition that prepares students for real world 
situations. Through his sincere and honorable service to the students 
of Hammond, Dr. Jones has been a guiding light to the Northwest Indiana 
community.
  Dr. Jones has not only served his community through his educational 
accomplishments, but he has also positively contributed in other ways 
by being a dedicated member of various community service organizations 
such as the Woodmar Kiwanis Club, the Hammond Board of Health, the 
Public Improvements Task Force, and Lake Area United Way to name just a 
few. He is also a ten-year member of the PTA Executive Committee and 
has received the PTA National Life Membership Award, which was 
presented to him by the Hammond Council of PTA's. He has received many 
awards that exemplify his dedication and leadership to the Hammond 
community. He is a member of the Indiana Congress of Parents and 
Teachers, as well as a recipient of the Outstanding Volunteer Service 
Award.
  Mr. Speaker, Dr. Jones has contributed graciously to not only the 
youth of Hammond, but also to the entire Northwest Indiana community. 
His dedication and devotion to the youth of our nation is a goal we 
should all strive to achieve. I respectively ask that you and my other 
distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Dr. Jones on his 
retirement. His valiant effort to educate the youth of Northwest 
Indiana is most commendable, and will be truly remembered.
