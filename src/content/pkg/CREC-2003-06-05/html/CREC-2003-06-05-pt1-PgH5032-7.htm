                      MAJORITY DID NOT DO ITS JOB

  (Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. JACKSON-LEE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would argue that after 
today's work it is imperative that we put on the floor of the House a 
relief to many of the children of America, millions in fact.
  We did not do our job. This House, the majority, did not do its job. 
The Senate, the majority, did not do its job by eliminating a tax 
credit benefit from 6.5 million families, 12 million children. We need 
to restore the $400 tax credit that will be given to those families.
  Right now we have a study that says military kids are slighted on tax 
credits. That means the young men and women, the young families in the 
United States military, their income does not allow them to get a tax 
credit for the children that they have. Blessed are the poor, they do 
not get tax cuts.
  They do pay taxes. They pay sales tax, payroll taxes. They pay 
property taxes. It is imperative to pass H.R. 2286, and Mr. Speaker, as 
an original cosponsor I would ask that the Rangel-DeLauro bill be put 
on the floor of the House next week to match the Senate bill so we can 
restore the $400 to these families 6.5 million, 12 million children, 
what a shame.
  We do not need to wait for months for tax bills to come. We need to 
fix our error now and help the working families of America.
