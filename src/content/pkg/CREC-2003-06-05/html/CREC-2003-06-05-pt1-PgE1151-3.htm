                 HONORING CREATIVE ARTS THERAPIES WEEK

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. STEVEN R. ROTHMAN

                             of new jersey

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. ROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate Creative Arts 
Therapies Week, which began on June 1 and continues through June 7.
  Creative Arts Therapies are an increasingly important tool for 
healing both physical and mental health needs. There are currently more 
than 15,000 Creative Arts Therapists practicing in the United States 
and around the world--all working to address major societal issues 
including school violence, substance abuse, breast cancer, Alzheimer's 
disease, and domestic violence.
  Since its first application over 50 years ago, Creative Arts 
Therapists have provided individual and group art experiences for 
people in need of care and treatment to address and overcome great 
personal challenges. Using art, dance, movement, drama, music, and 
poetry, therapists are able to achieve remarkable results.
  I commend Creative Arts therapists and the National Coalition of 
Creative Arts Therapies for their tireless work to improve health, 
communication, and expression, to enhance self-awareness, and to 
facilitate positive change in human experience and behavior.
