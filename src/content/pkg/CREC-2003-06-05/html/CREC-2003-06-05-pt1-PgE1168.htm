  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend congratulations to 
Dr. Victor J. Connors from Middleton, WI. On June 21, 2003, in San 
Diego, CA, optometrists from around the Nation will elect my 
constituent, Dr. Connors, as the 82nd president of the American 
Optometric Association. Dr. Connors' enthusiasm and contributions to 
his profession have earned him this prominent recognition.
  Dr. Connors has an impressive record in his profession at the local, 
State and national level demonstrating his leadership in the field of 
optometry. He served as president of the Wisconsin Optometric 
Association in 1987 and was recognized as our State's Optometrist of 
the Year in 1990. Dr. Connors has also served as the president of the 
North Central States Optometric Council and was elected to the American 
Optometric Association's board of trustees in 1997.
  In addition to his extraordinary leadership in his profession, Dr. 
Connors has been an energetic leader in many civic organizations. He 
has served as president of the Middleton Optimist Club, chairman of the 
Middleton Park, Recreation and Forestry Commission, chairman of the 
Middleton Police Commission, president of the Middleton Area 
Development Corporation, president of the Middleton Chamber of 
Commerce, president of the Middleton Good Neighbor Festival and 
president of the church council at St. Andrew Lutheran Church in 
Middleton.
  Dr. Victor J. Connors' vast achievements and commitment to public 
service have led him to develop a distinguished record of leadership in 
his profession and his community. It is evident that his dedication and 
motivation will allow him to have a successful term as president of the 
American Optometric Association. I join his many friends, colleagues 
and his wife, Becky, and children, Sara, Colleen and Colin in 
congratulating him and wishing well as the new president of the 
American Optometric Association.
