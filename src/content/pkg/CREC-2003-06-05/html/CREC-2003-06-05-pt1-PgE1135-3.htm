                TRIBUTE TO MR. TED RAVELO OF NORTH MIAMI

                                 ______
                                 

                         HON. KENDRICK B. MEEK

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. MEEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a wonderful human 
being and a magnificent activist symbolized by North Miami community 
leader Ted Ravelo, a Filipino-American. On Saturday, June 7, 2003, at 
the Design Center of the Americas (DCOTA) in Broward County, he will be 
honored by the Philippine American Federation of South Florida, Inc. at 
a gala event celebrating the 105th Philippine Independence Day 
festivities.
  Mr. Ravelo came to the North Miami community some 15 years ago. He 
was the Director of the Southern Apparel Exhibitors at the Miami 
Merchandise Mart, after which he directed the Southeastern Apparel 
Exhibitors in Atlanta, Georgia. The citation for this gala event 
defines ``. . . his loyal service to the community of North Miami and 
the Filipino-American community he has helped with utmost care and 
concern.'' Above all, however, this pioneering leader is more saliently 
characterized by his deep faith in the God he serves through countless 
Filipino immigrants in search of a warm friendship and timely advice. 
Being a dutiful husband to his wife, Ma. Teresa Padua-Ravelo, and a 
loving father to his two teenaged children, Jamie and Jo Anne, he has 
taken upon himself the awesome responsibility of providing the same 
brand of love and affection to many more Filipino-American families who 
search for guidance and direction in the ways and processes of how 
government and its various agencies function.
  Indeed, Mr. Ravelo represents the best and the noblest of our 
community in his unceasing involvement with the socio-cultural well-
being of his fellow immigrants in a manner that uplifted their own 
self-esteem and dignity. He continues to demonstrate a remarkable 
wisdom and warm friendship in serving his North Miami community, and 
still manages to enlighten his fellow citizens on the agenda of 
conscientious public service and good governance impacting our duties 
and responsibilities toward the less fortunate.
  I am indeed a beneficiary of the brand of genuine advocacy he 
demonstrates both by way of word and example. I have learned from him 
the many struggles that immigrants throughout my district have had to 
confront on a daily basis, conscious of the fact that the will to 
succeed and be aware of the many nuances of public service undergird 
the civic responsibilities of a community leader and must characterize 
his advocacy role toward those who could least fend for themselves.
  Continuing his mission to represent his fellow citizens and 
immigrants, Mr. Ted Ravelo was named to the North Miami Community 
Relations Board from 1997 thru 1998 and served as President of the 
Filipino Community Association of South Florida, Inc. Indeed, his quest 
for making a little bit of difference in the lives of people has always 
been his genuine way of changing the kind of world to which he was 
given to serve.
  Named as the Activist of the Year by the North Miami Mayor's Economic 
Task Force in 1997, he has held the presidency of the Central North 
Miami Homeowners Association and vice-presidency of the North Miami 
Mayor's Economic Task Force, and has likewise held memberships on the 
Miami-Dade County Asian-American Advisory Board, Greater North Miami 
Chamber of Commerce and Asian-American Federation of Florida.
  His involvement with the above organizations motivated his desire to 
run for the Mayor's seat of North Miami during the 1999 mayoral 
elections. Though he eventually lost his race, he ran a strong and 
credible campaign by focusing on the crucial issues impacting the well-
being and equality of opportunity for his fellow citizens. His 
candidacy for public office has truly maximized his role as the 
consummate community activist who lives by the dictum that those who 
have less in life, through no fault of their own, should have more from 
those fortunate enough to have received the greater blessings from God. 
The collective testimonies he has received from the parents, community 
leaders and residents of North Miami and beyond represent an 
unequivocal testimony of the utmost respect and gratitude he now 
enjoys.
  With the gala tribute to him on the historic celebration of the 105th 
Philippine Independence Day, the Filipino-American community in

my District will honor him for his undaunted leadership and utmost 
perseverance. I am truly privileged to represent Mr. Ravelo and his 
family in the Congress, and I am grateful that he continues to teach us 
to live by the noble ethic of loving God by serving our fellowmen. 
Above all, his caring and compassion for other immigrants in Florida's 
17th Congressional District appeal to the noblest character of our 
common humanity. My pride in sharing his friendship is only exceeded by 
my deep gratitude for all that he has done to uplift the honor and 
dignity of Filipino-Americans and other immigrants in North Miami and 
beyond.
  This is the remarkable legacy with which we will always honor and 
respect the wonderful leadership and magnificent advocacy of Mr. Ted 
Ravelo.
