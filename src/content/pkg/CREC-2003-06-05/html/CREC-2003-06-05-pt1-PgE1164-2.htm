                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Murtha and I rise today to 
pay tribute to General Eric Shinseki, an outstanding soldier and 
American who is retiring as the 34th Chief of Staff of the Army after 
more than 38 years of distinguished service to his country. He is an 
exceptional leader with a clear sense of purpose, conviction, and 
conscience of service to his nation.
  General Shinseki has served as Chief of Staff in one of the most 
dynamic and challenging periods in the storied 228-year history of the 
United States Army. Under his leadership, the Army began a 
``transformation'' from a force focused on a defined threat that won 
the Cold War to a more flexible force that is capable of meeting the 
new and varied threats of the 21st century. At the same time General 
Shinseki was managing this historic level of change, he ensured the 
Army maintained the highest levels of combat readiness that were 
demonstrated so successfully during operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.
  General Shinseki received his commission from the United States 
Military Academy in 1965. He served two combat tours in the Republic of 
Vietnam with the 9th and 25th Infantry Divisions, first as an artillery 
forward observer and later as Commander of Troop A, 3rd Squadron, 5th 
Cavalry. During both he was seriously wounded.
  Since Vietnam, General Shinseki has served in a variety of command 
and staff assignments in the Continental United States and overseas. He 
served in Hawaii at Schofield Barracks with Headquarters, United States 
Army Hawaii, and at Ft. Shafter with Headquarters, United States Army 
Pacific. He also taught at the United States Military Academy's 
Department of English. During duty with the 3rd Armored Cavalry 
Regiment at Ft. Bliss, Texas, he served as Regimental Adjutant and 
Executive Officer with the 1st Squadron.
  Ric spent over ten years in Europe, which included assignments as 
Commander, 3rd Squadron, 7th Cavalry; Commander, 2nd Brigade; Assistant 
Chief of Staff G3; and Assistant Division Commander, all with the 3rd 
Infantry Division (Mechanized).
  From 1994 to July 1995, he commanded the 1st Cavalry Division at Ft. 
Hood, Texas and in July 1996, he was promoted to Lieutenant General and 
became the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the 
Department of the Army.
  He was selected for the rank of General in June 1997 and assumed 
duties as Commanding General, United States Army Europe and Commander, 
NATO Stabilization Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In November 1998 he 
assumed duties as Vice Chief of Staff of the Army.
  In addition to receiving a Bachelor of Science Degree from the United 
States Military Academy, he also holds a Master of Arts Degree in 
English Literature from Duke University. General Shinseki's military 
education includes the Armor Officer Advanced Course, the United States 
Army Command and General Staff College, and the National War College.
  His awards include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the 
Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit (with Oak Leaf 
Clusters), the Bronze Star Medal with ``V'' device (with 2 Oak Leaf 
Clusters), as well the Purple Heart (with Oak Leaf Cluster). He has 
also been awarded the Parachutist Badge, the Ranger Tab, the Office of 
the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge, Joint Chief of Staff 
Identification Badge, and Army Staff Identification Badge.
  History will look very favorably on the accomplishments of General 
Shinseki. It is easy to talk about concepts such as ``transformation'', 
but it takes a visionary leader to implement them. There are countless 
decisions that he has had to make that might very

well mean the difference between success and failure on current and 
future battlefields. General Shinseki successfully met every challenge 
during his tenure as Chief of Staff with professionalism, commitment, 
and perseverance.
  To Ric and his wife Patti, God speed and enjoy a well-deserved 
retirement.
  The United States Army will miss you and so will we.
