               ENSURING AMERICA'S SECURITY FROM TERRORISM

  (Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BARTLETT of Maryland. Mr. Speaker, we have heard it said it so 
many times that it risks becoming a cliche: Our Nation is engaged in a 
war against terrorism. If I may be permitted one more cliche: Money is 
the lifeblood of any terrorist organization.
  The ability of the September 11th terrorists to move money through 
American banks without sending up any cautionary red flags was critical 
to their success and our national tragedy. People attempting to open 
accounts in this country without Social Security numbers ought to be 
seen as a giant, flashing red neon flag. That is why we must refuse to 
allow banks to accept as legitimate identification any foreign 
government-issued identification document in lieu of a Social Security 
number.

[[Page H4984]]

  The Department of Treasury and the banks see things differently. The 
Treasury Department has issued a final rule to allow banks to accept 
the Mexican matricula I.D. card. But at the request of the banks, 
Treasury went even further. Their rule does not even require banks to 
maintain copies of the matricula cards.
  Ignorance in this case might be good business practice, but it is 
dangerous and foolhardy security policy. Our responsibility as Members 
of Congress is to make sure that terrorists cannot use American banks 
to finance attacks on our people.
