                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 100th 
anniversary of the Village of Lyndonville, New York. This congressional 
recognition will be presented later this month when village officials 
and citizens gather together to celebrate this historic event.
  The Village of Lyndonville is a small town that has evolved with the 
times, but whose residents have never lost touch with their roots. Its 
history resembles that of many of the small towns on which our nation 
was built. In the 1820s, the area began to grow after the construction 
of a corduroy road, which was built of logs laid side by side 
transversely. This road is now Route 63--Lyndonville's Main Street. The 
locale began to prosper after several merchants built businesses on 
Main Street in 1836. Settlers also found the area attractive due to the 
possibilities offered by Johnson's Creek, which runs through the 
village. Named for the British Indian agent, Sir William Johnson, 
Johnson's Creek was harnessed by early settlers as a power source. 
Early settlers built the first flouring mills using the creek, 
including S. W. Mudgett, Samuel Tappan, and Richard Barry, among 
others.
  The village was originally called Lyndon--in honor of Lyndon, 
Vermont, the home of many of its original settlers. Lyndon's name was 
eventually changed to Lyndonville in order to distinguish the village 
from nearby Linden, New York. One hundred years ago, the Village of 
Lyndonville was officially incorporated in Orleans County, on the shore 
of Lake Ontario.
  The village sits on one square mile of beautiful, fertile Western New 
York land. The surrounding area is home to many of New York's famous 
apple orchards, as well as the lush, rolling vistas created by the 
retreating glaciers ages ago. Nestled against Lake Ontario, Lyndonville 
is blessed with the rich soil and pastoral serenity that Americans 
consider the ideal of our countryside, evocative of Mayberry and 
Grover's Corners.
  With a population of 950, Lyndonville is a close-knit community where 
everyone is a neighbor. Most people know each other, and even if you 
are not well acquainted, faces smile with recognition and greetings are 
exchanged with warmth. Friendly inquiries are made when there has been 
an experience with pain--or joy. Anytime a neighbor is suffering from 
ill health or some loss, the community is there to help, to lighten the 
burden, and to express its loving concern. Beyond the village's long 
and distinguished history, Lyndonville is simply a place residents are 
proud to raise a family.
  Mr. Speaker, on the occasion of the Village of Lyndonville's 100th 
birthday, I unite with its residents to celebrate their accomplishments 
and contributions to Orleans County, our state, and our nation.
