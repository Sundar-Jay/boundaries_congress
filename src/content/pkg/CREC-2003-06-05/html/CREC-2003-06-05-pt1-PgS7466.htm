                      FBI BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM

  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation released a report on the efficiency and effectiveness of 
the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, also known as 
NICS. According to the report, the FBI has improved its ability to 
respond quickly to gun dealer requests for criminal background checks, 
with only nine percent of the transactions delayed. These improvements 
have increased the immediate response rate from an average of 71 
percent in early 2001 to 91 percent in 2002.
  According to the report, in 2001 the NICS system processed 8.9 
million background checks, with approximately 125,000 denials of 
permission to purchase a gun. While, in 2002, the system performed over 
8.4 million checks and denied approximately 121,000 of these purchases. 
I commend the FBI for its hard work and commitment to improving this 
important law enforcement tool.
  Despite the success of the NICS System and the FBI's hard work, many 
guns are still being purchased without any background checks being 
performed. Under current Federal law, criminal background checks on gun 
purchasers are only required for sales by licensed firearm dealers. 
Consequently, criminals, fugitives, and terrorists are able to purchase 
firearms without any background check. They do this by purchasing guns 
at gun shows. I believe we should require a background check on every 
gun sale and close the loopholes in Federal law that criminals 
manipulate to buy and sell guns.
  During the last Congress, I cosponsored the Gun Show Background Check 
Act introduced by Senator Jack Reed. I believe this legislation would 
be a vital tool in preventing guns from getting into the hands of 
criminals and other ineligible buyers. This bill would simply apply 
existing law governing background checks to individuals buying firearms 
at gun shows. This bill is commonsense gun safety legislation that is 
supported by a number of major law enforcement organizations including 
the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the National 
Troopers Coalition, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, 
the Police Executive Research Forum, the Major Cities Chiefs, the 
National Association of School Resource Officers, the National Black 
Police Association, the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement 
Executives, and the Hispanic American Police Command Officers 
Association.
  I believe closing the gun show loophole is an important tool in 
reducing gun violence and preventing guns from getting into the hands 
of criminals and foreign terrorists. Since its inception, the National 
Instant Criminal Background Check System has prevented over 563,000 
ineligible buyers from gaining access to guns, but many continue to 
slip through the gun show loophole. I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting this important piece of gun safety legislation.
