                       TRIBUTE TO SUZANNE NEWLIN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SCOTT McINNIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to stand and pay 
tribute to an outstanding educator from my district. Suzanne Newlin, a 
teacher at Montrose High School in Montrose, Colorado, is the recipient 
of this year's high school teacher of the year award from the National 
Association for Sport and Physical Education. Suzanne is an innovative 
teacher with an uncanny ability to motivate her students, and I am 
honored to recognize her commitment and dedication to education today.
  Suzanne has made it her life's work to get her students hooked on 
physical activities that they can enjoy throughout their lives. Most 
kids won't take part in team sports as adults, so she introduces them 
to other activities such as bicycling, rock climbing and power walking. 
Suzanne not only participates with her students, but she teaches them 
how to get the most out of their workouts and individualize the 
sessions by including heart-rate monitors. Suzanne does teach 
traditional team sports as well, though she does so by personally 
demonstrating skills and techniques to make the experience more 
meaningful.
  Mr. Speaker, Suzanne's positive spirit, creativity and innovation 
make her a true asset to the students of Montrose High School, and it 
is my pleasure to recognize her efforts here today. She not only 
touches the lives of her students, but she gives them the tools to 
succeed later in life. That is a precious gift, and it is a great honor 
to speak of her inspirational accomplishments before this body.
