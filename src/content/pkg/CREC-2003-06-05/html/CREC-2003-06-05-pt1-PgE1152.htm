                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SCOTT McINNIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with tremendous pride that I stand 
before this body of Congress to recognize one of Colorado's outstanding 
citizens. Lynn Dyer resides in Cortez and has been working there as the 
director of tourism for Mesa Verde Country. Lynn has recently been 
chosen as Citizen of the Year by the City of Cortez and is currently 
the President of the Southwest Colorado Travel Region.
  Lynn recently planned the Mesa Verde Country Indian Arts and Western 
Culture Festival, which was recognized as one of the top 100 events in 
North America in 2003 by the American Bus Association. The organization 
and planning of this festival also earned Lynn the Governor's Award for 
Outstanding Community Tourism Initiative. This award, presented by 
Colorado's Governor Bill Owens, is given to a community that helps to 
promote tourism in Colorado.
  As most of you know, the Mesa Verde area has been challenged by a 
number of severe wildfires in recent years, making many think tourism 
would sharply decrease. The efforts of Lynn and her team have helped to 
keep tourism steady, so people across the nation can see the wonders of 
the Mesa Verde area.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand and express my gratitude for the 
hard work of Lynn Dyer. Lynn is the kind of individual who makes my 
district proud. I wish Lynn the best as she continues her work 
promoting tourism in Colorado and it is my hope that Americans will 
continue to discover the beauty of this region.
