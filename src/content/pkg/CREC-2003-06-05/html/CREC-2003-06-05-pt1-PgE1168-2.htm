  IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 2286, THE WORKING FAMILIES TAX CREDIT ACT OF 2003

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. CHRIS BELL

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. BELL. Mr. Speaker, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
tout ``No Child Left Behind'' when in actuality they deliberately 
choose to leave millions of children behind. Last week, President Bush 
signed a new law that would provide tax cuts of $93,500 to the 200,000 
taxpayers making over $1 million. Fifty three percent of all taxpayers 
would get less than $100 under the GOP law. Here is another example of 
the Administration choosing the wealthiest over America's working 
families.
  What is even more egregious is that the Administration chose not to 
provide or increase the child tax credit to working families making 
between $10,500 to $26,625 per year. Mr. Speaker, Republicans in the 
Senate dropped a provision, added by Senator Lincoln, that would have 
helped nearly 12 million children and their families get a tax credit. 
Out of that 12 million, a staggering 8 million receive no child tax 
credit under the GOP law.
  Mr. Speaker, their plan in no way, shape or form protects the 
children that need it the most. Instead, their plan deliberately 
excludes these children. In actuality, the Republican plan should be 
called the ``Plan to Leave Children Behind.''
  This is why I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2286, the Rangel-
Davis-DeLauro bill. I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this bill. This is 
a great start to repairing the damage inflicted by the Administration's 
reckless and negligent tax package. H.R. 2286 would restore the child 
tax credit to families making minimum wage by providing greater tax 
relief to working families. Nineteen million children and their 
families will benefit from this bill. In fact, over 2 million children 
in my home state of Texas would benefit under Rangel plan.
  In addition to the child tax credit, H.R. 2286 would create more 
jobs. The provisions in this bill are key elements of the House Jobs 
and Economic Growth package and will create more than 1 million jobs 
without adding one penny to the deficit. Lastly, this bill has key 
elements that would ensure our brave men and women in uniform are not 
denied tax relief just because they are on active duty.
  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2286--this tax plan 
is fair--it helps: America's economy, America's men and women in 
uniform and America's working families. Most importantly, this child 
tax credit helps America's children by leaving no child behind.
