      PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF BREAST CANCER

  (Mr. BURNS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BURNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the victims 
and the survivors of breast cancer. This Saturday, June 7, the Susan G. 
Komen Breast Cancer Foundation will sponsor the 14th annual Race for 
the Cure. Along with Members of my staff, I am entering this race in 
pursuit of a cure of this rampant disease.
  Breast cancer is a disease that has affected the lives of many 
Georgians and many throughout our Nation. In fact, my wonderful wife of 
30 years, Laura, is a breast cancer survivor. I know firsthand the 
strength and the dignity that she showed throughout this challenge.
  I also know all too well the challenges that families face when 
confronting the harsh realities of breast cancer. But with early 
detection and aggressive treatment, we know that breast cancer does not 
mean a life sentence for women.
  I am encouraged by the progress that cancer research has made and the 
struggle to defeat breast cancer. I realize we have a long way to go. 
But, Mr. Speaker, my wife and thousands of survivors like her are 
living proof that breast cancer is not an in insurmountable challenge.
