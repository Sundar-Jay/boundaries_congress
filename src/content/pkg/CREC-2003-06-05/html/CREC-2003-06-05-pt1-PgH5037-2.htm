                   IN RECOGNITION OF ELAINE PATTERSON

  (Mr. SHAW asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. SHAW. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to acknowledge the contributions 
to the academic excellence of St. Anthony's Catholic School in Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida, through the efforts of its principal, Elaine 
Patterson, who is retiring. St. Anthony's School is the oldest Catholic 
school in Broward County, Florida, and Elaine has guided thousands of 
students throughout her 22-year tenure.
  Elaine has served as St. Anthony's principal from 1986 to 2003. In 
that time, she introduced the school's pre-kindergarten program, 
forwarded technology by way of computers, and promoted innovative 
programs which helped in the total development of the children in her 
care.
  Mr. Speaker, through the years, Elaine has earned the respect of 
fellow principals in the Archdiocese of Miami, as well as many of the 
teachers who have worked with her.
  As a grandfather whose grandchildren have benefited from Elaine's 
professionalism, I can say that her retirement will be a loss to the 
school and the families she has guided during her career.
  Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Elaine Patterson on a distinguished 
career educating South Florida's youth; and on behalf of the entire 
Shaw family, I wish to thank Elaine for her great service.
  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the contributions made to 
the academic excellence of St. Anthony's Catholic School in Fort 
Lauderdale, Florida through the efforts of its principal, Elaine 
Patterson, who is retiring. St. Anthony's School is the oldest Catholic 
school in Broward County, Florida, and Elaine has guided thousands of 
students throughout her 22-year tenure.
  Elaine received a Bachelor of Science Degree at Southern Connecticut 
State University and a Master's Degree in Guidance at Florida Atlantic 
University. Her experience includes elementary classroom teaching, 
guidance counseling, and serving as a vice-principal before becoming a 
principal.
  Elaine has served as St. Anthony's principal from 1986 to 2003. In 
that time, she introduced the school's pre-kindergarten program, 
forwarded technology by way of computers, and promoted innovative 
programs which helped in the total development of the children in her 
care. She worked very closely with St. Anthony's Pastor, Father Timothy 
Hannon, in achieving these goals and was very active in fund raising 
activities which made attaining them possible.
  In addition to her administrative activities, Elaine has served with 
distinction on numerous committees for the Archdiocese of Miami and has 
headed two very successful Self Study Committees. She served as a 
member of the St. Anthony's Advisory Board, the Parish Council, St. 
Anthony's Foundation for Education, the Home and School Association and 
the Victoria Park Civic Association of Homeowners.
  Mr. Speaker, through the years Elaine has earned the respect of 
fellow principals in the Archdiocese of Miami, as well as, the many 
teachers who have worked with her. Elaine's leadership and example have 
made her a mentor to many. She believes in an open-door policy for 
everyone and will be remembered as a kind and compassionate 
administrator. As a grandfather whose grandchildren have benefited from 
Elaine's professionalism, I can say that her retirement will be a loss 
to the school and the families she has guided during her career.
  Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Elaine Patterson on a distinguished 
career educating South Florida's youth, and on behalf of the Shaw 
family, I thank Elaine for her service. God bless Elaine Patterson and 
the entire St. Anthony's family.
