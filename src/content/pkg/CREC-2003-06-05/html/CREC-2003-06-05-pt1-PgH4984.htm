                HELPING CHILDREN WHO NEED HELP THE MOST

  (Mr. COOPER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. COOPER. Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago this House made a terrible 
mistake in the tax cut bill, partly because that bill was rammed 
through this House under the so-called marshal law rule, with minimal 
notice or debate. Some 12 million American children who need the help 
the most were left out of that bill; 444,000 Tennessee children were 
left out of that bill.
  It is not too late to correct the mistake, and I hope that this House 
will take prompt action to help those 12 million children, including 
the 444,000 Tennessee children who need the help the most. The clock is 
ticking, Mr. Speaker. The world is watching. Let us help these kids.
