                          PERSONAL EXPLANATION

  Mr. BURTON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, due to an unavoidable conflict in 
my schedule, I was unable to be present during rollcall votes 236-247. 
Had I voted, I would have voted ``yea'' in rollcall votes 236-239, 
``no'' on rollcall votes 240-241, and ``yea'' on rollcall votes 242-
247.
