                   MEMORIAL DAY BRAT FEST OF MADISON

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. TAMMY BALDWIN


                              of wisconsin

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the annual 
Memorial Day Brat Fest of Madison.
  This event, run by locally owned Metcalfe's Sentry Foods, started in 
1983 as a modest customer appreciation luncheon and grew into the huge 
city wide charity event that it is today. Over this past Memorial Day 
weekend, an impressive $26,252 was raised for charity. Since the 
founding in 1983, the Brat Fest has raised over $220,000 for the local 
charities whose members volunteer at the stands each Memorial Day.
  This year, Brat Fest reached two amazing milestones. The first was a 
new record high of 123,520 brats sold, setting a new world record. One 
of these brats was the millionth brat sold for charity since the birth 
of the festival.

  Not only is the event to be recognized for its contributions to local 
charities, but also for its promotion of community spirit and vitality. 
This event brings people from all backgrounds in the community together 
in support of local organizations. Wisconsinites are given the chance 
to interact with ``celebrity'' cashiers. Every year as a cashier I 
truly enjoy gathering with my constituents at Brat Fest, serving up 
brats, and making sure no one leaves hungry.
  This form of positive community building is commendable and deserves 
recognition. I look forward to future Memorial Day Brat Fests and the 
service that they provide for the community.
