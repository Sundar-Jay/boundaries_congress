IN RECOGNITION OF OFFICER MICHAEL SIEBERT, RECIPIENT OF THE CALIFORNIA 
       AMERICAN LEGION LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE YEAR AWARD.

<bullet> Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the 
Senate's attention the exemplary achievements and outstanding service 
of Officer Michael Siebert of the San Francisco Police Department.
  The American Legion, Department of California has chosen Officer 
Michael Siebert as its Law Enforcement Officer of the Year. Officer 
Siebert is receiving this award for his dedication to the betterment of 
his community and to law enforcement.
  Officer Michael Siebert has dedicated himself to raising funds for 
children with catastrophic childhood diseases. In 1998, Officer Siebert 
volunteered to travel to Sydney, Australia, to take part in its ``Crop-
A-Cop'' fundraising event. This event featured officers who raise 
charity funds earmarked for children with cancer. As part of the event, 
officers would shave their heads to demonstrate to children going 
through the horrors of chemotherapy that it was okay to have no hair. 
Not only did Officer Siebert shave his head, but he also returned to 
``Crop-A-Cop'' in Australia the following year.
  Through his efforts, in 1999, this event debuted in the United 
States. Not only did he succeed in having the San Francisco Police 
Department and the Sheriff's Department participate, but Officer 
Siebert enlisted agencies all over the State of California to take 
part. This year marked the fourth year of Officer Siebert's ``Buzz the 
Fuzz'' fundraiser.
  Officer Siebert is an inspiration to all. Californians are extremely 
proud of Officer Siebert's dedication to his police work, the 
community, and to children who bravely face the devastation of cancer. 
He is most deserving of this award and the outpouring of admiration he 
receives from colleagues and friends. I am honored to pay tribute to 
him, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in wishing Officer 
Michael Siebert much continued success in his law enforcement 
career.<bullet>
