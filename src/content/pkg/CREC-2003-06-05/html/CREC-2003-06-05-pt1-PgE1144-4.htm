  Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to an 
outstanding young man from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. I am 
happy to announce that Aaron M. Wurst of Ottoville, Ohio, has been 
offered an appointment to attend the United States Military Academy.
  Mr. Speaker, Aaron's offer of appointment poises him to attend the 
United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming cadet class 
of 2007. Attending one of our Nation's military academies is an 
invaluable experience that offers a world-class education and demands 
the very best that these young men and women have to offer. Truly, it 
is one of the most challenging and rewarding undertakings of their 
lives.
  Aaron brings a special mix of leadership, service, and dedication to 
the incoming class of West Point cadets. While attending Ottoville High 
School, Ottoville, Ohio, Aaron has attained a grade point average of 
4.0. During his time at Ottoville High School, Aaron has received 
several commendations for his superior scholastic efforts. Aaron's 
accomplishments include Academic Letters, being awarded the Voice of 
Democracy School winner, was selected to participate in several highly 
selective mathematics competitions, as well as being inducted into the 
National Honor Society.
  Outside the classroom, Aaron has distinguished himself as an 
excellent athlete. On the fields of friendly strife, Aaron participated 
in Cross Country where he earned his Varsity Letter, Basketball, and 
Track. In addition to his

athletic accomplishments, Aaron is an active member in the student 
council where he served as his Class President and the drama club.
  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to stand and join me in paying 
special tribute to Aaron M. Wurst. Our service academies offer the 
finest education and military training available anywhere in the world. 
I am sure that Aaron will do very well during his career at the United 
States Military Academy and I wish him the very best in all of his 
future endeavors.
