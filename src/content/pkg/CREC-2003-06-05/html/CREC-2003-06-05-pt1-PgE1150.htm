  Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to an 
outstanding young man from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. I am 
happy to announce that Alexander M. Huber of Milan, Ohio, has been 
offered an appointment to attend the United States Merchant Marine 
Academy.
  Mr. Speaker, Alexander's offer of appointment poises him to attend 
the United States Merchant Marine Academy this fall with the incoming 
cadet class of 2007. Attending one of our Nation's military academies 
is an invaluable experience that offers a world-class education and 
demands the very best that these young men and women have to offer. 
Truly, it is one of the most challenging and rewarding undertakings of 
their lives.
  Alexander brings a special mix of leadership, service, dedication to 
the incoming class of Merchant Marine Academy cadets. While attending 
Edison High School, Milan, Ohio, Alexander has attained a grade point 
average of 3.942 which places him 7th in his class of 129 students. 
During his time at Edison High School, Alexander has received several 
commendations for his superior scholastic efforts. Alexander's 
accomplishments include being on the honor roll for all four years, 
being awarded the Student of the Quarter for Business, recipient of the 
Mathematics Award, student of the quarter award for Science, and 
recipient of the Scholarship Pin. Aside from his accomplishments 
Alexander also participated in the National Honor Society, the Math 
Club, and the Spanish Club.
  Outside the classroom, Alexander has distinguished himself as an 
excellent student-athlete and dedicated citizen of Milan. On the fields 
of friendly strife, Alexander has participated in Soccer, Tennis, and 
Weight Lifting. In addition to his athletic accomplishments, Alexander 
is an active member in his community participating in National Youth 
Leadership Conference and Boys State.
  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to stand and join me in paying 
special tribute to Alexander M. Huber. Our service academies offer the 
finest education and military training available anywhere in the world. 
I am sure that Alexander will do very well during his career at United 
States Merchant Marine Academy and I wish him the very best in all of 
his future endeavors.
