                          COMMENDING BULGARIA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. JOE WILSON

                           of south carolina

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of House 
Concurrent Resolution 177 commending the men and women of our Armed 
Forces, our leaders and our allies for the courage and dedication 
displayed during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and 
Operation Iraqi Freedom in Iraq. Since that fateful day in September 
2001 we have been a Nation at war. In one of the few instances in our 
history when our homeland was directly attacked, our President 
responded decisively by declaring a global war on terrorism.
  That September night while the world watch in horror, the President 
directed the full power and might of the United States to bring the 
terrorists to justice and asked for our friends and allies to join us 
in the war against terrorists. Over 70 nations responded to his call to 
arms and one, the Republic of Bulgaria, has stood with us since that 
fateful day, sharing in the dangers and the determination to fight the 
global war on terrorism.
  Since September 11, 2001 the Republic of Bulgaria has acted firmly 
and convincingly as a friend and a de facto ally of the United States. 
In the world councils, Bulgaria has supported the NATO decisions to 
help patrol our skies after the September 11, 2001, and backed the 
European Union's Plan of Action in support of the United States. As an 
important non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, 
the Republic of Bulgaria has contributed constructively to all of the 
resolutions to bring the terrorist networks to justice. With Bulgaria's 
help, UN Resolutions 1386 and 1390 to bring pressure on the Al Qaeda 
and Taliban networks were quickly passed, thereby cutting off any 
material aid to the Taliban regime that was providing safe haven for 
Osama Bin Laden's terrorists and their training camps.
  But the Republic of Bulgaria has done more than just support us in 
international councils. It has come to our assistance both at home and 
in the theaters of war. Within days of our warning to the Taliban 
regime in Afghanistan, Bulgaria granted our air forces blanket 
overflight rights for any United States aircraft participating in 
Operation Enduring Freedom. As the tempo of air operations increased, 
Bulgaria expanded its support to provide a base for our aircraft at 
Sarafovo. To assist other NATO nations which were providing troops to 
Operations in Afghanistan, Bulgaria volunteered a security company to 
the peacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo. And Bulgaria came to 
our direct assistance in Operation Enduring Freedom by providing a 
Decontamination Company to the International Security and Assistance 
Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. That force has been in place 
constructively working with U.S. and other allied forces since January 
2002.
  When the issue of Iraqi arose Bulgaria again stood with us both at 
the United Nations and at the battle front. Bulgaria took an active 
part in the passage of United Nations Resolution 1441 and has remained 
committed to the disarming of Iraq. When it became clear that Iraq had 
no intention of abiding by the United Nations Constraints, Bulgaria 
acted quickly to once again provide unfettered overflight, temporary 
basing and transit rights over its territory. Once again U.S. air 
forces soon found themselves a friendly base at Sarafovo. When the 
moment of decision arrived, Bulgaria stood steadfast with our 
determined President and sent a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical 
Protection Company to join our forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom and 
help protect them against Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.
  I wish to point out that the Republic of Bulgaria has conducted 
itself as a staunch and committed ally to the United States and its 
support should not go unnoticed by this great deliberative body. So I 
ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing that the Republic of 
Bulgaria is one of the handful of nations that we are here today 
commending for having stood shoulder-to-shoulder with us in these two 
campaigns in the global war on terrorists.
