                       TRIBUTE TO COACH LOU GIANI

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. STEVE ISRAEL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Coach Lou Giani of 
Huntington High School on his induction into the U.S. National 
Wrestling Hall of Fame.
  Coach Giani is among the most successful wrestling coaches in New 
York State history, having compiled 388 victories in 34 seasons. This 
past season Coach Giani and his Huntington High School team won the New 
York State team title--a remarkable eighth title for Coach Giani. In 
addition to the team accolades, Huntington High School also had three 
individual wrestlers win State Championships, increasing the career 
total of Coach Giani to a record 22 individual state champions. In 
recognition of these accomplishments, the National Wrestling Coaches 
Association bestowed on him the honor of ``Coach of the Year''.
  In addition to his service to Huntington High School and New York 
State, Coach Giani has served as an international ambassador for 
wrestling. Having organized cultural exchange programs in both the 
Soviet Union and Poland, he has provided disadvantaged youth with the 
opportunity to learn wrestling from one of the sport's best coaches.
  Beyond his service as a coach and international teacher, Mr. Giani 
had an equally impressive career as a wrestler. Having not begun to 
wrestle until his junior year of high school, Mr. Giani went on to win 
ten New York Athletic Club titles, a gold medal at the 1959 Pan 
American Games and was given the honor of representing the United 
States on the 1960 Olympic Freestyle team.
  I commend Coach Lou Giani for his dedication to the sport as well as 
his service to the students of Huntington High School and I 
congratulate him on his induction into the U.S. National Wrestling Hall 
of Fame.
