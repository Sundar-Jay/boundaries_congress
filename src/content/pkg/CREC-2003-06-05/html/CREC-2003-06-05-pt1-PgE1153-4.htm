                           HON. JOHN SHIMKUS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Braden 
Christian of Harrisburg, Illinois in honor of his participation in the 
76th annual Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee.
  Braden was the winner of the Tri-State Spelling Bee held at Bosse 
High School in Evansville, Illinois on March 15 earlier this year. His 
win secured him an invitation to the National Spelling Bee.
  Today, I would like to congratulate Braden on his victory and wish 
him luck in the National Competition.
  The Scripps Howard National Spelling Bee is held annually and 
features 251 students from grades five through eight from all over the 
country. Students are quizzed on a large selection of words from the 
Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary. I would like to 
commend Braden for his hard work and dedication to pursuing his goal of 
winning the National Title.
  In closing, I would like to praise Braden for all of his achievements 
and also thank his parents and teachers who have nurtured and inspired 
Braden's desire for excellence and love of knowledge. He is a truly 
wonderful young man and I look forward to hearing of his future 
accomplishments. God Bless.
