          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):
  S. 1190. A bill to expand and enhance postbaccalaureate opportunities 
at Hispanic-serving institutions, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
  Mr. BINGAMAN: Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from 
Texas, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, to introduce the Next Generation 
Hispanic-Serving Institution Act. This bill will strengthen provisions 
in Title V of the Higher Education Act, HEA, by providing our Hispanic-
Serving Institutions with both graduate opportunities and reductions in 
regulatory barriers.
  According to the 2000 census Hispanics make up 12.5 percent of the 
American population. Currently Hispanics constitute 10 percent of the 
college enrollment. By 2050 the Hispanic population will grow to 25 
percent. It is in our national interest to ensure that this population 
is well educated so that they will be ready to take their place as 
professionals, scientists, inventors, and well-informed citizens.
  Hispanic-Serving Institutions, HSIs, serve students of all 
backgrounds and ethnicities in 13 States. Colleges and universities 
become eligible for HSI status if at least 50 percent of their student 
population receives need-based financial assistance, 25 percent is 
Hispanic, and 50 percent of their Hispanic population is low-income. It 
is at these HSIs that the largest growth in advanced degrees awarded to 
Hispanics is occurring. Between 1991 and 2000 the number of Hispanic 
students earning master's degrees at HSIs grew 136 percent and the 
number of receiving doctoral degrees grew by 85 percent. Currently over 
25 percent of the Hispanics who obtained these degrees did so at HSIs. 
As a nation, we need to expand the capacity of Hispanic-Serving 
Institutions, support their undergraduate programs, and encourage them 
to offer quality graduate and professional degree programs.
  The Next Generation Hispanic-Serving Institution Act will strengthen 
our Hispanic-Serving Institutions by: Establishing a competitive grant 
program for HSIs to support their masters and doctoral degree programs. 
Eliminating the current requirement for HSIs to show that 50 percent of 
their Hispanic population is low-income. This requirement is difficult 
for the institutions to meet because they cannot collect the necessary 
student data. Eliminating the 2-year wait-out period between HSI grants 
allowing continuous funding of existing programs. Adding, as an 
authorized activity, programs that support student transfers from 2-
year to 4-year institutions. Raising the funding for the Title V HSI 
grant program to $175,000,000. Allocating $125,000,000 for a new grant 
program to support HSI masters and doctoral programs.
  The State of New Mexico houses 19 HSIs within its border. The New 
Mexico HSIs serve the entire State and their student populations are 
very diverse. Over the years these 19 institutions have worked 
diligently to educate and support all students. They have graduated 
outstanding teachers, scientists, and other professionals. The Next 
Generation Hispanic-Serving Institution Act supports the valuable work 
that these and all other HSIs are currently doing and gives them new 
resources they need to expand their offerings.

  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and I ask unanimous consent 
that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                   AMERICANS.

       (a) Establishment of Program.--Title V of the Higher 
     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) is amended--
       (1) by redesignating part B as part C;

[[Page S7479]]

       (2) by redesignating sections 511 through 518 as sections 
     521 through 528, respectively; and
       (3) by inserting after section 505 the following:

   ``PART B--PROMOTING POSTBACCALAUREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HISPANIC 
                               AMERICANS

     ``SEC. 511. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

       ``(a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
       ``(1) According to the United States Census, by the year 
     2050, 1 in 4 Americans will be of Hispanic origin.
       ``(2) Despite the dramatic increase in the Hispanic 
     population in the United States, the National Center for 
     Education Statistics reported that in 1999, Hispanics 
     accounted for only 4 percent of the master's degrees, 3 
     percent of the doctor's degrees, and 5 percent of first-
     professional degrees awarded in the United States.
       ``(3) Although Hispanics constitute 10 percent of the 
     college enrollment in the United States, they comprise only 3 
     percent of instructional faculty in college and universities.
       ``(4) The future capacity for research and advanced study 
     in the United States will require increasing the number of 
     Hispanics pursuing postbaccalaureate studies.
       ``(5) Hispanic-serving institutions are leading the Nation 
     in increasing the number of Hispanics attaining graduate and 
     professional degrees.
       ``(6) Among Hispanics who received master's degrees in 
     1999-2000, 25 percent earned them at Hispanic-serving 
     institutions.
       ``(7) Between 1991 and 2000, the number of Hispanic 
     students earning master's degrees at Hispanic-serving 
     institutions grew 136 percent, the number receiving doctor's 
     degrees grew by 85 percent, and the number earning first-
     professional degrees grew by 47 percent.
       ``(8) It is in the National interest to expand the capacity 
     of Hispanic-serving institutions to offer graduate and 
     professional degree programs.
       ``(9) Research is a key element in graduate education and 
     undergraduate preparation, particularly in science and 
     technology, and Congress desires to strengthen the role of 
     research at Hispanic serving-institutions. University 
     research, whether performed directly or through a 
     university's nonprofit research institute or foundation, is 
     considered an integral part of the institution and mission of 
     the university.
       ``(b) Purposes.--The purposes of this part are--
       ``(1) to expand postbaccalaureate educational opportunities 
     for, and improve the academic attainment of, Hispanic 
     students; and
       ``(2) to expand and enhance the postbaccalaureate academic 
     offerings of high quality that are educating the majority of 
     Hispanic college students and helping large numbers of 
     Hispanic students and low-income individuals complete 
     postsecondary degrees.

                             By Mr. LEAHY:

  S. 1191. A bill to restore Federal remedies for infringements of 
intellectual property by States, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee on the Judiciary.
  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in June 1999, the United States Supreme 
Court issued a pair of decisions that altered the legal landscape with 
respect to intellectual property. I am referring to Florida Prepaid v. 
College Savings Bank and its companion case, College Savings Bank v. 
Florida Prepaid. The Court ruled in these cases that States and their 
institutions cannot be held liable for damages for patent infringement 
and other violations of the Federal intellectual property laws, even 
though they can and do enjoy the full protection of those laws for 
themselves.
  Both Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank were decided by the 
same five-to-four majority of the justices. This slim majority of the 
Court threw out three Federal statutes that Congress passed, 
unanimously, in the early 1990s, to reaffirm that the Federal patent, 
copyright, and trademark laws apply to everyone, including the States.
  I believe that there is an urgent need for Congress to respond to the 
Florida Prepaid decisions, for two reasons.
  First, the decisions opened up a huge loophole in our Federal 
intellectual property laws. If we truly believe in fairness, we cannot 
tolerate a situation in which some participants in the intellectual 
property system get legal

[[Page S7480]]

protection but need not adhere to the law themselves. If we truly 
believe in the free market, we cannot tolerate a situation where one 
class of market participants have to play by the rules and others do 
not. As Senator Specter said in August 1999, in a floor statement that 
was highly critical of the Florida Prepaid decisions, they ``leave us 
with an absurd and untenable state of affairs,'' where ``States will 
enjoy an enormous advantage over their private sector competitors.''
  The second reason why Congress should respond to the Florida Prepaid 
decisions is that they raise broader concerns about the roles of 
Congress and the Court. Over the past decade, in a series of five-to-
four decisions that might be called examples of ``judicial activism,'' 
the current Supreme Court majority has overturned Federal legislation 
with a frequency unprecedented in American constitutional history. In 
doing so, the Court has more often than not relied on notions of State 
sovereign immunity that have little if anything to do with the text of 
the Constitution.
  Some of us have liked some of the results; others have liked others; 
but that is not the point. This activist Court has been whittling away 
at the legitimate constitutional authority of the federal government. 
At the risk of sounding alarmist, this is the fact of the matter: We 
are faced with a choice. We can respond--in a careful and measured 
way--by reinstating our democratic policy choices in legislation that 
is crafted to meet the Court's stated objections. Or we can run away, 
abdicate our democratic policy-making duties to the unelected Court, 
and go down in history as the incredible shrinking Congress.
  About four months after the Florida Prepaid decisions issued, I 
introduced a bill that responded to those decisions. The Intellectual 
Property Protection Restoration Act of 1999 was designed to restore 
Federal remedies for violations of intellectual property rights by 
states. I have continued to refine this legislation over the years, and 
in February 2002, as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I held the 
Committee's first hearing on the issue of sovereign immunity and the 
protection of intellectual property.

  Today, I am pleased to be introducing the Intellectual Property 
Protection Restoration Act of 2003, which builds on my earlier 
proposals and on the helpful comments I have received on those 
proposals from legal experts across the country. I am proud to have the 
House leaders on intellectual property issues, Representatives Smith 
and Berman, as the principal sponsors of the House companion bill.
  This bill has the same common-sense goal as the three statutes that 
the Supreme Court's decisions invalidated: To protect intellectual 
property rights fully and fairly. But the legislation has been re-
engineered, after extensive consultation with constitutional and 
intellectual property experts, to ensure full compliance with the 
Court's new jurisprudential requirements. As a result, the bill has 
earned the strong support of the U.S. Copyright Office and the 
endorsements of a broad range of organizations including the American 
Bar Association, the American Intellectual Property Law Association, 
the Business Software Alliance, the Intellectual Property Owners 
Association, the International Trademark Association, the Motion 
Picture Association of America, the Professional Photographers of 
America Association, and the Chamber of Commerce.
  In essence, our bill presents States with a choice. It creates 
reasonable incentives for States to waive their immunity in 
intellectual property cases, but it does not oblige them to do so. 
States that choose not to waive their immunity within two years after 
enactment of the bill would continue to enjoy many of the benefits of 
the Federal intellectual property system; however, like private parties 
that sue States for infringement, States that sue private parties for 
infringement could not recover any money damages unless they had waived 
their immunity from liability in intellectual property cases.
  This arrangement is clearly constitutional. Congress may attach 
conditions to a State's receipt of Federal intellectual property 
protection under its Article I intellectual property power just as 
Congress may attach conditions on a State's receipt of federal funds 
under its Article I spending power. Either way, the power to attach 
conditions to the federal benefit is part of the greater power to deny 
the benefit altogether. And no condition could be more reasonable or 
proportionate than the condition that in order to obtain full 
protection for your federal intellectual property rights, you must 
respect those of others.
  I am encouraged by the Supreme Court's recent decision in Nevada 
Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs, which, although very narrow, 
suggests that certain Justices may be starting to realize that the 
Court has gone too far in sacrificing ordinary people's rights at the 
altar of sovereign immunity. By upholding the Family and Medical Leave 
Act as applied to the States, the Hibbs case also suggests that a very 
carefully crafted law, which simply does what is necessary to protect 
important rights, will be upheld.
  I hope we can all agree on the need to protect the rights of 
intellectual property owners. A recent GAO study confirmed that, as the 
law now stands, owners of intellectual property have few or no 
alternatives or remedies available against State infringers--just a 
series of dead ends.
  We need to assure American inventors and investors, and our foreign 
trading partners, that as State involvement in intellectual property 
becomes ever greater in the new information economy, U.S. intellectual 
property rights are backed by legal remedies. I want to emphasize the 
international ramifications here. American trading interests have been 
well served by our strong and consistent advocacy of effective 
intellectual property protections in treaty negotiations and other 
international fora. Those efforts could be jeopardized by the loophole 
in U.S. intellectual property enforcement that the Supreme Court has 
created.
  Senator Brownback made this point at a Judiciary Committee hearing on 
February 27, 2002. He said, ``When states assert sovereign immunity for 
the purpose of infringing upon intellectual property rights, it damages 
the credibility of the United States internationally, and could 
possibly even lead to violations of our treaty obligations. Any 
decrease in the level of enforcement of intellectual property rights 
around the world is likely to harm American businesses, because of our 
position as international leaders in industries like pharmaceuticals, 
information technology, and biotechnology.''
  The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act restores 
protection for violations of intellectual property rights that may, 
under current law, go unremedied. We unanimously passed more sweeping 
legislation in the early 1990s, but were thwarted by the Supreme 
Court's shifting jurisprudence. We should enact this legislation 
without further delay.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows.

                                S. 1191

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES.

       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the 
     ``Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act of 2003''.
       (b) References.--Any reference in this Act to the Trademark 
     Act of 1946 shall be a reference to the Act entitled ``An Act 
     to provide for the registration and protection of trade-marks 
     used in commerce, to carry out the provisions of certain 
     international conventions, and for other purposes'', approved 
     July 5, 1946 (15 U.S.C. 1051 et seq.).

     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

       The purposes of this Act are to--
       (1) help eliminate the unfair commercial advantage that 
     States and their instrumentalities now hold in the Federal 
     intellectual property system because of their ability to 
     obtain protection under the United States patent, copyright, 
     and trademark laws while remaining exempt from liability for 
     infringing the rights of others;
       (2) promote technological innovation and artistic creation 
     in furtherance of the policies underlying Federal laws and 
     international treaties relating to intellectual property;
       (3) reaffirm the availability of prospective relief against 
     State officials who are violating or who threaten to violate 
     Federal intellectual property laws; and
       (4) abrogate State sovereign immunity in cases where States 
     or their instrumentalities, officers, or employees violate 
     the

[[Page S7481]]

     United States Constitution by infringing Federal intellectual 
     property.

     SEC. 3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY REMEDIES EQUALIZATION.

       (a) Amendment to Patent Law.--Section 287 of title 35, 
     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
     following:
       ``(d)(1) No remedies under section 284 or 289 shall be 
     awarded in any civil action brought under this title for 
     infringement of a patent issued on or after January 1, 2004, 
     if a State or State instrumentality is or was at any time the 
     legal or beneficial owner of such patent, except upon proof 
     that--
       ``(A) on or before the date the infringement commenced or 
     January 1, 2006, whichever is later, the State has waived its 
     immunity, under the eleventh amendment of the United States 
     Constitution and under any other doctrine of sovereign 
     immunity, from suit in Federal court brought against the 
     State or any of its instrumentalities, for any infringement 
     of intellectual property protected under Federal law; and
       ``(B) such waiver was made in accordance with the 
     constitution and laws of the State, and remains effective.
       ``(2) The limitation on remedies under paragraph (1) shall 
     not apply with respect to a patent if--
       ``(A) the limitation would materially and adversely affect 
     a legitimate contract-based expectation in existence before 
     January 1, 2004; or
       ``(B) the party seeking remedies was a bona fide purchaser 
     for value of the patent, and, at the time of the purchase, 
     did not know and was reasonably without cause to believe that 
     a State or State instrumentality was once the legal or 
     beneficial owner of the patent.
       ``(3) The limitation on remedies under paragraph (1) may be 
     raised at any point in a proceeding, through the conclusion 
     of the action. If raised before January 1, 2006, the court 
     may stay the proceeding for a reasonable time, but not later 
     than January 1, 2006, to afford the State an opportunity to 
     waive its immunity as provided in paragraph (1).''.
       (b) Amendment to Copyright Law.--Section 504 of title 17, 
     United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
     following:
       ``(e) Limitation on Remedies in Certain Cases.--
       ``(1) No remedies under this section shall be awarded in 
     any civil action brought under this title for infringement of 
     an exclusive right in a work created on or after January 1, 
     2004, if a State or State instrumentality is or was at any 
     time the legal or beneficial owner of such right, except upon 
     proof that--
       ``(A) on or before the date the infringement commenced or 
     January 1, 2006, whichever is later, the State has waived its 
     immunity, under the eleventh amendment of the United States 
     Constitution and under any other doctrine of sovereign 
     immunity, from suit in Federal court brought against the 
     State or any of its instrumentalities, for any infringement 
     of intellectual property protected under Federal law; and
       ``(B) such waiver was made in accordance with the

                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):
  S. 1192. A bill to establish a Consumer and Small Business Energy 
Commission to assess and provide recommendations regarding recent 
energy price spikes from the perspective of consumers and small 
businesses; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Consumer and 
Small Business Energy Commission Act. I am pleased to have the support 
of the Senator from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, in introducing this 
legislation. This legislation will allow us to better understand the 
causes of energy price spikes from the consumer and small business 
perspectives, and better address this pressing issue.
  The Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act would establish 
a Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission. The members would be 
appointed on a bipartisan basis by the Speaker and Minority Leader of 
the House and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate, as well 
as the President. The Commission would be comprised of representatives 
of consumer groups, the energy industry, small businesses, and the 
Administration. The Commission will study the causes of energy price 
spikes and issue recommendations on how to avert price spikes in the 
future.
  Sine 1990, residential heating oil, residential natural gas, 
commercial natural gas, industrial natural gas, and gasoline have all 
had significantly fluctuating prices. Gasoline price spikes have become 
commonplace in the Midwest. Escalating home heating and cooling bills 
have crippled family budgets in the Midwest and Northeast. Farmers and 
industries dependent on natural gas for the production of fertilizer 
and other chemical products have also suffered economically. Most 
recently, natural gas prices have skyrocketed and gasoline prices have 
shown little sign of falling from the historic highs of the past few 
months.
  We need a comprehensive study of these problems. Some past studies 
have assessed the long-range supply and demand for energy product. The 
Federal Trade Commission studied gasoline price spikes in the Midwest, 
and Senator Levin has embarked on a series of hearings exploring 
gasoline pricing issues. Other studies have investigated narrow or 
specific abuses of market power in the energy industry, such as in 
California. The Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission will look 
at the entire picture, focusing on price fluctuations of all consumer 
energy products. The list of potential causes that need to be studied 
includes: insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery 
capacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, possible regulation 
problems, flawed deregulation, excessive consumption, over-reliance on 
foreign supplies, insufficient investment in research and development 
of alternative sources, opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and 
abuse of market power.
  We need to give consumers and small businesses a voice. When 
consumers go to pay their grocery bills, or their tuition bills, or 
even their residential electricity bills in most states, and when small 
businesses go to pay for raw materials, prices are fairly predictable. 
But when they go to pay for their heating and cooling, natural gas, or 
gasoline, families and businesses face the frustrating reality of wild 
price swings.
  We need to bring consumers and small businesses to the table together 
with representatives of the energy industry and government. We need 
these groups to work collectively, and to consider the range of 
possible causes of energy price spikes.

  A measure very similar to this bill enjoyed strong, bipartisan 
support last year, and passed as an amendment to the Senate energy bill 
by a vote of 69-30. The minor changes to this bill include adding 
direct representation of small businesses to the Commission, expanding 
the participation of Administration representatives in the study phase, 
and establishing an Executive Committee to expedite the issuance of the 
final report, which will include recommendations.
  By enacting the Consumer and Small Business Energy Commission Act, we 
will be able to better understand the causes of energy price spikes and 
hopefully avert them in the future. I urge my colleagues to join me as 
a cosponsor of this important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that 
the text of the bill be printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1192

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer and Small Business 
     Energy Commission Act of 2003''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds that--
       (1) there have been several sharp increases since 1990 in 
     the price of electricity, gasoline, home heating oil, natural 
     gas, and propane in the United States;
       (2) recent examples of such increases include--
       (A) unusually high gasoline prices that are at least partly 
     attributable to global politics;
       (B) electricity price spikes during the California energy 
     crisis of 2001; and
       (C) the Midwest gasoline price spikes in spring 2001;
       (3) shifts in energy regulation, including the allowance of 
     greater flexibility in competition and trading, have affected 
     price stability and consumers in ways that are not fully 
     understood;
       (4) price spikes undermine the ability of low-income 
     families, the elderly, and small businesses (including 
     farmers and other agricultural producers) to afford essential 
     energy services and products;
       (5) energy price spikes can exacerbate a weak economy by 
     creating uncertainties that discourage investment, growth, 
     and other activities that contribute to a strong economy;
       (6) the Department of Energy has determined that the 
     economy would be likely to perform better with stable or 
     predictable energy prices;
       (7) price spikes can be caused by many factors, including 
     insufficient inventories, supply disruptions, refinery 
     capacity limits, insufficient infrastructure, over-regulation 
     or under-regulation, flawed deregulation, excessive 
     consumption, over-reliance on foreign supplies, insufficient 
     research and development of alternative energy sources, 
     opportunistic behavior by energy companies, and abuses of 
     market power;
       (8) consumers and small businesses have few options other 
     than to pay higher energy costs when prices spike, resulting 
     in reduced investment and slower economic growth and job 
     creation;
       (9) the effect of price spikes, and possible responses to 
     price spikes, on consumers and small businesses should be 
     examined; and
       (10) studies have examined price spikes of specific energy 
     products in specific contexts or for specific reasons, but no 
     study has examined price spikes comprehensively with a focus 
     on the impacts on consumers and small businesses.

                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Smith, and Mrs. Murray):
  S. 1193. A bill to provide for qualified withdrawals from the Capital 
Construction Fund for fishermen leaving the industry and for the 
rollover of Capital Construction Funds to individual retirement plans, 
and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Capital 
Construction Fund Qualified Withdrawal Act of 2003. My friends and 
colleagues, Senator Smith and Senator Murray, join me in introducing 
this important bill.
  In January of 2000, a fishery disaster was declared by the Secretary 
of Commerce for the West Coast groundfish fishery. Due to major 
declines in fish population, the Pacific Fisheries Management Council 
decreased groundfish catch quotas by 90 percent. Today, the groundfish 
fishery in Oregon and adjoining States in the Pacific Northwest 
continues to face daunting challenges as a result of this disaster. 
Fishery income has dropped 55 percent and over a thousand fishers face 
bankruptcy. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has called for a 50 
percent reduction in fishing capacity as part of their strategic plan 
for the recovery of the fishery. This legislation supports this effort 
by reforming the Capital Construction Fund in a way that will ease the 
groundfish fishers' transition away from fishing.
  The Capital Construction Fund, CCF, Merchant Marine Act of 1936, 
amended 1969, 46 U.S.C. 1177, has been a way for fishers to accumulate 
funds, free from taxes, for the purpose of buying or refitting fishing 
vessels. It was conceived at a time when the federal government wanted 
to help capitalize and expand American fishing fleets. The program was 
a success: it led to a larger U.S. fishing fleet. However, fish 
populations declined and the U.S. commercial fishing fleet is now over-
capitalized. The CCF's usefulness has not kept up with the times, and 
now it exacerbates problems facing U.S. fisheries, including the West 
Coast groundfish fishery.
  Now is the time to help fishers, who wish to do so, to leave the 
fleet.
  In Oregon, the amounts in CCF accounts range from $10,000 to over 
$200,000. This legislation changes current law to allow fishers to 
remove money from their CCF for purposes other than buying new vessels 
or upgrading current vessels, without losing up to 70 percent of their 
CCF funds in taxes and penalties. This legislation changes the CCF so 
fishers who want to opt out of fishing are not penalized for doing so.
  This bill takes a significant step towards helping fishermen and 
making the West Coast groundfish fishery and the commercial fishing 
industry sustainable by amending the CCF to allow non-fishing uses of 
investments. This bill amends the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 and the 
Internal Revenue Code to allow funds currently in the CCF to be rolled 
over into an IRA or other types of retirement accounts, or to be used 
for the payment of an industry fee authorized by the fishery capacity 
reduction program, without adverse tax consequences to the account 
holders. This bill will also encourage innovation and conservation by 
allowing fishers to use funds deposited in a CCF to develop or purchase 
new gear that reduces bycatch.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this 
legislation.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Grassley, Ms. 
        Cantwell, and Mr. Domenici):
  S. 1194. A bill to foster local collaborations which will ensure that 
resources are effectively and efficiently used within the criminal and 
juvenile justice systems; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators 
Domenici, Leahy, Grassley, and Cantwell, to introduce the ``Mentally 
Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003.'' This 
bipartisan measure would, among other things, create a program of 
planning and implementation grants for communities so they may offer 
more treatment and other services to mentally ill offenders. Under this 
bill, programs receiving grant funds would be operated collaboratively 
by both a criminal justice agency and a mental health agency.
  The mentally ill population poses a particularly difficult challenge 
for our criminal justice system. People afflicted with mental illness 
are incarcerated at significantly higher rates than the general 
population. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, while only 
about five percent of the American population has a mental illness, 
about 16 percent of the State prison population has such an illness. 
The Los Angeles County Jail, for example,

[[Page S7484]]

typically has more mentally ill inmates than any hospital in the 
country.
  Unfortunately, however, the reality of our criminal justice system is 
that jails and prisons do not provide a therapeutic environment for the 
mentally ill and are unlikely to do so any time soon. Indeed, the 
mentally ill inmate often is preyed upon by other inmates or becomes 
even sicker in jail. Once released from jail or prison, many mentally 
ill people end up on the streets. With limited personal resources and 
little or no ability to handle their illness alone, they often commit 
further offenses resulting in their re-arrest and re-incarceration. 
This ``revolving door'' is costly and disruptive for all involved.
  Although these problems tend to manifest themselves primarily within 
the prison system, the root cause of our current situation is found in 
the mental health system and its failure to provide sufficient 
community-based treatment solutions. Accordingly, the solution will 
necessarily involve collaboration between the mental health system and 
criminal justice system. In fact, it also will require greater 
collaboration between the substance abuse treatment and mental health 
treatment communities, because many mentally ill offenders have a drug 
or alcohol problem in addition to their mental illness.
  The purpose of the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime 
Reduction Act'' is to foster exactly this type of collaboration at the 
Federal, State, and local levels. The bill provides incentives for the 
criminal justice, juvenile justice, mental health, and substance abuse 
treatment systems to work together at each level of government to 
establish a network of services for offenders with mental illness. The 
bill's approach is unique, in that it not only would promote public 
safety by helping curb the incidence of repeat offenders, but it also 
would promote public health, by ensuring that those with a serious 
mental illness are treated as soon as possible and as efficiently and 
effectively as possible.
  Among its major provisions, this legislation calls for the 
establishment of a new competitive grant program, which would be housed 
at the U.S. Department of Justice, but administered by the Attorney 
General with the active involvement of the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services. To ensure that collaboration occurs at the local level, 
the bill would require that two entities jointly submit a single grant 
application on behalf of a community.
  Applications demonstrating the greatest commitment to collaboration 
would receive priority for grant funds. If applicants can show that 
grant funds would be used to promote public health, as well as public 
safety, and if the program they propose would have the active 
participation of each joint applicant, and if their grant application 
has the support of both the Attorney General and the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services, then it would receive priority for funding.
  Additionally, the bill would permit grant funds to be used for a 
variety of purposes, each of which embodies the goal of collaboration. 
First, grant funds may be used to provide courts with more options, 
such as specialized dockets, for dealing with the non-violent offender 
who has a serious mental illness or a co-occurring mental illness and 
drug or alcohol problem. Second, grant funds could be used to enhance 
training of mental health and criminal justice system personnel, who 
must know how to deal appropriately with the mentally ill offender. 
Third, grant funds could be devoted to programs that divert the 
criminal justice system into treatment those non-violent offenders with 
severe and persistent mental illness. Finally, correctional facilities 
may use grant funds to promote the treatment of inmates and ease their 
transition back into the community upon release from jail or prison.
  In specifically authorizing grant funds to be used to promote more 
options for courts to deal with mentally ill offenders, this bill 
builds on legislation that I introduced two years ago with my colleague 
from Ohio, Congressman Ted Strickland. That measure, which became law, 
authorized $10 million per year for the establishment of more mental 
health courts. I have long supported mental health courts, which enable 
the criminal justice system to provide an individualized treatment 
solution for a mentally ill offender, while also requiring 
accountability of the offender. The legislation we are introducing 
today would make possible the creation or expansion of more mental 
health courts, and it also would promote the funding of treatment 
services that support such courts.
  In addition to making planning and implementation grants available to 
communities, the ``Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime Reduction 
Act'' also calls for an Interagency Task Force to be established at the 
federal level. This Task Force would include the Attorney General and 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as well as the Secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of 
Education, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Commissioner of 
Social Security. The Task Force would be charged with identifying new 
ways that federal departments can work together to reduce recidivism 
among mentally ill adults and juveniles.
  Finally, the bill would direct the Attorney General and Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to develop a list of ``best practices'' for 
criminal justice personnel to use when diverting mentally ill offenders 
from the criminal justice system.
  Ultimately, this is a good bill and one that is long overdue. I 
encourage my colleagues to support this important legislative measure.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1194

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Mentally Ill Offender 
     Treatment and Crime Reduction Act of 2003''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

       Congress finds the following:
       (1) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, over 16 
     percent of adults incarcerated in United States jails and 
     prisons have a mental illness.
       (2) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
     Delinquency Prevention, approximately 20 percent of youth in 
     the juvenile justice system have serious mental health 
     problems, and a significant number have co-occurring mental 
     health and substance abuse disorders.
       (3) According to the National Alliance for the Mentally 
     Ill, up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a serious 
     mental illness will come into contact with the American 
     criminal justice system at some point in their lives.
       (4) According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and 
     Delinquency Prevention, over 150,000 juveniles who come into 
     contact with the juvenile justice system each year meet the 
     diagnostic criteria for at least 1 mental or emotional 
     disorder.
       (5) A significant proportion of adults with a serious 
     mental illness who are involved with the criminal justice 
     system are homeless or at imminent risk of homelessness; and 
     many of these individuals are arrested and jailed for minor, 
     nonviolent offenses.
       (6) The majority of individuals with a mental illness or 
     emotional disorder who are involved in the criminal or 
     juvenile justice systems are responsive to medical and 
     psychological interventions that integrate treatment, 
     rehabilitation, and support services.
       (7) Collaborative programs between mental health, substance 
     abuse, and criminal or juvenile justice systems that ensure 
     the provision of services for those with mental illness or 
     co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders can 
     reduce the number of such individuals in adult and juvenile 
     corrections facilities, while providing improved public 
     safety.

     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

       The purpose of this Act is to increase public safety by 
     facilitating collaboration among the criminal justice, 
     juvenile justice, mental health treatment, and substance 
     abuse systems. Such collaboration is needed to--
       (1) reduce rearrests among adult and juvenile offenders 
     with mental illness, or co-occurring mental illness and 
     substance abuse disorders;
       (2) provide courts, including existing and new mental 
     health courts, with appropriate mental health and substance 
     abuse treatment options;
       (3) maximize the use of alternatives to prosecution through 
     diversion in appropriate cases involving non-violent 
     offenders with mental illness;
       (4) promote adequate training for criminal justice system 
     personnel about mental illness and substance abuse disorders 
     and the appropriate responses to people with such illnesses;
       (5) promote adequate training for mental health treatment 
     personnel about criminal

[[Page S7485]]

     offenders with mental illness and the appropriate response to 
     such offenders in the criminal justice system;
       (6) promote communication between criminal justice or 
     juvenile justice personnel, mental health treatment 
     personnel, nonviolent offenders with mental illness, and 
     other support services such as housing, job placement, 
     community, and faith-based organizations; and
       (7) promote communication, collaboration, and 
     intergovernmental partnerships among municipal, county, and 
     State elected officials with respect to mentally ill 
     offenders.

``Sec. 2991. Adult and juvenile collaboration programs.''.


  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have joined today with Senators DeWine, 
Grassley, Cantwell, and Domenici to introduce legislation that will 
help State and local governments reduce crime by providing more 
effective treatment for the mentally ill. All too often, people with 
mental illness rotate repeatedly between the criminal justice system 
and the streets of our communities, committing a series of minor 
offenses. Law enforcement officers' ever scarcer time is being occupied 
by these offenders, who divert them from their more urgent 
responsibilities. Meanwhile, offenders find themselves in prisons or 
jails, where little or no appropriate medical care is available for 
them. This bill give State and local governments the tools to break 
this cycle, for the good of law enforcement, corrections officers, the 
public's safety, and mentally ill offenders.
  I held a Judiciary Committee hearing last June on the criminal 
justice system and mentally ill offenders. At that

[[Page S7487]]

hearing, we heard from State mental health officials, law enforcement 
officers, corrections officials, and the representative of counties 
around our Nation. All agreed that people with untreated mental illness 
are more likely to commit crimes, and that our State mental health 
systems, prisons and jails do not have the resources they need to treat 
the mentally ill, and prevent crime and recidivism. As this 
legislation's findings detail, more than 16 percent of adults 
incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons have a mental illness, about 20 
percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental 
health problems, and up to 40 percent of adults who suffer from a 
serious mental illness will come into contact with the American 
criminal justice system at some point in their lives. This is a serious 
problem that I hear about often when I talk with law enforcement 
officials and others in Vermont.
  Under this bill, State and local governments can apply for funding to 
a. create or expand mental health courts or other court-based programs, 
which can divert qualified offenders from prison to receive treatment; 
b. create or expand programs to provide specialized training for 
criminal justice and mental health system personnel; c. create or 
expand local treatment programs that serve individuals with mental 
illness or co-occurring mental illness and substance abuse disorders; 
and d. promote and provide mental health treatment for those 
incarcerated in or released from a penal or correctional institution.
  This legislation brings together law enforcement, corrections, and 
mental health professionals--indeed, officials from each of these 
fields in Vermont have offered their advice and support in drafting 
this bill. They know that the States have been dealing with the unique 
problems created by mentally ill offenders for many years, and that a 
Federal response is overdue. I look forward to working with them, and 
with Senator DeWine, Representative Ted Strickland, and other Members, 
to see this bill enacted this Congress.
  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be once again 
introducing with Senator DeWine the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and 
Crime Reduction Act of 2003. This bipartisan bill authorizes the 
Attorney General to administer a grant program to assist communities in 
planning and implementing services for mentally ill offenders. These 
grants will increase public safety by fostering collaborative efforts 
by criminal justice, mental health, and substance abuse agencies. I 
have seen these types of collaborative programs work in Iowa and I know 
that they can work elsewhere.
  We have an obligation to ensure that the public is protected from 
these offenders who suffer from mental illness. The Bureau of Justice 
Statistics has reported that over 16 percent of adults incarcerated in 
U.S. jails and prison have a mental illness. In addition, the Office of 
Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention has reported that over 20 
percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have serious mental 
health problems. This grant program will help increase public safety, 
as well as reduce the number of mentally ill adults and juveniles 
incarcerated in correctional facilities.
  These grant dollars may be used by States and localities to establish 
mental health courts or other diversion programs, create or expand 
community-based treatment programs, provide in-jail treatment and 
transitional services, and for training of criminal justice and mental 
health system employees. The state of Iowa and a number of its counties 
are already leading the way in finding creative and collaborative 
programs to address the problems presented by these mentally ill 
criminals. Working together, the criminal justice, mental health, and 
substance abuse professionals can make a difference in the lives of 
this special class of offenders and also increase the safety of the 
public.
  I want to thank Senator DeWine for his leadership on this important 
issue. He has drafted a bill that reflects a common sense approach to a 
serious public safety issue. I also want to encourage my colleagues to 
support this important piece of legislation.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator DeWine 
and Senator Patrick Leahy along with Senators Grassley and Domenici in 
cosponsoring this important legislation. This bill will take steps to 
reduce the prevalence of the mentally ill in the criminal justice 
system by providing more effective treatment. Forty percent of the 
mentally ill in this country come in contact with the criminal justice 
system, many for minor but repeated offenses. This wastes tremendous 
law enforcement resources that can be better focused on more urgent 
responsibilities and results in many of the mentally ill sitting in 
jail cells where little treatment is available to them. My State has 
already taken some forward looking action in this area, and this 
legislation is an important next step.
  The Mentally Ill Crime Reduction Act of 2003 funds new grants that 
will give States the tools they need to work collaboratively to break 
the cycle of mentally ill people repeatedly moving through the 
corrections system. This legislation will allow more jurisdictions to 
follow Seattle's lead in creating mental health courts that monitor 
individuals to keep them in treatment and out of jail. It will provide 
much needed funding to mental health and substance abuse programs, and 
it will provide critical dollars for treatment of those incarcerated in 
or released from prisons. The legislation has the support of Washington 
State Corrections Director Joe Lehman and the Washington Department of 
Social and Health Services as well as the National Alliance for the 
Mentally Ill and the Council of State Governments. I'd like to 
especially thank the Bazelon Center for its work in this area.
  Last year, the Council on State Governments Criminal Justice/Mental 
Health Consensus Project issued a report that detailed the imbalance of 
the mentally ill in the criminal justice system. The Project found 
that, while those suffering from serious mental illness represent 
approximately five percent of the population of this country, they 
represent over 16 percent of the prison population. Of that 16 percent, 
nearly three-quarters also have a substance abuse problem, and nearly 
half were incarcerated for committing a nonviolent crime. In some 
jurisdictions recidivism rates for mentally ill inmates can reach over 
70 percent. Police, judges and prosecutors are usually without options 
of what to do with mentally ill patients, given the lack of health 
services, and thus many end up in jail for minor crimes. The Los 
Angeles County Jail alone holds as many as 3,300 individuals with 
mental illness, more than any state hospital or mental health 
institution in the United States.
  Each time a mentally ill individual is incarcerated, his or her 
mental condition will likely worsen. Once incarcerated, people with 
mental illness are particularly susceptible to harming themselves or 
others. This environment exacerbates their mental illness, yet access 
to effective counseling or medication is severely limited. This in turn 
brings on depression or delusions that immobilize them; many have spent 
years trying to mask torments or hallucinations with alcohol or drugs 
and on average spend more time in prisons.
  This problem is particularly acute in the area of juvenile offenders. 
The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention reports that 
over 20 percent of children in the juvenile justice system, over 
155,000, have serious mental health problems. This bill creates 
specialized training programs for juvenile and criminal justice agency 
personnel in identifying symptoms of mentally ill individuals that will 
help identify and treat juveniles at an earlier stage.

  The prevalence of people with mentally illness in the criminal 
justice system comes at a high price to taxpayers. In King County, WA, 
officials identified 20 people who had been repeatedly hospitalized, 
jailed or admitted to detoxification centers. These emergency services 
cost the county approximately $1.1 million in a single year. In 
contrast, an Illinois Cooperative Program which brought criminal 
justice and mental health service personnel together to provide 
services to those mentally ill patients released from jail calculated 
that the 30 individuals in the study spend approximately 2,200 days 
less in jail, and 2,100 fewer days, in hospitals than they had the 
previous year, for a savings of $1.2 million dollars.

[[Page S7488]]

  In 1997, Seattle Fire Department Captain Stanley Stevenson was 
murdered by an individual who had been found incompetent by the local 
municipal court but was released because of the lack of alternative 
options. This murder was the impetus for the creation of a Task Force 
that led directly to the formation of the King County Mental Health 
Court in 1999. The primary reason why this Court has been growing more 
effective in dealing with mentally ill offenders is that it has 
increased cooperation between the mental health and criminal justice 
systems, institutions that have traditionally not worked closely 
together. Building on the model of the drug court, the mental health 
court closely monitors compliance with treatment regimens by assembling 
a team proficient in dealing with the mentally ill and at using the 
stick of the criminal justice system to make that treatment work. The 
vast majority of these mentally ill individuals are responsive to 
treatment.
  This program has progressed well and is becoming an effective means 
of helping mentally ill offenders, assuring public safety, and running 
a more cost efficient system. Yet to allow this system to continue to 
expand in Seattle and other communities in Washington State, as well as 
to allow other States to begin using these types of programs, federal 
grant funding is critical. That is what this bill provides.
  Collaboration between mental health, substance abuse, law 
enforcement, judicial, and other criminal justice personnel is also 
critical to the success of our mental health court program in Seattle. 
It is only through full coordination between the criminal justice and 
the mental health treatment community at the Federal and the local 
level that these efforts will be successful.
  Similarly, only through full coordination at the Federal and local 
level will this bill be able to make a critical difference. I believe 
that some additional improvements can be made to strengthen that 
critical coordination and I look forward to working with Senator DeWine 
and Senator Leahy to accomplish that goal. I welcome the introduction 
of this legislation and look forward to working with my cosponsors to 
make this bill law in the next Congress.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. KYL  (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. 
        McCain, Mr. Frist, Mr. Alexander, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Bunning, 
        Mr. Smith, Mr. Graham of Florida, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Kerry, Mr. 
        Kennedy, and Mr. Hatch):
  S. 1195. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to 
clarify that inpatient drug prices charged to certain public hospitals 
are included in the best price exemptions for the medicaid drug rebate 
program; to the Committee on Finance.
  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Bingaman, 
Rockefeller, McCain, Frist, Alexander, Lincoln, Bunning, Smith, Bob 
Graham, Santorum, Kerry, Kennedy and Hatch to introduce a modest but 
important piece of legislation, the Safety Net Hospital Pharmacy Access 
Act. This legislation would correct a small error in current law that 
prohibits safety-net hospitals from being able to negotiate with 
pharmaceutical companies for the lowest prices they can get.
  Let me provide some background on this problem. In 1990, Congress 
established the Medicaid drug-rebate program to ensure that the 
Medicaid program pays no more than a pharmaceutical manufacturer's 
``best price'' for a covered outpatient drug. So whatever was the 
lowest price the manufacturer offered to anyone, this becomes the price 
Medicaid pays under this ``best price'' rule.
  Unfortunately, this rule provides an incentive for pharmaceutical 
manufacturers not to offer deep discounts to anyone, given that these 
prices may become the new price that Medicaid pays. Given this, in 1992 
Congress exempted some organizations from the Medicaid best price 
calculations so that pharmaceutical manufacturers would offer them 
lower drug prices. These organizations include the VA, the Department 
of Defense, and section 340B covered entities. These 340B hospitals are 
so called because they fall under section 340B of the Public Health 
Services Act, which defines 12 categories of publicly funded safety net 
providers. There are approximately 160 hospitals in the country that 
fall under the 340B program. These hospitals often bear the burden of 
providing a substantial amount of uncompensated care in dealing with 
the indigent or the uninsured.
  Unfortunately, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
interpreted the 1992 law as only applying to outpatient drugs purchased 
by these entities. Therefore, drugs purchased for inpatient use at the 
340B hospitals are covered by the Medicaid best price rule. This means 
these hospitals actually pay more for these drugs than for drugs that 
they can negotiate their own prices for in the outpatient setting. The 
legislation I am introducing today corrects this problem by allowing 
the 340B hospitals to also negotiate for lower drug prices in the 
inpatient setting.
  This is an important correction since these hospitals are often 
providing free care to the indigent and the uninsured. And let me be 
clear that this legislation would not require pharmaceutical companies 
to provide discounts to these hospitals. All this legislation would do 
is allow the hospitals to negotiate for lower prices. However, in my 
discussion with representatives of hospitals that would be affected by 
this law, they believe they would be able to save money.
  For instance, the Maricopa County hospital, which is the public 
hospital for the city of Phoenix, believes that it could save up to $1 
million a year. Since this hospital constantly runs in the red because 
of the massive amount of uncompensated care it is required under 
federal law to provide, such savings would be very helpful.
  I want to thank the bill's cosponsors. I also want to urge my 
colleagues to take a close look at this important legislation. I am 
going to work to see that it is passed this year.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bunning, Mr. 
        Burns, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Fitzgerald, and Mr. Hagel):
  S. 1196. A bill to eliminate the marriage penalty permanently in 
2003; to the Committee on Finance.
  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill to 
provide permanent tax relief from one of the most egregious, anti-
family aspects of the tax code--the marriage penalty. Relieving 
American taxpayers of this burden has been one of my highest priorities 
as a U.S. Senator.
  Last week President Bush signed into law a $350 billion jobs and 
economic growth package to put Americans back to work and stimulate the 
economy. The bill provides immediate marriage penalty relief by 
enlarging the standard deduction and the 15 percent tax bracket for 
married couples filing jointly to twice that as for single filers. This 
provision will save 34 million married couples an average of $589 this 
year alone.
  Enacting marriage penalty relief is a giant step for tax fairness, 
but it may be fleeting. The Jobs and Growth Act was just signed, but 
even as the ink dries a tax increase on married couples looms in the 
near future. Since the bill was restricted by artificial limitations to 
$350 billion, the marriage penalty provisions will only be in effect 
for two years. In 2005, marriage will again be a taxable event for 
millions of Americans. Similar restrictions were placed on the 2001 tax 
cut, so, while relief will be phased in by 2009, it will disappear for 
good in 2011 unless we act decisively.
  Millions of couples across America will be penalized once more by our 
tax code simply because they are married. Without marriage penalty 
relief, 48 percent of married couples will again pay the government an 
average $1,400 more in taxes.
  Given the state of the economy and the difficulty many families face 
in making ends meet, we must make sure we do not backtrack on this 
important reform.
  Without marriage penalty relief, the tax code provides a significant 
disincentive for people to walk down the aisle, and the benefits of 
marriage are well established. Marriage is a fundamental institution in 
our society and should not be discouraged by the IRS. Children living 
in a married household are far less likely to live in poverty or

[[Page S7489]]

to suffer from child abuse. Research indicates they are less likely to 
be depressed or have developmental problems. Scourges such as 
adolescent drug use are less common in married families, and married 
mothers are less likely to be victims of domestic violence.
  The bill I am offering would make the marriage penalty relief in the 
Jobs and Growth Act permanent. It also will accelerate changes to the 
earned income tax credit that were passed in the 2001 tax reform bill. 
This will reduce the marriage penalty on lower income couples.
  We cannot be satisfied until couples never again must decide between 
love and money. Marriage should not be a taxable event.
  I call on the Senate to finish the job we started and say ``I do'' to 
providing permanent marriage penalty relief today.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1196

      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, Mr. 
        Lautenberg, and Mr. Dorgan):
  S. 1197. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure the 
safety and accuracy of medical imaging examinations and radiation 
therapy treatments; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions.
  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, imagine for a moment you have gone to the 
doctor to have a medical condition evaluated. Uncertain as to what your 
injury may be, your doctor sends you to a specialist for a medical 
imaging examination to determine the extent of your injury and the 
proper course of treatment for it.
  Or, imagine, having heard the dreaded diagnosis of cancer, going to 
the same facility for radiation therapy.
  In either case, our sense of concern and anxiety about our medical 
condition will serve to focus our attention on ourselves, and not on 
the caregivers providing us with the treatment we need to recover, or 
in the case of cancer, to survive.
  But, what would you say if you knew that the individual helping to 
direct your diagnosis or the one providing your course of treatment is 
someone who has done nothing more to earn his credentials than spend a 
few weeks getting some on the job training.
  Imagine how you would feel and the level of trust you would have in a 
system that allowed such a thing to happen.
  Unfortunately, that's an all too common occurrence with the present 
state of our health care system.
  But, it is a problem that we can solve with the passage of 
legislation I am introducing today.
  The Consumer Assurance of Radiological Excellence, RadCARE, Act will 
ensure that there are coherent standards in place for those who plan 
and deliver radiation therapy treatments. I am pleased to be joined by 
my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, as well 
as Senators Daschle, Lautenberg, and Dorgan, in this effort, which will 
bring peace of mind and restore the confidence of the health consumer 
in the treatment they receive from those who perform radiologic 
procedures. It will also increase awareness of the skills of these 
health care professionals and raise the level of visibility their 
profession enjoys in the public eye.
  It is important that we establish standards for personnel who perform 
radiologic procedures because physicians depend upon medical imaging 
examinations to diagnose disease and identify and treat injuries of all 
kinds. The quality of a radiologic procedure hinges upon the expertise 
of the professionals who assist in administering them.
  Currently, 15 States as well as the District of Columbia do not 
regulate or register radiologic personnel.
  To address that lack of attention, the RadCARE Act will strengthen 
the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981. The 
current law calls for States to establish voluntarily a set of 
educational and credentialing standards for radiologic and medical 
imaging personnel. Yet many States still do not have licensing laws in 
place that meet the standards recommended by the Federal Government. 
The RadCARE Act will require that radiologic and medical imaging 
personnel meet a minimum credentialing standard.
  The RadCARE Act will not affect states that have a suitable licensing 
system or those that have mandated higher standards than required by 
Federal law. If a state has no meaningful

[[Page S7490]]

regulations or licensing system, however, then the Federal standards 
will apply. The RadCARE Act also has a provision to ensure access to 
quality healthcare in rural regions where a one-size-fits all approach 
may not be applicable. Enforcement of the RadCARE Act would be achieved 
by restricting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement to facilities that 
employ personnel who meet the minimal federal standards.
  The RedCARE Act will improve the safety of radiological procedures by 
reducing the risk of harmful overexposure to radiation. Healthcare 
costs will also be lowered by decreasing the number of repeated 
procedures due to personnel error. Additionally, the RadCARE Act will 
enable radiologists and other healthcare professionals to have access 
to quality information so that patients receive the best health care 
possible.
  This legislation is supported by a variety of organizations concerned 
with the quality of these procedures, including the American Society of 
Radiologic Technologists, the Society of Nuclear Medicine Technologist 
Section, the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists, the Nuclear 
Medicine Technology Certification Board, the Association of Vascular 
and Interventional Radiographers, and the other members of the Alliance 
for Quality Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy, which represents the 
more than 275,000 medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals 
in the United States.
  When it comes right down to it, it's a big enough battle to fight the 
cancers or the injuries to our bodies that require such invasive 
treatments or diagnosis. We shouldn't have to worry about the level of 
competence of those who are providing us with the services we so 
desperately require for the maintenance of our health.
  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and passing this much 
needed legislation. It respects the power of the states who have 
addressed this problem as it provides minimum standards for those who 
have not.
  More importantly, its enactment into law will do a great deal to 
increase the level of confidence of the American health consumer in our 
healthcare system.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1197

       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
     the United States of America in Congress assembled,

     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer Assurance of 
     Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003''.

     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.

       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
       (1) More than 300,000,000 medical imaging examinations and 
     radiation therapy treatments are administered annually in the 
     United States.
       (2) Seven out of every 10 Americans undergo a medical 
     imaging examination or radiation therapy treatment every year 
     in the United States.
       (3) The administration of medical imaging examinations and 
     radiation therapy treatments and the effect on individuals of 
     such procedures have a substantial and direct effect upon 
     public health and safety and upon interstate commerce.
       (4) It is in the interest of public health and safety to 
     minimize unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to radiation 
     due to the performance of medical imaging and radiation 
     therapy procedures by personnel lacking appropriate education 
     and credentials.
       (5) It is in the interest of public health and safety to 
     have a continuing supply of adequately educated persons and 
     appropriate accreditation and certification programs 
     administered by State governments.
       (6) Persons who perform or plan medical imaging or 
     radiation therapy, including those employed at Federal 
     facilities or reimbursed by Federal health programs, should 
     be required to demonstrate competence by reason of education, 
     training, and experience.
       (7) The protection of public health and safety from 
     unnecessary or inappropriate medical imaging and radiation 
     therapy procedures and the assurance of efficacious 
     procedures are the responsibilities of both the State and the 
     Federal Governments.
       (8) Facilities that conduct medical imaging or radiation 
     therapy engage in and affect interstate commerce. Patients 
     travel regularly across State lines to receive medical 
     imaging services or radiation therapy. Facilities that 
     conduct medical imaging or radiation therapy engage 
     technicians, physicians, and other staff in an interstate 
     market, and purchase medical and other supplies in an 
     interstate market.
       (9) In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient 
     Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35) 
     which established minimum Federal standards for the 
     accreditation of education programs for persons who perform 
     or plan medical imaging examinations and radiation therapy 
     treatments and for the certification of such persons. The Act 
     also provided the States with a model State law for the 
     licensing of such persons.
       (10) Twenty-two years after the enactment of the Consumer-
     Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981--
       (A) 13 States do not require licensure of any kind for 
     persons who perform or plan medical imaging examinations and 
     radiation therapy treatments;
       (B) 37 States license, regulate, or register radiographers;
       (C) 28 States license radiation therapists;
       (D) 22 States license nuclear medicine technologists;
       (E) 8 States license or require board certification of 
     medical physicists; and
       (F) no States regulate or license medical dosimetrists.
       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
       (1) to ensure the accreditation of education programs for, 
     and the licensure or certification of, persons who perform, 
     plan, evaluate, or verify patient dose for medical imaging 
     examinations and radiation therapy treatments; and
       (2) to ensure the safety and accuracy of medical imaging 
     examinations and radiation therapy treatments.

      By Mr. DODD:
  S. 1198. A bill to establish the Child Care Provider Development and 
Retention Grant Program, the Child Care Provider Scholarship Program, 
and a program of child care provider health benefits coverage, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
Pensions.
  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Focus on 
Committed and Underpaid Staff for Children's Sake Act. I am pleased 
that Senators Kennedy, Murray, and Bingaman are joining me as original 
cosponsors and that companion legislation is being introduced in the 
House today by Representatives George Miller and Patrick Kennedy.
  The need for child care has become a daily fact of life for millions 
of parents nationwide. Sixty-five percent of mothers with children 
under age six and 78 percent of mothers with children ages 6 to 13 are 
in the labor force. Each day, 13 million preschool children, including 
6 million infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day in child 
care.
  The quality of that care has a tremendous impact on the critical 
early years of children's development. And, the most powerful 
determinant of the quality of child care is the training, education, 
and pay of those who spend 8-10 hours a day caring for our children.
  Yet, what we know about the child care field is alarming. Despite the 
fact that continuity of care is critical for the emotional development 
of children, staff turnover at child care centers averages 30 percent 
per year--four times greater than the turnover rate for elementary 
school teachers.
  We as a society say there is no more important task than helping to 
raise a child. Yet, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we pay 
the average child care worker about $16,500 a year--barely above the 
poverty level for a family of three. Few child care providers have 
basic benefits like health coverage or paid leave. Only a small 
fraction of child care workers have graduated from college.
  We pay people millions of dollars a year to throw baseballs, to shoot 
basketballs and to swing golf clubs. What does that say about our 
priorities when at the same time we pay those who care for our most 
precious resource--our children--poverty-level wages?
  A report by the University of California, Berkeley and the Center for 
Child Care Workforce on child care providers' pay, training and 
education highlighted the current crisis in the child care field. In a 
survey of child care centers in three California communities, the study 
found that three-quarters of all child care staff employed in 1996 were 
no longer on the job in 2000. Some centers reported 100 percent 
turnover. Additionally, nearly half of the child care providers who had 
left had a Bachelor's degree, compared to only one-third of the new 
teachers. Some 49 percent, nearly half, of those who had left their 
job, left the child care field entirely.
  It's clear that if we want to attract quality teachers to the child 
care field, the pay has to better reflect the value we place on their 
work. We can't attract them and we can't keep them if we don't pay them 
a living wage.
  The legislation I am introducing today will provide states with funds 
to increase child care worker pay based on the level of education--the 
greater the level of education, the greater the increase in pay. In 
addition, the legislation will provide scholarships of up to $1,500 for 
child care workers who want to further their early childhood education 
training by getting a college degree, an Associate's degree, or a child 
development associate credential.
  The legislation also includes a separate allotment to states to 
address access to health care coverage by child care workers. States 
would be free to develop their own creative methods to improve access 
to health care, but the intent is to ensure that an industry that works 
with children--who as many parents know, often come down with a variety 
of illnesses, particularly preschool age children--would have greater 
access to comprehensive and affordable health care coverage.
  We will never make significant strides in improving the quality of 
child care in this Nation if we fail to address one of the leading 
problems--attracting and retaining a quality child care workforce. It 
is time to invest in our children by investing in those who dedicate 
their lives to caring for our children.
  I ask unanimous consent to print a short summary of the bill 
following my remarks.
  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

  the focus act: focus on committed and underpaid staff or children's 
                                sake act

       Background: According to the Department of Labor, the 
     average wage for a child care provider is $8.16 an hour--
     $16,980 per year. Despite the important role child care 
     providers play in early childhood development and learning, 
     child care providers earn less than bus drivers ($29,430), 
     barbers ($21,190), and janitors ($19,800). The turnover rate 
     in the child care field is high--30 percent. But, to offer 
     compensation to attract and retain high quality staff, child 
     care programs would be required to charge fees that many 
     parents would not be able to afford. Current law 
     reimbursement rates, which are woefully inadequate for 
     center-based and family day care homes already shut out too 
     many parents from the child care market.
       The FOCUS Act: The purpose of the FOCUS Act is to establish 
     a Child care Provider Retention and development Grant 
     Program, a Child Care Provider Scholarship Program, and to 
     improve access to health coverage by child care workers and 
     their dependents in order to reward and promote retention of 
     committee, quality child care providers.
       Child Care Provider Retention and Development Grant 
     Program: The FOCUS Act provides grants to states to 
     supplement the

[[Page S7492]]

     wages of full-time child care workers who have a child 
     development associate (CDA) credential by at least $1,000. A 
     child care worker who has a Bachelors Degree in child 
     development or early child education shall receive a grant of 
     at least twice as much as grants made to providers who have 
     an Associates degree in the area of child development or 
     early child education. Grants to providers with an AA degree 
     shall be at least 150 percent of grants made to those with a 
     CDA. States shall provide grants in progressively larger 
     dollar amounts to child care providers to reflect the number 
     of years worked as a child care provider.
       Child Care Provider Scholarships: The FOCUS Act provides 
     grants to states for child care providers who have been 
     employed for at least a year in the child care field--maximum 
     grant is $1,500, to further staff education and training. 
     FOCUS Act scholarships are not counted against other federal 
     education aid.
       Health Care Coverage for Child Care Providers: The FOCUS 
     Act provides grants to states to provide better access to 
     health coverage for child care workers. States retain a great 
     deal of flexibility in determining how they will improve 
     access to health care and health coverage by child care 
     providers.
       Funding: For FY 2004, the FOCUS Act authorizes $500 million 
     for wage and scholarship initiatives and $200 million for 
     health care initiatives. Such sums are authorized for fiscal 
     years 2005-2008.
       Of the $500 million for wage and scholarship initiatives, 
     67.5 percent is for grants to attract and retain a quality 
     child care workforce and 22.5 percent is for scholarships to 
     promote a child care workforce better educated on childhood 
     development.
       Set-aside: 3 percent for Indian Tribes and tribal 
     organizations.
       Funding formula: based on the number of children under age 
     5 and the percentage of children receiving free or reduced 
     price lunches. 90/10 funding 1st year; 85/15 funding 2nd 
     year; 80/20 funding 3rd year; 75/25 funding fourth and 
     subsequent years.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. McCain):
  S. 1199. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the 
outreach activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that 
will help to ensure that all of our veterans know about Federal 
benefits to which they may be entitled by improving outreach programs 
conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs.
  I am please to be joined in this effort by the Senator from Arkansas, 
Mrs. Lincoln, and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.
  Three years ago, the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, WDVA, 
launched a statewide program called ``I Owe You.'' Under the direction 
of Secretary Ray Boland, the program encourages veterans to apply, or 
to re-apply, for benefits that they earned from their service in the 
United States military.
  As part of this program, WDVA has sponsored six events around 
Wisconsin called ``Supermarkets of Veterans Benefits'' at which 
veterans can begin the process of learning whether they qualify for 
Federal benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. These 
events, which are based on a similar program in Georgia, supplement the 
work of Wisconsin's County Veterans Service Officers and veterans 
service organizations by helping our veterans to reconnect with the VA 
and to learn more about services and benefits for which they may be 
eligible. More than 11,000 veterans and their families have attended 
the supermarkets, which include information booths with representatives 
from WDVA, VA, and veterans service organizations, as well as a variety 
of Federal, State, and local agencies. I was proud to have members of 
my staff speak with veterans and their families at a number of these 
events. These events have helped veterans and their families to learn 
about numerous topics, including health care, how to file a disability 
claim, and pre-registration for internment in veterans cemeteries.
  The Institute for Government Innovation at Harvard University's 
Kennedy School of Government recognized the ``I Owe You'' program by 
naming it a semi-finalist for the 2002 Innovations in American 
Government Award. The program was also featured in the March/April 2003 
issue of Disabled American Veterans Magazine.
  The State of Wisconsin is performing a service that is clearly the 
obligation of the VA. These are Federal benefits that we owe to our 
veterans and it is the Federal Government's responsibility to make sure 
that they receive them. The VA has a statutory obligation to perform 
outreach, and current budget pressures should not be used as an excuse 
to halt or reduce these efforts.
  The legislation that I am introducing today was spurred by the 
overwhelming response to the WDVA's ``I Owe You'' program and the 
supermarkets of veterans benefits. If more than 11,000 Wisconsin 
veterans are unaware of benefits that may be owed to them, it is 
troubling to think how many veterans around our country are also 
unaware of them. We can and should do better for our veterans, who 
selflessly served our country and protected the freedoms that we all 
cherish. And it is important to address gaps in the VA's outreach 
program as we welcome home and prepare to enroll into the VA system the 
tens of thousands of dedicated military personnel who are serving in 
Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places around the globe.
  In order to help to facilitate consistent implementation of VA's 
outreach responsibilities around the country, my bill would create a 
statutory definition of the term ``outreach.''
  My bill also would help to improve outreach activities performed by 
the VA in three ways. First, it would create separate funding line 
items for outreach activities within the budgets of the VA and its 
agencies, the Veterans Health Administration, the Veterans Benefits 
Administration, and the National Cemetery Administration. Currently 
funding for outreach is taken from the general operating expenses for 
these agencies. These important programs should have a dedicated 
funding source instead of being forced to compete for scarce funding 
with other crucial VA programs.
  I have long supported efforts adequately fund VA programs. We can and 
should do more to provide the funding necessary to ensure that our 
brave veterans are getting the health care and other benefits that they 
have earned in a timely manner and without having to travel long 
distances or wait more than a year to see a doctor or to have a claim 
processed.
  Secondly, the bill would create an intra-agency structure to require 
the Office of the Secretary, the Office of Public Affairs, the VBA, the 
VHA, and the NCA to coordinate outreach activities. By working more 
closely together, the VA components would be able to consolidate their 
efforts, share proven outreach mechanisms, and avoid duplication of 
effort that could waste scarce funding.
  Finally, the bill would ensure that the VA can enter into cooperative 
agreements with State Departments of Veterans Affairs regarding 
outreach activities and would give the VA grant-making authority to 
award funds to State Departments of Veterans Affairs for outreach 
activities such as the WDVA's ``I Owe You Program.'' Grants that are 
awarded to State departments under this program could be used to 
enhance outreach activities and to improve activities relating to 
veterans claims processing, which is a key component of the VA benefits 
process. State departments that receive grants under this program may 
choose to award portions of their grants to local governments, other

      By Mr. GRAHAM of South Carolina (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. 
        Bunning, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Roberts, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Smith, Ms. 
        Landrieu, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Daschle, and Mrs. 
        Lincoln):
  S. 1201. A bill to promote healthy lifestyles and prevent unhealthy, 
risky behaviors among teenage youth; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions.
  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am happy to be joining my 
colleague Senator Lindsey Graham in introducing the YMCA Healthy Teen 
Act. Senator Graham and I are introducing this bill along with Senators 
Bunning, Corzine, Daschle, DeWine, Durbin, Landrieu, Lincoln, Murray, 
Roberts, and Smith. This bipartisan legislation will address a critical 
issue for our Nation's future: the health of our children.
  Unfortunately, there has been an alarming trend in recent years 
towards increased obesity in our Nation's youth. On average, America's 
young people spend 4 hours a day watching television, 1 and \1/2\ hours 
a day listening to music, 30 minutes watching videos, and 20 minutes 
playing video games. Only 13 percent of students walk or bike to 
school. Only one State, Illinois, requires daily physical education in 
schools. The Surgeon General has reported that 13 percent of children 
and adolescents are overweight, more than double the number who were 
overweight in 1970.
  We are rapidly becoming a country of the unfit, the inactive, and the 
unhealthy--and our young people are suffering the consequences of a 
sedentary lifestyle. If ignored, obesity in children leads to obesity 
in adulthood--and the numerous health problems that come with it 
including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and cancer. These five diseases alone account for 
more than two-thirds of all deaths in the United States, and caring for 
them comes at a tremendous cost to society--close to $117 billion 
annually.
  On top of the need for increased physical activity and healthier 
lifestyles, the evidence is all around us that our young people today 
also need some extra care and support. Kids today face challenges and 
obstacles that I never dreamed about when I was growing up in Regent. 
Although recent promising evidence show that rates of smoking, drinking 
and the use of illegal drugs among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders fell 
simultaneously in 2002, still half of all high school seniors have 
reported using illicit drugs at least once in their lifetime.
  These challenges arise in part from the temptations kids face when 
they have too much idle time on their own. Every day, millions of 
American teens are left unsupervised after school. Studies have shown 
that teens left unsupervised during those hours are more likely to 
smoke, drink alcohol, engage in sexual activity, and become involved in 
delinquent behavior than teens who participate in structured, 
supervised afterschool activities. Also, nearly 80 percent of teens who 
are involved in afterschool activities are A or B students, while only 
half of those who are not involved earn those grades.
  To address these crucial issues facing America's youth, I propose we 
turn to an exemplary organization dedicated to improving kids' lives, 
the YMCA. Nearly 2.4 million teenagers--1 out of every 10--are involved 
in a program offered by their local YMCA. In 2001, total membership 
rolls reached their highest level in history, with 18.3 million men, 
women, and children--half of them under 18--receiving a vast range of 
services from their local YMCAs.

  In the past year and a half, I visited three of the six YMCAs that 
serve

[[Page S7494]]

North Dakota teens. Through programs focused on education, healthy 
lifestyles, physical activity, leadership, and service learning, these 
North Dakota YMCAs helped 12,500 teens in my State develop character, 
build confidence, and become healthier within the last year alone.
  I have seen firsthand what a difference a safe, structured, and 
healthy afterschool environment can make for our youth. In those 
communities in North Dakota and across the country, the YMCA is a place 
to learn, a place to play sports, a place to meet friends, and a place 
to simply shed the problems that youths face every day in school and at 
home and just have some fun. North Dakota teens embrace the countless 
opportunities presented to them at their YMCAs with enthusiasm, and I 
have no doubt they are not alone.
  While the YMCA is national in scope, they are local in control and 
every program is designed and evaluated to meet the communities' unique 
needs. I am confident that this bill will help the YMCA to reach more 
teens and continue to provide successful solutions for our Nation's 
teens and families.
  To serve more teens in need of healthier lifestyles and safe and 
structured afterschool programs, the YMCA has set the goal of doubling 
the number of teens served to one in five teens by 2005. This ambitious 
campaign is called the Teen Action Agenda.
  The bill that Senator Graham and I offer today provides funding to 
help the YMCA reach teens who need safe and structured activities that 
will promote physical activity and healthy lifestyles. This piece of 
legislation authorizes Federal appropriations of $20 million per year 
for fiscal years 2004 through 2008 for the YMCA to implement its Teen 
Action Agenda. This funding would in turn be distributed to local YMCAs 
that are located in all 50 States and the District of Columbia. Similar 
legislation was passed in the 105th Congress for the Boys and Girls 
Club and in the 106th Congress for the Police Athletic League to aid in 
their efforts to reach out to youth.
  Each program funded through this initiative would include physical 
activity and nutritional education components, and could also focus on 
other health risks faced by teenage youths, such as tobacco, drugs, and 
risky behaviors that lead to injury and violence.
  This bill will encourage public-private partnerships and leverage 
additional funding for teen programs. It contains a matching component 
that will be met by the YMCA through local and private support. The 
YMCA in 2001 raised $777 million in public contributions, double the 
annual contribution levels of a decade ago, and continues to grow and 
gain support from communities for its work. The matching component, 
along with the support the YMCA programs receive from national 
corporate sponsors, will turn $20 million in Federal funds into $50 
million that will be invested in proven programs that serve teens who 
are most in need.
  Adolescence is an opportune time to instill in children positive 
eating habits and exercise routines that will carry over into 
adulthood. The YMCA is an established and proven organization that is 
in the position to reach out and influence thousands of teenagers. This 
legislation is an opportunity for us to do something for the health of 
our Nation's teenagers, when they now face greater risks and challenges 
than ever before. Again, for the sake of our children's future, I urge 
my Senate colleagues to join Senator Graham and me in cosponsoring this 
piece of legislation.
                                 ______
                                 
      By Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Bingaman and Mr. Campbell):
  S. 1203. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding 
distance education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions.
  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, one of the great benefits of the revolution 
in information technology has been its effect on education. With the 
information superhighway and the number of online research and 
information sources it has made available, modern technology and higher 
education have become inseparable.
  The notion of distance learning and the access it provides to 
students--especially those in rural areas--could use a little more 
support, however, so that is why I am introducing the Distance Learning 
and Online Education Act of 2003.
  This legislation builds on principles already found in the Higher 
Education Act to help reach populations that have traditionally been 
excluded from attending institutions of higher education.
  Wyoming is a very rural State. There is only one four year school in 
the entire State, and there are only seven community colleges. If you 
include the University of Wyoming's satellite campuses, that adds up to 
nine institutions of higher education in an area of nearly one hundred 
thousand square miles. By contrast, there are one hundred twenty nine 
institutions of higher education in the State of Massachusetts, which 
makes up an area roughly one tenth the size of Wyoming. In fact, the 
only State that has fewer institutions of higher education is Alaska.
  Expanding access to higher education for our rural communities has 
been a challenge for many years. Now, the Internet has made it possible 
for prospective students in rural communities, far removed from the 
university campus, to attend college online. They may now spend their 
time studying, rather than commuting back and forth between school.
  At present, the most significant barriers that distance learners and 
online education programs must face are those that were created by the 
Higher Education Act. Under current law, students attending 
institutions that enroll more than half of their students in distance 
programs are ineligible for Federal student financial assistance. As a 
result, many of the communities that this assistance is designed to 
reach have been excluded from sharing in its benefits, including 
students from rural communities, single mothers, working professionals, 
and a range of others who are interested in attending college but who 
cannot afford to do so.
  The legislation that I introduce today corrects this problem by 
creating an avenue for online and distance educators to reach out to 
rural communities and non-traditional students by making them eligible 
for federal student assistance. It creates an eligibility standard for 
these institutions that helps to ensure they will provide high quality 
education programs, while it also protects Federal funding from fraud 
and abuse.
  The Distance Learning and Online Education Act ensures students will 
receive a high quality education by requiring online educators to 
become accredited by an agency that has an appropriate focus on 
distance education. As provided under current law, the accrediting body 
must also be recognized by the Secretary of Education as an agency that 
can determine the institution's eligibility under Title IV of the 
Higher Education Act. This is a slightly higher standard than is 
expected of the brick and mortar institutions that have been entrusted 
with Title IV funding since the Higher Education Act was originally 
passed.
  My bill will also protect against any fraud and abuse of Title VI 
funds by requiring distance educators to demonstrate their financial 
responsibility. In addition to meeting the default rates already 
established in current law, institutions interested in becoming 
eligible must also have a record free from audit findings or program 
review findings resulting in significant penalties for a period of at 
least two years. Distance learning institutions must also show that 
they have not had their participation in Title IV limited, suspended or 
terminated during the previous five years, and they must create a 
system of assurances that the student participating in the program is 
the individual completing the work.
  It is clear that the shape of higher education in this country is 
changing and it will never be the same again. We have an opportunity, 
through technology, to reach student populations that have been 
excluded from participation in higher education because they cannot 
afford to attend or travel to classrooms or campuses located many miles 
from their homes. We can change part of the equation by changing the 
way we view those programs that hold the greatest promise for non-
traditional students. Making them eligible for federal student 
assistance will go a long way toward making a higher education 
available to everyone with

[[Page S7495]]

the interest in learning and the determination to get the job done. The 
Distance Learning and Online Education Act of 2003 will provide a hand 
up--not a hand out--to those whose interest in a higher education is 
limited only by their resources. By offering them a helping hand we can 
eliminate that obstacle and help a new generation achieve their goals 
and live their dreams.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

      By Mr. CHAMBLISS (for himself and Mr. Miller):
  S. 1204. A bill to recognize the heritage of hunting and provide 
opportunities for continued hunting on Federal public land; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hunting 
Heritage Protection Act. With the introduction of this important 
legislation, we are able to acknowledge our Nation's rich heritage of 
hunting. The purpose of this bill is to pass that legacy on to future 
generations by protecting and preserving the rights of our Nation's 
sportsmen and women.
  In 2001 over 13 million Americans contributed over $20.6 billion to 
the U.S. economy while hunting--a true recreational activity. Many 
believe that in order to hunt you must own land, but that is not true. 
I believe that hunting should be available as a recreational activity 
for everyone.
  I have been an avid outdoor sportsman since my early adulthood. I am 
also an avid conservationist, like most other hunters. Mr. President, 
recreational hunting provides many opportunities to spend valuable time 
with children, just as I do with my son. He has been hunting since he 
was a young boy where he discovered and learned to appreciate one of 
the Earth's greatest treasures, nature.
  Over the years, hunters have contributed billions of dollars to 
wildlife conservation, by purchasing licenses, permits, and stamps, as 
well as paying excise taxes on goods used by hunters. Since the time of 
President Teddy Roosevelt, father of the conservation movement, 
sportsmen and women have been and will continue to be some of the 
greatest supporters of sound wildlife management and conservation 
practices in the U.S.
  Hunters need to be recognized for the vital role they play in 
conservation in this country. The Hunting Heritage Protection Act will 
do just that. This bill formalizes a policy by which the Federal 
Government will support, promote, and enhance recreational hunting 
opportunities, as permitted under State and Federal law. Further, the 
bill mandates that Federal public land and water are to be open to 
access and use for recreational hunting where and when appropriate. I 
should clarify and stress that this bill does not suggest that we open 
all national parks to hunting. As I mentioned, the goal is simple--I 
want recreational hunting on our public land to be available to the 
citizens of this country where and when appropriate.
  It is crucial that the tradition of hunting is protected and that the 
valuable contributions that hunters have made to conservation in this 
country are recognized. And, we want to ensure that Federal land 
management decisions and their actions result in a `no net loss of 
hunting opportunities'' on our public lands. This bill allows Congress 
to address this issue and to honor our Nation's sportsmen and women.
                                 ______

  S. 1205. A bill to provide discounted housing for teachers and other 
staff in rural areas of States with a population less than 1,000,000 
and with a high population of Native Americans or Alaska Natives; to

  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murkowski, I rise to 
introduce the Rural Teacher Housing Act of 2003.
  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that will 
have a profound effect on the retention of good teachers, 
administrators, and other school staff in remote and rural areas of 
Alaska and in the rest of our Nation.
  In rural areas of Alaska, school districts face the challenge of 
recruiting and retaining teachers, administrators and other school 
staff due to the lack of affordable housing. In one school district, 
they hire one teacher for every

six who decide not to accept job offers. Half of the applicants not 
accepting a teaching position in that district indicated that their 
decision was related to the lack of housing options.
  Recently, I traveled throughout rural Alaska with Education Secretary 
Rod Paige. I wanted him to see the challenges of educating children in 
such a remote and rural environment. At one rural school, the principal 
must sleep in his office due to the lack of housing in that village. In 
the same village, there is not enough housing for each teacher to have 
their own separate home--several teachers must share a single home. 
Therefore, there is not enough room for the teachers' spouses.
  Rural Alaskan school districts also experience a high annual rate of 
teacher turnover due to the dearth of affordable housing. Apparently, 
up to 30 percent of teachers leave rural school districts due to 
housing issues. How can we expect our children to thrive and to meet 
the mandates of the No Child Left Behind Act in such an educational 
environment? Clearly, the lack of affordable teacher housing in rural 
Alaska is an issue that needs to be addressed in order to ensure that 
children in rural Alaska receive an educational experience that is 
second to none and is also respectful of cultural differences.
  My bill authorizes the Department of Housing and Urban Development to 
provide funds to States to address the shortage of teacher housing in 
rural areas in Alaska and in the rest of our Nation. Specifically, my 
bill provides funds to States that have a population of 1 million or 
fewer people and include qualifying municipalities, which have 
populations of 6,500 or fewer people and also do not have direct access 
to either a State or interstate highway system. The appropriate state 
housing authority will accept such funds and will then transfer the 
funds to an eligible school district in a qualifying municipality. An 
eligible school district must be within the boundaries of an Indian 
reservation, one or more Alaska Native villages or land owned by one or 
more Alaska Native village corporations. This legislation will allow 
the eligible school districts to address the housing shortage in the 
following ways: construct housing units, purchase and rehabilitate 
existing housing units, or rehabilitate housing units that are already 
owned by a school district. Once this phase is complete, eligible 
school districts shall provide the housing to teachers or other school 
staff under terms agreed upon by the school district and the teacher or 
other staff.
  It is imperative that we address this important issue immediately and 
allow the flexibility for the disbursement of funds to be handled at 
the local level. The quality of education of our rural children is at 
stake.
  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the 
Record.
  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

                                S. 1205
