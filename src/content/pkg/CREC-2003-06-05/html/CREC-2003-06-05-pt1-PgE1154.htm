                      IN TRIBUTE TO MICHELE MILLER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ELIOT L. ENGEL

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a woman who believes 
that public education is the foundation of a prosperous and democratic 
society. Michele Miller always wanted to be a teacher. As a student at 
Spring Valley Senior High School, Michele was a member of Future 
Teachers of America. Graduating from the State University of New York 
at Albany, she attended Hunter College for a masters degree in 
education with a concentration in social studies.
  A lifelong New Yorker, Michele has spent her entire career teaching 
the students of Pearl River, New York. She has spent 33 years teaching 
social studies at the Pearl River School District's Middle School and 
High School. Michele began as a student teacher in Pearl River when 
Lyndon Johnson was the President of the United States in the fall of 
1968. She will end her career this month, eight Presidents later and 
after providing thousands of her students with the knowledge and 
appreciation of the democratic values that underpin our great country.
  Michele is the epitome of a great teacher. Although she's known 
throughout Pearl River as one of the toughest teachers around, she's 
also known for being caring, compassionate, and funny. She thrives on 
being in the classroom, the students have always kept her youthful in 
both appearance and in personality. Moreover, she constantly learns 
from her students and hopes that they leave the classroom every day 
knowing a bit more about the world.
  I hope that new teachers are inspired by Michele's dedication to 
teaching. She will be sorely missed by the Pearl River School District.
  I would like to join the Pearl River community, her family and 
friends in thanking Michele for her years of service and wishing her 
congratulations on the occasion of her retirement.
