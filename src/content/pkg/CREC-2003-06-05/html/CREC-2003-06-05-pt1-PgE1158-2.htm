REINTRODUCTION OF THE REVITALIZING CITIES THROUGH PARKS ENHANCEMENT ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mrs. MALONEY. Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce legislation, the 
``Revitalizing Cities Through Parks Enhancement Act,'' that would 
establish a $10 million grant program for qualified, non-profit, 
community groups, allowing them to lease municipally-owned vacant lots 
and transform these areas into parks.
  These vacant lots often are areas of heavy drug-trafficking. Parks 
and gardens created with the grants will not only provide safe places 
to gather, but will increase property values as well. The grants will 
be available from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to 
groups who have met standards of financial security, and who have 
histories of serving their communities. To further ensure that these 
grants are used to make lasting positive changes, land improved and 
made into open community space under this legislation must be available 
for use as open space from the local government for at least seven 
years.
