                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to pay tribute to Mr. Johnny 
Albino, who will be honored this weekend as Yaucano del Ano 2003. Mr. 
Albino is a renowned singer and songwriter who has recorded more than 
300 records. He has traveled around the world sharing the gift of his 
music, in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, as well as places 
as far away as Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Egypt and Israel, among 
others.
  Mr. Albino was born in Yauco, Puerto Rico, on December 19, 1919. He 
was one of seven children. He went to school in Guayama, Puerto Rico, 
and planned to pursue law studies at the University of Puerto Rico, but 
in 1940 he enlisted in the United States Armed Forces. He served in the 
Corps of Engineers and studied to become a telegraph operator. During 
his tenure in the military, he also found a way to pursue his interest 
in music by forming a quartet and singing in U.S.O. sponsored events 
for servicemen. He served in the military for seven years, retiring as 
a Lieutenant.
  When he returned to Yauco, he formed El Trio San Juan with Chago 
Alvarado and Ola Martinez. They used to rehearse at a house on Tendal 
Street, on the way to Barrios Quebrada and Sierra Alta.
  During his musical career as part of the famous Trio Los Panchos, 
with Alfredo Gil and Chucho Navarro, Albino traveled around the world 
seven times and had the opportunity to perform with luminaries such as 
Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., Nat King Cole and Eydie Gorme. He also 
shared the stage with world-renowned figures like Xavier Cugat and 
Johnny Carson. He has been one of Puerto Rico's most talented musical 
ambassadors. He has been married for 43 years to Mrs. Maria Albino, who 
is also his manager.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Johnny 
Albino, an accomplished musician, for his achievements and for giving 
to the Hispanic community and to the world the gift of beautiful music.
