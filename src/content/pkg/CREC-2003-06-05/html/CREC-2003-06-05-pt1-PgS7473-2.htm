                   TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN CHARLES A. BUSH

<bullet> Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay 
tribute to an outstanding officer, CPT Charles A. Bush, on the occasion 
of his retirement from the Department of the Navy. It is a great honor 
for me to take this opportunity to thank Captain Bush and his family 
for his 27 years of distinguished and dedicated service to our Nation. 
Over the last quarter of a century, he has proudly and selflessly 
served his Nation in defense of freedom.
  Few of us can appreciate the true awe of the U.S. aircraft carrier as 
well as Captain Bush can. During his career he served the aircraft 
carrier community in many facets: naval aviator, engineer officer, 
maintenance coordinator, and most recently as program manager for in-
service aircraft carriers.
  During his tenure as program manager, Captain Bush oversaw the 
construction of the USS Harry S Truman, CVN 75, and Ronald Reagan, CVN 
76, the complete refueling and complex overhaul of the first Nimitz-
class carrier, USS Nimitz, CVN 68, the commencement of the second 
Nimitz-class carrier to undergo a refueling and overhaul--the USS 
Dwight D. Eisenhower, CVN 69, as well as the maintenance planning for 
the in-service carrier force at the highest possible level of 
readiness.
  His innovative concepts, motivational leadership, and personal energy 
have produced exactly what was required to support these national 
assets--dramatic streamlining of processes and organizations, reduced 
maintenance cost and cycle time, and a government and commercial 
workforce trained for and ready to take these concepts forward. The 
culmination of his efforts can be no better illustrated than by the 
successful surge of carriers in support of both Operation Enduring 
Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Captain Bush's son, Nicholas, now 
has the distinct honor to continue the family's great service to our 
Nation onboard the USS Nimitz. Nicholas is a naval flight officer 
assigned to VAQ-135, NAS Whidbey Island, WA, and was recently deployed 
in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
  It is my honor to recognize Captain Bush for his distinguished 
service to our Nation. As a veteran of World War II and Korea, I have 
the highest respect for those who serve in uniform, and I appreciate 
and honor all the men and women who have served, and continue to serve, 
in defense of freedom. Recalling our national anthem, to our veterans 
and Armed Forces, I say, we would not be ``the land of the free'' were 
we not also the ``home of the brave.'' My colleagues and I wish Captain 
Bush and his family continued success and the traditional naval wish of 
``Fair winds and Following seas'' as he closes out his military 
career.<bullet>
