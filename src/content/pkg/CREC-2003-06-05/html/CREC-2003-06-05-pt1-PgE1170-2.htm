              CONDEMNING THE ATTACKS AGAINST AUNG SAN SUU

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SHERROD BROWN

                                of ohio

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I condemn the attacks by Burma's 
brutal military regime against 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung 
San Suu Kyi (Chee) and her party, the National League for Democracy.
  The NLD and its members are the rightfully elected leaders of Burma. 
For 13 years the military rulers of Burma have suppressed their people 
and ignored the results of the 1990 elections.
  Burma's military regime must not be permitted to attack, murder, 
imprison, and torture its people with impunity.
  Now is the time for the United States to increase pressure against 
this regime. Now is the time for Congress and the administration to ban 
imports from Burma and freeze their assets.
  I am disappointed in the silence of the Asia Bureau at the U.S. State 
Department over the past month.
  While human rights groups have sought to bring to their attention the 
need to increase pressure on this regime, the Bureau has done nothing.
  Now Miss Kyi (Chee) is once again being illegally detained against 
her will, ``for her own protection,'' as the military has termed it. 
The Asia Bureau sticks to its indefensible position of doing nothing.
  Now is the time for Congress to act.
