                        HONORING TESS CARMICHAEL

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SCOTT McINNIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand before this body of 
Congress today to recognize a dedicated educator from my district. Tess 
Carmichael recently retired from Mesa State College in Grand Junction 
after teaching mass communications for over 30 years. We should all be 
inspired by the many years of enthusiastic service Tess has given to 
her students and it is my pleasure to highlight a few of her 
outstanding accomplishments here today.
  Tess began her education at Western State College, receiving four 
Bachelor's Degrees. She went from there to the University of Colorado 
where she earned her Master's degree in Journalism and Mass 
Communications. Tess found her way to Mesa State in 1973, and through 
the years her passion and dedication to her students has remained 
steadfast. Her impact at Mesa State spans the entire campus, as she has 
taught courses in business, theater, speech, English, and mass 
communications. Just think of the countless number of lives Tess has 
touched. She not only has lent her talents but also passion to her work 
and, by so doing, she has given her students an awesome gift--the 
opportunity to succeed.
  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand before this Congress today to 
express my gratitude and reverence for Tess Carmichael's many years of 
service. This is a chance to remind us all of the importance teachers 
play in guiding our youth and of the admiration and respect they 
deserve. Teaching is truly a noble calling and Tess Carmichael has 
answered that call. Thank you Tess, for your many years of dedicated 
and selfless public service.
