               WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION EXIST IN IRAQ

  (Mr. KIRK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. KIRK. Mr. Speaker, no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? We 
know to a moral certitude of such weapons. How do we know? Saddam 
Hussein told us. On December 7 of last year, he told the U.N. that he 
owned 30,000 chemical weapons, but he forgot where he put them. We have 
not even found the chemical weapons that Saddam admitted to the U.N. he 
made. There are over 500 WMD sites in Iraq, and we have inspected less 
than half of them.

                              {time}  1030

  Remember Dr. Hussein Kamel? The U.N. inspected Iraq for 4 years 
between 1991 and 1995 and found no nuclear program. Dr. Kamel then told 
us that 40,000 Iraqis worked on nuclear weapons, but our intelligence 
missed it all.
  WMD in Iraq, it is inevitable that a final chapter will be written in 
this story. As Paul Harvey would say, and then we will say, ``and now 
for the rest of the story.''
