                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. HILDA L. SOLIS

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Maria 
Elena Durazo who is receiving the 2003 Paul Wellstone Citizen 
Leadership Award for her outstanding service to the Hotel Employees and 
Restaurant Employees Union of Los Angeles.
  As President of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union 
(H.E.R.E.) Ms. Durazo has helped the union emerge as a vital force in 
the life of Los Angeles residents, representing over 250,000 workers in 
the hospitality industry in the U.S. In 1996, she also became the first 
Latina to be elected to the national leadership of the H.E.R.E. 
International Union and has long served as a role model for other 
Latina leaders.
  Ms. Durazo has worked tirelessly to obtain justice for the mostly 
immigrant-based union in Los Angeles, adopting a policy of bilingualism 
for its union meetings and newspaper. Furthermore, she has empowered 
countless bilingual employees to acquire positions and benefits they 
deserve. Under her leadership, the union has been widely recognized as 
one of the most active rank and file unions in southern California, 
striving to build valuable coalitions among community, church, 
academic, ethnic, and political organizations throughout the local 
area.
  Maria Elena has further advanced the Hotel Employees and Restaurant 
Employees Union by securing and improving citywide hotel contracts, 
increasing wages and benefits for thousands of hotel workers in 
downtown Beverly Hills and the Westside. Maria Elena now serves as 
National Director of the Immigrant

Workers' Freedom Ride, campaigning to improve immigration laws in the 
United States.
  With these accomplishments, it is fitting that she will receive the 
Paul Wellstone Citizen Leadership Award. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Ms. Maria Elena Durazo for her diligent work in 
improving labor conditions for the workers of southern California.
