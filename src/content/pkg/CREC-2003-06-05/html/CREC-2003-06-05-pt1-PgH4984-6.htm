                                TAX CUT

  (Ms. SOLIS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. SOLIS. Mr. Speaker, I also wish to rise and express my outrage 
that, in the passing of an irresponsible tax cut, Republicans 
deliberately prevented families with incomes under $26,625 from 
receiving a child tax credit.
  Here is a family that I represent in my district. They also happen to 
be a family that sent one of their sons to war. He is still in Iraq. He 
would not even qualify for a rebate. It is outrageous that 31 percent 
of California families right now will not be eligible for any tax 
credit, child tax credit. That is 2.4 million children in California 
alone, a State that I represent. In my district, one out of every four 
families will get no child tax credit.
  Families like this work hard, pay their taxes, are expecting to get 
some help from the government, and get nothing. They do not want a 
handout; they just want to be treated fairly. Yet somehow Republicans 
found $90 billion to give to 200,000 millionaire families. I do not 
even have one millionaire family that lives in my district.
  This is the wrong thing to do. We need to not declare a war on 
working-class people.
