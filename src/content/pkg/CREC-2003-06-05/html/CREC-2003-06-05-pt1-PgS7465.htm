                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2003

  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for 
hate crimes legislation. On May 1, 2003, Senator Kennedy and I 
introduced the Local Law Enforcement Act, a bill that would add new 
categories to current hate crimes law, sending a signal that violence 
of any kind is unacceptable in our society.
  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on March 21, 
2003. In Burbank, IL, an explosion caused by a powerful fireworks-type 
device damaged the 1989 Ford Econoline van of a Palestinian Muslim 
family and shook doors and windows of neighboring homes. The blast 
shattered the vehicle's windows and blew open the vehicle's door. The 
man who committed the crime is being held on bond and is being charged 
with arson, criminal property damage, and committing a hate crime.
  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to 
defend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law 
Enforcement Enhancement Act is a symbol that can become substance. I 
believe that by passing this legislation and changing current law, we 
can change hearts and minds as well.
