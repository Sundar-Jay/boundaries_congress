           THE CHILD TAX CREDIT: SUPPORTING FAMILIES IN NEED

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support of 
legislation to expand the child tax credit to working families left out 
of the tax bill that the President recently signed.
  Last week, the President signed a $350 billion tax cut plan, a 
package of large tax cuts that are weighted heavily toward America's 
wealthiest families, and that will do little to spur economic growth or 
reduce the Nation's jobless rates. These additional cuts are likely to 
further burden the economy's future with growing budget deficits and 
debt--spending the Social Security Trust Fund surplus and threatening 
essential programs such as Medicare.
  The most disturbing aspect of this legislative effort was the 
Majority's last-minute exclusion of a provision that would help nearly 
12 million children and their families to get the child tax credit. In 
their persistent efforts to cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, the 
Majority stripped this important provision from the final bill in order 
to make room for a dividend tax cut and other measures benefiting only 
those wealthiest taxpayers.
  For some time now, the Administration has maintained that all 
Americans deserve a tax break. However, this new law did not honor that 
promise, and the President should not have signed legislation that 
denies a promised child tax credit to the millions of families that 
need it the most and are the most likely to spend it.
  These families with children, earning between $10,500 and $26,625, 
are already working hard to make ends meet. Our immediate priority in 
Congress should now be to pass legislation that will correct this last-
minute injustice and provide these moderate-income families with the 
relief they deserve. Therefore, I support the legislation introduced by 
House Democratic leaders to accomplish this goal and benefit almost 3 
million children in my home State of California. I urge my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle to join us in helping those Americans in 
most need.
