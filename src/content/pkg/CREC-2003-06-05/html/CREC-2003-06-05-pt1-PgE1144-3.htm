  Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to an 
outstanding young woman from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. I am 
happy to announce that Jennifer L. Lewis of Sandusky, Ohio, has been 
offered an appointment to attend the United States Military Academy.
  Mr. Speaker, Jennifer's offer of appointment poises her to attend the 
United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming cadet class 
of 2007. Attending one of our Nation's military academies is an 
invaluable experience that offers a world-class education and demands 
the very best that these young men and women have to offer. Truly, it 
is one of the most challenging and rewarding undertaking of their 
lives.
  Jennifer brings a special mix of leadership, service, and dedication 
to the incoming class of West Point cadets. While attending Perkins 
High School, Sandusky, Ohio, Jennifer has attained a grade point 
average of 4.248, which places her first in her class of 152 students. 
During her time at Perkins High School, Jennifer has received several 
commendations for her superior scholastic efforts. Jennifer's 
accomplishments include being on the honor roll for all four years, 
placing third of fifty-four in the Greater Toledo Council of Teachers 
of Mathematics Integrated Math I exam and eighteenth of two hundred and 
four in the Greater Toledo Council of Teachers of Mathematics Geometry 
Exam.
  Outside the classroom, Jennifer has distinguished herself as an 
excellent musician, athlete and dedicated citizen of Sandusky. On the 
fields of friendly strife, Jennifer participated in Track and Karate. 
In addition to her athletic accomplishments, Jennifer is an active 
member in her community participating in Huron Township Conservation 
Club.
  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to stand and join me in paying 
special tribute to Jennifer L. Lewis. Our service academies offer the 
finest education and military training available anywhere in the world. 
I am sure that Jennifer will do very well during her career at the 
United States Military Academy and I wish her the very best in all of 
her future endeavors.
