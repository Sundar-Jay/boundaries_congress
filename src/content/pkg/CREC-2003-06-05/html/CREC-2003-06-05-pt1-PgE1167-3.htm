       HONORING THE GREECE LITTLE LEAGUE ON ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. THOMAS M. REYNOLDS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. REYNOLDS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
pay tribute to the Greece Little League of Greece, New York, on the 
occasion of its 50th Anniversary.
  Baseball has been America's pastime for over a century: a source of 
recreation and enjoyment for young and old alike.
  Fifty years ago, the Greece Little League was created to serve young 
boys and girls in the Greece community. Today, the League serves 1,200 
children and 1,000 families, and has extended its services to include 
softball and the Challenger Program, which allows physically and 
mentally challenged children to compete. The league provides a positive 
environment and a tremendous recreational opportunity for children of 
all ages and abilities.
  Over the last half-century, America's pastime has been shared and 
enjoyed by many in the Town of Greece, thanks to the Greece Little 
League.
  Mr. Speaker, I ask that this Congress join me in saluting the Greece 
Little League as it marks its 50th Anniversary.
