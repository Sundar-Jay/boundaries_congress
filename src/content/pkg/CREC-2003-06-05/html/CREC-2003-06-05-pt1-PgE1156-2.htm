                          HONORING COLE REVIS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SCOTT McINNIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, it is with a profound sense of pride that I 
stand before this Congress to speak about the actions of Cole Revis. 
Cole, a second grader in Grand Junction, Colorado, has shown more 
kindness and maturity in the face of adversity than most people have 
three times his age. Cole's father, a veteran of the first Gulf War, 
passed away this spring from skin cancer. Cole understood the 
sacrifices his father made in the service of our country and he is 
trying his best to follow his father's courageous example.
  Mark Revis, Cole's father, was a Staff Sergeant in the 143rd Signal 
Company of the Colorado National Guard for six years, having previously 
served for 14 years in the Army. Mark was forced to retire from the 
National Guard when he was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. He was 
later diagnosed with lung cancer and then skin cancer. Mark fought each 
disease and that same fighting spirit is evident in his son. He passed 
away in February, at the age of 44.
  After receiving a death benefit check from the government, Cole felt 
strongly that this inheritance should go to his father's fellow 
soldiers. While most eight year olds would have bought candy, Cole 
wanted to use his money in a way that would help others. So Cole 
decided his money would be spent buying care packages for United States 
troops serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to speak today about Cole Revis. His 
passion, kindness, maturity and heart are an inspiration to us all. 
Cole's optimism and understanding of the role and duty that his father 
fulfilled have allowed him to understand that while his father is gone, 
his actions will never be forgotten. I know that if he were here today, 
Mark Revis would be extremely proud of his son. Thank you, Cole. Your 
actions are a testament to the will and unyielding strength that 
America's youth represents.
