                     IN MEMORY OF MICHAEL J. HANDY

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. VITO FOSSELLA

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. FOSSELLA. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week New York City suffered a 
blow with the untimely death of Mike Handy. He leaves behind his wife, 
Edna Wells-Handy, and four daughters. He was 55.
  Mike served as Director of Veterans Affairs for New York City, a 
position he held under Mayors Ed Koch, David Dinkins, Rudy Giuliani and 
Mike Bloomberg. Professionally he had earned a great deal of respect, 
but it was his personal dealings with veterans, colleagues and friends 
that had earned him so much love. He will be very much missed.
  A veteran of Vietnam, he served as a ``Quick Reaction Team'' leader 
(with a rank of E-5) and was a .50 Caliber Machine Gun Instructor at 
Phu Cat.
  He was active in veterans affairs for nearly 30 years, acquiring more 
than 50 honors and awards from city, State and Federal levels. He was a 
member of the American Legion, the Catholic War Veterans, the Navy 
League, an honorary member of the New York Society of Military & Naval 
Officers, and a member of the Veteran Corps of Artillery.
  Mike led New York City's fight to save the Times Square Recruiting 
Station and then chaired a City/Army Corps of Engineers Task Force to 
facilitate its renovation.
  In 1991, he was appointed to the Operation Welcome Home Commission, 
which organized what was at the time the largest Ticker Tape Parade in 
the city's history. In 1995, he was the Mayor's representative for the 
``Nation's Parade'' NYC tribute to the 50th anniversary of World War 
II. He was the Mayor's representative for seven of thirteen ``Fleet 
Week'' celebrations in New York City.
  Without fanfare, Mike helped thousands of veterans. He did this not 
for credit but to help his comrades-in-arms who were in need. His is a 
loss not only for New York, but for the Nation as well. He will be 
missed.
