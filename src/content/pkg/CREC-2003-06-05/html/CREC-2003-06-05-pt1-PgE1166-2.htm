                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Stark and I rise today to honor Shiloh 
Baptist Church of Hayward, California and its pastor, Reverend Jesse L. 
Davis, Sr. on the 35th Anniversary of its founding.
  On September 5, 1968, a small group of Christians met at the home of 
Emmett & Bernice Mason to organize a church. The Reverend Jesse L. 
Davis accepted the charge and was installed as Pastor of Shiloh Baptist 
Church by Adolph Kelly, Pastor of Macedonian Baptist Church in 
Milpitas, California.
  Shiloh Baptist's first facility was shared with Indian Baptist Church 
on Arthur Street in Oakland. In its second year, Shiloh Baptist bought 
that building as well as the one adjacent. Additionally, an Assistant 
Pastor was ordained and appointed, the Reverend Porter Clewis. The old 
building was demolished in 1976 and a new one was dedicated in June of 
1978, along with the Jesse L. Davis Educational building. The 
congregation outgrew its facility once more, and moved to its present 
location in Hayward in October, 1992.
  Shiloh Baptist has been honored by the Southern Baptist Convention of 
California. Also, the Mass Choir has received the ``Church Choir of the 
Year Award'' at the 24th Annual Gospel Academy Awards. Sister Doria 
Cummins-Lewis was awarded ``Director of the Year.''
  Among the ministries Shiloh Baptist has organized are Angel Tree 
(part of Prison Ministry), Street Witnessing, Feeding Program, Tutorial 
Program, Singles Ministry, Sisters of Excellence Women's Ministry, 
Alpha & Omega Drama and Dance Troupe. Together they have changed the 
lives of many people for the better.
  Since its inception, Shiloh Baptist's rise has mirrored that of its 
leader, Reverend, Jesse L. Davis, Sr. Reverend Davis was born in 
Louisiana in 1937 and will celebrate his 66th birthday on June 11. He 
attained an Associate of Arts Degree at Merritt College before 
graduating the Bay Cities Bible Institute, both in Oakland. He later 
attended the Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary in Mill Valley 
and had an honorary Doctor of Divinity Degree conferred upon him by the 
University of Biblical Studies at Burbank, California.
  In addition to his guidance of Shiloh Baptist for the past 35 years, 
Jesse has been a Lay Evangelism School Teacher with the Southern 
Baptist General Convention of California, Vice-President and past 
President of the Baptist Pastor's and Minister's Conference of Oakland, 
Director of Christian Education for the Mt. Zion District Association, 
and Treasurer for the California Baptist State Convention.
  Finally as we honor Shiloh Baptist Church and the esteemed Reverend 
Dr. Jesse L. Davis, Sr., we want to thank them on behalf of the entire 
9th and 13th Congressional District for serving the greater Bay Area 
for 35 years. Reverend Davis and his wife, Sister Alma Davis, have 
shared their wisdom and been great community leaders. Due to their 
positive influence, their sons, Rev. Jesse L. Davis, II and Rev. Andrew 
Paul Davis have followed in their father's footsteps. Most of all, we 
thank them for their friendship and for their prayers.
  I take great pride in joining friends, family, and the congregation 
to salute Shiloh Baptist Church and its leader, the extraordinary 
Pastor Jesse L. Davis, Sr.
