                     RECOGNITION OF RALPH CLEMINGS

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. JOHN SHIMKUS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise before you today to recognize Mr. 
Ralph Clemings of Troy VFW Post 976, Illinois. Ralph recently presented 
two protective vests for the dogs of the Illinois State Police K-9 unit 
from District 11 in Collinsville, Illinois.
  Ralph came up with the idea after watching the K-9 units work in the 
aftermath of 9-11. He thought that since these dogs are now being sent 
in to risk their lives in dangerous situations, they should have the 
same type of protective vests that the policemen have. He then 
contacted the Illinois State Police and found out that the state didn't 
have enough funding in the budget to purchase any vests for the dogs. 
After hearing this Ralph set out to raise the needed funds to purchase 
the vests. It took him nearly 7 months, but he raised the money without 
ever asking anyone else for help.
  On April 27, 2003, Ralph presented two dog vests to Sergeant Fred 
Scholl and his K-9 partner ``DAX'' and also to Trooper Rampert and his 
K-9 partner ``Rogune.'' Ralph also noted that K-9 units have been used 
to save thousands of lives in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and most 
recently in Iraq.
  I would like to congratulate and thank Ralph for his hard work on 
this cause. This selfless act is a prime example of someone giving back 
to the community and the dedication that makes this country so great.
