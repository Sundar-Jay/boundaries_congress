                       A TRIBUTE TO DENNIS COOPER

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. EDOLPHUS TOWNS

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of Dennis Cooper in 
recognition of his outstanding accomplishment in this year's 75th 
Precinct Council Spelling Bee competition.
  Dennis is currently in the fifth grade at P.S. 306 in Brooklyn, New 
York. He received a third place award in the spelling bee.
  Mr. Speaker, Dennis Cooper has demonstrated that he is committed to 
his academic studies and is an excellent speller. As such, he is more 
than worthy of receiving our recognition today and I urge my colleagues 
to join me in honoring him and his accomplishment.

                          ____________________
