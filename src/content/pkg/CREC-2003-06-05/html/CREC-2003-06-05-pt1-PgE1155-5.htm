           TRIBUTE TO MR. AND MRS. DONALD WALLACE OF FLORENCE

                                 ______
                                 

                    HON. ROBERT E. (BUD) CRAMER, JR.

                               of alabama

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. and Mrs. 
Donald Wallace of Florence, AL. For 23 years, they have provided 
outstanding service to the American Legion--Mr. Wallace as adjutant and 
Mrs. Wallace as his assistant.
  Mr. Wallace began serving the American Legion as an assistant to the 
former adjutant and will be retiring later this month. As adjutant, Mr. 
Wallace was charged with maintaining both the records and activities of 
the group of over 1,000; however, he did not limit himself to those 
tasks. Mr. Wallace helped rebuild

the American Legion's reputation as both a veteran's advocacy and 
community service organization. Under Wallace's leadership, the post 
received state and national attention as a leader in supporting the 
Boys State Program, a program which teaches lessons of patriotism and 
civics to high school juniors. He also worked with the American Legion 
Baseball program and oratorical contests that offered scholarships to 
local participants.
  Although Mr. Wallace does not like taking credit for the success of 
the group, many veterans and families in the Shoals will tell you that 
without him the Legion would not be what it is today. Wallace simply 
believes that his work at the American Legion is just the continuation 
of work begun by an earlier generation, the original Legionnaires who 
established the post in 1919 and the World War I veterans who built 
their current hall in 1939. As adjutant, Wallace helped maintain this 
building that has been their home for 64 years.
  Mr. Speaker, I also want to pay tribute to Mr. Wallace's wife of 60 
years, Mrs. Ellen Wallace. As his assistant at the Legion, Mrs. Wallace 
filed paperwork and served with the Ladies Auxiliary during the chicken 
stews and other activities. Mr. Wallace credits her with making him the 
man he is today.
  Despite the irregular hours, low pay, and lack of prestige, both Mr. 
and Mrs. Wallace enjoyed helping many people during their time of 
service with the American Legion. They have dedicated themselves to 
their community, and on behalf of the people of north Alabama I thank 
them for their service and congratulate them on a job well done.
