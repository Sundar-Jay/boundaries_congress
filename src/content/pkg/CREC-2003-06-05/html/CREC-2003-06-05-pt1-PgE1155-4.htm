             PAYING TRIBUTE TO POLICE CHIEF LONNIE WESTPHAL

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SCOTT McINNIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to stand before 
this body of Congress today to pay tribute to an individual who has 
dedicated his life to protecting the American public. Lonnie Westphal 
of Lakespur, Colorado first donned the badge of a Colorado State 
Patrolman 29 years ago. This week he will retire from the force after 
an impressive career in which he rose in the ranks from a state trooper 
to the head of the Colorado State Patrol.
  Chief Westphal is one of those special people in our society who 
willingly put themselves in harm's way to protect the public. He knew 
he would never get rich in his chosen profession, but he also knew that 
some things, such as keeping our families out of harm's way, come with 
rewards not measured by monetary means. Thus, it is not surprising that 
Chief Westphal distinguished himself so honorably by serving on 
numerous boards such as the National Commission Against Drunk Driving, 
the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the State Patrol 
Protective Association, and many more.
  Mr. Speaker, our nation owes a great debt to Chief Westphal and all 
brave heroes like him who keep the peace at home. Because of his 
service, the state of Colorado is a better and safer place to live. I 
thank Chief Westphal for his service to his community, the State of 
Colorado, and this nation. All the best to you, Lonnie; enjoy your 
retirement!
