 CELEBRATING A LIFETIME OF ACHIEVEMENT AND THE LONGEVITY OF A LEWISTON 
                                LANDMARK

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. MICHAEL H. MICHAUD

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. MICHAUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share with you the 
wonderful story of Toni Orestis and her lifetime of achievement. Marois 
Restaurant, a Lewiston landmark since 1919, is closing on May 31, 2003. 
Started by Antoinette Marois Orestis' grandfather, carried onby her 
father Leon, and now run by Toni for more than 35 years, Marois is a 
first class restaurant that has anchored the downtown area of Lewiston 
for almost 85 years.
  Marois started as a lunch counter business and expanded over the 
decades into the full service restaurant that it is today. During the 
Second World War, the restaurant was open 24 hours a day, 7 days a 
week, feeding the shipbuilders and other workers involved in supporting 
the war effort from home. When Lewiston and Maine had a need, Marois 
was always there to meet it.
  Toni started working in the restaurant at the age of thirteen. She 
and her three sisters worked for their grandfather and father all 
through the years. In fact, no one knows the restaurant business better 
than Toni. Throughout the past 65 years she has performed every role, 
from starting as a helper, to becoming a server, then cook, and now 
owner and executive. Toni and Marois are an example of downtown 
Lewiston at its finest.
  Along with her remarkable work ethic and business acumen, Toni has 
also been there for so many people in the community. From baptisms to 
bar mitzvahs, from weddings to anniversaries, from office and 
retirement parties to Christmas parties, and yes for funerals too, Toni 
is always there with wonderful food and hospitality. So many people 
remember fondly the food, the dessert cart, the French and Greek menus, 
the formal and correct table service, but most of all, the genuine and 
generous personality that is Toni Marois Orestis. No one ever went away 
hungry and everyone went away with a smile.
  Now Toni, at 78 years young, is finally retiring. When asked if she 
wanted to keep working, she said ``Yes, but part time, maybe 35 or 40 
hours a week''. That is the true mark of dedication; a life lived 
purposefully and well. Mr. Speaker, please join me and the residents of 
Lewiston in congratulating Toni Orestis on her retirement and thanking 
her for all she has done for her community.
