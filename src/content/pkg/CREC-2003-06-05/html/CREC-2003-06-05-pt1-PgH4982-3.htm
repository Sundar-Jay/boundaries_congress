 INTRODUCING THE HONORABLE RANDY NEUGEBAUER AS NEWEST MEMBER OF 108TH 
                                CONGRESS

  (Mr. BARTON of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Mr. BARTON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to 
introduce to the House of Representatives the fourth member to 
represent the 19th Congressional District of Texas, the 236th Texan to 
serve in the House, and 9,833rd U.S. citizen to serve as a member of 
the House of Representatives, the Honorable Randy Neugebauer, born on 
December 24, Christmas Eve, 1949, graduate of Texas Tech University, 
High Plains citizen, small businessman, banker, home developer, and the 
winner of a historic vote, I believe, by 700 votes. He will say that 
there were more people in Lubbock that wanted to vote than wanted to 
vote in Midland, Texas. He now represents both the Permian Basin and 
the High Plains. We are absolutely delighted to have you. You join such 
former Texans, Presidents like Lyndon Johnson and George W. Bush, 
Speakers like Jim Wright and Sam Rayburn, majority leaders like Tom 
DeLay and Dick Armey in this august body.
  We are delighted to have you. Welcome to the United States House of 
Representatives.

                          ____________________
