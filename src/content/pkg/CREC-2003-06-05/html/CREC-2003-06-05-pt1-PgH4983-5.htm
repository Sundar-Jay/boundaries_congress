          LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME AMERICANS TREATED DIFFERENTLY

  (Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. GEORGE MILLER of California. Mr. Speaker, Erin Doyel asked the 
question, ``what about my kid?'' Her kid in this case is Adrienne. Erin 
works as a financial administrative assistant. She earns $12,675 a 
year. She goes to work every day. She is eligible for the child tax 
credit. In fact, she receives the child tax credit.
  But what she will not receive is she will not receive the increase in 
the child tax credit that was passed this year, which would mean $400 
to families with children who are eligible. But the Republicans made a 
decision that people like Erin and her daughter Adrienne will not 
receive it because they earn between $10,000 and $26,000 a year.
  These are families with children who go to work every day, but they 
will not be given the benefit of the tax cut, they will not get the 
increase in the child tax credit, they will not have an easier time 
supporting their family for all of the hard work they do at very 
difficult and low wages, because the Republicans made a decision that 
Erin and Adrienne will not be included.
  That is why Erin Doyel from Vallejo, California, is asking, what 
about my kid? Why are we treated differently than the rest of America's 
families?
