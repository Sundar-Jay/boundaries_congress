  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
recognize a longtime servant of Alamosa, Colorado, Lynn Weldon. Lynn 
has served the Alamosa City Council diligently for almost twenty years. 
In recognition

of his service, I would like to recognize his dedication and a few of 
his accomplishments before this body of Congress and this nation.
  People in Alamosa have long felt deep respect for Lynn's patience, 
his integrity, and his dedication. People have referred to Lynn, who 
served as a chaplain's assistant during the Korean War, as a source of 
tranquility in the face of battle. Lynn has proved this countless times 
during many years of public service, where he has calmly listened to 
others, and stood his ground resolutely on issues of principle, no 
matter how heated the debates before him.
  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize Lynn's long service to 
Alamosa before this body of Congress and this nation. I would like to 
join the rest of Alamosa in expressing my gratitude to Lynn for his 
dedication to his community. Lynn, our thoughts and our prayers are 
with you.
