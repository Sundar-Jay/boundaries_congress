                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to an 
outstanding young woman from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. I am 
happy to announce that Alisa L. Fellhauer of Port Clinton, Ohio, has 
been offered an appointment to attend the United States Air Force 
Academy.
  Mr. Speaker, Alisa's offer of appointment poises her to attend the 
United States Air Force Academy this fall with the incoming cadet class 
of 2007. Attending one of our Nation's military academies is an 
invaluable experience that offers a world-class education and demands 
the very best that these young men and women have to offer. Truly, it 
is one of the most challenging and rewarding undertakings of their 
lives.
  Alisa brings a special mix of leadership, service, and dedication to 
the incoming class of Air Force Academy cadets. While attending the 
Port Clinton High School, Port Clinton, Ohio, Alisa has attained a 
grade point average of 3.88, which places her 13th in her class of 161 
students. During her time at Port Clinton High School, Alisa has 
received several commendations for her superior scholastic efforts. 
During her first year, she received the Kiwanis Scholar Athlete Award. 
Her second year was marked by her being again awarded the Kiwanis 
Scholar Athlete Award as well as being inducted into the National Honor 
Society. Alisa went on in her senior year to maintain her role in the 
National Honor Society as well being selected for participation in a 
highly selective biology program.
  Outside the classroom, Alisa has distinguished herself as an 
excellent student-athlete and dedicated citizen of Port Clinton. On the 
fields of friendly strife, Alisa has participated in Varsity Cross 
Country, Varsity Basketball, and Varsity Softball. She is a three times 
Cross Country letter winner and served as the Team Captain her senior 
year. In addition to her athletic accomplishments, Alisa is an active 
member in her community participating in Key Club, Future Professionals 
in Medicine, National Honor Society, Relay for Life, and the Buckeye 
Girl's State.
  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to stand and join me in paying 
special tribute to Alisa L. Fellhauer. Our service academies offer the 
finest education and military training available anywhere in the world. 
I am sure that Alisa will do very well during her career at Air Force 
and I wish her the very best in all of her future endeavors.
