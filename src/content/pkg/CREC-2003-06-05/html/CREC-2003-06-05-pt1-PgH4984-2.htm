                   ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE PROCESS

  (Mrs. MILLER of Michigan asked and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, yesterday we saw a truly 
historic event as President Bush pushed the Israeli-Palestinian peace 
process forward. The road map to peace that President Bush has laid out 
has been accepted by the Israeli government, Palestinian Prime Minister 
Abu Mazan and other Arab leaders.
  In fact, Abu Mazan became the first Palestinian leader to denounce 
terrorism as a solution to the conflict with Israel; and, 
significantly, those words were spoken in Arabic for the entire Arab 
world to hear.
  Prime Minister Sharon also has helped move the process forward by not 
only continuing the dialogue but by taking concrete steps to show the 
commitment of the Israeli people to peace.
  This is all very promising, but now words need to be backed up with 
action. None of this would have been possible without the bold 
leadership of President George W. Bush. I praise President Bush for his 
efforts. This is just another example of the President's consistent 
message to the world that the United States is ready to lead the world 
in the fight against terrorism and in the pursuit of peace and freedom.
