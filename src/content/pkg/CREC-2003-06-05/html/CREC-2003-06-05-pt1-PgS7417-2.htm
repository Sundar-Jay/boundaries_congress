                                 prayer

  The guest Chaplain offered the following prayer:
  Let us bow together in prayer.
  Dear Father, we thank You for surrounding these Senators with such a 
great cloud of witnesses who have served in the seats of honor before 
them. We thank You for those who stood with courage during difficult 
days. We thank You for those whose wisdom guided our Nation through 
times of darkness. We thank You for the times when the Senate stood in 
unity in pursuit of justice when the world was threatened by the forces 
of evil.
  Dear Lord, we pray that You will give these Senators freedom from the 
encumbrances of business, of pettiness, and worry. Loosen them from any 
of the sins of prejudice or bitterness or anger that might entangle 
them. Give them the discipline to run with endurance the race You have 
set before them. Fix their eyes on You, the author and perfecter of 
sight. And fill them with Your spirit so that they will not grow weary 
or lose heart.
  Endow them with Your gifts of faith, hope, and love: Faith that You 
are the sovereign God, hope that righteousness will prevail, and love 
for You, for Your creation, and for each individual as a person of 
worth and value.
  In Thy name we pray. Amen.
  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. I ask the Democratic assistant leader if 
he will lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag.
