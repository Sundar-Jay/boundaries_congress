                        HONORING RENEE MULLIKEN

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SCOTT McINNIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today to pay 
tribute to a young woman from my district who exemplifies the positive 
attitude it takes to succeed in life. Renee Mulliken of Palisade, 
Colorado has known for some time that she wanted to be a gymnast. In 
fact, she began gymnastic classes at the age of three and has been 
competing in meets since she was 10. Her drive and determination 
escalated her up the gymnastic ranks, leading her to level nine, one 
step below the national level.
  While warming up on a trampoline for a high school meet, Renee under-
rotated on a flip and fractured her neck. The injury led to weeks in 
traction and several more in a stabilizing brace called a halo. The 
doctors told Renee that she would recover, but most thought her career 
as a gymnast was over. Renee set out to prove them wrong, and five days 
after she got the halo off, Renee was back competing.
  It took some time and hard work for Renee to achieve her previous 
ability, but I am glad to say she has recently competed in the level 
eight state gymnastics meet. Renee's favorite event is the floor 
routine, where she can express herself through her movements and choice 
of music. Renee has made it clear to everyone who doubted her that she 
will continue her gymnastics career despite the injury she suffered.
  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand before this Congress to recognize 
the accomplishments of Renee Mulliken. The hard work and determination 
Renee displayed should be an inspiration to us all. I wish Renee good 
luck in her gymnastics career and wish her the best in all of her 
future endeavors.
