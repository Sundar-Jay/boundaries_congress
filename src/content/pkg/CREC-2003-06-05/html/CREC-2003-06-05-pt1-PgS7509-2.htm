                                PROGRAM

  Mr. BENNETT. For the information of all Senators, the Senate will 
reconvene on Monday. On Monday, the Senate will resume consideration of 
S. 14, the Energy bill. The chairman and ranking member will be here 
and are encouraging Members to come forward with their amendments. In 
addition, we will continue to try to reach an agreement to limit 
amendments to the Energy bill. Next week, we will have a busy session 
as the Senate continues to make progress on this important legislation.
  As a reminder to all Senators, on behalf of the leader, I announce 
that the next rollcall vote will occur at 5:45 on Monday in relation to 
the confirmation of Michael Chertoff to be a United States circuit 
court judge.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

                          ____________________
