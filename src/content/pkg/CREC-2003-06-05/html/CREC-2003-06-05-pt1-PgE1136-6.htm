                TRIBUTE TO THE MOTHER BETHEL FOUNDATION

                                 ______
                                 

                          HON. ROBERT A. BRADY

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Mother 
Bethel Foundation as it begins its $20,000,000 campaign to preserve and 
celebrate the Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
Situated in my District, Mother Bethel is the first home of the African 
Methodist Episcopal Church. The land on which it sits has been owned by 
African-

Americans longer than any property in the United States. Founded in 
1794, Mother Bethel Church is the oldest incorporated African-American 
church in the country.
  The foundation has launched an ambitious effort to construct a new 
facility that will house an expanded Richard Allen museum, an 
interactive learning center, and archives focused on the story of 
Richard Allen. The ultimate goal of the Mother Bethel Foundation is to 
celebrate and affirm what the Church and its founder have meant to 
generations of Americans.
  In honoring the established Foundation, one must not forget to honor 
Mother Bethel's distinguished founder, Richard Allen, for whom the 
Richard and Sarah Allen Center is named. Richard Allen was a man who 
overcame tremendous obstacles to foster change for the betterment of 
African-American people. Born into slavery, Mr. Allen purchased his 
freedom through an agreement with his master.
  Rev. Allen eventually responded to a call to preach and became a 
regular preacher at St. George's Methodist Episcopal Church. Due to 
segregationist practices at St. George's Church, Rev. Allen founded 
Mother Bethel Church.
  While Rev. Allen is best known for founding Mother Bethel Church, he 
provided more to the African-American community. He was a critical 
member in the formation of the Free African Society, an organization to 
offer security and the benefits of association to Philadelphia's free 
blacks. He also joined with Absalom Jones to organize the Black Legion, 
a group of 2,500 men who defended Philadelphia against the British 
during the War of 1812.
  Mr. Speaker, Philadelphia is America's most historic city. But, 
Mother Bethel stands out as one of our most cherished sites. It is a 
privilege to recognize an organization with such an admirable goal. I 
ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending 
the Mother Bethel Foundation as it begins its campaign this Juneteenth.
