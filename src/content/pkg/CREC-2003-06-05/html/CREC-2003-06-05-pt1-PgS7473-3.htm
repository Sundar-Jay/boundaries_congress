             TRIBUTE TO COMPANY C 5TH BATTALION 112TH ARMOR

<bullet> Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I stand before you today in tribute 
of the Company C 5th Battalion 112th Armor currently stationed at the 
Pine Bluff Arsenal. Along with the people of my State as well as those 
across the Nation. I would like to offer my sincere appreciation and 
farewell to this group of 238 personnel that will be relieved of their 
duty at the Arsenal in a transfer of authority on June 11, 2003.
  This exceptional group of young men and women hailing from Arkansas 
and Texas came together in an unusual display of diversity in September 
of 2002 in order to provide extensive base security as a Chemical Site 
Defense Force. Under the creed, ``One flag, One Team, One Fight,'' this 
company is a combination of 169 men and women from five Army Companies 
in Northeast Texas, as well as 69 personnel from my home State of 
Arkansas. For those not schooled in the procedures of the National 
Guard, this interstate combination is rare. On top of this is the fact 
that within ``Tank Fantillery,'' which is the adopted nickname of the 
company, there is also an unusual mixture of tankers, infantrymen and 
an artillery battery. Under the direction of CDR Robert Eason, ``Tank 
Fantillery'' has shown their dedication, unity, and diversity as they 
have joined in the fight against terrorism by successfully fulfilling 
their protective duties at the Pine Bluff Arsenal Chemical Munitions 
facility. Now, coming to the end of their term of duty, I feel that it 
is appropriate for us to offer them our gratitude and congratulations 
on the completion of their objective.
  Later this month the transfer of authority will take place, and this 
group of personnel will be relieved of the protective duties that they 
have held for the last 10\1/2\ months. Such an occasion offers the 
chance to honor these men and women that display a level of dedication 
to their country that too few of us share. All of the world should be 
so lucky as to have such dedicated and honorable soldiers committed to 
their protection. It is with a warm heart that I salute these men and 
women and wish them luck in all of their future endeavors.<bullet>
