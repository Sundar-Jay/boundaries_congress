    COMMEMORATING LIFE, ACHIEVEMENTS, AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF AL LERNER

  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 122, S. Res. 
116.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.
  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:

       A resolution (S. Res. 116) commemorating the life, 
     achievements, and contributions of Al Lerner.

  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the 
resolution.
  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Alfred Lerner. 
Al, as he was called by those who knew him best, was a man of great 
success and wealth but also great compassion and charity.
  Al was born in New York City, graduated from Columbia College and 
proudly served in the Marine Corps as an officer and pilot from 1955 
through 1957. The son of Russian immigrants, Al Lerner had an amazing 
sense of patriotism and was so proud to accept the Ellis Island Medal 
in honor of his immigrant heritage and individual achievements in 2002.
  My personal relationship with Al developed because of the fondness we 
shared for the city of Cleveland, and Cleveland is a better place 
because of Al Lerner. His generosity was seen in well known ways such 
as his contributions to Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital, where 
the Lerner Research Institute was founded, and to the Cleveland Clinic. 
In fact, Al Lerner's $100,000,000 contribution to the Cleveland Clinic 
was one of the largest donations to academic medicine in the history of 
the United States. Al gave so much of himself to these institutions, 
serving as president and trustee of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and 
establishing the Lerner Research Institute at the Clinic to conduct 
research of new treatments for cancer, coronary artery disease and 
AIDS.
  Al Lerner also understood how important professional football is to 
the city of Cleveland, and due in large part to his business savvy, 
Lerner and his partner, Carmen Policy, were able to reestablish a 
football team in Cleveland. He was subsequently appointed chairman of 
the National Football League Finance Committee, and I am confident that 
the Cleveland Browns' 2002 playoff appearance, just 4 years after 
returning to the league, had a great deal to do with Al's leadership

and guidance. I am not sure Cleveland would have its Browns today 
without Al Lerner's dedication and determination.
  Despite his amazing success as the founder, chairman, and chief 
executive of MBNA Corporation, Al Lerner remained grounded. He helped 
raise funds through the company and the Cleveland Browns, for the 
``Cleveland Brown Hero Fund'' to aid families from the New York City 
Fire and Police Departments who suffered the loss of a parent in the 
tragic September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Al also answered 
President Bush's call in the aftermath of September 11, and was a 
member of the President's Foreign Advisory Board.
  Throughout his lifetime, many of Al's other achievements could also 
be observed in quieter ways that were never heralded. His dedication to 
his family was remarkable. He married his high school sweetheart and 
best friend, Norma. They shared 47 glorious years together and raised 
two children, Randy and Nancy. My wife Janet and I talked often about 
how Al and Norma seemed to love each other and genuinely enjoyed each 
other's company. Perhaps the greatest contribution that the two of them 
made was the strong example of a good marriage for their children, 
seven grandchildren, and anyone who know Al and Norma Lerner.
  I am honored to have known and worked with Al Lerner and am confident 
that his legacy will remain an example of hard work, philanthropy, and 
genuine kindness for generations to come.

  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 
resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to 
reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or 
debate.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  The resolution (S. Res. 116) was agreed to.
  The preamble was agreed to.
