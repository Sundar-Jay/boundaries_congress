                             HON. TOM UDALL

                             of new mexico

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2003

  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of S. 222, The Zuni Indian Tribe Water Rights Settlement Act of 2003. 
This legislation puts to rest long-standing water rights disputes 
between water users in the Little Colorado River basin in Arizona. More 
importantly, this legislation would also provide the Zuni tribe with 
the financial resources to acquire water rights in the Little Colorado 
River basin and to restore the riparian environment that existed 
previously at Zuni Heaven Reservation.
  Recently, a delegation of Zuni tribal leaders and members visited my 
office here in Washington. They told me that Zuni Heaven, a riparian 
area along the Little Colorado River, is central to the Zuni religious 
and cultural traditions and is the place where Zuni deities and 
ancestors have resided from time immemorial. This sacred riparian area 
is the home of the Kachina, one of the highest religious orders in Zuni 
culture, and was in historical times, a very lush riparian area with 
willow, cottonwood, cattails, turtles, and waterfowl.
  Ever since the 1877 Presidential order diminished the Zuni cultural 
homelands and established the current Zuni Reservation in New Mexico, 
the Zuni people have maintained the practice of making a pilgrimage to 
Zuni Heaven. Every four years, Zunis from western New Mexico trek over 
50 miles to Zuni Heaven, located in northeast Arizona, to perform 
religious ceremonies during the summer solstice period. This pilgrimage 
is very important because it helps sustain and rejuvenate Zunis' 
cultural and religious traditions.
  The Zuni Water Rights Settlement will help the Zuni people restore 
their sacred Zuni Heaven to the way it was as described in ancient 
traditional historical accounts. Furthermore, it will help them develop 
wetlands for water plants, birds and other animals so important and 
necessary in carrying on the Zuni Kachina religion.
  Considering the above, I strongly encourage my colleagues to join me 
today and support this very important legislation.
