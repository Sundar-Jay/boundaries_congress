                        PORKER OF THE WEEK AWARD

  (Mr. HEFLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Speaker, a children's health agency has reportedly 
diverted Federal funds to a study of the sexual predilections of aging 
men.
  Now, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has 
provided more than $137,000 for a 3-year study to provide the most 
comprehensive picture to date of the sexual behavior of aging men. The 
grants were sent in two fiscal years to the New England Research 
Institute to examine trends in a range of sexual behavior.
  Good grief, we talk about budget deficits, and we spend our money 
like this. We should be ashamed. This money was intended to help 
children affiliated with pediatric illnesses and diseases, not to study 
sexual habits of America's senior men.
  The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development gets my 
Porker of the Week Award.
