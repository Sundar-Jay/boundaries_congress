  Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to an 
outstanding young man from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. I am 
happy to announce that Cory M. Sinning of Van Wert, Ohio, has been 
offered an appointment to attend the United States Military Academy.
  Mr. Speaker, Cory's offer of appointment poises him to attend the 
United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming cadet class 
of 2007. Attending one of our nation's military academies is an 
invaluable experience that offers a world-class education and demands 
the very best that these young men and women have to offer. Truly, it 
is one of the most challenging and rewarding undertakings of their 
lives.
  Cory brings a special mix of leadership, service, and dedication to 
the incoming class of West Point cadets. While attending Van Wert High 
School, Van Wert, Ohio, Cory has attained a grade point average of 
3.81, which places him twenty of one hundred sixty-nine students. 
During his time at Van Wert High School, Cory has received several 
commendations for his superior scholastic efforts. Cory's 
accomplishments include being a four year Renaissance Card Holder and a 
member of the National Honor Society.
  Outside the classroom, Cory has distinguished himself as an excellent 
athlete. On the fields of friendly strife, Cory participated in 
Basketball where he earned his Varsity Letter and served as a team 
captain for three years. In addition to his athletic accomplishments, 
Cory proved himself a dedicated citizen of Van Wert through dedicating 
time to volunteer for Elementary Basketball Camps, Junior High 
Basketball Camps, YMCA, and Served as a Mentor for At-Risk Students.
  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to stand and join me in paying 
special tribute to Cory M. Sinning. Our service academies offer the 
finest education and military training available anywhere in the world. 
I am sure that Cory will do very well during his career at United 
States Military Academy and I wish him the very best in all of his 
future endeavors.
