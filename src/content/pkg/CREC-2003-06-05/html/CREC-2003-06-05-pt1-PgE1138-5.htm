   CONDEMNING THE ATTACK ON NOBEL PEACE PRIZE LAUREATE AND DEMOCRACY 
         ACTIVIST AUNG SAN SUU KYI AND HER COLLEAGUES IN BURMA

                                 ______
                                 

                            HON. CURT WELDON

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. WELDON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn in 
the strongest possible terms this weekend's violent crackdown on Daw 
Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy (NLD). The Nobel 
Peace Prize winner was concluding a month

long speaking tour in Burma. The NLD won Burma's last democratic 
election in 1990, however, Burma's military regime has refused to honor 
the election results. I'm outraged to learn that Ms. Suu Kyi may have 
been seriously injured and many of her supporters killed.
  I want to express my solidarity with the peoples of Burma and their 
struggle for democracy. As Ronald Reagan once said, ``Regimes planted 
by bayonets do not take root''. Now is the time for the United States 
to express our support for freedom in Burma.
  Mr. Speaker, we should immediately move to increase pressure against 
this despicable regime.
