                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Speaker, with yesterday's passage of H. Con. Res. 
177, we formally recognized and commended our Armed Forces for their 
participation and success in Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation 
Iraqi Freedom. Our magnificent men and women in uniform serve as the 
greatest ambassadors of what is good and right in our world. They are 
the bearers of the tremendous might, the indomitable spirit, and the 
boundless compassion of our nation and the freedom loving people 
everywhere.

  Our forces are, as they always have been throughout our history, 
Americans first, citizen soldiers, and great patriots. They have come 
from ordinary walks of life rising to do extraordinary things that 
shape our world and leave us forever awestruck. I again want to extend 
our collective and sincere thanks to all our members who serve, and I 
also want to recognize a particular group of truly unsung yet most 
deserving heroes--our U.S. Merchant Mariners.
  Once again, our country has turned to its mariners to take the fight 
to the enemy, to project our force half a world away, to secure the 
precious freedom that now spreads to an Iraqi people free to choose 
their own destiny, to raise their families as they choose, and to renew 
the glories of one of the world's greatest civilizations. Our 
liberating force was decisive and it moved on the brawn, ingenuity, and 
dedication of our merchant marine. Not in 12 years have we moved such a 
force by sea, and we have done it better, against greater challenge 
than ever before.
  We recently saw a line of ships spread from our east coast through 
the Straights of Gibraltar, through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, and 
into the Gulf of Oman--a ``steel bridge'' of resolve. A bridge as 
strong as those mariners who crew our enormous ships and who go on in 
harms way to deliver our force anyplace, anytime they are called.
  Since the beginning of the War on Terrorism, over 6,800 U.S. merchant 
mariners and civil servant mariners have served and provided support to 
our global military operations. Currently serving on 211 vessels, our 
U.S. mariners face many of the same hazards confronting our uniformed 
military as they regularly transit and operate within potential 
targeted areas of chemical and biological weapons, waterborne mines, 
and terrorist activities. Truly, our country's merchant mariners have 
answered the call selflessly and brilliantly.
  Our mariners activated and crewed 40 vessels of our ready reserve 
force, essential to the early movement of ammunition, tanks, aircraft, 
and military vehicles. These U.S. mariners crewed our vital 
prepositioned ships and our fast response surge sealift vessels, 
providing time-critical warfighting equipment and supplies to the 
battlefield. Over 4,000 civil servant mariners manned and supported the 
continuous worldwide operations of our ships supporting U.S. naval and 
coalition forces at sea. Around the clock, every day, across the globe, 
our mariners make it happen.
  At this crucial time in history, our U.S. mariners stepped forward 
with skill, bravery, and an unrivaled legacy of service. They made all 
the difference. Our nation continues to rely on these warriors, and 
their impact is profound. Long after the fighting stops, our mariners 
will still be on the watch, returning the troops, sustaining the force, 
and providing for the needy as we renew a proud but shattered land.
  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of our Congress and a grateful Nation, it is 
my humble honor to say thank you to all our U.S. Merchant Mariners. We 
wish them God Speed and a safe return. They are indeed a national 
treasure--long may they serve.
