                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay 
tribute to the people of St. Petersburg, Russia, on the 300th 
Anniversary of the founding of their grand city.
  St. Petersburg was founded by Peter the Great on May 27, 1703, and 
boasts an illustrious history, impressive architectural achievements, 
and a rich culture. Under the leadership of Catherine the Great, St. 
Petersburg became one of the cultural capitals of Europe.
  The people of St. Petersburg suffered greatly under the brutal 
regimes led by Lenin and Stalin. Following the death of Vladimir Lenin 
and under the iron fist of communism, the city was renamed Leningrad. 
The city suffered further when during World War II the German Army led 
the Siege of Leningrad on September 8, 1941. During this 900-day siege, 
over 600,000 Russian citizens died, but Hitler never prevailed to take 
over the city due to the valiant defense by its residents.
  Indeed, despite the devastation of war and the cruelty of communism, 
the spirit of the St. Petersburg people persevered. With the crumbling 
of communism, in 1991 the city reclaimed the name of St. Petersburg.
  In 1995 I saw firsthand the beautiful city reflecting the 
extraordinary culture of the ``Venice of the North.'' I was hosted by 
the parents of Maxim Kidalov, who in 1993 as a student at the 
University of South Carolina was the first Russian page to serve in the 
Senate of South Carolina. He is now a respected attorney in Washington, 
DC. Dr. Vladimir Nikolayevick Kidalov and Mrs. Lyudmila Mikhailovna 
Kidalova were gracious hosts, and they brought to life warm Russian 
hospitality.
  It is fitting now for all Americans to salute the achievements of the 
people of St. Petersburg and wish Godspeed for its bright future as a 
valued participant in the democratic family of nations.
