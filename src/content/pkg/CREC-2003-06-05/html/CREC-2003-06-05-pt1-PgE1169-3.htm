                       TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE PARKER

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. HAROLD ROGERS

                              of kentucky

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career 
of my friend and eastern Kentucky native Charlie Parker, president and 
CEO of Buckhorn Children's Foundation. Charlie is retiring after 21 
years of service to the children and families of Kentucky. It is only 
fitting to take this opportunity to recognize all that he has 
accomplished.
  Buckhorn Children's Foundation's mission is to alleviate the 
suffering of children and families and bring hope to otherwise hopeless 
lives in Appalachia. Through a variety of programs, Buckhorn has helped 
thousands learn about themselves, feel pride in who they are, and 
become successes in life. Although they actively seek out the most 
troubled of our youth, Buckhorn can boast of an over 70 percent success 
rate, which is far above the national average.
  Coming on board in 1982, Charlie took over Buckhorn's one residential 
campus with a budget of $650,000. Under his vision and leadership, that 
one residential campus has grown to three with a budget of $18 million. 
Its reach has extended beyond the hills of Eastern Kentucky into more 
urban areas. Without question, this would never have been accomplished 
were it not for the tireless efforts of Charlie.
  While we have taken much time recently to recognize our heroes that 
have defended our freedom abroad, we must also recognize our heroes at 
home. I know that the many young people that Charlie has positively 
affected consider him a hero, as do I. Thank you, Charlie, for giving 
young people one of the greatest gifts of all--a future.
