                        Wednesday, June 4, 2003

  Mr. GILLMOR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special tribute to an 
outstanding young man from Ohio's Fifth Congressional District. I am 
happy to announce that Geoffrey J. Wightman of Amherst, Ohio, has been 
offered an appointment to attend the United States Military Academy.
  Mr. Speaker, Geoffrey's offer of appointment poises him to attend the 
United States Military Academy this fall with the incoming cadet class 
of 2007. Attending one of our nation's military academies is an 
invaluable experience that offers a world-class education and demands 
the very best that these young men and women have to offer. Truly, it 
is one of the most challenging and rewarding undertakings of their 
lives.
  Geoffrey brings a special mix of leadership, service, and dedication 
to the incoming class of West Point cadets. While attending Firelands 
High School, Oberlin-Henrietta Township, Ohio, Geoffrey has attained a 
grade point average of 3.6, which places him eighteenth in his class of 
one hundred fifty-four students. During his time at Firelands High 
School, Geoffrey has received several commendations for his superior 
scholastic efforts. Nathan's accomplishments include being on the honor 
role, being inducted into the National Honor Society, serving as the 
Historian in the National Honor Society, and First Place in the Science 
Fair in the field of Engineering.
  Outside the classroom, Geoffrey has distinguished himself as an 
excellent musician, athlete and dedicated citizen of Amherst. On the 
fields of friendly strife, Geoffrey participated in Football, Wrestling 
in which he is a three year letter winner, cross country, and Track 
where he was again a three year letter winner. In addition to his 
athletic accomplishments, Geoffrey is an active member in his community 
participating in the Boy Scouts of America where he became an Eagle 
Scout, he has remained active in his Church, and an active member of 
North Coast Pipe Band, Buckeye Boys State, and a member of the 
Firelands High School class council.
  Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to stand and join me in paying 
special tribute to Geoffrey J. Wightman. Our service academies offer 
the finest education and military training available anywhere in the 
world. I am sure

that Geoffrey will do very well during his career at United States 
Military Academy and I wish him the very best in all of his future 
endeavors.
