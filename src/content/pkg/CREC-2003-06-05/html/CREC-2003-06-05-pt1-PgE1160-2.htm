     SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF PEACE OFFICERS MEMORIAL DAY

                                 ______
                                 

                               speech of

                            HON. BART STUPAK

                              of michigan

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 3, 2003

  Mr. STUPAK. Mr. Speaker, today the House of Representatives took up 
H. Res. 231, a resolution supporting Peace Officers Memorial Day, which 
took place on May 15, and honoring law enforcement officers who were 
killed or disabled in the line of duty. I want to thank my colleague 
Mr. Hefley for sponsoring this important legislation again this year, 
and wholeheartedly back this important resolution.
  Supporting law enforcement is very important to me. Before coming to 
Congress in 1993, I served for over 12 years as a Michigan state police 
officer for the Escanaba City Police Department. I was the founder and 
have continuously served as co-chair of the House Law Enforcement 
Caucus for the past 11 years.
  Since September 11, 2001, many in this nation and this Congress have 
come to realize the importance of the sacrifices made by our law 
enforcement officers. Every day law enforcement men and women protect 
and serve, often putting their own lives at risk. In Michigan alone, 
over 40 officers have given their lives in the line of duty over the 
past 15 years.
  Peace Officers Memorial Day brings us together in honoring the 
extreme sacrifice our nation's law enforcement and public safety 
officers make to our communities and our nation every day.
  I think it is important as we discuss this important resolution, to 
resolve to focus in Congress on providing the necessary funding and 
support to law enforcement in the growing challenges they face.
  I am hopeful that my colleagues will follow up on their support of 
this resolution, and continue our commitment to law enforcement by 
supporting these important funding needs. It is the least we can do for 
those who put their lives on the line every day.
