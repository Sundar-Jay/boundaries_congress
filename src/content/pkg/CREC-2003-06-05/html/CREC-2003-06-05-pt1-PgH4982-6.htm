 RECOGNIZING ANTONIO ARGIZ FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
                               COMMUNITY

  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today I stand in recognition of the 
wonderful contributions of a friend of the South Florida community, Mr. 
Antonio Argiz. Tony bravely journeyed to the United States from Cuba, 
without his parents, at the age of 8, thanks to Operation Peter Pan.
  Determined to live the American dream, Tony attended Florida 
International University, where he earned his accounting degree. 
Recognized as an expert in forensic accounting, he was the first Cuban 
American appointed by the Governor to chair Florida's board of 
accountancy.

                              {time}  1015

  Tony's passion for business is matched by his dedication to our 
community in South Florida. Tony serves as the cochair of the United 
Way of Miami-Dade and has served on the

passion in his every endeavor. He is a true inspiration and an 
exemplary Floridian.
  Gracias por todo mi amigo. Thank you, Tony.
