                         HONORING RUTH ZEMLOCK

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SCOTT McINNIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to stand before this body of 
Congress today to express my thanks and admiration for Ruth Zemlock, 
the winner of the May 2003 ``9 Who Care Award''. Channel Nine News in 
Denver, Colorado awards this honor to someone who strives to give back 
to his or her community through volunteering, something Ruth has 
succeeded in doing for over 14 years.
  Valley View Hospital in Glenwood Springs, Colorado is lucky to have 
such a determined and hard working volunteer; a woman who has done so 
much for the hospital that she has garnered the nickname ``Dr. Ruth.'' 
Her fellow co-workers explain that Ruth knows ``anything and 
everything'' about the hospital, because at one time or another she has 
worked in every department. Today, Ruth is working at the information 
desk and in outpatient surgery and is a member of the hospital's Board 
of Directors. To date, she has amazingly given over 11,000 hours of her 
time, about 458 days, to the care of others.
  Mr. Speaker, Ruth's hard work and determination have provided Valley 
View Hospital with an exemplary model of heart and kindness. Volunteers 
are an integral part of America's workforce. Each day, they make an 
impact on everyone around them. At the age of 85, Ruth's endless energy 
and enthusiastic spirit amaze all who know her. Thank you, Ruth, for 
your years of distinguished, honorable service. Valley View Hospital 
and Glenwood Springs, Colorado will forever be in your debt.
