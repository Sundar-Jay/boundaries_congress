                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. SCOTT McINNIS

                              of colorado

                    in the house of representatives

                         Thursday, June 5, 2003

  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand before this Congress 
and this nation to pay tribute to an outstanding volunteer and 
community member from my district. Nora Anzik is the recipient of this 
year's Volunteer of the Year Award given by TREC, the Therapeutic 
Riding and Education Center of Pueblo, Colorado. Nora's hard work helps 
children with disabilities experience the joy of riding horses, 
something they could not accomplish without her.
  Nora's enthusiasm, patience, and effectiveness became obvious in her 
first week at TREC. She began her work with a young autistic boy named 
Steven. Steven was not comfortable with some of the aspects of riding, 
and it was Susan's persuasive, positive attitude that helped him to 
adjust. Her work with Steven is just one example of the compassion she 
has for those in need. Nora continues to work with Steven and numerous 
other children, becoming a role model in many of their lives. She is a 
wonderful teacher, who knows how to get through to children with 
special needs.
  Mr. Speaker, great Americans like Nora, who volunteer their time, 
have helped to make our country great. I am proud of her 
accomplishments and it gives me great joy to inform this body of 
Congress and this nation of her outstanding community service. Thank 
you, Nora, for your hard work and dedication. Your commitment and 
involvement in the Pueblo community will not be forgotten.
