   CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY CONCERNING THE CORONAVIRUS 
  DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE 
                   UNITED STATES (H. DOC. NO. 117-18)

  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message 
from the President of the United States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Energy and 
Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means and ordered to be printed:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency declared in Proclamation 9994 of 
March 13, 2020, beginning March 1, 2020, concerning the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is to continue in effect beyond March 
1, 2021.
  There remains a need to continue this national emergency. The COVID-
19 pandemic continues to cause significant risk to the public health 
and safety of the Nation. More than 500,000 people in this Nation have 
perished from the disease, and it is essential to continue to combat 
and respond to COVID-19 with the full capacity and capability of the 
Federal Government.
  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the 
national emergency declared in Proclamation 9994 concerning the COVID-
19 pandemic.
                                                     Joseph R. Biden.  
The White House, February 24, 2021.
