                                 ______
                                 

                      REMEMBERING DR. SEAN McCAGH

<bullet> Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Sean 
McCagh, a Marylander whom we should all emulate for his selflessness 
and passion for helping others. Sean touched the hearts and lives of 
his family, friends, coworkers, patients, and the entire community of 
Allegany County in the western part of my State. Sadly, Sean was taken 
far too soon from his family and the many neighbors who cared so deeply 
for him due to complications of COVID-19. He leaves behind his wife, 
Terri, and three sons, Mike, Cory, and Casey.
  Sean was born and raised in Cumberland, MD. He graduated from Bishop 
Walsh High School and completed his undergraduate studies at Mount St. 
Mary's University. He earned his medical degree from Georgetown 
University School of Medicine and completed his dermatology residency 
at the University of West Virginia. He returned to the hometown he 
loved so well and joined his brother Mike's dermatology practice in 
1996.
  Sean was a man of vision who was never one to sit idly by. He 
volunteered his time as the athletic physician for Allegany High School 
for several years and later established a community fundraiser known as 
the Hooley Plunge to support the ice rink at the local YMCA. When the 
YMCA closed the ice rink, Sean redirected his efforts to another cause 
close to his heart, people with developmental disabilities. With Sean 
as its champion for 17 years, the Hooley Plunge has raised more than 
$1.5 million to support the Special Olympics of Allegany County and 
other local programs that serve individuals with development 
disabilities. It has become the largest single-day fundraising event in 
Allegany County, with hundreds of brave souls running into the freezing 
waters of Rocky Gap State Park's Lake Habeeb in return for donations.
  A few years ago, Sean received the Community Service Award from the 
Allegany County Chamber of Commerce, one of numerous entities to 
recognize his unwavering commitment to the greater good. Sean's sister, 
Erin McCagh Morrissey, has fittingly called him Cumberland's George 
Bailey, referring to the community-minded banker James Stewart played 
in the classic movie, ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
  While Sean loved his job as a dermatologist and was passionate about 
helping others, he also loved being a cattle farmer. When his middle 
son, Cory, graduated from college, Sean encouraged him to follow his 
dream to start a brewery. With Cory's vision and Sean's support and 
investment, they christened the 200-year-old barn on the family's farm 
as the ``1812 Brewery,'' which set the stage for a growing and mutually 
supportive family of small brewers to attract tourists and enhance the 
lives of local residents.
  While the people of Allegany County grieve the sudden, stunning loss 
of a cherished husband, father, friend, doctor, businessman, and 
community leader, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in remembering 
and honoring the life of Dr. Sean McCagh who, through his service and 
love for people, has left his community a better place.<bullet>
