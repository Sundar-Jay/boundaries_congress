                            HON. JOHN JOYCE

                            of pennsylvania

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Leslie 
Kelly of Altoona, Pennsylvania for her work as founder of Service Paws 
of Central Pennsylvania.
  Leslie Kelly understands firsthand the barriers that family can face 
when purchasing a service dog, which can cost between $4,000 and 
$35,000. To help families with this costly process, Leslie founded 
Service Paws of Central Pennsylvania. Last year, her organization was 
able to assist several people in need of a service dog.
  Service Paws of Central Pennsylvania now serves 14 of Pennsylvania's 
67 counties. As an all-volunteer organization, Service Paws of Central 
Pennsylvania is able to use its resources to directly place service 
dogs with individuals and families in need.
  Leslie is an incredible and servant-hearted leader in Blair County 
and across our Commonwealth. On behalf of Pennsylvania's 13th 
Congressional District, I thank Leslie Kelly for her work to improve 
the lives of Pennsylvanians and wish her continued success in this 
mission.
