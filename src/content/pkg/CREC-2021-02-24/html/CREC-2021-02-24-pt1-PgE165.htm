               RECOGNIZING DR. WILLIAM ``BILL'' GOLDSTEIN

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. ERIC SWALWELL

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Dr. William ``Bill'' 
Goldstein on the occasion of his upcoming retirement as Director of 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and President of Lawrence 
Livermore National Security, LLC on March 1, 2021.
  Before landing at LLNL, Bill received a bachelor's degree in physics 
from Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, a doctorate in theoretical 
physics from Columbia University in New York, and was a postdoctoral 
research associate with the Theoretical Physics Group at the Stanford 
Linear Accelerator Center. His first assignment at LLNL was in the 
Physics Directorate, where his portfolio included diverse national 
security and science programs. This positioned him well to take on 
supervisory and senior management roles, such as Associate Director of 
Physical and Life Sciences, then Deputy Director for Science and 
Technology, where he was tasked with leading the strategic deployment 
of LLNL's science and technology capabilities. He continued to impress 
and was named LLNL's 12th director and LLNS' 3rd president on March 31, 
2014.
  Under Bill's leadership during the past seven years, LLNL's budget 
and workforce have grown by 50 percent and 25 percent respectively. In 
fact, in 2020, LLNL was listed in the top ten of GlassDoor's 100 best 
large places to work in the United States. All of this occurred despite 
ever-increasing competition for talent from nearby Silicon Valley.
  LLNL has experienced significant growth in all programs and 
operations with Bill at the helm. He has prepared it and its personnel 
to lead a new era of nuclear stockpile stewardship, ensuring that our 
nuclear weapons are responsibly maintained and keeping the United 
States at the forefront of innovation. Much of this is made possible by 
Sierra, a new class of supercomputer brought into the field in the last 
few years. Bill's holistic and multi-jurisdictional thinking continues 
to enable growth and flexibility throughout LLNL operations and our 
national security.
  Most recently, Bill not only helped his LLNL team navigate the new 
workforce realities brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, but he and 
his management team also did their part to make significant 
contributions to the fight against the disease, fabricating emergency 
ventilators, using 3D printing to fabricate nasal swabs, and providing 
predicted structures of a key COVID-19 viral protein to help accelerate 
the development of potential medical treatments for the disease.
  As if all that was not enough, Bill has authored or co-authored more 
than 70 papers on a variety of topics while a fellow of the American 
Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of 
Science.
  I thank Bill for his nearly four decades of service. Enjoy a well-
earned retirement, and we wish him all the best while he spends more 
time with his wife, Kathy, and twin daughters, Emma and Sarah.
