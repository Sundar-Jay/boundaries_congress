                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate the 
New Oxford High School Marching Colonials on their victory in the V-
USBands Pennsylvania State Championship.
  The New Oxford High School Marching Colonials include 52 students in 
grades 9-12. A competitive band for many years, the band persevered 
through the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and competed in the 
virtual V-USBands circuit. From their home stadium in New Oxford, the 
band designed a new, original field show called ``Together,'' which is 
intended to convey a message of unity.

  In addition to the state championship, the New Oxford Marching 
Colonials also earned special awards for High Music, High Visual, High 
Percussion, and High Colorguard. The band also competed in the V-
USBands National Championship, in which the students placed fourth and 
received a special award for Best Colorguard.
  I congratulate the dedicated members of the New Oxford Marching 
Colonials, their instructors, and families on this remarkable 
achievement, and I wish the students every continued success.
