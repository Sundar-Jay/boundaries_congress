                                Protests

  Mr. President, finally, I want to commend the Rules Committee and the 
Homeland Security Committee yesterday for holding an important hearing 
examining the attack on January 6, a horrible, horrible attack. It was 
the first of what will be many examinations of the events on January 6 
and how we can prevent such an attack from ever happening again.
  The hearing revealed several security and communication failures that 
must be addressed going forward and followed up on in future 
investigations. Regrettably, the hearing also revealed that there are 
still Members of the Senate Republican minority who are willing to 
continue the campaign of misinformation, deception, and conspiracy that 
helped fuel the attack on January 6 in the first place.
  Let me be very clear. Blaming the January 6 attack on provocateurs 
and fake Trump protesters is mindless garbage. It has no basis in fact. 
Perpetuating and giving a platform to those lies is a preposterous 
contribution to a Senate hearing devoted to Capitol security. 
Everyone--everyone needs to move forward by sticking to the facts and 
engaging in a very serious discussion about the security of the Capitol 
Complex.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.
