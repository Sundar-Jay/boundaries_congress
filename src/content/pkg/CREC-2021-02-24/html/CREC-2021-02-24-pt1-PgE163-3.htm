                     NEW DEAL FOR NEW AMERICANS ACT

                                  _____
                                 

                            HON. GRACE MENG

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, immigrants are an essential part of our 
nation. And our nation can only be made stronger if we assist the 
efforts of new Americans to integrate, contribute to the growth of our 
economy, and be civically engaged.
  The United States is the nation that it is today because of immigrant 
contributions. In fact, I am proud to represent one of the most diverse 
congressional districts in the country, in Queens, New York; it is a 
place where immigrant communities have thrived for decades and decades.
  Madam Speaker, I am a proud daughter of immigrants. I know firsthand 
the difficulties my parents and grandparents encountered when they 
immigrated to the United States for a better life for their children. 
This is not an uncommon story. While the levels of hardships of new 
immigrants vary, there are common challenges--from language barriers to 
finding work.
  That is why, I am so proud to reintroduce the ``New Deal for New 
Americans Act''. I am honored and grateful to lead this bill with 
Senators Markey and Hirono and Representatives Jayapal and Garcia. The 
New Deal for New Americans Act would ensure a more inclusive and 
welcoming immigration system to help new Americans achieve their 
American Dream. Among many provisions, this bill would help immigrants 
overcome common challenges such as language barriers and employment 
attainment, and help start a business and break down barriers to 
naturalization.
  Specifically, the ``New Deal for New Americans Act'' would:
  Establish a National Office of New Americans in the Executive Office 
of the White House to promote and support immigrant and refugee 
integration and inclusion and coordinate efforts of federal, state, and 
local governments to support social, economic, and civic integration of 
immigrants and refugees.
  Establish a Federal Initiative on New Americans to coordinate federal 
response to address issues that affect the lives of new immigrants and 
refugees and communities with growing immigrant and refugee 
populations.
  Create a Legal Services and Immigration Assistance Grant Program to 
support organizations that provide direct immigration assistance to 
those in need of immigration screening; know-your-rights education; 
assistance in applying for citizenship, lawful permanent resident 
status or other legal status (DACA, TPS, asylum, etc.); or seeking 
relief from a removal order.
  Create an English as a Gateway to Integration Program for 
organizations that teach English or help individuals prepare for 
naturalization or earn a GED.
  Create a Workforce Development Grant Program to ensure that immigrant 
and refugee adults have equitable access to education and workforce 
programs that help equip them with occupational skills needed to secure 
or advance in employment.
  Reduce barriers for individuals to naturalize by establishing a flat 
application fee for naturalization, amending the English and civics 
exam requirements for older individuals, and exempting eligible U.S. 
high school graduates from taking the naturalization exams.
  Limit USCIS's ability to raise fees without Congress' approval, plus 
require authorization of appropriations to cover USCIS' need to operate 
and adjudicate cases.
  Promote civic engagement through automatic voter registration of 
newly naturalized individuals.
  Expand family integration by reducing the age of citizens who are 
able to petition eligible family members from 21 years old to 18 years 
old.

  Increase Refugee Admissions level to 125,000 per fiscal year.
  Provide social, economic, and civic support to refugees and rebuild 
the capacity and infrastructure of local communities to welcome 
refugees.
  Amend the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to no longer allow 
deportation of an individual deemed to have become a public charge.
  Madam Speaker, the rich tapestry of our nation that is comprised of 
diverse cultures, languages, and experiences have always been America's 
strength--and that is why improving our system to welcome new Americans 
will ensure our nation continues to thrive. This bicameral legislation 
is a down payment for future generations to succeed in the United 
States. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and join me in 
moving our diverse nation forward by helping new Americans.
