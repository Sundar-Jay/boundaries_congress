                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate 
Miguel Perez upon his appointment to serve as manager of the Altoona 
Curve for 2021's minor league season, which will be Mr. Perez's 14th 
season in the Pittsburgh Pirates' system.
  Mr. Perez will be the first former Altoona Curve player to serve as 
the team's manager. Prior to his appointment as manager of the Altoona 
Curve, he served as a manager for the West Virginia Power, the 
Greensboro Grasshoppers, and the Bristol Pirates.
  Mr. Perez began his career as a baseball player in 2000 with the 
Cincinnati Reds, and made his major league debut with the Reds in 2005. 
He played for the Altoona Curve in 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013. During 
his tenure with the Altoona Curve, he appeared in 92 games and hit .271 
with 36 RBIs.
  It is my honor to congratulate Mr. Perez on his appointment as 
manager of the Altoona Curve and welcome him back to Altoona. As the 
2021 season begins, I wish Mr. Perez and the Altoona Curve team a safe, 
healthy, and successful season ahead.

                          ____________________
