  MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF THE HONORABLE RON 
                                 WRIGHT

  (Ms. JOHNSON of Texas asked and was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.)
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, as dean of the Texas 
Congressional delegation, I rise to express my condolences on the 
passing of Congressman Ron Wright of Arlington. In his death, Congress 
has lost a statesman, Texas has lost a dedicated Representative, and I 
have lost a dear friend.
  Congressman Wright was an energetic and bright presence in our 
delegation. He had a passion for public service, and was willing to 
work with anyone, regardless of party or politics, to get things done.
  He leaves behind a legacy that will inspire future generations of 
Texans to commit themselves to public service. Though his presence will 
certainly be missed, we will find comfort in knowing that his memory 
will always be with us.
  Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), 
my colleague and ranking member of the House Ways and Means Committee.
  Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, today we gather as a grieving delegation 
and as a proud Nation to recognize the life and legacy of our colleague 
and friend, Congressman Ron Wright.
  Texas born and bred, Ron worked with and for the people of Texas in 
some way for the past 21 years. Throughout his courageous battle with 
lung cancer, his good spirits never faltered, and he remained a 
steadfast champion of his conservative principles.
  To many of us, it seemed like Ron never had a bad day. In fact, the 
last two bills he introduced in Congress protected the unborn and the 
sanctity of life, something Ron always passionately supported. Think 
about that. As his life was waning, he was protecting the lives of the 
innocent unborn.
  The Texas people have lost a real fighter, and all of us have lost a 
true friend. Cathy and I and our entire Texas delegation hold Ron's 
wife, Susan, close to our hearts, and our deepest condolences go out to 
his children, grandchildren, and staff.
  Godspeed to you, my friend. You will be missed.
  Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, I ask that we all rise for a 
moment of silence.
  The SPEAKER. The Chair asks all Members in the Chamber to rise for a 
moment of silence.
