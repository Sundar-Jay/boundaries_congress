                        COMMENDING TED McKINNEY

  (Mr. BAIRD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to commend the work of Under 
Secretary of Agriculture for Trade and Foreign Agricultural Affairs Ted 
McKinney. Ted is the first person to hold this position, and he set a 
high bar for whoever succeeds him.
  His work has been an integral part of shaping trade agreements, 
including the successful renegotiation of the NAFTA into the USMCA. His 
determination to help American farmers get their products to new 
markets has not only helped our American farmers but has helped feed 
the world.
  Ted's remarkable passion for agriculture began at an early age, 
growing up on a farm in Tipton, Indiana, and was active in 4-H and with 
the Future Farmers of America organization. He then graduated from 
Purdue University with a B.A. in agricultural economics and later 
served as the director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture.
  Thank you, Ted, for your outstanding work and devotion to our 
Nation's farmers.
