                       RECOGNIZING ROBBY SNELTZER

  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
and thank Robby Sneltzer of Venango County, Pennsylvania.
  Robby is a 9-year-old Oil City resident with a kind heart. This 
holiday season, Robby decided to help his neighbors in need by starting 
a donation drive.
  With the help of his stepmother, Angel, Robby began to collect 
donations of toiletries, snacks, ponchos, hats, and hand sanitizer, 
stuffing backpacks full of these much-needed items for those in need.
  Robby's relatives pitched in with donations, as well as Hasson 
Heights Elementary School and Hope Pediatrics. The backpacks were 
donated to The Pointe. The Pointe is a drop-in center promoting 
recovery and community awareness for individuals who struggle with 
mental health difficulties.
  Angela Proper, executive director of The Pointe, said: ``When Robby 
brought them in and we piled them up, it was pretty amazing.''
  I would like to personally thank Robby for his support of his 
community. Acts of kindness like these make our world a better place.
