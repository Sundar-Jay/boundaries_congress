                              EQUALITY ACT

                                  _____
                                 

                            HON. SUSAN WILD

  Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, if the Equality Act is signed into law, 
millions of our fellow Americans will, for the first time, no longer be 
subject to discrimination based on their sexual orientation or gender 
identity. Barriers across our society--in essential areas like housing, 
employment, credit, and education--will finally come down.
  In reflecting on this legislation, I can't help thinking about my 
uncle Wes, who grew up during the Depression. As a young man, he was 
never able to come out to his family because he didn't think they'd 
accept him for it. Later in life, he did come out--living as a proud, 
gay man in Alabama. He passed away last year, and when I cast my vote 
for this legislation, I'll be thinking of him.
  I'll also be thinking of the many messages I've gotten since I was 
first sworn in from young LGBTQ people in my community. They've shared 
their stories with me, and I've been inspired by their courage. I want 
them to know that this country belongs every bit as much to them--and 
that they have the right to a life of dignity and respect. That is 
what's at stake in this vote.
