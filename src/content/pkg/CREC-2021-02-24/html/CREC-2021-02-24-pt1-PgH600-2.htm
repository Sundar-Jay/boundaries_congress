                 SUPPORTING NATIONAL RIGHT-TO-WORK ACT

  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to 
address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this week I am 
reintroducing the National Right-to-Work Act with over 60 original 
cosponsors.
  I, along with over 80 percent of the American people, believe that 
every worker should have the power to decide whether to negotiate for 
themselves with their employer. This bill would simply listen to the 
majority of American workers.
  South Carolina has seen firsthand the job creation when we protect 
freedoms for American workers. I was present for Michelin Tire Corp.'s 
groundbreaking with Governor Jim Edwards to develop their largest plant 
in the world. I was with Governor Carroll Campbell for the BMW 
groundbreaking in Greer for their largest manufacturing facility. And I 
was with Governor Nikki Haley to see the building of Boeing aircraft in 
Charleston.
  Congratulations to Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work 
Legal Defense Foundation, for his success in 27 States.
  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget 
September 11th in the global war on terrorism.
