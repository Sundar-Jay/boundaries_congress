  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate 
Master Sergeant Rafael A. Melgar of Altoona, Pennsylvania on his 
retirement after 20 years of service in the United States Air Force.
  Sergeant Melgar enlisted in the Air Force in 2000. His service has 
included six years of active duty with the 74th Fighter Squadron, the 
23rd Fighter Wing, at Pope Air Force Base, North Carolina as an A-10, 
F-15, and U-2 Avionics Systems Journeyman. He also has served with the 
152nd Medical Squadron at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport as a 
Biomedical Equipment Repair Technician. Currently, he is a Biomedical 
Equipment Support Specialist at the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical 
Center in Altoona, Pennsylvania.
  Sergeant Melgar deployed in support of Operation: Southern Watch, 
Operation: Enduring Freedom, and Operation: Iraqi Freedom. During his 
service, he earned the Air Force Achievement Medal with an Oak Leaf 
Cluster.
  Sergeant Melgar is an outstanding American and Pennsylvanian. It is 
my honor to recognize his distinguished service to our nation and to 
our community. On behalf of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, 
I congratulate Sergeant Melgar on his retirement and wish him the best 
as he and his family embark on a new chapter.
