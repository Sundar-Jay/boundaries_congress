                 HONORING THE LIFE OF W. EUGENE BURRELL

                            HON. BRIAN BABIN

                                of texas

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a 
community leader and friend, W. Eugene Burrell of Fannett, Texas, who 
passed away on Wednesday, December 30, 2020, at the age of 86. Eugene 
was a lifelong cattle rancher, rice farmer, and civic leader in 
Southeast Texas. He had the respect of all who knew him.
  Eugene was born on October 27, 1934, in Beaumont, Texas, to Louise 
DeVillier Burrell and Walter Jordan Burrell. He began farming rice at 
the age of 18 and worked in that role until the age of 21, when he 
decided to serve his country in the United States Army. After serving 
in the Army from 1955 to 1957, where he was stationed overseas in 
Germany, Eugene returned home and continued rice farming--an occupation 
that would unknowingly last for 52 years. Apart from growing rice, he 
was also a dedicated cattle rancher for more than 70 years. Eugene 
served as a board member on numerous industry and community boards, 
such as: the American Rice Incorporate Board in Houston, the American 
Rice Growers Board in Cheek, Texas, the Coastal Cattlemen's Association 
Board, the Equalization Board for the Jefferson County Appraisal 
District, the West Jefferson Municipal Water District, and the Texas 
Rice Festival, where he volunteered with his wife, Sandra. In 1999, 
Eugene was named the Texas Rice Festival Farmer of the Year and 
subsequently its Pioneer Farmer of the Year in 2017. His steadfast 
faith was always important to him. In fact, he served as a member of 
St. Mary's Fannett Knights of Columbus organization.
  In addition to ``Eugene,'' his friends and family lovingly referred 
to him as ``Dad,'' ``Pawpaw,'' ``Boogie,'' and ``Fred''. Supporting his 
children, and later his grandchildren, by attending their sporting 
events and various competitions over the years was always a top 
priority to him. Eugene is survived by his wife of 63 years, Sandra Ray 
Burrell; daughters, Karen Burrell Reneau and her husband, Charlie, and 
Kelly Burrell Alton and her husband, Randy; son, Troy Eugene Burrell 
and his wife, Shelly; grandchildren, Landon Reneau and his wife, 
Hillary, William Reneau and his wife, Amanda, Lane Stuart, Reid Alton, 
Mary Alton, Abby Alton, Cody Burrell, and Cameron Burrell and his wife, 
Lauren; great-grandchildren, Eli Reneau, Ella Reneau, and Bryar Burrell 
and numerous nieces and nephews. He is preceded in death by his 
parents, Louise and Walter Burrell, and brother, James ``Jack'' 
Burrell.
  Madam Speaker, I would like to honor my friend W. Eugene Burrell for 
his many years of faithful service to his community. My thoughts and 
prayers remain with his family and friends during this difficult time.
