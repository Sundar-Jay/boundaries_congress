                   HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY, JOE BERKLICH

  (Mr. STAUBER asked and was given permission to address the House for 
1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
  Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Joe Berklich, a 
World War II veteran and Hibbing, Minnesota, native, who is celebrating 
his 100th birthday today.
  In 1943, Joe enlisted in the Army and courageously served in the 
Pacific theater until the end of the war. In fact, all four of the 
Berklich brothers were proud to serve during our country's time of 
need.
  Upon returning home, Joe married the love of his life, Margaret. He 
still lives in the family home in Hibbing, Minnesota, where they raised 
their four children: Michael, Danny, Timmy, and Mary. Always a family 
man, Joe's favorite memories are spending the Fourth of July at their 
cabin on Bear Lake and spoiling his grandchildren on Christmas Eve.
  After the war, Joe worked for U.S. Steel, the Sherman Mine, and 
Minntac in Mountain Iron. He became a foreman and also traveled the 
Nation working with vendors of mining equipment.
  In his free time, Joe has been an active member of the Hibbing 
community, serving as a Hibbing city councilor to the president of the 
Hibbing Curling Club.
  Mr. Speaker, members of the Greatest Generation like Joe Berklich are 
the pride of our communities. As the Hibbing community gathers today 
for a drive-by past his house to celebrate this major milestone, I am 
proud to stand here on the House floor to thank Joe for his service and 
wish him the happiest of birthdays.
