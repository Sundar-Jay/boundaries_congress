                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam Speaker, America has lost a 
treasured Icon of Truth with the death of Rush Limbaugh. My wife 
Roxanne and our family and community extend our most sincere sympathy 
to his wife Kathryn and the Limbaugh Family. He was America's Number 
One broadcaster with tens of millions of listeners in every community 
in America.
  Rush Limbaugh was the Ronald Reagan of broadcasting proving 
conservatism is positive, friendly, faith-based, and even funny as he 
itemized the Greatness of America never apologizing for Exceptionalism.
  Also, like President Reagan he achieved and promoted the American 
Dream that all can succeed with hard work. It was Reaganesque that he 
created thousands of jobs saving the AM Radio band enabling local hosts 
to penetrate daily newspapers' mostly fake news. Local hosts are 
highlighted by talented truth tellers--Keven Cohen, Gary David, Carl 
Gooding, Paul Kirby, Kelly Nash, Jonathan Rush, and Christopher 
Thompson. This is also a platform for affordable advertising by local 
businesses to create jobs.
  His logical, common sense explanation of American political issues 
was vital for conservative success.
  In 1994 he worked with speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich to achieve the 
first Republican House majority in my lifetime--leading to a 
Congressional vote to establish the American Embassy in Jerusalem.
  In 2010 he encouraged the grassroots to become active with the 
spontaneous Tea Party movement gaining an incredible 63 House seats.
  In 2016 he recognized outsider Donald Trump to unexpectedly be 
elected President to successfully create jobs with record employment 
for African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, women, and youth.
  In 2020 in my home state of South Carolina he inspired young 
conservatives for additional State Senate, State House, and a 
Congressional seat achieving the largest Republican majorities in 140 
years. This follows Nikki Haley being elected the first female governor 
in 340 years and second Indian American in history with Senator Tim 
Scott being the South's first African American U.S. Senator.
  Columbia's Morning News host Gary David is correct that there has 
been no one who has impacted our political culture more than Rush 
Limbaugh without serving in public office.
  I saw firsthand the good-natured friendliness of Rush Limbaugh in 
1990 when I served as his driver during his visit to Columbia for an 
address to the South Carolina Policy Council. He was not offended being 
crammed into our van with our four sons age 3 to 17 (helping inspire 
our son Alan to be elected America's youngest state Attorney General in 
2010).
  Last February 5th I was grateful to congratulate him at the Capitol 
following his being presented the Medal of Freedom by President Donald 
Trump during his historic State of the Union address. The opinion show 
host was clearly humbled by this deserved recognition.
  It is so re-assuring that the Rush Limbaugh legacy will continue as 
excerpts from his broadcasts will remain on the air reinforcing how 
profound his love of America that are timeless.
