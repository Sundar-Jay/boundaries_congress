                   COMMENDING COLD CHAIN TECHNOLOGIES

  (Mr. AUCHINCLOSS asked and was given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.)
  Mr. AUCHINCLOSS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of President 
Biden's American Rescue Plan, a critical tool in the race between 
vaccines and variants.
  My district is home to global leaders in the life sciences who are 
helping to win this race. Last week, I visited one of them in Franklin, 
Massachusetts.
  Cold Chain Technologies is at the cutting edge of materials science, 
producing insulated packaging to transport and store vaccines and other 
biologics. They package all of Moderna's vaccines on the critical path 
of getting shots into arms.
  To defeat this pandemic and prevent another, we must enact the 
American Rescue Plan and unlock its investment in life sciences 
research, development, and manufacturing here in the United States. My 
district is an exemplar of the innovation and jobs that are the fruits 
of the life sciences.
