       CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF BISHOP CHARLES E. DAVIS

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. BOBBY L. RUSH

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. RUSH. Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and celebrate 
the life of an extraordinary and influential figure from Chicago's 
South Side, Bishop Charles Edward Davis. A native of Leland, 
Mississippi, Bishop Davis's life was guided by service to his country, 
his community, and his faith. After graduating high school in 1940, 
Bishop Davis relocated to Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood, at the 
beginning of the Second Great Migration and the year before the United 
States entered World War II. Heeding the call to serve his country 
after the outbreak of war, Bishop Davis joined the U.S. Army at the age 
of 19, serving as a sergeant. In the Army, Bishop Davis would complete 
tours of duty in Germany, France, and Holland.
  After the war, Bishop Davis would enter the upholstery business with 
his dear friend Brother James McDonald, a step which would lead him 
towards his lifetime of faith and good works. Brother McDonald's 
mother-in-law, Sister Anastasia Anderson, introduced him to the Indiana 
Avenue Pentecostal Church of God (IPC), and he became a member of the 
church in 1954 when it was under the pastorate of Elder Charles Ellis.
  Recognizing the deep faith, commitment, and talent of Bishop Davis, 
Elder Ellis's successor, Elder Odee Akines, encouraged the further 
development of his faith and leadership. With Elder Akines at the helm 
of IPC, Bishop Davis served as the church's Sunday School 
superintendent, Young People's Leader, and President of the senior 
choir. By his side throughout his energetic leadership of the church 
was Dr. Geraldine Olivia Davis, his dear wife of 43 years until her 
passing in 1998. Bishop Davis was also a devoted father to a son, 
Larney Bush, Jr., and a daughter, Yolanda Davis.
  After Elder Akines passed away in 1970, Bishop Davis was elected 
pastor of IPC. Himself a Doctor of Divinity and Master of Theology, 
Bishop Davis made this a central focus during his leadership of IPC, 
establishing scholarships and programs for young people seeking to 
further their educations in both the secular and Christian traditions. 
In 1986, Bishop Davis was elevated to the Bishopric by the Pentecostal 
Assemblies of the World, serving as a Diocesan Bishop in New York 
State, Washington State, and Wyoming, eventually accepting a role as 
Diocesan of the 6th Episcopal District of the Pentecostal Assemblies of 
the World, their Illinois District Council, in 2008.
  Bishop Davis would come to be widely recognized as one of the 
Pentecostal Assemblies of the World's most exemplary leaders, admired 
both in Chicago and nationally for his character and conviction. This 
caused him to become fondly known as ``Chief.'' Bishop Davis was a 
mentor to many young people who came to his churches seeking salvation, 
and always conducted robust community outreach efforts, making sure 
that his good works did not only benefit IPC, but the entire 
neighborhood and city. Bishop Davis's work was recognized by the City 
of Chicago in 1992, when the 3500-3600 block of South Indiana Avenue 
was named in his honor.
  In 2004, Bishop Davis became united in marriage with Dr. Jessie 
Davis, and they were inseparable from one another, always working 
together for the spiritual benefit of their community. They would 
remain by each other's sides until Dr. Davis's death in April of 2020.
  Madam Speaker, on February 9th, Bishop Davis was called to heaven 
after a lifetime of good works. My deepest prayers and sympathies go 
out to Bishop Davis's family, friends, and the IPC community on the 
passing of this supremely devoted and talented leader, who gave so much 
in service to his faith, community, and country.
