                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret Grun Kibben, offered the 
following prayer:
  By Your mercies, O Lord, we present ourselves to You this day, 
bringing with us not just diverse attitudes and a range of passions, 
but deeply held opinions which we truly believe are offered in faith.
  We reluctantly admit that it is our faith that confounds us, for as 
we dare to interpret Your will and attempt to live into Your intent, we 
find ourselves viscerally at odds with the very ones with whom You have 
caused us to serve.
  Renew our minds, individually and collectively, that we would not be 
conformed to the divisive patterns of this world but transformed by 
Your grace. May we not think so highly of ourselves that we fail to be 
reasonable or use careful judgment. Remind us that as Members of this 
one body, we are called to live in peace, to be thankful, to admonish 
in love.
  Then together, in faith, enable us to discern Your will to determine 
what really is good, pleasing, and appropriate for our country, for our 
community, and for our Congress.
  We offer ourselves, our words and deeds, praying in Your most holy 
name.
  Amen.
