                  JESSIE CLEMENTE CELEBRATES 103 YEARS

  (Ms. TENNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)
  Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of an inspiring woman 
in my community, Jessie Clemente.
  Jessie will be celebrating her 103rd birthday on Thursday with her 
family.
  Born and raised in Utica, New York, Jessie has committed her life to 
being a loving wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. She 
enjoys spending time with her family, especially her beloved 5-month-
old great-granddaughter, who she enjoys cooking and baking with. Jessie 
is also incredibly proud of her great-nephew David, who is serving our 
Nation in the U.S. Army.
  The Clemente family has been a pillar of the Utica community for many 
generations. They own and operate Clemente Novelties, where Jessie 
often helped with day-to-day tasks and supported her son, who is 
currently running the family business.
  I want to wish Jessie a very happy birthday and a safe and healthy 
year. Her zest for life and love of her family are an inspiration to 
all of us.
