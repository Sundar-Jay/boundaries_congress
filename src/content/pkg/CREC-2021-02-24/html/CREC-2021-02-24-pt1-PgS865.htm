                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS

                                 ______
                                 

 SENATE RESOLUTION 71--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT ALIENS 
 CONVICTED OF DRUNK DRIVING OFFENSES QUALIFY AS A PUBLIC SAFETY THREAT 
              FOR THE PURPOSES OF IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT

  Ms. ERNST (for herself, Mr. Grassley, and Mrs. Fischer) submitted the 
following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary:

                               S. Res. 71

       Whereas Sarah Root of Council Bluffs, Iowa, died at the 
     hands of a drunk driver who was not lawfully present in the 
     United States;
       Whereas the mission of the immigration enforcement process 
     is to ensure the safety of our communities; and
       Whereas drunk driving and aliens convicted of drunk driving 
     are a threat to public safety of the United States, and to 
     say otherwise is offensive to both the victims of drunk 
     driving offenses and those who seek to enforce criminal 
     statutes related to drunk driving: Now, therefore, be it
       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that any 
     guidance issued by the Department of Homeland Security or 
     U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement as it relates to 
     immigration enforcement and removal of aliens should not 
     deprioritize the removal of aliens convicted of--
       (1) drunk driving or otherwise driving under the influence; 
     or
       (2) any crime which includes as an element an act of 
     assault or violence.
