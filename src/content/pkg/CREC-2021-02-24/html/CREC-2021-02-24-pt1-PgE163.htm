                         RECOGNIZING JOHN DIAZ

                                  _____
                                 

                           HON. ERIC SWALWELL

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, along with Speaker of the House Nancy 
Pelosi and Representatives Mark DeSaulnier, Anna G. Eshoo, Jared 
Huffman, Ro Khanna, Barbara Lee, Zoe Lofgren, Jerry McNerney, Jackie 
Speier, and Mike Thompson, I rise to recognize California journalist 
John Diaz on the occasion of his retirement from the San Francisco 
Chronicle.
  John's superb stewardship of the Chronicle's editorial pages over the 
past 25 years has kept California readers talking and thinking about 
the most pressing issues facing the state. His own columns, exploring 
complex issues in ways that laypeople can easily understand and engage, 
have been a big part of that.
  John, a graduate of California's Humboldt State University, started 
his career at the Red Bluff (CA) Daily News, where after two years he 
was promoted to the parent company's Washington, D.C. bureau. He later 
reported for the Associated Press in Philadelphia and reported and 
edited for the Denver Post before starting at the Chronicle in 1990 as 
an assistant city editor and becoming its editorial page editor in 
1996.
  Both in maintaining the Chronicle's editorial voice and in expressing 
his own opinions and analysis through his column, John unflinchingly 
has delved into tough issues without resorting either to 
oversimplification or to mean-spiritedness. His balanced presentation 
of facts is a credit to the Chronicle and to journalism at large, and a 
boon to his readers.
  The Bay Area political landscape has changed enormously on his watch, 
as has the region's media landscape. Through it all, John has kept our 
communities well-informed and a well-informed populace is a necessary 
part of our democratic republic.
  We thank John for his many years of service to our constituents, and 
we wish him the best in his next endeavors.
