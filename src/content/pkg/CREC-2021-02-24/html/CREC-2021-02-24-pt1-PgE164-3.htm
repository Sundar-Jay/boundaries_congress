                                  _____
                                 

                            HON. BILL POSEY

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart and solemn 
remembrance that I rise to pay tribute to a great man and my longtime 
friend, Capt. (Ret) James Michael Kuzma. Jim passed away unexpectedly 
on Friday, February 5, 2021, just three days shy of his 60th birthday.
  Jim was born February 8, 1961 in Steubenville, Ohio. He earned a 
Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from the U.S. 
Naval Academy, a Master of Science in Engineering Management from the 
Catholic University of America, and a Master of Science in National 
Resource Strategy from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces 
(ICAF).
  Jim served 28 years with the U.S. Navy before ``retiring'' to Cocoa 
Beach in 2011. I say ``retiring'' in quotations because anyone who knew 
Jim knew that it was nearly unthinkable for him to rest. He was always 
thinking of creative ways to solve challenges. For the last decade, Jim 
served as Space Florida's Senior Vice President and General Manager of 
the Cape Canaveral Spaceport, working to cement the state's position as 
a world leader in aerospace.
  Recruited to Space Florida to strengthen and grow its operational 
support for the commercial space industry at Cape Canaveral Spaceport, 
Jim embraced the mission and excelled at finding ways to respond to 
industry's needs. He led efforts to secure Federal Aviation 
Administration spaceport operating licenses for both the former Shuttle 
Landing Facility (SLF) and other former Government sites on Cape 
Canaveral Air Force Station. Jim spearheaded the transfer of the SLF to 
Space Florida's management and operation, and he was instrumental in 
attracting Blue Origin to base its orbital program in Florida. For the 
past two years, he worked tirelessly to ensure a solution for replacing 
NASA's 1964 Indian River Bridge that would meet the spaceport's needs 
far into the future. These were only a few examples Jim's 
accomplishments to further America's space program in positive ways.
  Jim visited my office frequently in Washington, advocating for the 
commercial space industry, offering creative solutions to problems, and 
urging needed regulatory reform to ensure America's leadership in 
space. He served on the Board of the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, 
and more recently on the CSF Executive Committee.
  Jim began his Naval service on the USS Jacksonville SSN 699. He went 
on to Naval Sea Systems Command, serving during 1988 through 90 as a 
Fleet Liaison and Systems Test Director for various submarine Combat 
and Weapons System Program Offices. He served as Engineering Officer on 
the USS Newport News SSN 750 from 1991 to 1994. In 1994, he was 
assigned to the Commander in Chief, U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT) 
Nuclear Propulsion Examining Board. He served as the Executive Officer 
on USS Atlanta SSN 712 from October 1996 to July 1998 before reporting 
to Submarine Warfare Division of the Office of the Chief of Naval 
Operations (OPNAV) staffer where he served as Submarine Combat Systems 
Requirements Officer. Following that, he served as the Commanding 
Officer of the USS Boise 764 from March 2001 until October 2003. He 
then became Deputy Director for Operations on the staff of the 
Commander, Naval Submarine Forces from 2003 to 2005. From October 2005 
to August 2007, Captain Kuzma served as Special Activities Division 
Chief on Strategic Command's Joint Functional Component Command for 
Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance staff before attending 
the Industrial College of the Armed Forces (ICAF) from August 2007 to 
June 2008. He rounded off his impressive Naval career as the Commanding 
Officer of the Naval Ordnance Test Unit in Cape Canaveral (2008-2011).
  Captain Kuzma's personal decorations include the Legion of Merit, 
Bronze Star, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, two Meritorious Service 
Medals, six Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals and four Navy and 
Marine Corps Achievement Medals. Yet, he never spoke about them. Jim 
was indeed

passionate about his work, but his greatest joy in life was his family. 
Anyone who spent time around Jim instantly knew that he was a family 
man; he delighted in attending concerts and visiting theme parks with 
his family, especially his grandchildren. He is survived by Karen, his 
wife of 36 years, their four children, James Michael II (Andrea Pinzon-
Garcia), William Jordan (Patricia Kuzma), Lauren Rose (Aaron Possinger) 
and Candace Marie and five grandchildren, Ariana, Lillian, Camilo, 
Adelaide, and Maverick. He is also survived by his mother, Catherine 
Kuzma, and mother-in-law, Candace Jordan. He is also survived by 
innumerable friends and colleagues, who all miss him dearly.
  On a personal note, I am proud to have called Jim my friend for many 
years. Jim served on my selection board for the U.S. Naval Academy. He 
believed in the importance of serving our nation and was a strong 
supporter of our brave men and women in military uniform as well as our 
military veterans. Jim was proud of our nation's space program, worked 
tirelessly to promote America's mission in Space along with our 
commercial space endeavors, and was champion for local businesses in 
Brevard County, Florida.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting Captain 
James Kuzma for a lifetime of service to the United States and his 
fellow citizens. I would also like to ask my colleagues in the House to 
join us in extending our deepest sympathies to Jim's family, friends, 
colleagues, and loved ones during this difficult time.
