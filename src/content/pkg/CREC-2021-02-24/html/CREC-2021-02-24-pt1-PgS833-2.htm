                                 PRAYER

  The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, offered the following prayer:
  Let us pray.
  Precious Lord, You delight in those who have integrity. Lord, Your 
Word describes integrity as always trying to maintain a clear 
conscience before You and everyone else. Inspire our lawmakers to obey 
the voice of conscience, focusing on pleasing You by being true to 
duty. Lord, provide them with the determination to do what is right and 
leave the consequences to You. May they receive the smile of Heaven's 
approval because of their striving to be faithful. Help them to ignore 
the shouts from the shadows and focus on glorifying You.
  We pray in Your great Name. Amen.
