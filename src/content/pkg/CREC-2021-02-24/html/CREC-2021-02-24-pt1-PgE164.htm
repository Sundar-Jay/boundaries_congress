                      Wednesday, February 24, 2021

  Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate Mike 
Tedesco on his new role as President and CEO of Vision Together 2025 in 
Johnstown, Pennsylvania.
  Vision Together 2025 is a volunteer-based organization that works to 
improve life in the Greater Johnstown region by laying a groundwork for 
better educational and economic opportunities. Vision Together 2025 
already is making great strides in its mission, and I am confident that 
Mike will continue this work for the community.
  Mike holds a degree from the University of Idaho and a master's 
degree in Urban & Regional Planning from the University of Kansas. An 
expert in urban planning, Mike was most recently the Executive Director 
of the Spokane Tribe of Indians in Spokane, Washington. He also 
previously served as Executive Director of the Pueblo Urban Renewal 
Authority.
  On behalf of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, it is my 
privilege to welcome Mike Tedesco to Johnstown and wish him success in 
his new role.
