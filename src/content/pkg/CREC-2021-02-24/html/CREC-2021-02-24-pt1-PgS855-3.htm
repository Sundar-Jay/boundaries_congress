                          PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE

                                 ______
                                 

     REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS 
ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN PROCLAMATION 6867 OF MARCH 1, 1996, WITH RESPECT 
TO THE UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY OF ANY UNITED STATES-REGISTERED VESSELS INTO 
                     CUBAN TERRITORIAL WATERS--PM 2

  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation:

To the Congress of the United States:
  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) 
provides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, 
within 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the 
President publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the 
Congress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect 
beyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have 
sent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice 
stating that the national emergency with respect to Cuba that was 
declared on March 1, 1996, in Proclamation 6867, as amended by 
Proclamation 7757 on February 26, 2004, Proclamation 9398 on February 
24, 2016, and Proclamation 9699 on February 22, 2018, is to continue in 
effect beyond March 1, 2021.
  There remains a need to continue this national emergency, based on a 
disturbance or threatened disturbance of the international relations 
for the United States related to Cuba. The unauthorized entry of any 
United States-registered vessel into Cuban territorial waters continues 
to be detrimental to the foreign policy of the United States.
  The unauthorized entry of vessels subject to the jurisdiction of the 
United States into Cuban territorial waters is currently a violation of 
Federal law. Further, the unauthorized entry of United States-
registered vessels into Cuban territorial waters continues to be 
detrimental to United States foreign policy and counter to the purpose 
of Executive Order 12807, which is to ensure, among other things, safe, 
orderly, and legal migration. The possibility of large-scale 
unauthorized entries of United States-registered vessels into Cuban 
territorial waters would disturb the international relations of the 
United States regarding Cuba by allowing for or providing the means to 
facilitate a mass migration of Cuban nationals and threatening our 
national security.
  Therefore, I have determined that it is necessary to continue the 
national emergency with respect to Cuba and the emergency authority 
relating to the regulation of the anchorage and movement of vessels set 
out in Proclamation 6867, as amended by Proclamation 7757, Proclamation 
9398, and Proclamation 9699.
                                                     Joseph R. Biden.  
The White House, February 24, 2021.
