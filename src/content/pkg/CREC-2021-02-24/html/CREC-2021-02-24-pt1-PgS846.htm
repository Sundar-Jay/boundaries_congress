                          Black History Month

  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, each February, we mark Black History 
Month by coming together to highlight the achievements and 
contributions of Black Americans to our national story and remember the 
centuries of struggle that have shaped our society.
  At every turning point in American history, Black American 
achievements and calls to action have driven our Nation's cultural, 
economic, and social progress forward, helping to hold to account the 
promises of freedom and equality for all people that our founding 
doctrine failed to uphold.
  For too long, this history and the names and faces of those who 
marched, sacrificed, and fought for change have been obscured by 
prejudice and hate. It is our charge to remember those who marched for 
justice and the forces they marched against.
  When we ignore the injustices of our past, we cannot make amends in 
the present. The consequences of such inaction are grave and live on in 
present day: the ongoing racial and religious profiling, brutality, and 
killing of Black Americans by police; the high rates of COVID-19 
transmission and death in Black communities; and the disproportionate 
impact this current economic crisis has had on Black workers and Black-
owned businesses.
  The unemployment rate for Black workers reached 9.9 percent, for 
instance--far beyond the national average of 6.7 percent, according to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
  These issues, including the broader economic and health consequences 
of the pandemic, result from systemic failures in place far before the 
current crisis, and they threaten to worsen racial gaps in wealth, 
health outcomes, and opportunities for years to come.
  Last year, our Nation's fight against racism gained new urgency by a 
police officer's callous killing of George Floyd in May. The Trump 
administration and law enforcement's response to peaceful protests 
further displayed the double standard that still exists in our society 
today. Protesters were attacked with tear gas and rubber bullets across 
the Nation and here in our capital as they organized and marched to 
make it known that Black lives matter. We watched on television as the 
National Guard forcefully removed peaceful protesters from Lafayette 
Park to make way for President Trump to walk to St. John's Episcopal 
Church for a photo op. President Trump brandished a Bible in front of 
the church while he continued to fan the flames of bigotry, hate, and 
racism.
  The historic election of Kamala Harris as our Nation's first Black 
female Vice President serves as a reminder of the power of collective 
action. The Biden-Harris administration gives us opportunity to take 
meaningful action in government to create a more just society. In the 
year ahead, we must work together to advance the George Floyd Justice 
in Policing Act to bring accountability to law enforcement and the  
John Lewis Voting Rights Act to combat voter suppression and restore 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
  It is our charge to mobilize all levels, from our communities to the 
Oval Office, to advance social, economic, and civil rights and justice 
to all Americans. It is time to expel all remaining vestiges of slavery 
and White supremacy that continue to plague our Nation.
  As our National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman said so eloquently 
in her inaugural day address, ``[B]eing American is more than [just] a 
pride we inherit, it's the past we step into and how we repair it.'' 
Black History Month is a reminder to look to this past and to act on 
our responsibilities in the present to make our Nation a better place 
for all of us.
  We are still fighting against the vestiges of the institutions of 
slavery, of targeted violence and resistance in the Reconstruction and 
the Jim Crow eras, and of the tactics to keep Black Americans from the 
polls and out of government
  They are not merely footnotes in our history textbooks; they are the 
lineage of our Nation, the obstacles that have left millions of our 
citizens behind in the effort to obtain the American dream.
  The realization of justice and true equality depends on our work to 
build a country committed to righting historic wrongs, closing gaps in 
the opportunity to achieve, and dismantling vestiges of inequality in 
our foundations. The 28 days in February must set the tone for the 
entire year--a continued commitment to justice, equality, and 
opportunity.
  Celebrating Black experiences and culture contributes to the 
greatness of our diverse society. Such a celebration is aspirational, 
highlighting one of the many fundamental components that make this 
Nation a beacon around the world despite our flaws.
  For the past 40 years, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer celebrated 
Black History Month by hosting a breakfast for political and civic 
leaders and inviting illustrious keynote speakers. Past speakers 
included then-Senator Barack Obama and Congressman John Lewis. 
Congressman Anthony Brown joined the effort to bring so many of us 
together for this 40th Annual Black History Month Celebration and 
featured Vice President Harris as the honored guest and keynote 
speaker.
  I would like to acknowledge the planning committee for this year's 
event, including Jackie Rhone and the former chair, Betty Richardson. 
Through their hard work, the celebration is a true success that 
everyone who participates looks forward to year after year.
  This year's event focused on the identity, representation, and 
diversity of the Black family. Maya Angelou once said:

       I sustain myself with the love of my family.

  The lasting bonds we have with our families sustain us through life. 
For many, our families serve as our home base through times of triumph, 
trial, and tragedy.
  The past year was a tumultuous year, from the COVID-19 pandemic, 
which has disproportionately harmed African Americans much more 
severely than others, to the resounding calls for racial justice and 
racial equity, which have long been overdue. Through all of the 
turmoil, 2020 brought us together to appreciate and celebrate the gifts 
of life, family, and diversity. As we celebrate Black History Month and 
moving forward, we can recommit ourselves to promoting and celebrating 
diversity and advancing civil rights in our society. Black history is 
American history. It is a story of oppression, struggle, and, if we are 
to be true to our founding premise, redemption and equality.
