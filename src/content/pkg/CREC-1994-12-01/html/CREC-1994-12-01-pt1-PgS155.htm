                          ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE

  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, if there is no further business to come 
before the Senate, and no other Senator is seeking recognition, I now 
move that the Senate stand adjourned sine die in accordance with the 
provisions of House Concurrent Resolution 315.
  The motion was agreed to, and the Senate, at 9:14 p.m., adjourned 
sine die.
