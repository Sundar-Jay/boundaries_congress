                     TRIBUTE TO ELEANOR UNGER INGE

  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Eleanor Unger Inge, long recognized for 
her contributions to the world of art and education, passed away on 
October 22 at her home in Mobile, AL.
  Mrs. Inge's life was one characterized by community service. She 
worked with the Mobile Public Library, the University of South Alabama 
and was president of Friends of the Saenger Center of the Arts. She 
also served on the boards of the Mobile Mental Health Association, the 
Allied Arts Council, the USA Arts Council, Mobile United, and was a 
member of the Board of Trustees of Alabama A&M University.
  Her spirit of activity and goal for betterment of the community 
reflects well on her profession of Christianity and membership of St. 
Paul's Episcopal Church.
  Earlier in her life, Mrs. Inge graduated from Smith College WAVE 
Officers School and served as a lieutenant junior grade in the U.S. 
Navy during World War II. She also attended international graduate 
school at Oxford University and the University of London.
  Eleanor Unger Inge will be missed greatly by the community which she 
served so well for so long and by all who knew her.
  My sincerest condolences are extended to Eleanor's husband, Herndon 
Inge, Jr., and their entire family during this time of sadness.
