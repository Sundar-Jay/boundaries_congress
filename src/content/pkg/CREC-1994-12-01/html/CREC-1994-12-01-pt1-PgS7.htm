                       THANKS AND CONGRATULATIONS

  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, first let me echo what I indicated earlier 
in my statement thanking the chairman, Senator Moynihan; my colleague, 
Senator Packwood; the majority leader; Secretary Bentsen; Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor; and, of course, the President of the 
United States, and to also congratulate those who were in opposition: 
The Presiding Officer, Senator Byrd, and Senator Hollings.
