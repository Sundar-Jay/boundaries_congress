                               JIM SASSER

  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about my colleague 
from Tennessee, Jim Sasser. I just cannot tell you how saddened I am 
about the decision of November 8 in Tennessee. Tomorrow, our caucus is 
going to have a vote on leadership. I am a candidate in that race. I do 
not know this evening what the outcome of that will be. It is a close 
race. But I would not be a candidate had Jim Sasser been reelected from 
Tennessee. I say with all due respect to my opponent, and I am sure he 
will appreciate this in the contest tomorrow, that had Jim Sasser been 
reelected, he would be the new minority leader of the U.S. Senate, in 
my view.
  I say this not just because I was a supporter of his, but because of 
my deep appreciation for the vision that Jim Sasser brought to the U.S. 
Senate. I was the most junior member of his Budget Committee for a 
number of years and watched a remarkable, remarkable performance by one 
United States Senator. Time after time, he marshalled the votes and 
brought together people of totally different persuasions and opinions 
on one of the most difficult jobs that any Member of this body has. 
That is to fashion a budget in the environments that we have been 
living in. And he did it successfully, on six different occasions, in 
addition to three reconciliation bills. These victories came under the 
tightest and most difficult circumstances--even in a Republican 
administration under George Bush, when he fashioned one of the most 
difficult budget compromises in modern history.
  So, let me just add to the words of my colleagues, Don Riegle and 
John Glenn, Barbara Boxer and Harlan Mathews and many others who have 
spoken about Jim Sasser's contribution to the Senate, his contribution 
to his State, and his contribution to the country.
  Let me also say that while people may look at this body through some 
objective lens, those of us who serve together here develop strong and 
deep friendships. I have developed one of those friendships with Jim 
Sasser.
  I listened to Don Riegle only a few moments ago talk about his 
father, a person who had been involved in the politics of Michigan. And 
I know of Jim Sasser's experience through his father. I had a similar 
experience with my father. We are second-generation Democrats, second-
generation members of families that believed deeply in public service.
  From his earliest days of involvement as a driver with Estes Kefauver 
to his work putting together a new party in 1973 in Tennessee, Jim 
Sasser has demonstrated over and over and over again his deep, deep 
patriotism for this country; his deep, deep love for the values that 
America holds dear.
  So, in these waning hours of the 103d Congress, I wanted to join my 
colleagues in saying to Jim that you will be missed dearly by this 
Member. I would have enjoyed nothing more--nothing more than to have 
worked with the minority leader, Jim Sasser, in trying to put together 
the creative alternatives that we are going to have to fashion in this 
coming Congress. I would have enjoyed working with him as he shepherded 
a Democratic Party in the Senate, as he had done in his State, to the 
ideals and values and principles that have been the pillars of his own 
life in public service.
  So, Jim, to you tonight, and to Mary and your children, I say God 
bless and Godspeed, but know as well that you have a lifelong friend in 
your colleague from Connecticut. Mr. President, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] 
is recognized for 10 minutes.
