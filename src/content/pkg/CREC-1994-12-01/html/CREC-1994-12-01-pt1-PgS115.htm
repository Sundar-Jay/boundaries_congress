               TRIBUTE TO U.S. MARSHAL ARTHUR D. BORINSKY

<bullet> Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to inform the U.S. 
Senate of the death of Arthur D. Borinsky, a respected Federal employee 
of New Jersey and a close personal friend.
  Mr. Borinsky served with distinction as a U.S. Marshal for 6 years 
until his recent, premature death on September 18, 1994. Arthur 
Borinsky was dedicated to the U.S. Marshal Service and will not be 
forgotten by those he served and those he served with.
  Mr. Borinsky's many accomplishments include spearheading the 
successful capture of Eddie Antar, the former head of the now defunct 
Crazy Eddie, Inc., who hid in Israel from Federal authorities after he 
was charged with stock fraud. Mr. Borinsky is also widely praised for 
his role in expediting the return of fugitive former State Senator 
David Friedland following his arrest in the Maldive Islands is the 
Indian Ocean in 1987.
  Whether his job took him across the country, across the world or just 
throughout the State, Arthur Borinsky always displayed enthusiasm, 
diligence, and the kind of professionalism that impressed his 
colleagues here in America and in countries around the world.
  Mr. Borinsky was revered by all his colleagues for his unflagging 
commitment to fighting crime. He has been praised as ``undoubtedly and 
unqestionably'' the most dedicated and best U.S. Marshal in the State 
of New Jersey.
  Arthur D. Borinsky was a truly exceptional person who dedicated his 
life to his family and friends, to crime prevention, and to his 
country. He will be missed by his many friends, by the U.S. Marshals 
Service, the State of New Jersey, and by everyone who respected him for 
his commitment to law enforcement.<bullet>
