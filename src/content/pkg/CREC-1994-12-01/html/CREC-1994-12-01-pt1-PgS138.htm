                          GLENN MILLER TRIBUTE

<bullet> Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, later this month family, friends 
and fans of the great band leader, Glenn Miller, will assemble at 
Arlington National Cemetery for a memorial service to honor his memory. 
This event will commemorate the 50th anniversary of his disappearance 
during World War II.
  I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of this man who 
I am proud to say was born in Clarinda, IA on March 1, 1904. He grew up 
in neighboring Missouri and founded the very successful Glenn Miller 
Orchestra. The band was synonomous with his distinctive ``big band'' 
style of music and gave us many memorable songs including ``Moonlight 
Serenade'' and ``Little Brown Jug''.
  Glenn Miller was a gifted musician with a popular band when he 
enlisted in the armed forces during the Second World War. He left the 
relative security of the United States for the turbulent and dangerous 
environs of Europe. This was an act of great courage and showed his 
dedication to public service.
  Then in a tragic turn of events, he disappeared on December 15, 1944, 
somewhere between Bedford, England and Paris, France. Unfortunately, he 
was the only member of the Army Air Forces Band who did not return to 
the United States after the war. He may have been lost, but he has 
certainly not been forgotten because his music still lives on.
  On December 15 we will remember Glenn Miller and celebrate his life. 
It will be a day to honor the man and his music.<bullet>
