                       THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST

  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the words 
of our colleagues, as we talked about some of our friends and fellow 
Senators who were saying goodbye on this, their last session on the 
floor of the U.S. Senate.
  I do not want this to become too funereal. These are people who are 
going to make a contribution that is important in their States and to 
our country. But something went awry, and we are losing some of the 
best people that I have met in my lifetime; but also people who have 
made a contribution that continues to enhance the value of our 
Government service in this institution that we have all fought so hard 
to join.
  Among our newer friends, Harlan Mathews, someone who had an immediate 
response from others that was always very positive. It was always good 
to see Harlan Mathews and to have him say hello, give you a pat on the 
back, encourage you. I was disappointed to hear that Harlan Mathews 
decided that he was not going to continue to try to serve here.
  Harris Wofford, from my neighboring State, who is a man with a 
mission which he served so diligently. He won a tough race the first 
time he ran. But he distinguished himself in that race and he added a 
dimension to this body and to all of us, on both sides of the aisle, 
that will last, again, way beyond his relatively short service.
  We are seeing some of the best and some of the brightest and some of 
the most caring people leave this place, all regarded with a great 
degree of sadness. George Mitchell's decision to retire; Senator 
DeConcini, Senator Metzenbaum--who has been kind of our watchdog and 
friend to all, even those who may sharply disagree with him on some 
policy matters.
  But there are a couple with whom I have had especially good 
relationship, people whose views I treasure, whose values I share, and 
whose friendships I value.
