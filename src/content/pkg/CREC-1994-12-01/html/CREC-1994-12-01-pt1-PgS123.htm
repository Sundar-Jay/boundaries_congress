              75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT

<bullet> Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a 
fine institution in upstate New York, the Syracuse University school of 
management, on the occasion of its 75th anniversary. In truth it's not 
so much the institution that is deserving of our admiration and 
respect, but the cooperative efforts of faculty, staff, and students 
over many years of change.
  Syracuse University has a long-standing tradition of being one of the 
most revered institutions in New York State and the School of 
Management has played a major role in carving out this notable legacy.
  The year was 1919, the war was over, and Americans were embracing the 
principles of scientific management for the omni-present industrial 
boom. No one embraced the business ideology more devoutly than John 
Herman Wharton, a professor of English in the college of engineering at 
Syracuse University. Wharton seemed an unlikely champion of business 
education, yet he succeeded in convincing James Roscoe Day, then 
chancellor, that there was an imminent need for sound collegiate 
business programs.
  It was an academic response to the challenge of technology which 
brought forth the school of management at Syracuse University. The 
school has been nurtured by many hands over 50 years of change 
beginning with Dean John Herman Wharton. We can all take great pride in 
the success of this school and all programs of this caliber that 
responded then and continue to respond today to the needs of our nation 
long before they become apparent to the masses. It is my hope that our 
institutions of higher learning will continue to lead the way in 
responding to our educational needs as we remain competitive in a 
global economy. I congratulate Syracuse's school of management on 75 
years of achievement, and look forward to its continued success in the 
year ahead. Thank you, Mr. President.<bullet>
