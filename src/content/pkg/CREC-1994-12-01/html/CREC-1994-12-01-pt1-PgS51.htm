                    SLOVAKIA SHOULD STAY THE COURSE

  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I recently visited Bratislava, Slovakia, 
where I met with, among others, President Michael Kovac, Foreign 
Minister Eduard Kukan, and Parliament Chairman Ivan Gasparovic. As many 
of my colleagues may know, I have a special tie to Slovakia where I 
served as a young foreign service officer at the time of the Communist 
takeover in 1948. It was indeed a pleasure to return to free Slovakia 
once again.
  This trip was particularly gratifying for me, as I presented a U.S. 
Government check to one of my former foreign service national 
employees, Frank Sporka, to compensate him for the years he spent in 
prison because of his service to the U.S. Government. As I told Mr. 
Sporka, he can never be compensated for his 7 long years of 
maltreatment and imprisonment, but that he should view the check as a 
token of the U.S. Government's high regard for his service.
  Recalling the difficult days of 1948 that ushered in 50 years of 
oppression in Slovakia, I emphasized during my meetings the importance 
that the United States places on Slovakia's democratic and economic 
progress and its continued adherence to the constitution and the rule 
of law. I was very encouraged by the commitment of those with whom I 
met to do just that.
  Slovakia is going through a very difficult period, but I hope the 
current situation will not derail the important process of creating 
institutions such as a free press, and of moving forward with 
privatization. Slovakia's desire to become more fully integrated into 
the institutions of Europe and the West will depend on its continued 
commitment to democratic and free market principles. The parliamentary 
elections held earlier this fall yielded no clear majority, although 
the Movement for Democratic Slovakia received a plurality. Party 
leaders continue discussions about forming a new government, and I am 
hopeful that the new government that emerges will stay the course.
