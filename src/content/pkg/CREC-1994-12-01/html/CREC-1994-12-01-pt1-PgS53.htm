                       GEORGE MITCHELL'S NEW JOB

  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I am delighted by the news that President 
Clinton today named Senator Mitchell to be the special adviser to the 
President and Secretary of State for economic initiatives in Ireland. 
This news is doubly welcome. First, I am pleased that the President has 
decided to create the position of an adviser on initiatives in Ireland. 
Second, I can think of no one better than George Mitchell to take on 
this difficult but extremely important task.
  Today's announcement signals President Clinton's continuing 
commitment to the peace process in Northern Ireland. I am pleased by 
the emphasis the administration has placed on trade and investment as 
an instrument of the peace process, which has been a constant theme in 
meetings with leaders from Northern Ireland, including with my good 
friend John Hume. These leaders have driven home to me the importance 
of offering economic hope to the communities torn apart by years of 
violence. Investment and trade, they have told me, are more important 
than assistance.
  In fact, I encouraged the President to create a point person for 
economic initiatives. Today's announcement, together with Commerce 
Secretary Ron Brown's upcoming trip to Belfast for a British-sponsored 
trade conference are concrete signs of the administration's commitment.
  Those of us who have served with George Mitchell know that he is the 
perfect candidate for the position of special adviser. He has a close 
working relationship with the President and the Secretary of State; he 
is well-respected by his colleagues in the Congress, who of course, are 
important partners in the administration's efforts to encourage the 
peace effort; he is known and trusted by the leaders of Ireland, 
Britain, and the various actors in Northern Ireland.
