         IS CONGRESS IRRESPONSIBLE? YOU BE THE JUDGE ABOUT THAT

  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, before contemplating today's bad news about 
the Federal debt, let's have a little pop quiz. How many million 
dollars would you say are in a trillion dollars? And when you arrive at 
an answer, remember that Congress has run up a debt exceeding $4\1/2\ 
trillion.
  To be exact, as of the close of business yesterday, Wednesday, 
November 30, the Federal debt stood down to the penny at 
$4,778,520,357,397.29. This means that every man, woman, and child in 
America owes $18,328.80 computed on a per capita basis.
  Mr. President, to answer the pop quiz question--how many million in a 
trillion--there are a million million in a trillion, for which you can 
thank the U.S. Congress for the present Federal debt of $4\1/2\ 
trillion.
