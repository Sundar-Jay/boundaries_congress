                            DENNIS DECONCINI

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as this Congress ends, I would like to 
offer a few words in tribute to a colleague who is retiring after 18 
years of distinguished service, Senator Dennis DeConcini.
  Senator DeConcini has been an able leader in the Senate's efforts to 
reduce crime, gun violence, and the use of illegal drugs. For many 
years, he worked to assure that the fight against illegal drugs 
received the attention and support of the executive and legislative 
branches. And he played an indispensable role this year in securing 
passage of a comprehensive ban on the sale of semiautomatic assault 
weapons.
  Senator DeConcini also was a leader in the Senate's successful effort 
to extend temporary safe haven to refugees from the bloodshed in El 
Salvador. Through his determined efforts, that program was enacted into 
law.
  Senator DeConcini also performed admirably as chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government on the 
Appropriations Committee. All of us know how difficult it is to 
allocate Federal dollars in this era of scarcity. Senator DcConcini did 
an excellent job in these very difficult times.
  Senator DeConcini also did an excellent job as chairman of the 
Intelligence Committee, where he diligently examined the failures of 
the CIA in the Aldrich Ames case.
  I had the privilege of serving with Senator DeConcini on the 
Judiciary Committee, where he ably chaired the Subcommittee on Patents, 
Copyrights, and Trademarks. That panel plays a tremendously important 
role in shaping our Nation's policies regarding technology, innovation, 
communications, literature, and the arts. During his tenure, Dennis 
skillfully crafted patent and copyright legislation that advanced 
consumers' interests while carefully balancing the rights of others.
  We worked closely together on a number of important measures, 
including the Visual Artists Rights Act, which enables painters and 
sculptors to prevent the desecration of their work, and legislation to 
enable biotechnology firms to better protect their innovative products.
  These are but a few of Senator DeConcini's many accomplishments. He 
was a very able Senators, skilled at finding common ground with 
Senators from both sides of the aisle.
  I want to join my colleagues in extending our very best wishes to 
Dennis DeConcini for every happiness in the years ahead.
