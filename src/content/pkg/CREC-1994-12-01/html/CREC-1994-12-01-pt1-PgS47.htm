 DEATH OF FORMER FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AIDE MILRAE JENSEN WIRSIG

  Mr. PELL. Mr. President, I regret to report that an esteemed former 
professional staff member of the Foreign Relations Committee, the 
former Milrae Jensen, died on September 20.
  Milrae Jensen was on our committee staff from 1956 until her 
retirement in 1973. For the first 2 years she was a valued assistant to 
Dr. Carl Marcy, the longtime staff director of the committee.
  Starting in 1958 she held a newly created position with 
responsibility for relations with other parliamentary bodies. In this 
capacity she arranged meetings of congressional delegations with 
international organizations, and with their counterparts in other 
countries. She was also responsible for arranging the Senate reception 
of distinguished foreign visitors.
  In 1967, Dr. Marcy nominated her for the Federal Woman's Award, 
stating ``She handles Senate relations with other parliamentary bodies 
the world over and does a magnificent job--an assertion that no less 
than two-thirds of the Senate would endorse.'' It turned out that this 
award was limited to candidates from the executive branch so Milrae 
Jensen could not be considered for it, a restriction to which Dr. Marcy 
took strong exception at the time.
  Milrae Jensen had worked previously in the State Department's Office 
of Congressional Relations where she began her service to Members of 
Congress traveling abroad. Her State Department and Foreign Relations 
Committee experience combined to make her the invaluable arranger for 
Senate participation in international meetings and Senate reception of 
foreign government leaders.
  I am one of the few Senators still serving who recalls Milrae Jensen 
and her gracious and devoted service not just to the Foreign Relations 
Committee, but to all Senators.
  After her retirement, she married former Army Maj. Gen. Otto L. 
Nelson, Jr., who died in 1985. In 1990 she married Woodrow Wirsig and 
moved to Florida. At the time of her death she was traveling with her 
husband on a cruise to the Far East. She is survived by her husband, a 
brother, and three nieces.
  She is remembered for her many years of dedicated service to Members 
of this body.
