                               DON RIEGLE

  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier in this session of Congress, I had 
the opportunity to speak regarding my good friend, Don Riegle, who made 
the decision not to seek reelection this year. He served with 
distinction as my chairman on the Banking Committee. I served on other 
committees and in other capacities with him during my 14 years here in 
the U.S. Senate. We have served in the minority together and the 
majority together. We have been through election cycles together.
  I will not repeat what I said earlier about him, but I think all of 
our colleagues here, regardless of party, feel the same way about Don 
Riegle and his tremendous contribution to this Nation, to his State, to 
the Senate. He will be sorely missed, I think, by all of us.
