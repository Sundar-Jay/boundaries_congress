               WISHING SENATOR THURMOND A HAPPY BIRTHDAY

  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, I did want to note that the distinguished 
Senator from South Carolina is on the floor, and next week he will be 
celebrating his 92nd birthday.
  We certainly all join in wishing our friend and our colleague Senator 
Thurmond a happy and prosperous not only birthday but several more 
years. I understand he is considering term limits. I am not certain. 
But we know he is going to have a happy birthday.
  [Applause.]
  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind remarks of our 
able leader. I will be 92 December 5th, but 92 years young. I feel 
active and as if I were only half that age.
  I appreciate the friendship of all the Members of the Senate and 
their cooperation and courtesies extended to me, and I thank all of 
them from the bottom of my heart.
  [Applause.]
  Mr. COHEN addressed the Chair.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.
