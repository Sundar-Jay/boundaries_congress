                    STATE REPRESENTATIVE JIM SIMPSON

  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago, my State of Mississippi 
lost one of its finest public officials when former State 
representative, Jim Simpson, died.
  Many of my colleagues know Bill Simpson, who was a key staff member 
for Senator James D. Eastland and President Jimmy Carter.
  Bill Simpson delivered the eulogy at his older brother Jim's funeral, 
and I invite Senators to read it. While it conveys in an eloquent way 
the special bond of friendship and love among the members of Jim 
Simpson's fine family, it reminds all of us in public office how 
important our priorities really are.
  Incidentially, Jim Simpson was one of the most effective, hard-
working, and respected members who has ever served in our State 
legislature. He died while working for the election of his son to serve 
in the seat he had held for over 20 years, and I am sure his son will 
be a distinguished and successful representative, too.
  With a loving and supporting family of Simpsons on his side, he 
cannot miss.
  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the eulogy of Bill Simpson be 
printed in the Record.
  There being no objection, the eulogy was ordered to be printed in the 
Record, as follows:

 Eulogy Offered for James C. Simpson, November 11, 1994, by William G. 
                                Simpson

       I would offer a few remarks about my only brother and my 
     faithful friend.
       This day, Veterans Day, is the time for me to speak of a 
     brave and proud Marine. He was a forward observer for 
     artillery in Korea out in front where danger was ever 
     present.
       He brought his dedication to duty home with him. He was 
     always willing to put himself in harm's way to take the risks 
     to protect and serve others.
       When he was chosen by his people to go to the legislature, 
     he did two great things.
       First, when he raised his hand and committed himself to 
     well and faithfully discharge the duties of his office. He 
     was not participating in a ceremony. He was binding himself 
     to what he saw as a solemn duty.
       Second, the term representative was not a title to him. It 
     was the sum of his mission. He sought with all his strength 
     to represent the citizens of his district and of this 
     beautiful coast and of the State he loved.
       Seven times his people sent him to Jackson to be out in 
     front for them and at the end of a distinguished career. He 
     returned the office to them with the honored term integrity 
     engraved upon it.
       I would tell you from my heart, several personal things.
       The bond between my brother and me stretched from his birth 
     to this day and will stretch into the future until the end of 
     my life.
       He was my always friend: Through my service in the 
     Governor's office to Senator Eastland's office, to the White 
     House, and to the present. He was there: Solid as a rock to 
     advise to guide, to encourage, to remind me that we are not 
     here to curse the darkness, we are here to light a candle.
       My other observation deals with family and with abiding 
     love.
       Jim loved the wife he was blessed with. He loved his 
     children and their mates and their children. He loved his 
     brother and my family and his sister and her family. To close 
     this shining circle each of us returned his love in full 
     measure.
       During the passage of the Simpson family through this 
     valley of sadness, you should know that our hearts have been 
     lifted and our spirits strengthened by the flood of affection 
     and support that many hundreds of friends, like those 
     gathered here, have given so freely to us.
       Finally, even on an occasion like this one, something so 
     right occurs that it must be marked.
       I would point to the small group who are Jim's pallbearers 
     today. He shared with them his hopes and dreams and his life. 
     They carried each other for more than a quarter of a century. 
     I wish I possessed the talent to say how far they have 
     carried this State and her people. It is fitting and proper 
     that they should bear Jim to his rest from the labors that 
     will now be taken up by one of his beloved sons.
       As we bid farewell to this good and decent man, let us take 
     comfort from the certain knowledge that Jim Simpson fought 
     the good fight. He finished the course. He kept the faith.
