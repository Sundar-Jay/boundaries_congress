                   RETIREMENT OF LINDA STOLL-ANDERSON

<bullet> Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is always tough to see a 
dedicated public servant step down when they are at the top of their 
game. Linda Stoll-Anderson of Helena, MT, is retiring as a 12-year 
commissioner for Lewis and Clark County, but not before making her 
community a better place in which to live.
  Linda serves as an outstanding example of a public servant. She is 
honest and patient. She works hard. She's a great mediator. She's 
extremely bright. She never stops putting Montana and Lewis and Clark 
County first.
  Her passion about environmental issues has been inspirational. For 
many years, Linda has been dedicated to maintaining what makes Montana 
the last best place, in particular, protecting our beautiful Rocky 
Mountain front. I know, because I worked with Linda to preserve many 
acres of this pristine land. When some would settle for less, Linda 
held true to her principles.
  I hate to see her go. Based on her track record, I know she has a 
promising future in whatever she chooses to pursue next. She and her 
husband Bob, who serves as a public service commissioner in Montana, 
are highly committed to our State. They demonstrate it each day in 
their work. I wish them both well.<bullet>
