                 TRIBUTE TO SENATOR GEORGE J. MITCHELL

  Mr. COHEN. I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague from Maine, 
Senator George Mitchell. Today is the final day of the 103d Congress 
and marks the end of Senator Mitchell's service after more than 14 
years of representing Maine in the U.S. Senate. From a quiet young 
lawyer in Waterville, ME, has come a great leader who has done his 
country and his State proud.
  George Mitchell had big shoes to fill when he was appointed to 
Senator Muskie's seat 14 years ago. When he first came to the Senate, 
I, in the infinite wisdom I had as Maine's senior Senator, offered to 
take him under my wing and show him the Senate ropes. In retrospect, 
that offer was a little like Larry Bird offering to give instruction to 
Michael Jordan on how to improve his vertical leap.
  Most of you know that we share much more than just the position of 
Senator from Maine. We both grew up in similar circumstances. with very 
similar backgrounds. Senator Mitchell is half Irish, and half Lebanese. 
I am half Irish and half Jewish. We both graduated from Bowdoin 
College. We both become lawyers before entering public service. And we 
wrote a book together that produced many headlines and only a few 
royalties. But I must tell you it was a great experience for both of 
us.

  Since his elevation to majority leader, like Michael Jordan, he 
continues, along with Bob Dole, to play well above the rim. There have 
been countless articles speculating on the reasons for his dramatic 
rise in the Senate. There is a Chinese proverb that says ``when 
drinking the water, don't forget to remember those who dug the well.'' 
I think to really understand George Mitchell's success one needs to 
look no further than the fact that he had Ed Muskie as his mentor. Ed 
provided Senator Mitchell with the basic principles of public service 
which I think have guided him over the years. And I think it is no 
surprise that the Senate majority leader demonstrates many of the 
attributes of Senator Muskie, who had an abundance of intelligence, 
integrity, and independence. I believe Oscar Wilde must have had 
someone like George in mind when he said: ``I can stand brute force, 
but brute reason is quite unbearable. There is something unfair about 
its use. It's hitting below the intellect.''
  Senator Mitchell has always hit well above not only the belt but the 
intellect as well.
  Mr. President, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote:

       I have always thought that not place or power or popularity 
     makes the success that one desires, but the trembling hope 
     that one has come near to an ideal. The only ground that 
     warrants a man for thinking that he is not living the fool's 
     paradise if he ventures such a hope is the voice of a few 
     masters. I feel it so much I don't want to talk about it.

  George Mitchell comes as close to the ideal public servant that I 
know. His voice has reminded those of us that believe public service is 
a noble calling that we are not living a fool's paradise. We are truly 
going to miss him--and I feel it so much, I don't want to talk about 
it.
  I yield the floor, Mr. President.
  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator 
Cohen very much for his generous remarks. It has been a true pleasure 
for me to serve with him in the Senate, and under him--I as the junior 
Senator, he as the senior Senator from Maine. We have worked closely in 
behalf of the people of our State and in the process have become close 
personally. I am honored to serve as a Senator with Senator Cohen to 
represent the people of Maine, but most of all, I treasure and value 
his friendship.
  I am very deeply grateful and moved by his remarks here this evening.
  Mr. DeCONCINI addressed the Chair.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.
  Mr. DeCONCINI. I ask unanimous consent that I may extend my remarks 
beyond the 10-minute period of time for morning business.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
