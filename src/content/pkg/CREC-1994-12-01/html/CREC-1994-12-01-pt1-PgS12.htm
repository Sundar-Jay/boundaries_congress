                     ACCOLADES TO SENATOR MITCHELL

  Mr. DeCONCINI. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from Maine in 
offering my accolades to the majority leader. I have already done so 
before we recessed last month. But no one has served this body as well 
as he has. We have had some distinguished Members here, but Senator 
Mitchell has consistently been a true leader in the most effective way.
