                THE DEPARTURE OF SENATOR HARRIS WOFFORD

  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to salute 
the Senate career of our colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Harris 
Wofford. Senator Wofford can leave this body proud of an impressive 
list of accomplishments during a relatively brief tenure here in the 
Senate.
  Senator Wofford brought a lifetime of public service to his role as 
United States Senator. Prior to being appointed to the Senate, he had 
served as an assistant to President Kennedy, an advisor to Dr. Martin 
Luther King, a founder of the Peace Corps and a college president. In 
all these positions he worked to protect the rights and opportunities 
of all Americans no matter their color, age or economic standing--a 
fight he has continued here in the Senate.
  Perhaps more than anyone, Senator Wofford is responsible for placing 
health care at the top of our nation's agenda. His election to this 
body reflected the widespread insecurity felt by America's middle-class 
about their health care coverage and gave many of us in Congress the 
impetus to take action.
  Senator Wofford has worked to author several key reform efforts and I 
wholeheartedly agree with him that we must reach consensus on health 
care, and that we must do it sooner rather than later. While we have 
not been able to reach a viable solution yet, his work on the issue has 
certainly brought us closer to giving Americans a health care system on 
which they can depend.
  Although well known for his work on health care, Senator Wofford has 
also played a major role on other important issues facing American 
families during the past three years. Last year he sponsored the 
National and Community Service Act which provides college funds for the 
youth of this country in exchange for community service. I recall 
Senator Wofford's call for an American Peace Corps as he successfully 
managed the bill through the Senate. And because of his efforts, 
Congress passed legislation making it easier for middle-class families 
to pay for their children's college education.
  Mr. President, based on his previous achievements it is clear Harris 
Wofford does not need to be a United States Senator to make a positive 
difference in the lives of middle-class America. I have no doubt he 
will continue to ably serve this country outside this chamber and to 
play a major role in the fight for health care security for all 
Americans. He has served the people of Pennsylvania with great 
distinction and as he prepares to depart, he should do so with the 
satisfaction of a job well done.
