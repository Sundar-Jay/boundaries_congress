                     THE CANADAIGUA TREATY OF 1794

<bullet> Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of 
the oldest and most respected treaties ever written in New York State. 
The Canadaigua Treaty of 1794 signed between the United States and the 
people of the Six Nations of Indians, established a firm and permanent 
friendship which has lasted two hundred years. In recognizing this 
treaty, we also recognize the many great things accomplished all over 
New York State through the team work of the Haudenosaunee and the 
descendants of all those who have settled in New York State. Together 
our State has grown and prospered, always respecting the rights of all 
who live within our borders.
  The Treaty of 1794 served as a model to the entire United States. The 
friendship that it recognized on paper has grown into a bond which 
knows no separation. The American Frontier had seen much bloodshed. 
People from all over the globe came to America to escape injustice and 
begin new lives, free of oppression. As the fight for expansion raged 
on in the West, the people of the Six Nations of Indians worked with 
their new neighbors to establish what would serve all in the United 
States as a model of peace and understanding based on trust and 
respect.
  The first article of the treaty proclaims the underlying theme of the 
entire agreement--peace and friendship. That friendship has remained 
for 200 years, and continues to grow as we work together.
  The second through fourth Article establishes the recognized 
boundaries between the United States and the Haudenosaunee. The focus 
is mutual respect and an understanding that the United States, having 
acknowledged what lands belong to the Six Nations ``will never claim 
the same, nor disturb the Six Nations people or their Indian friends in 
the free use of and enjoyment thereof''.
  The last Article of the Canandaigua Treaty, article No. 7, 
incorporates the spirit of cooperation and the sense of justice which 
both signatories held so sacred. Article 7 establishes ``that, for 
injuries done by individuals, on either side, no private revenge or 
retaliation shall be made by the party injured, to the other; but, 
instead thereof, complaint shall be made by the party injured, to the 
other''.
  The celebration of the Canandaigua Treaty of 1794 is a celebration of 
friendship and cooperation. This day is important because it 
commemorates that great spirit of friendship which keeps our separate 
communities together. I congratulate the people of Canandaigua and the 
Haudenosaunee.
