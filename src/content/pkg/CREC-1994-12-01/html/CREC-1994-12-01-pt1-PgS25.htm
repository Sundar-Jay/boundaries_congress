                               DON RIEGLE

  Mr. LAUTENBERG. First, Senator Don Riegle. No one ever stood on this 
floor and presented the case with more force, with more commitment, 
with more diligence, with more sincerity, to serve his community and 
his country than my friend, Don Riegle. I learned a lot from Don, and 
so much of it was beyond the process.
  But more important, I think, was the need to feel something really 
deeply and fight for it, stand up for it, even on the most contentious 
issue where he served a minority view: tenacious and deliberate--good 
guy.
