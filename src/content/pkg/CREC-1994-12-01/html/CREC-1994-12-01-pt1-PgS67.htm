                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MITCHELL

  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, soon the 103d Congress will be history. 
The end of the 103d Congress also will mean the end of the historic and 
distinguished career of Senator George Mitchell as the majority leader 
of this body. Mr. President, today, I want to pay tribute to a man that 
every Member of this body holds in the highest regard.
  Earlier this year, Senator Mitchell was mentioned as a candidate for 
commissioner of baseball. He was asked about dealing with the egos of 
the 28 baseball owners. His reply, that the commissioner's job would be 
a 72-percent reduction from his role as Senate majority leader, has now 
become famous. But I think his reply also illustrates Senator 
Mitchell's approach to what is surely one of the most difficult jobs in 
Washington. There are 100 Members of the U.S. Senate. We come from 50 
different States. We are members of different political parties, and we 
represent a wide variety of personalities, views, and political 
philosophies. Yet, we are able to work together. Our successes over the 
years are in no small part due to the fairness, perseverance, integrity 
and the good humor of Senate Majority Leader Mitchell. I know that many 
of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--even while they might 
have disagreed with him on various issues--respect Senator Mitchell's 
ability to deal with them fairly. Senator Alan Simpson, the minority 
whip, recently said of Senator Mitchell: ``Not once, ever did he do 
anything he said he would not do. He wouldn't cut a corner.'' All of us 
who have served with Senator Mitchell would agree with that assessment.
  It has been my great pleasure to serve with the distinguished 
majority leader. Like many of my colleagues, I have admired his 
intelligence, his patience, and his steady leadership. As majority 
leader, he guided legislation through this body with great skill. As a 
Senator representing the citizens of Maine, he worked diligently on 
behalf of his constituents, just as he worked for the well-being of 
Americans throughout the Nation.
  We all know George Mitchell could have left this body earlier this 
year and taken his place on the Nation's highest court. There is little 
doubt he would have served in that capacity with great distinction, and 
continued to make a significant difference in the history of our 
country. But he chose not to take that opportunity. Instead, he decided 
to remain in the Senate and to attempt to reform our national health 
care system. Mr. President, he made that decision because of his deep 
and sincere dedication to accomplishing a goal he felt was in the best 
interests of our Nation. He put the national interest above his 
personal interest.
  While we were not able to pass legislation reforming our Nation's 
health care system this year, it was certainly not due to a lack of 
commitment or determination on the part of the distinguished Senator 
from Maine. Senator Mitchell put his personal convictions ahead of 
personal gain, and demonstrated to every other public servant the true 
meaning of public service.
  In that spirit of public service, Senator Mitchell has established a 
scholarship fund with the remainder of his campaign fund and the 
donations of many, many generous people from across the country. That 
fund will help needy and deserving students receive a higher education. 
At the fundraising dinner for the scholarship bearing the majority 
leader's name, George Mitchell said: ``Public service must be and is 
its own reward, for it does not guarantee wealth, popularity, or 
respect.'' I know many of us share those sentiments.
  While he may be correct that serving in the Senate does not guarantee 
those things, Senator Mitchell has earned the respect and admiration of 
his colleagues. He will leave this Chamber with a wealth of memories of 
legislative battles--he has won some impressive victories, and suffered 
some disappointing defeats. But above it all, he has earned the respect 
of everyone who has had the privilege of working with him. Although he 
may be retiring from the Senate, I know that will not mean the end of 
his desire to serve his country.
  Indeed, just today President Bill Clinton announced that George 
Mitchell has agreed to serve as a special U.S. adviser for economic 
initiatives in Ireland. As that troubled area moves toward ending 
decades of violence and confrontation, efforts to ensure economic 
stability and growth will be an essential part of helping Northern 
Ireland achieve peace and prosperity. The President said he needed 
someone of ``great talent, great stature and great wisdom'' for the job 
as special economic adviser to Northern Ireland. Mr. President, I think 
all of us who have served with Senator Mitchell agree the President has 
found the right man. All of us in this Chamber have been fortunate to 
serve with him in the Senate, and his steady and distinguished presence 
will be missed.
