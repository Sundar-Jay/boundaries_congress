                             HARLAN MATHEWS

  Mr. DODD. Harlan Mathews, we only served a short time together. But 
friendships can be formed in a short period of time. I feel as though I 
have a new friend in Harlan Mathews. We sat on the same committee, the 
Foreign Relations Committee. We got to be good colleagues and worked 
together. He served his State well. He came here under different 
circumstances, being asked to replace our colleague, Al Gore, and he 
did a great job in serving his State, serving the Senate.
  I can say to you, Harlan, that even though you may have been here 
only a short time, you have left a lasting impression and you have 
permanent friends.
