                         TRIBUTE TO KEN HARPER

<bullet> Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a 
great Kentucky Republican for his excellence in representing a portion 
of northern Kentucky in Kentucky's General Assembly for 18 years. Mr. 
Ken Harper did not seek re-election this year and plans to retire in 
January after his current term expires.
  Mr. Harper was first elected in 1963, but gave up his seat later that 
decade to serve the citizens of Kentucky in other capacities, including 
Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Child Welfare and Secretary 
of State for former Governor Louie Nunn. In 1981, he was once again 
elected to Kentucky's General Assembly for the 63d House seat. He 
subsequently ran unopposed in three of his six re-elections. Mr. Harper 
served on many committees including the Appropriations and Revenue 
Committee, Program Review and Investigations Committee and the Tourism 
and Energy Committee, where he served as vice chairman.
  Throughout his tenure in public service, Mr. Harper has continued to 
operate his realty company in Northern Kentucky. After retiring, he 
plans to focus on this business, as well as spend more time with his 
six grandchildren. Among his major accomplishments, he lists 
legislation that helped create Northern Kentucky University and a flood 
prevention project on the Doe Run Lake in Kenton County.
  Mr. Harper is a graduate of the Kentucky Military Institute [KMI] and 
has been honored many times. In 1963, he was the Outstanding Young Man 
of Kentucky. In 1966, he received the KMI Humanitarian Award, and in 
1980 he received the Walter L. Pieschel Award from the Northern 
Kentucky Chamber of Commerce.
  Mr. Harper's hard work and dedication has proven to be a great asset 
to Kentucky's 63d House District and will be missed in that district 
and the entire Commonwealth.<bullet>
