                         VERMONT GAINS A LEADER

  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday Vermont's Gov. Howard Dean 
announced that Theresa Alberghini will become the head of Vermont's 
Health Care Authority. It is one of the most challenging, difficult 
jobs in all of Vermont. In Theresa Alberghini, Governor Dean could not 
have made a better choice. Theresa is my legislative director, and has 
been my senior adviser on health care matters for many years.
  Governor Dean takes his commitment to providing health insurance to 
every Vermonter seriously. In Theresa, he has hired a brilliant, loyal 
Vermonter who will help make that commitment happen.
  Theresa began working in my office almost 10 years ago, answering 
phones in my front office. From there, she has risen to become one of 
the most senior and respected staff members on Capitol Hill. Her 
knowledge of health care issues is unsurpassed. Her ability to work 
with everyone, whether they are the largest corporations in our 
society, or those Americans with the greatest needs but the quietest 
voices, is one of her greatest strengths.
  Theresa is one of my closest advisers. She is also a close friend. A 
native of Barre who grew up in Burlington, Theresa has served our 
Nation with distinction. Her parents, Roy and Concetta Alberghini, 
should be proud of their daughter. The people of Vermont are lucky that 
one of their native daughters is coming home.
