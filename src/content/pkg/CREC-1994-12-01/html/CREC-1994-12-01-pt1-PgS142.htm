             TRIBUTE TO NAVY CAPT. (SELECT) NANCY LESCAVAGE

<bullet> Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, as the 103d Congress draws to a 
close, I want to pay tribute to a distinguished naval officer who has 
served as a Congressional Science Fellow on my staff for the past 21 
months, Capt. Nancy Lescavage, U.S. Navy. As the first Navy Nurse 
selected for this highly coveted fellowship, her impeccable credentials 
quickly earned her the highest respect and admiration of the Senator 
staff. She promptly distinguished herself as a professional who 
possesses an infectious demeanor and exudes tremendous integrity, 
incisive leadership, political savvy, and a keen business acumen. The 
epitome of a naval officer, Captain Lescavage is the consummate 
professional who embodies not only visionary thinking but also the 
ability to operationalize these visions and see them through no 
completion.
  Captain Lescavage joined my office in the midst of one of the most 
controversial debates of our times--the reform of our Nation's health 
care delivery system. As the sole representative of all military 
nurses, she immediately and capably tackled complex health care issues 
as they came before the various congressional committees. While most of 
the debate focused on national health care reform without regard for 
its potential effect on our Nation's military, it is important to note 
that the military health care system is among the world's largest with 
over 8.3 million beneficiaries. It was and is absolutely critical that 
any health care reform reflect the needs of our military health care 
system that is at the foundation of military readiness. This was 
Captain Lescavage's charge when she came to my office. As this office's 
dominant force behind our national and military health care 
initiatives, she worked tirelessly with the Senate Appropriations 
Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, the 
Senate Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations, and the Senate 
Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations, and the Senate Armed Services 
Committee in an effort to realize the strategic goals of our evolving 
national health care systems. This was accomplished in a manner that 
would be consistent with any eventual health care reform.
  As a recognized authority on health care, Captain Lescavage's 
expertise was in constant demand as a speaker and writer. She authored 
a book and journal articles; she has been involved in a myriad of 
speaking engagements and interviews. At significant personal sacrifice, 
she eagerly sought each and every opportunity to advance the health 
care goals and vision of America.
  In all my years in the Congress, I have rarely seen such dedication. 
Captain Lescavage is an officer of whom the military and our Nation can 
and should be justifiably proud. As she leaves my office, I want to 
personally and publicly acknowledge my sincere appreciation to Captain 
Lescavage for her dedicated months of exemplary service and to bid her 
a fond aloha and heartfelt mahalo.<bullet>
