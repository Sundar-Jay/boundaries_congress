                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM POPE SWIFT, JR.

  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, longtime Selma, AL businessman William 
Pope Swift, Jr. passed away on September 26 in Birmingham. Bill was 
president of Swift Drug Co., where he practiced pharmacy for more than 
40 years.
  Bill Swift received his bachelor's degree in pharmacy from the 
Alabama Polytechnic Institute--now Auburn University--in 1940, and 
served in the U.S. Army Air Corps during World War II. His college and 
military years were the only periods of his life during which Bill was 
away from Selma. He was an avid sportsman and successful trainer and 
handler of field trial bird dogs, including two national champions.
  In Selma, Swift Drug Co. has been a part of downtown for longer than 
most of its residents can remember, just as it seemed Bill Swift had 
been filling prescriptions forever for hundreds of Selmians. Bill was 
known for his wit and friendly manner, which contributed significantly 
to his professional success. His leadership and generosity will be 
greatly missed not only among his family and friends, but throughout 
Selma, Dallas County, and the Black Belt.
  I extend my sincerest condolences to Bill's wife Cornelia Morrissette 
Swift and their entire family in the wake of this loss.
