                                 prayer

  The Chaplain, the Reverend Richard C. Halverson, D.D., offered the 
following prayer:
  Let us pray:
  And we know that God works in everything for good to those who love 
Him and are called according to His purpose.--Romans 8:28.
  Gracious God our heavenly Father, on this last day of the 103d 
Congress we want to thank You for all of its achievements and for 
faithful Senators who will not be with us in the 104th. We ask Thy 
blessing upon them and their loved ones, and we pray that Thou wilt 
surprise them with the good things You have planned for them, for which 
their time in the Senate was preparation. Fill them with a sense of 
Your love and the plans You have for them in the future.
  Loving Lord, You know how traumatic an election can be for staff 
people whose Senators were not reelected. We thank You for those who 
have found work, and we pray for those who are hurting because, up to 
this time, they have not found a place in which to serve. May Thy grace 
fill their hearts as they remember that they have not been forgotten, 
either by God or by those for whom or with whom they labored so 
faithfully. Encourage them in the confidence that You have a plan for 
their lives and will guide and protect and fulfill. Let Thy blessing 
rest upon all who experience the many changes that are inherent in a 
new Congress.
  In the name of Him who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Amen.
