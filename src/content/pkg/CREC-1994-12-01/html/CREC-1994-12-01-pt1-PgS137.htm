              NATIONAL STANDARDS FOR CIVICS AND GOVERNMENT

<bullet> Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this 
opportunity to go on record indicating my strong support for the 
National Standards for Civics and Government that were unveiled by the 
Center for Civic Education earlier this month.
  These voluntary content standards will help our schools educate 
students to be responsible citizens who are knowledgeable about 
American constitutional democracy. They are the result of collaboration 
by over 3,000 groups and individuals and are a resource local school 
systems can use to develop their own civics curricula. The future of 
our great National depends on our youth, and a strong civics background 
is a prerequisite for an informed citzenry. The new guidelines are 
organized around five questions that cover such issues as the duties of 
citizens, the foundations of American democracy, and definitions of 
politics and government. They also emphasize the role of State and 
local governments in the American political system.
  American adults are often criticized for low voter turnout and lack 
of interest in the political process. Education is the best way to 
combat such disinterest. The National Standards for Civics and 
Government, which are designed to focus civics education as early as 
kindergarten, will provide a foundation for our young people to build 
on to become the responsible leaders of tomorrow, leaders committed to 
perpetuating the fundamental values of our constitutional democracy.
  I would also like to use this occasion to express my support for the 
continued growth and success of the ``We The People--The Citizen and 
the Constitution'' program administered by the Center for Civic 
Education. Millions of students have participated in the program, 
learning lessons that will stay with them throughout their lives, which 
confirm that our republic can thrive only when citizens remain engaged 
in the debate of politics and governing.
  We must continue to encourage civic education for our young people. 
Programs like We The People and guidelines such as those issued by the 
Center for Civic Education will ensure that American students are 
prepared to enter the 21st century as active citizens who have taken 
the principles of American democratic government to heart.<bullet>
