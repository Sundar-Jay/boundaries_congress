        HAWAII AIR NATIONAL GUARD'S HOLIDAY FAIR WILL BE TURKEY

  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as we enter the holiday season, on December 
3, some 200 members of the Hawaii Air National Guard's 154th Operations 
Group will be taking off for Turkey--the country, that is. There, they 
will become a part of Operation ``Provide Comfort II,'' furnishing 
protection to Iraqi Kurds by preventing Iraqi air forces from flying 
above the 36th parallel. Return to Hawaii is expected to take place on 
or about January 12 of next year.
  The move is intended to temporarily relieve active duty forces who 
are stationed in Europe. In January, the 154th itself will be replaced 
by members of the Louisiana Air National Guard.
  The 20 F-15 pilots attached to the 199th Fighter Squadron and the 120 
maintenance and support personnel accompanying them will be a half-
world away from their families during the Christmas and New Year 
season. Still, as Maj. Wayne ``Wildman'' Wakeman told a local newspaper 
recently, his family knows ``it's important that we do this, so they 
feel like they're participating by letting me go. We'll celebrate some 
other time.'' 1st Lt. Wade ``Ninja'' Oganeku stated it most simply and 
directly: ``It's our turn to go. This is what we signed up to do.''
  That, of course, is true. These dedicated individuals have willingly 
accepted the obligation of answering their country's call--whenever 
that call may come. To them, they are just doing their jobs. 
Nonetheless, as a fervently and deservedly proud representative of 
Hawaii, I raise this matter for one reason * * * that it is too-often 
forgotten that the Aloha State is as integral a facet of all our 
Nation's affairs as any other.
  In specific point of fact, the 154th Group is more than integral. It 
is exemplary. This September, it was presented its fifth Distinguished 
Flying Unit Plaque from the National Guard Association of the United 
States. It is also a five-time recipient of the U.S. Air Force 
Outstanding Unit Award.
  I pay high tribute to these committed citizens of Hawaii and the 
families who sustain them. The sacrifices you make in service to your 
country are acknowledged with profound gratitude.
