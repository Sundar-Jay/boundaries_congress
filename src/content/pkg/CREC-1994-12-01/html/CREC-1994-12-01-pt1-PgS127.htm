                    RETIREMENT OF ``PINKY'' THOMPSON

<bullet> Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, yesterday marked the retirement of 
one of the foremost contributors to native Hawaiian education, Myron 
Thompson, known as Pinky to his many friends.
  Pinky is one of those rare individuals that very few of us ever have 
the opportunity to meet, but when we do, our own lives are forever 
changed in a most unusual and positive manner. He is without question 
the dedicated public servant who is always there when needed, who 
actively shuns receiving credit for what he has accomplished, and who 
truly possesses national vision. Many years ago, my mother as a very 
young child was adopted by a native Hawaiian family and as I was 
growing up, she constantly reminded me of the importance of the 
inherent value that native Hawaiian people have always placed on family 
and country. I have never forgotten her words and have been pleased to 
work closely with Pinky for decades on behalf of these indigenous 
peoples and especially their children and families.
  I still vividly recall the first time that any U.S. Secretary of 
Education ever met with native Hawaiians to discuss their pressing and 
unique educational needs. That meeting was held in then-Secretary 
Terrence Bell's office with Pinky, then-Representative Dan Akaka--the 
first native Hawaiian to serve in Congress--and myself. From that 
meeting more than a decade ago, a whole new generation of impressive 
health and educational programs have evolved. Programs that focus on 
the unique needs of children and their families; programs that work and 
that have become inspirational models for all our Nation's children, 
not only for native Hawaiians.
  I could cite similar incidents of Pinky's leadership in the job 
training and health care arena, and equally importantly, in ensuring 
that native American cultures will thrive and be appreciated for 
generations to come. His son, Nainoa, following Pinky's vision, with 
only the guiding light of the stars and his cultural heritage, has 
navigated the ``Hokule'a'' throughout the Pacific waters, in so doing 
giving life to the history of native Hawaiians. This is the legacy that 
Pinky leaves us. Truly impressive accomplishments that very few have 
ever even dreamed to seek.
  Pinky retired yesterday as chairman of the board of trustees for 
Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate, after a distinguished service 
spanning 20 years. He was born and raised in Hawaii, and in his 70 
years of life has managed to involve himself in nearly every 
educational program Hawaii offers for its native Hawaiian citizens.
  As trustee for Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, he helped guide the 
expansion of educational programs throughout the Hawaiian community, 
reaching over 30,000 people each year. His foresight and support 
enabled Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate to create alternative 
education programs for at-risk students, such as Healthy Start and Safe 
Hawaii, which envisions a safe, healthy, and violence-free Hawaii in 
two generations.
  I am convinced that Pinky will continue to guide the programs he was 
so involved in during his trusteeship: the Native Hawaiian Health Act, 
and the Native Hawaiian Education Act.
  His motivation to improve the well-being and cultural pride of the 
Hawaiian community is rooted in the philosophy of self-help. He 
believes education is the key to addressing a variety of concerns 
within the Hawaiian community, including health, employment, and 
substance abuse.
  I commend this man for his many years of commitment to native 
Hawaiians and the State of Hawaii. I am sure he will remain just as 
active in retirement as he has been in the past.
  On behalf of the people of Hawaii, I extend to Mr. Myron Thompson our 
fondest aloha. I wish him the very best in navigating new waters and 
know he will sail on as a champion of native Hawaiians and native 
Americans everywhere.<bullet>
