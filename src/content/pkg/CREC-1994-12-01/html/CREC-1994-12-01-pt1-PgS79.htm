                         ROSS EARL THOMAS, SR.

  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, on November 19, 1994, Mr. Ross Earl 
Thomas, Sr., passed away. Mr. Thomas was an employee of the Sergeant at 
Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate with 24 years of Federal service.
  In 1954 he enlisted in the U.S. Army and during his military career 
he served in Europe and Asia. In 1963, Mr. Thomas attended Officers 
Candidate School at Fort Benning, GA and was commissioned as a second 
lieutenant in the U.S. Signal Corp. He served in the Vietnam War at 
which time he received many awards and decorations, including the 
Bronze Star. During his distinguished military career, he served as a 
member of the elite Green Beret. In 1976, he retired from the Army with 
the rank of Major.
  In June 1992, Mr. Thomas joined the staff of the Senate Sergeant at 
Arms as Supervisor of Environmental Services. He took great pride in 
his position as caretaker of the U.S. Capitol Building. Through his 
efforts, remarkable strides have been made to improve facility services 
and to meet the needs of Members of the Senate. As a result of his hard 
work, many visitors to the U.S. Capitol have been provided the 
opportunity to view this historic building at its very best. Mr. Thomas 
will be sincerely missed by all and on behalf of the Senate, I extend 
our sincere sympathy to his family.
