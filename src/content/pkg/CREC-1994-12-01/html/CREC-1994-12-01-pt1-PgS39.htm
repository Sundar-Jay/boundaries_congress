                   RETIREMENT PROTECTION ACT OF 1994

  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to 
recognize the many staff people who played an important role in 
crafting the Retirement Protection Act of 1994, the pension reform 
legislation that is in title VII of the GATT implementing bill.
  Staff of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation have provided 
invaluable assistance to the Finance Committee in this regard. In 
particular, I wish to thank Martin Slate, PBGC's executive Director; 
Judy Schub, Assistant Executive Director for Legislative Affairs; Nell 
Hennessy, Chief Negotiator; William Posner, Chief Operating Officer; 
Stuart Sirkin, head of the Corporate Planning and Research Department; 
Carol Connor Flowe, General Counsel; and their staffs, most notably, 
William Beyer, Terrence Deneen, Deborah Forbes, Russlyn Guritz, Richard 
Ippolito, William James, Leslie Kramerich, Linda Mizzi, Mrichael Rae, 
Gail Sevin, and Gretchen Young.
  Special note should be made of the actuaries whose advice and testing 
of alternative proposals helped us formulate major changes to the 
complex pension funding rules: from the PBGC, C. David Gustafson, Jane 
Pacelli, Eric Palley, Gary Gilliam, John Langhans, and Ruth Williams; 
from the Office of Benefits Tax Counsel at the Treasury Department, 
Harlan Weller; and from the IRS, James Holland.
  The Treasury Department also provided us with the invaluable 
assistance of Leslie Samuels, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy; 
Randolf Hardock, Benefits Tax Counsel; and Mark Iwry, Deputy Benefits 
Tax Counsel.
  Finally, I would like to express my appreciation to Joe Gale, Will 
Sollee, Mark Prater, and Doug Fisher on the tax staff of the Finance 
Committee, whose tireless efforts to smooth out the rough edges in the 
legislation made it possible to include the Retirement Protection Act 
in GATT.
