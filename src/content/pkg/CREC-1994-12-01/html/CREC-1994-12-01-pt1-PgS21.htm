                             HARRIS WOFFORD

  Mr. DODD. Harris Wofford, as someone who was involved in the earliest 
days of the Peace Corps, had a significant impact on me at an early 
age. He was one of those who literally created and founded the Peace 
Corps, along with Sargeant Shriver and the Kennedy administration 30 
years ago.
  When I had a full head of black hair, Mr. President, and was a little 
thinner of girth, I was a Peace Corps volunteer in the mountains of the 
Dominican Republic for 2\1/2\ years. It was, aside from the experience 
of growing up in my own family, the most profound experience in my 
life. I owe a deep debt of gratitude to Harris Wofford and the people 
who came up with the creative and imaginative idea of how a younger 
generation of Americans could serve their own Nation by serving others.
  I never imagined in those days that I would have the privilege and 
the honor of serving with this remarkably fine man in the U.S. Senate. 
I am deeply saddened that the people of Pennsylvania made a different 
choice on November 8--I would say to them, with all due respect, I 
think an unwise choice, in rejecting Harris Wofford. But I am 
confident, as I stand here this evening, that we will hear continuously 
of the efforts of Harris Wofford as he continues throughout his life to 
make this a stronger, a healthier, and a more decent nation. And I am 
saddened by his departure.
