     WAYS IN WHICH THE UNITED STATES CAN SUPPORT AFRICAN PEACE AND 
                             RECONCILIATION

<bullet> Mr. SIMON. Mr. President, I rise today to enter into the 
record recommendations from the report of a trip that I led to Africa 
earlier this year with Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and Russell 
Feingold of Wisconsin. We traveled to Liberia, Angola, and Tunisia to 
look at the effects of war and the prospects for peace. In addition, we 
met with Yassir Arafat to discuss the Palestinian National Authority, 
and Foreign Minister Solana of Spain regarding the Western Sahara.
  Considering the current state of affairs in Liberia and Angola these 
recommendations will help in providing some guidance to the 
administration. Liberia remains enmeshed in war with the regional 
peacekeeping operation--the first of its kind in Africa--funded by 
western African nations, most of the problems that the mission is 
experiencing are due to resource shortages. Others are due to the 
upsurge in the war among the factions. Under the new leadership of 
President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, the region is getting reengaged on 
Liberia, and working hard to put together a workable peace agreement 
that incorporates all parties within Liberia.
  The recommendations suggests ways in which the United States can 
support those regional efforts, and how we can put pressure on those 
Liberians who are working against the cause of peace. In addition, the 
full report suggests how we can make a difference in the lives of 
ordinary Liberians.
  Recently a peace accord was signed in Lusaka, Zambia, by the warring 
sides in the Angolan conflict. Our country has had a long history with 
Angola beginning during the colonization of America. Angolans were 
brought to the south eastern part of the United States as slaves. Some 
of their descendants are presently known as the Gullah people of the 
Carolina's. However, most of us have come to know Angola during the 
period of the cold war where the United States provided support to a 
number of Angolan parties.
  Angola's people, economy, and territory have been devastated by war, 
but with the signing of this new peace accord, brokered by the 
international community, we may for the first time in two decades see 
peace in Angola.
  This peace is not only historic for Angola, but also for the southern 
Africa reason. With elections this year in Mozambique and South Africa, 
we may now see a southern African region that will begin to see its 
potential as an engine for Africa.
  Our report addresses areas where the United States can make a 
difference in the lives of Angolans from immunizations for kids to 
reconstructing civil society. We hope that this report will serve as a 
basis for the new Congress and the administration to work with Africans 
on constructing peace and national reconciliation.
  Note.--Because of limitations on the amount of material that could be 
placed in the Record, I urge my colleagues to contact my office for a 
copy of the trip report.

 Visit to Liberia, Angola, Tunisia, and Spain--Recommendations to the 
  Committee on Foreign Relations by Senator Paul Simon, Senator Harry 
                   Reid, and Senator Russell Feingold


              findings and recommendations for u.s. policy

       The main findings of our report are listed below for each 
     country we visited:


                                liberia

       1. Liberians who raise money in the United States for 
     weapons and/or are implicated in committing crimes in Liberia 
     should be bared entry. Most of the Liberian factions have 
     high ranking members that reside in the United States.
       Under the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1986, the 
     President may make a proclamation that individuals or groups 
     from certain countries are barred access to the United States 
     for foreign policy reasons.
       2. Senators Simon and Reid believe that the Secretary of 
     State should recognize the Liberian National Transitional 
     Government [LNTG].
       Senator Feingold raised concern about the premature 
     recognition of the LNTG. He noted that since the LNTG was 
     appointed as a caretaker government pending democratic 
     elections in Liberia, U.S. recognition should be tied to the 
     holding of elections. Indeed, consistent with its priority on 
     advancing human rights and democracy, US policy has 
     explicitly linked recognition of the Liberian Government to 
     elections. No other country has recognized the LNTG, though 
     the United States and the United Nations have regular contact 
     with members of the LNTG on a working basis. Senator Feingold 
     supports developing a ``road map''--a graduated step-by-step 
     plan--aimed at legitimizing an elected Liberian Government.
       3. There needs to be increased UN scrutiny of the arms 
     embargo against Liberia. Recent reports have suggested that 
     the embargo needs to be strengthened.
       The delegation was particularly alarmed by widespread 
     reports that other countries--including Burkina Faso and Cote 
     D'Ivoire--are participating in the arming of various factions 
     in Liberia. It is also concerned about the role of ECOMOG in 
     enforcing the embargo. It is our belief that the war will not 
     end and economic development and political reconciliation 
     will not begin unless the arms trade is halted. As private 
     and public negotiations on a peace accord continue, the arms 
     trade should be a top priority. The delegation heard from 
     many sources that the Nigerian component of ECOMOG is arming 
     certain factions in Liberia.
       4. Given that ECOMOG appears to be the only hope for 
     Liberia, particularly under the invigorated leadership of 
     President Jerry Rawlings. The Administration should consider 
     providing additional resource support for ECOMOG, including 
     logistical and vehicle support that would allow the force to 
     fan out throughout the country.
       5. During our negotiations with the warring parties, there 
     should be an emphasis on demobilization and the reintegration 
     of soldiers with the understanding that elections can occur 
     if ``real'' demobilization is adhered to.
       Demobilization and reintegration, however, are inextricably 
     linked to economic development and peace. For instance, 
     soldiering is one of the only employment options available to 
     children. For disarming, soldiers are offered only a pair of 
     tennis shoes, a bag or rice, and a can of cooking oil--hardly 
     enough to sustain a family. The U.S., the U.N. and, ideally, 
     ECOWAS should look at possibilities (1) to create jobs as a 
     lever in the peace negotiations and (2) to develop programs--
     such as ``midnight basketball''--for children to give them 
     alternative activities to fighting.
       6. The Administration should discuss with ECOWAS the 
     request, made by the Transitional Government, to name a 
     political envoy to liaise with the Government.
       7. We should stress to all factions that they must abide by 
     the Cotonou Accord. The international community is looking to 
     the U.S. to take the lead in Liberia, and given our 
     historical ties and responsibilities in Liberia, we recommend 
     that the resolution of the war in Liberia become a higher 
     priority in our policy in Africa. Specifically, we recommend 
     that the U.S. send a high-level delegation to the region at 
     the appropriate time in the peace talks.


                                 angola

       1. The Agency for International Development should provide 
     funding to the Centro Orthopedica Neves Bendinha center in 
     Luanda. The center is the only operating prosthetic and 
     orthopedic hospital in Angola.
       2. The Agency for International Development should provide 
     funding to the UNICEF appeal for a national immunization 
     program.
       3. A problem common throughout the developing world is also 
     present in Angolan refugee camps: vaccines expire before they 
     arrive, or they spoil upon receipt because there are 
     inadequate storage facilities in Angola. The same is true for 
     food shipments. Critically, the U.S. should support ongoing 
     research on cold chain technology to ensure the utility of 
     vaccines as intended, as well as continuing research on 
     bags and containers holding food supplies.
       4. The Administration should insist that President Mobutu 
     of Zaire stop overflights of weapons shipments destined for 
     Angola.
       5. The Chairman of the Export-Import Bank should examine 
     the issue of providing risk insurance and financing for U.S. 
     firms operating in Angola.
       6. The Administration should discuss with Angolan President 
     Dos Santos the proposal by the opposition to convene on a 
     regular basis the Council of the Republic. The opposition 
     believes it needs institutional protection to guarantee its 
     voice in government decisions. This would also be a positive 
     confidence-building measure.
       7. The Administration should discuss with President Dos 
     Santos the opposition's proposal to accelerate the 
     appointment of justices to fulfill the remaining seats in the 
     Judiciary.
       8. Humanitarian NGO's on the ground should be mindful of 
     the concern that humanitarian assistance efforts not thwart 
     the production of indigenously produced goods. In addition, 
     resettlement programs should begin whenever areas that are 
     calm and safe can be opened up.
       9. Within funding already allocated for foreign assistance, 
     AID should provide additional money to initiatives like OTI 
     (Office of Transition Initiatives) because they can dispatch 
     assessment missions and quick infusions of money to countries 
     in transition such as Angola. Many times these countries do 
     not need humanitarian assistance for extended periods because 
     they have extreme potential, however, until they get beyond 
     the crisis, they cannot be provided developmental assistance.


                                tunisia

       1. As events develop in the Middle East peace process and 
     democratic reforms take hold, the Administration should 
     consider participating in joint exercises with the Tunisian 
     military for the purpose of strengthening Tunisia's defensive 
     capabilities.
       2. The Congress should consider holding joint meetings with 
     Tunisian legislators on focused issues, such as regional 
     concerns and the development of democracy.
       3. The U.S. should continue its support of Tunisia as 
     Chairman of the Organization of African Unity.
       4. As Tunisia continues its process of democratization, the 
     U.S. should emphasize the importance of the protection of 
     internationally-recognized human rights in a democratic and 
     pluralistic society. For example, the U.S. should continue to 
     raise issues such as the incarceration of human rights 
     activists and freedom of speech.


 meeting with palestine liberation organization chairman yasser arafat

       1. The Administration should continue to press Chairman 
     Arafat to take the lead in lifting the Arab boycott of 
     Israel.
       2. Israelis, Jordanians and Palestinians should work 
     together to determine whether there is a need for a 
     desalination plant and other clean water technologies in the 
     region. As water resources become more stressed and water 
     sources are increasingly shared, desalination techniques are 
     more timely than ever.
       3. The Administration should discuss with Arab states the 
     need to allow the Palestinian National Authority to collect 
     Palestinian remunerations that remain in Arab banks, in 
     connection with the Middle East peace process.
       4. The Administration should work closely with multilateral 
     institutions and other donor countries to ensure that the 
     Palestinian National Authority in the West Bank and Gaza is 
     receiving the money it has been pledged as implementation of 
     the peace accords continues.


  meeting with foreign minister solana of spain regarding the western 
                                 sahara

       1. As the process of reconciliation appears to be on the 
     verge of a breakthrough, the delegation supports the 
     continuation of MINURSO.
       2. The U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations should 
     carefully monitor the development of the identification 
     commission which is mandated to register voters from the 
     Western Sahara.<bullet>
