                         SENATOR HARRIS WOFFORD

  Mr. MITCHELL. Mr. President, I want to, if I might, say a word also--
I see our other colleague here, Senator Wofford--about Senator Wofford.
  We share something in common, both having been appointed to the 
Senate. We are a tiny minority of an already very tiny minority; that 
is, people who have been appointed to the Senate. As Senator Wofford 
knows, it is an unusual, truly extraordinary experience and one which 
he handled with great skill and talent.
  Senator Wofford, I think, is an outstanding example of a person who 
has devoted his life to helping others, to public service from his very 
early days organizing the Peace Corps, fighting hard for justice and 
equality in our society and culminating in extraordinary service to the 
Senate where he championed the cause of health care. He did not 
succeed, I did not succeed, we did not succeed, but we hope very much 
that what we did is a building block for the future, and that 
ultimately when, as I am certain it will, meaningful health care reform 
occurs in this country, historians will trace it to that day in 
November 3 years ago when Harris Wofford made it his cause and brought 
it to the attention of the Senate and the Nation.
  It has been a real pleasure to serve with Senator Wofford and I thank 
him for his service and wish him very well.
  Mr. WOFFORD addressed the Chair.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Wofford, is 
recognized.
