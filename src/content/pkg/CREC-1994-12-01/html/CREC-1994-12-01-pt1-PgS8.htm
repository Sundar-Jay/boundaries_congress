                         TRIBUTE TO TOM KUCHEL

  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, while I did not have the privilege of 
serving in this Chamber with Tom Kuchel of California, I admired his 
many accomplishments and was saddened by his death on November 21.
  Senator Kuchel entered this chamber in 1952, when then California 
Gov. Earl Warren appointed him to take the place of Richard Nixon, who 
had been elected Vice President of the United States. Prior to his 
appointment, Senator Kuchel had served as chairman of the California 
State Republican Party, a State assemblyman, a State senator, and State 
controller.
  Throughout his 16 years in the Senate, Senator Kuchel served 
California and America with great distinction--serving for 10 years as 
Republican whip, alongside the legendary Republican leader, Everett 
Dirksen.
  Senator Kuchel reached across party lines throughout his years in the 
Senate, serving with Democrat whip Hubert Humphrey as cofloor manager 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He also helped to write what became 
the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
  I know I speak for all members of the Senate in sending our 
condolences to Senator Kuchel's wife, Betty, and his entire family.
  Mr. DOLE. Mr. President, like all Members of the Senate, I was 
saddened by the announcement that former President Ronald Reagan is 
suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
  And, like all Members of the Senate, I was also inspired by the 
eloquence and courage of President Reagan's letter to the American 
people. The words were typical Ronald Reagan. Honest. Open. Positive.
  By going public with his diagnosis, President Reagan has also focused 
attention on the plight of the estimated 4 million Americans who are 
afflicted with Alzheimer's.
  This tragic disease is now the fourth leading cause of death among 
American adults. And because our population is aging, it is estimated 
that 14 million Americans will have the disease by the year 2050.
  In the past several years, Congress has moved to increase funding for 
Alzheimer's research and support programs for victims and their 
families. It is my hope that the 104th Congress will also devote 
careful attention to these programs.
  Mr. President, I know I speak for the entire Senate when I say that 
our thoughts and prayers are with President Reagan as he begins what he 
described as ``the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my 
life.''
  And our thoughts and prayers are also with Nancy Reagan, the 
remarkable woman who has played such an important role in his life, and 
who served as First Lady with such grace and dignity.
  I would also ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that President 
Reagan's letter to the American public be printed in the Congressional 
Record in its entirety.
  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in 
the Record, as follows:

   Transcript of Letter From President Ronald Reagan to the American 
                                 People

       My Fellow Americans, I have recently been told that I am 
     one of the millions of American who will be afflicted with 
     Alzheimer's Disease.
       Upon learning this news, Nancy & I had to decide whether as 
     private citizens we would keep this a private matter or 
     whether we would make this news known in a public way.
       In the past Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my 
     cancer surgeries. We found through our open disclosures we 
     were able to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a 
     result many more people underwent testing. They were treated 
     in early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives.
       So now, we feel it is important to share it with you. In 
     opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater 
     awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a 
     clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are 
     affected by it.
       At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the 
     remainder of the years God gives me on this earth doing the 
     things I have always done. I will continue to share life's 
     journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy 
     the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and 
     supporters.
       Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's Disease progresses, the 
     family often bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some 
     way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience. When 
     the time comes I am confident that with your help she will 
     face it with faith and courage.
       In closing let me thank you, the American people for giving 
     me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your President. 
     When the Lord calls me home, (sic) whenever that may be, I 
     will leave with the greatest love for this country of ours 
     and eternal optimism for its future.
       I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset 
     of my life. I know that for America there will always be a 
     bright dawn ahead.
       Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you.
           Sincerely,
     Ronald Reagan.
