  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.

       A resolution (S. Res. 294) to commend the exemplary 
     leadership of the Republican Leader.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the resolution.

                              S. Res. 294

       Resolved, That the thanks of the Senate are hereby tendered 
     to the distinguished Republican leader, the Senator from 
     Kansas, the Honorable Robert Dole, for his exemplary
