                     FEDERAL AVIATION AUTHORIZATION

  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, with your permission, I would like to 
engage in a brief colloquy with Senator Ford, who sponsored the 
recently enacted Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 
1994.
  Section 505 of that act provided additional authority for the FAA to 
participate with the National Park Service and the United States Air 
Force in funding asbestos removal and building demolition and removal 
work at Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, CA. Section 505 is intended to 
enable the FAA to aid in the cleanup of the site, participate with 
other agencies in the overall cleanup of the site, and thus share in 
the cost of carrying out the necessary demolitions and removals. I know 
that we specifically discussed this issue prior to Senate passage of 
the bill and all agreed on the intent. No one wanted to have FAA pay 
for the entire cleanup, but rather wanted to ensure that the FAA pay a 
portion of the costs. This issue has been a longstanding issue, and now 
appears to finally be resolved.
  I would like to confirm with the Senator from Kentucky that the 
intent of the language is to facilitate FAA participation by 
authorizing the FAA to assist these other agencies in the cleanup 
activities. I understand that the FAA's earlier agreed upon one-third 
share of the remaining costs, meaning the FAA's additional costs, would 
not exceed $320,000.
  Mr. FORD. The Senator from California has correctly stated the intent 
of this provision. As you stated, we did specifically discuss this 
matter on the Senate floor, and in crafting the provision, sought to 
facilitate the cleanup, and put a reasonable limitation on the FAA's 
share of the project. In providing the additional authority to assist 
in the cleanup activities at Mount Tamalpais, the provision will enable 
the FAA, as you indicated, to expend an additional $320,000 at the 
site. This represents FAA's share of the remaining costs. The other 
agencies will provide their fair share, which constitutes the remaining 
two-thirds of the cleanup costs.
