                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT

  Mr. SASSER. Mr. President, I hereby submit to the Senate the budget 
scorekeeping report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office under 
section 309(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974, as amended. This report meets the requirements for Senate 
scorekeeping of section 5 of Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, the first 
concurrent resolution on the budget for 1986.
  This report, which is the first for fiscal year 1995, shows the 
effects of congressional action on the budget through October 8, 1994. 
The estimates of budget authority, outlays and revenues, which are 
consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of the 
concurrent resolution on the budget (H. Con. Res. 287), show that 
current level spending is below the budget resolution by $2.3 billion 
in budget authority and $0.4 billion in outlays. Current level is $0.1 
billion below the revenue floor in 1995 and above by $0.1 billion over 
the 5 years, 1995-99. The current estimate of the deficit for purposes 
of calculating the maximum deficit amount is $239.6 billion, $1.4 
billion below the maximum deficit amount for 1995 of $241.0 billion.
  Since the last report, dated October 7, 1994, Congress has approved 
and the President has signed the following bills, Public Law 103-354, 
Public Law 103-352, Public Law 103-365, Public Law 103-375, Public Law 
103-387, Public Law 103-394, Public Law 103-415, Public Law 103-433, 
Public Law 103-434, Public Law 103-438, Public Law 103-446, Public Law 
103-448, and Pvt. Law 103-8. These actions changed the current level of 
budget authority, outlays, and revenues. The President also signed 
Public Law 103-337, and Public Law 103-353.

                                      Congressional Budget Office,


                                                U.S. Congress,

                                Washington, DC, November 30, 1994.
     Hon. Jim Sasser,
     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, 
         DC.
       Dear Mr. Chairman: The attached report shows the effects of 
     Congressional action on the 1995 budget and is current 
     through October 8, 1994. The estimates of budget authority, 
     outlays and revenues are consistent with the technical and 
     economic assumptions of the 1995 Concurrent Resolution on the 
     Budget (H. Con. Res. 218). This report is submitted under 
     section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional 
     Budget Act, as amended, and meets the requirements of Senate 
     scorekeeping of section 5 of S. Con. Res. 32, the 1986 First 
     Concurrent Resolution on the Budget.
       Since my last report, dated October 5, 1994, Congress has 
     cleared and the President has signed the following bills: 
     Continuation of certain SEC fees (P.L. 103-352), Federal Crop 
     Insurance Reform Act (P.L. 103-354), Arizona Wilderness Land 
     Title Resolution Act (P.L. 103-365), North American Wetlands 
     Conservation Act Amendments (P.L. 103-375), Social Security 
     Domestic Employment Reform Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-387), 
     Bankruptcy Reform Act (P.L. 103-394), State Department 
     Authorization Technical Corrections Act (P.L. 103-415), 
     California Desert Protection Act (P.L. 103-433), Yavapai-
     Prescott Indian Tribe Water Rights Claims Settlement Act 
     (P.L. 103-434), International Antitrust Enforcement 
     Assistance Act of 1994 (P.L. 103-438), Veterans Benefits 
     Improvements Act (P.L. 103-446), Healthy Meals for Healthy 
     Americans Act (P.L. 103-448) and a bill for the relief of 
     James B. Stanley (Pvt.L. 103-8). These actions changed the 
     current level of budget authority, outlays, and revenues. The 
     President has also signed the National Defense Authorization 
     Act for 1995 (P.L. 103-337), and the Uniformed Services 
     Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (P.L. 103-353).
           Sincerely,
                                             Robert D. Reischauer,
                                                         Director.
