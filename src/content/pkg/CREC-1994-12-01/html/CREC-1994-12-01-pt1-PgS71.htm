              THE RETIREMENT OF SENATOR HOWARD METZENBAUM

  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, as you know our colleague from Ohio, 
Senator Howard Metzenbaum, will not be returning to the Senate when the 
104th Congress convenes next month. I would like to take a moment to 
praise his accomplishments and wish him well in the future.
  Over 50 years ago Howard Metzenbaum was elected to the Ohio 
Legislature, beginning what would prove to be a highly distinguished 
and productive career in public service. During his time here in the 
Senate, Senator Metzenbaum has been a tireless crusader for those in 
our society who are often without a voice: consumers, children, and 
workers.
  His work on behalf of our Nation's disenfranchised is unequaled in 
the Senate. In this Congress alone, Senator Metzenbaum has worked to 
reform the insurance industry, provide pension security for retirees, 
increase civil rights, increase environmental protection, and increase 
child safety and labor fairness. During my 8 years in the Senate, I've 
seen his worker retraining bill, plant closing notification 
legislation, and food labeling requirements become law.
  I have long admired Senator Metzenbaum's dogged determination as he 
struggled to fight special interests and Government waste. Senator 
Metzenbaum is a man with deeply held convictions--agree or disagree--
you rarely wonder where he stands on an issue. I am sure that my 
colleagues who have opposed him on the floor will attest that his 
debating skills are unmatched, and he has not been reluctant to use 
these skills to promote or defeat legislation in defense of the 
principles and causes in which he strongly believes.
  This knowledge of the inner workings of the Senate combined with his 
experience as a successful businessman have served him well on issues 
relating to American business. As a Senator he successfully led the 
fight for stiffer penalties for child labor law violations, increased 
job training opportunities for women in nontraditional jobs, expansion 
of antitrust laws and stronger penalties for contractor fraud.
  Mr. President, our colleague Senator Simon has called Howard 
Metzenbaum the ``tiger of the Senate.'' After viewing the ferocity with 
which he mounts a filibuster or questions a Supreme Court nominee, I 
agree with that assessment. While his retirement brings to an end his 
battles in this Chamber, I strongly doubt it will mark the end of his 
fight to see that all Americans receive a fair opportunity to live a 
happy, successful life. Howard Metzenbaum has been a champion for the 
left out the left behind. He can be intensely proud of his service in 
the U.S. Senate.
