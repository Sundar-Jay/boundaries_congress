                  TRIBUTE TO JUDGE R. CLIFFORD FULFORD

  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge R. Clifford Fulford, 
a strong force in Alabama politics for two decades, passed away on 
October 29, 1994. He has been a Federal bankruptcy judge in Birmingham 
since 1985. He will probably best be remembered for his role in keeping 
the Alabama Democratic Party from being taken over by the Dixicrats in 
1948 and for keeping it in touch with the national during a turbulent 
time in the State's history. he was one of those rare individuals who 
got into politics to do the right thing, regardless of what might be 
popular at the moment.
  Clifford Fulford served as president of the student body at the 
University of Alabama, from which he graduated in 1940. He received his 
law degree there in 1942. He served in the Navy during both World War 
II and the Korean war. After serving with the Office of Price 
Stabilization as an enforcement officer, he entered private law 
practice in Birmingham. He served as assistant U.S. attorney in 
Birmingham in 1953. During the 1960's and 1970's, he served as attorney 
and treasurer of the Alabama Democratic Executive Committee. Over the 
years, Judge Fulford proved himself to be an honest and successful 
politician and an outstanding lawyer and judge.
  I extend my sincerest condolences to Judge Fulford's wife Toula and 
their entire family in the wake of their tremendous loss.
