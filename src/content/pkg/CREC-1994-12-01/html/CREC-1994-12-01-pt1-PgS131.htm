                            ONE OF THE BEST

<bullet> Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, many times, for good reason, the 
lobbying profession has a bad name. But there are many Americans who 
lobby Congress and our State legislatures who just do not fit the 
negative stereotype of a lobbyist.
  My friend Marie Durkee of Helena, MT, is one of the best. For many 
years, as executive secretary of the Montana Tavern Owners and 
Innkeepers, Marie has been an effective voice for the Montana 
hospitality industry. She worked hard for her membership. Along with 
the members of the Montana Legislature, I've always known her to be a 
force to be reckoned with.
  But there is nothing slick or high pressure about Marie. She's down 
to Earth. She's honest. She's loyal. And she speaks her mind. She cares 
deeply about what is best for her membership, Montana and our country. 
In short, Marie is a Montanan through-and-through.
  Marie recently decided to retire. I know that the Montana small 
businesses she represented so effectively for so long will miss her. 
But I also know she will stay active in her hometown of Helena. And I 
know that she and her husband Bob will continue to work for what is 
best for Montana. I wish them both well.<bullet>
