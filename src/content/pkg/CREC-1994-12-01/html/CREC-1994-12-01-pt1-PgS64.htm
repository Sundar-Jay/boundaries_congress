                       TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WOFFORD

  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, Senator Harris Wofford is, like Thomas 
More, ``a man for all seasons'': lawyer, writer, teacher, college 
president, politician. In his eventful life, he has been acquainted 
with important political figures from Gandhi to Martin Luther King to 
John Kennedy. He has studied and practiced their philosophies, from 
nonviolence to citizen service, and observed the seminal social 
movements of the second half of the 20th century. More to the point, he 
has participated actively in events, acting as a catalyst for change 
and betterment. He was one of the founders of the Peace Corps, one of 
those drafting the first civil rights act in 1956, and the candidate 
who focused the attention of the American people on the issue of health 
care.
  Senator Wofford brought to the Senate this wealth of service and 
insight, and sponsored legislation drawing upon his experiences. The 
National and Community Service Trust Act which he successfully managed 
on the Senate floor offers young Americans an opportunity to earn an 
education in exchange for a community service. It incorporates the 
principles of PennSERVE, the Governor's Office of Citizen Service, 
which Senator Wofford founded when he was Pennsylvania's Secretary of 
Labor and Industry.
  It has been a privilege to know and serve with Harris in the Senate.
