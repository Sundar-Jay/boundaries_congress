                          TRIBUTE TO BEN HALEY

  Mr. HEFLIN. Mr. President, Ben Haley, of Atmore, AL, will long be 
remembered as a man who loved life and served his community well. Ben 
passed away on November 13.
  Ben Haley moved to Atmore in 1933 with his family, served with the 
Navy and Marine Corps during World War II, returning to Atmore in 1947. 
He was employed by Retail Credit Corp. until 1956, when he became a 
partner in Maxwell-Haley. He continued with the firm as a broker until 
he died. He was elected to the Atmore City Council in 1968, serving 
until 1980.
  Ben was a great friend to me personally, as well as a close political 
adviser. He helped me numerous times when I campaigned in Escambia 
County. He knew everyone throughout the county and was friends with 
virtually all of them. His hard work and drive led him to prominent 
positions not only in the Atmore city government, but also with the 
Alabama Real Estate Commission.
  Ben was one of those people you immediately took to. He had a 
pleasant and warm demeanor and always made me feel at home when I 
visited Atmore and Escambia County. He had an engaging personality.
  Ben Haley will be sorely missed by those of us fortunate to have 
known him over the years. My condolences and prayers are with his wife, 
Barbara, and their children during their time of mourning.
