                        PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS

  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated:

       POM-671. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of California; to the Committee on Appropriations.

                   ``Assembly Joint Resolution No. 87

       ``Whereas, The Congress of the United States enacted the 
     Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public 
     Law 94-142), now known as the Individuals with Disabilities 
     Education Act (IDEA), to assure that all children with 
     disabilities in the United States have available to them a 
     free appropriate public education which emphasizes special 
     education and related services designed to meet their unique 
     needs, to assure that the rights of children with 
     disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to 
     assist states and localities to provide for the education of 
     all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the 
     effectiveness of efforts to educate children with 
     disabilities; and
       ``Whereas, The Congress of the United States developed a 
     formula in 1975 to determine the maximum amount of funding to 
     which states are entitled for purposes of implementing the 
     federal mandates to provide special education and related 
     services. That entitlement amounts to ``40 per centum, for 
     the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982, and for each 
     fiscal year thereafter, of the average per pupil expenditure 
     in public elementary and secondary schools in the United 
     States,'' multiplied by the number of children receiving 
     special education and related services; and
       ``Whereas, 1995 budget appropriations measures currently 
     pending before Congress only propose to fund special 
     education programs in the states, under Part B of IDEA, at 
     approximately 7 percent. That amount is 3 percent less than 
     Section 1411 of Title 20 of the United States Code authorized 
     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1979; and
       ``Whereas, The California Master Plan for Special Education 
     was approved for statewide implementation in 1980 on the 
     basis of the anticipated federal commitment to fund special 
     education programs at the federally authorized level; and
       ``Whereas, The Governor's Budget for the 1994-95 fiscal 
     year includes $1.6 billion in General Fund support for 
     special education programs; and
       ``Whereas, The State of California anticipates receiving 
     approximately $220 million in federal special education funds 
     under Part B of IDEA for the 1994-95 school year, even though 
     the federally authorized level of funding would provide over 
     $900 million annually to California; and
       ``Whereas, In addition to the $168 million local general 
     fund contribution required by state law, local educational 
     agencies in California have to pay for the underfunded 
     federal mandates for special education programs, at the cost 
     of approximately $600 million annually, from regular 
     education program money, thereby reducing funding that is 
     available for other education program; and
       ``Whereas, Whether or not California participates in the 
     IDEA grant program, the state has to meet the requirements of 
     Section 504 of the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 
     U.S.C. Sec. 701) and its implementing regulations (34 C.F.R. 
     104), which prohibit recipients of federal financial 
     assistance, including educational institutions, from 
     discriminating on the basis of disability, yet no federal 
     funds are available under that act for state grants; and
       ``Whereas, California is committed to providing a free and 
     appropriate public education to children and youth with 
     disabilities, in order to meet their unique needs; and
       ``Whereas, The California Legislature is extremely 
     concerned that, since 1978, Congress has not given states the 
     full amount of financial assistance necessary to achieve its 
     goal of ensuring children and youth with disabilities equal 
     protection of the laws; now, therefore, be it
       ``Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of 
     California, jointly, That the Legislature respectfully 
     memorializes the President and Congress of the United States 
     to provide the full 40 percent federal share of funding for 
     special education programs by the year 2000, so that 
     California and other states participating in these critical 
     programs will not have to take funding from other vital state 
     and local programs to fund underfunded federal mandates; and 
     be it further
       ``Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit 
     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President 
     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of 
     Representatives, to the Majority Leader of the Senate, to the 
     Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget and the Chair of 
     the House Committee on the Budget, to the Senate Committee on 
     Appropriations and the Chair of the House Committee on 
     Appropriations, to each Senator and Representative from 
     California in the Congress of the United States, and to the 
     United States Secretary of Education.''

       POM-672. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of 
     the State of California; to the Committee on Armed Services.

                   ``Assembly Joint Resolution No. 62

       ``Whereas, Violent felons account for nearly two-thirds of 
     all prisoners; and
       ``Whereas, Recent events, however, have demonstrated that 
     many violent felons who should be incarcerated for the 
     protection of the public, are instead out of prison and free 
     to prey upon helpless citizens; and
       ``Whereas, The lack of adequate prison space significantly 
     contributes to this situation and will continue to result in 
     the early release of inmates who constitute a danger to 
     public safety; and
       ``Whereas, The recent enactment of the ``3 strikes, you're 
     out'' law has been said to be too costly in that it will 
     require the construction of new prisons; and
       ``Whereas, The Governor has called for the construction of 
     six new prisons to be financed through the issuance of two 
     billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) in state general obligation 
     bonds; and
       ``Whereas, California has many major military bases 
     scheduled for closure; and
       ``Whereas, It is reasonable to argue that living facilities 
     that are adequate for our fighting men and women are adequate 
     for housing prisoners; and
       ``Whereas, While some security related modifications of 
     closed military bases may be necessary in order for the bases 
     to be used for state prison purposes, some security measures 
     are already in place, and the modifications would in many 
     cases require relatively minor expenditures; and
       ``Whereas, California's base closures will result in the 
     loss of 250,000 jobs and forty billion dollars 
     ($40,000,000,000) to the local economy; and
       ``Whereas, California has already lost 800,000 jobs due to 
     the recession and California continues to lag behind the rest 
     of the nation in recovery from the recession; and
       ``Whereas, The federal government should assist in the 
     economic recovery of California; and
       ``Whereas, Allowing conversion of closed military bases in 
     California for state prison use would provide an opportunity 
     for the federal government to assist in this recovery by 
     providing the state with the needed savings in capital outlay 
     expenditure and by facilitating the replacement of lost 
     defense-related jobs in the affected communities; and
       ``Whereas, Conversion of closed military bases to state 
     prisons would address the need for new prison space without 
     the need for the issuance of construction bonds, thus saving 
     the state two billion dollars ($2,000,000,000) plus the 
     financing costs at a time when the state should do whatever 
     possible to maximize its resources; and
       ``Whereas, The conversion of local area military bases to 
     state prison use shall be approved by the local area reuse 
     commission or entity; now, therefore, be it
       ``Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of 
     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of 
     California respectfully memorializes the President and the 
     Congress of the United States to allow California to, upon 
     local approval, convert closed military bases to state 
     prisons; and be it further
       ``Resolved, That the Speaker of the Assembly transmit 
     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President 
     of the United States, to the Speaker of the United States 
     House of Representatives, and to each Senator and 
     Representative from California in the Congress of the United 
     States.''

     Housing, and Urban Affairs.

                   ``Assembly Joint Resolution No. 24

       ``Whereas, Fraudulent payment of charge card and credit 
     card accounts with misappropriated checks is becoming 
     increasingly common; and
       ``Whereas, Thousands of inquires are being made each week 
     to charge card and credit card companies regarding the 
     misappropriation of checks intended for payment on a 
     particular account but which were applied to another account; 
     and
       ``Whereas, An illegal practice has developed among 
     dishonest persons employed in a bookkeeping or accounting 
     capacity, wherein these dishonest persons have taken 
     advantage of existing industry practice which holds that the 
     remittance stub is controlling as to the payment of checks 
     which were submitted with the remittance stub of one account, 
     although the checks were intended for payment on another 
     account; now, therefore, be it
       ``Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of 
     California, jointly, That the Legislature of the State of 
     California respectfully memorializes the President and the 
     Congress of the United States, and the Federal Reserve Board 
     and its Board of Governors, to review the Truth in Lending 
     Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 1601 et seq.), Regulation Z, and other 
     related statutes and regulations that control the information 
     required to be disclosed on the billing statement for charge 
     cards and credit cards, and make appropriate revisions 
     thereto, such that cardholders are required to be advised 
     that the only way to ensure that their check is credited to 
     their account is to inscribe the payee's name and the words 
     ``for credit to account number------only,'' with their 
     account number, on the portion of their check designated 
     ``Pay to the order of''; and be it further
       ``Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California 
     urges that Congress enact a statute or the Federal Reserve 
     Board adopt a regulation, or both, which would deem this 
     inscription controlling in cases in which the account number 
     inscribed on the payee line on the check is different from 
     the account number on the remittance stub; and be if further
       ``Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of California 
     urges Congress and the Federal Reserved Board to make it 
     clear that this statute, regulation, or both, will apply to 
     all charge cards and credit cards, regardless of use or 
     cardholder status, and be it further

     Representatives, to each Senator and Representative from 
     California in the Congress of the United States, and to the 
     Chairman and each member of the Board of Governors of the 
     Federal Reserve Board.''

                   ``Assembly Joint Resolution No. 58

       ``Whereas, Violence has increased in the lives of young 
     children who live in California; and
       ``Whereas, The United States is now the country with the 
     most violence in the industrialized world, leading the world 
     in homicides, rapes, and assaults; and
       ``Whereas, California is home to 12 percent of the nation's 
     65 million children; and
       ``Whereas, California's 7.8 million children represent one-
     quarter of the state's total populations; and
       ``Whereas, In 1990, handguns were used to kill 87 people in 
     Japan, 68 in Canada, 22 in great Britain, 10 in Australia, 
     and 10,567 in the United States; and
       ``Whereas, In 1990 Handguns were used to kill 222 children 
     under the age of 10 and 6,795 youths under the age of 25; and
       ``Whereas, National Trauma Center data reveals a 300 
     percent increase in hospital admissions involving gunshot 
     wounds to children who were shot by other children (age of 16 
     or under); and
       ``Whereas, Gun-related violence takes the life of one 
     American child at least every three hours and the lives of at 
     least 25 children--the equivalent of a classroom--every three 
     days; and
       ``Whereas, Since the Federal Communications Commission's 
     1982 decision to deregulate children's commercial television, 
     television time for war cartoons jumped from one and one-half 
     hours per week to 43 hours per week; and
       ``Whereas, Since deregulation of children's television in 
     the early 1980s, the marketing of violent toys through the 
     media has increased tremendously; and

     television programs has increased from 18.6 acts of violence 
     per hour a decade ago to 26.4 violent acts each hour today; 
     and
       ``Whereas, Years of research show that children exposed to 
     excessive viewing of television violence become less 
     sensitive to the pain and suffering of others, more fearful 
     of the world around them, and are more likely to behave in 
     aggressive or harmful ways toward others; and
       ``Whereas, Research also shows that exposure to media 
     violence leads children to see violence as a normal response 
     to stress and as an acceptable means of resolving conflict;

     Federal Communications Commission to review television's 
     efforts and accomplishments in addressing the impacts of

     mortality rates of 25 to 80 percent in the forest stands 
     within the Lake Tahoe Basin; and
       ``Whereas, Unless removed, these dead trees will remain for 
     decades and provide the heavy material to fuel intense, 
     disastrous fires into the next century; and
