              TRIBUTE TO PRIDE INDUSTRIES OF ROSEVILLE, CA

  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize PRIDE 
Industries of Roseville, CA. I had the distinct pleasure of meeting 
employees of PRIDE, and I want to share what I learned of this truly 
impressive organization.
  PRIDE Industries, the only not-for-profit organization run as a 
business, began in 1966 when a group of parents sought to provide 
meaningful opportunities for their physically and developmentally 
disabled sons and daughters. By 1983, the organization had a budget of 
$400,000, most of which came from the government. In 1983, Michael 
Ziegler became president and CEO, and by 1993, PRIDE had a budget of 
almost $20 million, 90 percent of which is selfgenerated. PRIDE boasts 
of impressive contracts with both private companies, such as Intel and 
Hewlett Packard, and the government, including contracts with McClellan 
Air Force Base.
  The success of PRIDE can most certainly be attributed to its 
employees. Out of a total of 1,600 persons employed, 1,100 are 
disabled. Additionally, PRIDE provides vocational training to disabled 
persons and helps them find jobs outside of PRIDE. All in all, PRIDE 
demonstrates the business and human success to be found from a truly 
empowered work force; a work force of individuals in charge of their 
destiny, and with a sense of independence rarely found.
  And PRIDE's success will certainly continue for the long-term. Given 
90 percent self-generated revenues, PRIDE has taken an original base of 
government funds and created a prosperous business. It is no surprise 
that PRIDE has received numerous business and human service awards, 
including the chairman's award of the President's Committee on 
Employment of People with Disabilities.
  I am honored that PRIDE Industries is from my home State of 
California, and I commend the employees and President Ziegler for their 
continuing contribution to both persons with disabilities and to the 
business community.
