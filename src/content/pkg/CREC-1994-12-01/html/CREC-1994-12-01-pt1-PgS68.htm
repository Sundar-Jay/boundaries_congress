                ON THE RETIREMENT OF SENATOR DON RIEGLE

  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the senior 
Senator from Michigan, Senator Don Riegle, as he prepares to retire 
from this body. During my eight years of service in the Senate, I have 
had the opportunity to serve with Senator Riegle on both the Budget and 
Finance Committees and have enjoyed the chance to work with him on a 
wide range of issues--particularly fair trade and health care reform.
  Senator Riegle has spent eighteen years in the Senate fighting for 
the working families of Michigan while protecting and expanding job 
opportunities and economic growth for our nation. His expertise in 
economic and financial policy issues and his voice on trade issues, 
industrial policy and U.S. competitiveness will be greatly missed.
  Senator Riegle has made it a priority in the Senate to ensure that 
American workers and businesses are competing in an open and free 
environment. He and I agree that free trade agreements are often not 
free or fair trade but negotiated trade that pits one American business 
interest against another while giving our global competitors an unfair 
advantage. As a result he has been an effective advocate of a tough 
trade policy. He has worked to end trade barriers that shut out 
American exports and to halt unfair dumping by foreign manufacturers.
  Senator Riegle has long warned of the need to address the health care 
crisis in this country and has worked for a new system that would 
decrease the number of uninsured and contain the increasing costs of 
health care. During the historic health care debate this past year, 
Senator Riegle met with me and other members of the Finance Committee, 
both Republicans and Democrats, to seek out common ground and areas of 
agreement. He served as a calm voice of reason during the long hours of 
often contentious debate. Although we were not able to reach agreement, 
in the end, I am confident that any health care reform enacted in the 
future will bear the mark of Don Riegle's hard work.
  While serving the people of Michigan in the Senate, Senator Riegle 
has also served his nation as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee 
for the past 5 years. During that time his committee has overhauled the 
banking industry, increased accountability for financial institutions, 
increased protection for consumers and expanded home ownership 
opportunities for low- and middle-income Americans.
  I have been constantly impressed with Senator Riegle's ability to 
write and pass legislation in an efficient, fair and effective manner. 
I have always found him accommodating and helpful with questions or 
concerns I have had with legislation that fell under the Banking 
Committee's jurisdiction. His highly praised role as a fair and 
un<gr-thn-eq>biased chairman during this summer's Whitewater hearings 
serve as evidence of his substantial leadership abilities.
  Not content to focus on economic issues, Senator Riegle has fought 
hardest to protect the children and senior citizens of our country. He 
is largely responsible for providing immunizations for uninsured 
children and has supported increased funding for expanded day care 
facilities for latchkey kids. He is well-known for his continual 
efforts to make good on the government's promises to the eldest members 
of our society.
  Mr. President, Don Riegle has served with distinction for eighteen 
years in the Senate and before that, ten in the House of 
Representatives. The people of Michigan, the country and his colleagues 
here in the Senate will greatly miss him, and I wish him and his family 
good fortune in the future.
