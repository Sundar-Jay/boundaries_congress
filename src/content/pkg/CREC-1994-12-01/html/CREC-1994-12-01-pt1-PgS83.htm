                 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR GEORGE MITCHELL

  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to George 
Mitchell, our majority leader, on his retirement from the United States 
Senate and to wish him well on the challenges which await him in the 
future.
  When the 104th Congress convenes next January, the Senate will elect 
a new Majority Leader. We can and will do that, but we will not be able 
to replace George Mitchell. He will leave a tremendous void in this 
institution. It will be less wise, less savvy and less compassionate. 
We will also miss his calm demeanor, his carefully thought out 
arguments, his great passion when he is fighting for the rights of 
ordinary people, and his judicious temperament. George Mitchell 
combined great skill in analyzing both legislation and the temperament 
of this body at any given moment.
  In the 22 years I have had the honor of serving in the Senate, I can 
recall no Senator that I hold in higher regard than George Mitchell. We 
have served together since 1980 when he was appointed to serve the 
remainder of Ed Muskie's term. I consider myself privileged to have 
been able to work closely with George Mitchell on many occasions, 
including our work on the Iran-Contra Committee.
  Those of us who have had the responsibility as committee chairmen in 
moving in moving a bill on the Senate floor appreciate Senator 
Mitchell's unique talents perhaps more than others. The two to three 
weeks that it sometimes takes to complete debate on our Armed Services 
authorization bill have given me a close vantage point to see the kind 
of extreme stress and pressure that our Majority Leader has endured in 
our behalf. From both sides of the aisle, we call on him for special 
consideration in the schedule, in accommodating our amendments, in 
enduring or breaking filibusters, and on and on.
  Through all of this, George Mitchell has maintained his warmth and 
courtesy and kindness. His dignity and sense of fairness have enhanced 
this institution at a time when that contribution was particularly 
important to the Senate and to the country.
  George Mitchell is a man of many talents. He served with distinction 
in the United States Army in its counter-intelligence branch. He later 
worked in the Department of Justice. He served as an United States 
Attorney and as an United States District Judge before beginning his 
service as an U.S. Senator. Most of his adult life has been dedicated 
to public service.
  To George Mitchell, public service is a high calling, not to be 
undertaken to fulfill one's selfish ambitions or for one's own rewards, 
but to serve the people. He has had the courage to govern--to endure 
the long, tedious hours and the delicate negotiations necessary to 
reconcile opposing parties, to be resolute when that was required, but 
without rancor or recklessness, always respectful of both those who 
opposed him, and those who followed his banner.

  As Senator Mitchell so wisely stated the other night at the Senate 
Spouses' and Retiring Members' Dinner:

       Public service must be and is its own reward, for it 
     guarantees neither wealth nor popularity. And, to paraphrase 
     Rodney Dangerfield, you don't get no respect, either. It's 
     often frustrating. But when you do something that will change 
     the lives of people for the better, then it's worth all the 
     frustrations.
       Ours is virtually the only Government in history dedicated 
     to opening doors, not closing them. In America today, I 
     believe anyone can go as far and reach as high as work, 
     talent, and education allow. We can't equalize effort or 
     talent. But we can equalize opportunity--the promise of a 
     fair chance to succeed.

  Mr. President, I believe these comments by Senator George Mitchell 
reflect his life's story. George Mitchell represents the ideal of the 
American dream. As a son of immigrant parents of humble means, he 
worked hard to acquire a superb education. Fortunately for this nation, 
he has chosen to use that education and his talents and skills and the 
opportunity they opened for him to serve his country and better the 
lives of its people. I am confident that his future plans will not 
stray from this course either.
  Although in a short time he will no longer be with us day to day here 
in the Chamber, I and his many friends in the Senate look forward to 
continuing our friendship.

                          ____________________
