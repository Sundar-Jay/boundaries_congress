                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MITCHELL

  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, before George Mitchell was a Senator, he 
was a Federal judge. He has been quoted in Down East magazine as saying 
that it was a wonderful job, that he loved the work. He then went on to 
say ``So is being a Senator wonderful, only in a different way. If I 
were able to order my life completely, I would have done it in reverse. 
I would have gone the conventional route: Served a couple of terms in 
the Senate and then become a judge.''
  I, for one, am glad that Senator Mitchell didn't go the conventional 
route. The Senate has been the better for his experience as a judge. 
The dignity, the calm deliberation and careful thoroughness, the 
judicial temperament which was reinforced during his service on the 
bench have proved to be a great asset both to the Majority Leader and 
to those whom he led. Throughout his term in the Senate, and especially 
in his memorable exchange with Oliver North, Senator Mitchell has 
demonstrated ``gravitas'', the quality of high seriousness which the 
ancient Romans demanded of their leaders.
  If seriousness of purpose is his defining characteristic, 
competitiveness runs it a close second. I can testify from first-hand 
experience, having seen him on the tennis court. He learned about hard 
work from his parents, immigrants who urged their five children to go 
to college, and from his brothers, who were all star athletes. In 
competition, in the Senate or on the tennis court, George Mitchell is 
well prepared and fiercely competitive, but he is always a good sport. 
He plays hard, but he plays fair. And he always tries to win.
  Those of us who have served with him, on and off the tennis court, 
respect him for his determination. He has worked extraordinarily long 
and hard during his term as Majority Leader. We admire his dedication 
to duty, but we hope that in his next career, there will be time for 
reading books, playing tennis and watching Red Sox games. He leaves 
with our thanks and the thanks of the American people.
