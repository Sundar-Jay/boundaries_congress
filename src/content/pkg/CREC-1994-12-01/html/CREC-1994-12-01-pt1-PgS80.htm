            RETIREMENT OF MAJORITY LEADER GEORGE J. MITCHELL

  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, President Clinton announced today that 
our distinguished majority leader, Senator George J. Mitchell, who cast 
his last vote in the U.S. Senate this evening, will be appointed U.S. 
Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State for Economic 
Initiatives in Ireland.
  It is welcome news that the majority leader will continue, at least 
in the near term, in public service, for it is a pursuit to which he 
seems to be uniquely qualified--although by no means limited. Senator 
Mitchell is in fact the ideal candidate for any job requiring vision, 
wisdom, integrity, and leadership. Indeed, how many other Americans--in 
the space of less than one year--are deemed to be the number one 
candidate for a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, Commissioner of major 
league baseball, and now Special Advisor to the President on Ireland?
  The answer, of course, is none. For Senator Mitchell is a leader of 
singular abilities and singular achievements. Since his election as 
majority leader in 1988, he has lead us with incomparable strength and 
unwavering conviction, but also with immeasurable patience and an 
uncompromising sense of fairness befitting a former Federal judge.
  It is difficult to imagine how we will get along without Senator 
Mitchell's formidable presence here in this Chamber. Just prior to the 
votes on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade implementing 
legislation, the majority leader delivered a masterful speech--as he 
does before every major vote--in favor of the GATT legislation. It 
reminded me how much we will miss the majority leader's superb oratory, 
his lawyerly precision, and his rare gift for persuasion.
  The majority leader's retirement from the Senate will be a great loss 
to this institution, to the State of Maine which he has represented so 
ably, and to the Nation. We are terribly saddened at his departure, but 
gratified and comforted by the knowledge that he will be continuing on 
in service to his country.
