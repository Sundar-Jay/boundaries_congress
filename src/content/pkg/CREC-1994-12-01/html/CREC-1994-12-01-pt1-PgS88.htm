                               DON RIEGLE

  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, after 28 years of service to the people 
of Michigan in both the House and the Senate, Don Riegle is retiring. 
His friends, colleagues and constituents will miss him deeply, and his 
outstanding service to the people of Michigan will be long remembered.
  Don's knowledge of business and finance is extensive, and his able 
leadership of the Banking Committee has been impressive. But his real 
strength has always been his ability to understand the concerns and 
defend the rights of average citizens and working families.
  He is the son of a small businessman from Flint, Michigan, and early 
in his career, he seemed to be following in his father's footsteps. He 
received his undergraduate degree from the University of Michigan and 
his MBA from Michigan State. He also studied business and government at 
Harvard before working in financial services for IBM in New York.
  But in 1966 don went home to Michigan, ran for Congress as a 
Republican, and won. He was a Republican for his first 7 years in the 
House, but he finally saw the light in 1973 and joined the Democratic 
Party. In 1976, Don was elected to the first of three terms in the 
United States Senate.
  Don has always been known as a fierce defender of Michigan and its 
people. Whether it was pushing through the Chrysler Assistance Bill, 
passing the National Affordable Housing Act, shepherding the HUD Reform 
Act through Congress, or working hard to deal with the savings and loan 
crisis, Don Riegle has done an outstanding job for Michigan and the 
country.
  On all of these issues and many others, don has worked tirelessly to 
provide fair opportunities for all Americans. And he has educated us 
all on the Senate floor with his eloquence in debate and his brilliant 
and passionate arguments for the causes he leads.
  Don will be especially remembered for the sense of humor, loyalty, 
and friendship he has shown to all of us in the Senate, and for the 
leadership that he has always brought to so many issues. To Don and 
Lori and their five children, we say well done, goodbye and good luck. 
He has served Michigan, the Senate, and the nation with extraordinary 
ability, dedication, and achievement, and we will miss him very much in 
the years ahead.
