          COMMENDING THE ANTARES GROUP, INC., OF LANDOVER, MD

  Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to 
recognize and commend the Antares Group, Inc., of Landover, MD, for 
their work on energy and environmental technologies. The Small Business 
Administration has awarded the Antares Group the Administrator's Award 
for Excellence for outstanding contribution and service in a joint 
Government-industry project as a subcontractor of the National 
Renewable Energy Laboratory [NREL]. The Antares Group came to my 
attention through their work on a biomass energy project to utilize 
switchgrass in electric power generation. This is an actual testing and 
demonstration project involving the NREL and several electric 
utilities. The Antares Group is a young company of engineers and 
economists with the expertise and drive to move technology from the 
research and development stage to demonstration and commercialization. 
The United States is recognized around the world for its initiative and 
creativity in energy and environmental technology. Companies like 
Antares are key to maintaining our edge internationally in commercial 
applications of energy and environment technology.
  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I would like to join with Senator 
Johnston in recognizing the Antares Group of Landover, MD. As a small 
business contractor, Antares has earned a reputation for engineering 
and economic excellence. With outstanding companies such as Antares 
working with Government and industry, we are able to achieve maximum 
leverage for our Federal dollars in developing and commercializing 
energy and environment technology, and creating jobs in Maryland.
