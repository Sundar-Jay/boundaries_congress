                     TRIBUTE TO MS. NANCY BRODERICK

  Mr. NUNN. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the retirement of 
Ms. Nancy J. Broderick, Deputy Staff Director for Congressional Affairs 
at the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), who is retiring after 25 years 
of dedicated public service.
  For the past 15 years, Ms. Broderick has worked closely with the 
Armed Services and Appropriations Committees on numerous defense 
readiness and acquisition issues. She has worked hard to ensure that 
the Congress has had ready access to the material necessary to make 
informed decisions. She was especially effective in assuring that the 
impact of military logistics was properly considered in our readiness-
related initiatives and in helping to clarify the tremendous complexity 
of acquisition reform.
  Ms. Broderick has been a consumate professional. Her candor, energy, 
and dedication have served as an inspiration to her colleagues, and 
reflect the best traditions of public service. I wish her the best in 
her retirement.
