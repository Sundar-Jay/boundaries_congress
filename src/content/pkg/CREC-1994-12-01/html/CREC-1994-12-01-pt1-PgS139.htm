      TRIBUTE TO MAYOR EDWARD S. BISHOP, SR., ``A FRUITFUL BOUGH''

Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an outstanding 
Mississippian, and great American, Mayor Edward S. Bishop, Sr., of 
Corinth, MI. Mayor Bishop retired last month after 64 years of 
dedicated service to this country, and the State of Mississippi. He has 
distinguished himself in the fields of elementary and secondary 
education, community relations, and county and State Government.
  Mayor Bishop is well noted in Mississippi for his long and successful 
career as an educator In his lifetime, he has served as a classroom 
teacher, principal, college professor, and director of in-service 
training programs for teachers and others. I have known him for a 
number of years, and I would like to pay homage, and share with my 
colleagues, how service speaks for this fine gentleman.
  Mayor Bishop attended public elementary and secondary schools in the 
State. He received the bachelor of science degree from Jackson State 
University; the master of science degree from the University of 
Southern Illinois; did further graduate study in social economy, 
principalship, and guidance counseling. He also received an honorary 
doctorate degree from Rust College.
  In 1978, Mayor Bishop became the executive director of the Tennessee 
Valley Regional Planning Commission and the Alcorn-Prentiss County 
Human Resource Agency. At present, he serves as executive director of 
the Alcorn County Resource Agency, the umbrella for a comprehensive 
elderly program, and an emergency shelter for children. All of Mayor 
Bishop's untiring efforts in community service should be well noted. He 
has been a driving force in the city of Corinth, and Alcorn County, in 
securing funding dollars for diverse human service programs. Through 
great personal effort, a new permanent home has been established for 
all senior citizen activities in Corinth and the surrounding area. 
Also, he was instrumental in the establishment of a new and permanent 
home for neglected and abused children.
  Mayor Bishop's entry into public service has been marked with 
distinction. He was elected three terms as alderman of the city of 
Corinth, and ran unopposed, for his last two terms.
  After serving as alderman, he was appointed vice-mayor by the City 
Council, and subsequently served as mayor pro tempore. On October 10, 
1989, he was sworn in as mayor of the city of Corinth. He was later 
elected in November 1990, by the citizens of Corinth to serve a full 
term as mayor. His retirement this past November, closed one chapter of 
a very fine career. We, in Mississippi, however, expect to see Mayor 
Bishop continue to give of his time and energy. As an educator, 
community activist, and pubic servant, Mayor Bishop has enjoyed the 
support and adoration of a region of our country, and an historic 
county in the State of Mississippi. The service he has rendered speaks 
volumes. He has been a fruitful bough.
