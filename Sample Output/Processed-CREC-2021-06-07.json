Madam President, finally, on paycheck fairness, \ntomorrow, the Senate will decide whether to take up legislation to \naddress the gender pay gap.\n  Right now in America, women earn, roughly, 82 cents for every dollar \na man makes. The gap is even wider for women of color. Even when you \naccount for educational attainment, Black and Latina women earn only 65 \nto 70 percent of what a White man makes with the same degree, whether \nit is a bachelor's degree or an advanced degree. Many women with \nadvanced degrees actually make less than their male counterparts who \ndon't have them. So, looking at the facts, women with the same jobs, \nthe same degrees--sometimes better degrees than their male colleagues--\nare making less money. That is the very definition of gender \ndiscrimination, and it is holding back women in every industry and area \nof the country.\n  The pandemic has only made matters worse. Faced with impossible \nchoices between careers and childcare, women have fallen out of the \nworkforce at an alarming rate. By one measure, the COVID-19 pandemic \nhas set women's labor force participation back by more than 30 years, \nleading some economists to describe the 2020 year not as a recession \nbut as a ``she-cession.''\n  So there is a lot of work to do to not only recover from a \ndevastating year for women in the workplace but also establish an equal \nplaying field where women are paid what they deserve.\n  Senate Democrats have put forward a bill that would make it much \neasier for women to petition for pay equity.

Madam President, finally, on paycheck fairness, tomorrow, the Senate will decide whether to take up legislation to address the gender pay gap.\n\tRight now in America, women earn, roughly, 82 cents for every dollar a man makes. The gap is even wider for women of color. Even when you account for educational attainment, Black and Latina women earn only 65 to 70 percent of what a White man makes with the same degree, whether it is a bachelor's degree or an advanced degree. Many women with advanced degrees actually make less than their male counterparts who don't have them. So, looking at the facts, women with the same jobs, the same degrees--sometimes better degrees than their male colleagues--are making less money. That is the very definition of gender discrimination, and it is holding back women in every industry and area of the country.\n\tThe pandemic has only made matters worse. Faced with impossible choices between careers and childcare, women have fallen out of the workforce at an alarming rate. By one measure, the COVID-19 pandemic has set women's labor force participation back by more than 30 years, leading some economists to describe the 2020 year not as a recession but as a ``she-cession.''\n\tSo there is a lot of work to do to not only recover from a devastating year for women in the workplace but also establish an equal playing field where women are paid what they deserve.\n\tSenate Democrats have put forward a bill that would make it much easier for women to petition for pay equity. It doesn't mandate that employers set wages at a certain level. It doesn't have the government reach into the private sector. It merely makes it easier for women to overcome pay discrimination.\n\tIn my view, this straightforward, unobjectionable piece of legislation should merit bipartisan support and should not require changes.

Without mentioning any politicians directly, Mr. \nArgaman added, ``It is our duty to come out with a clear and decisive \ncall to stop immediately the inciting and violent discourse. The \nresponsibility for calming spirits and reining in the discourse rests \non all of our shoulders.''\n  I bring this matter to the floor of the Senate because it parallels \nwhat we endured and experienced just a few months ago. I am sure you \nremember it well, Madam President. I do. The election last November, \nwhich was won by Joseph Biden over Donald Trump, the incumbent \nPresident, by some 7 million votes--one of the largest turnouts, if not \nthe largest turnout, in the history of the United States. It was a \ndecisive electoral college victory in the same margin that Trump had \ntriumphed over Hillary Clinton just a few years before. Yet, because of \nthe Big Lie and the denial by Donald Trump, he inspired his followers \nto come to Washington, DC, and participate in a rally to protest, and \nnot to come just any day but to come on January 6, 2021, of this year \nbecause that is when the electoral college votes would be counted.\n  We know what followed. We know that mob was turned loose in the \nstreets of Washington and turned loose on the Capitol Building, and \nthose who were here that day will never forget it. I can recall the \nVice President of the United States being pulled from that chair you \nare sitting in, Madam President. He was taken out that door. It was \nabout 2:15 in the afternoon. Then a member of the Capitol Police stood \nbefore us and warned us: Stay in your seats. This will be a safe place \nto be. We are going to gather all the staff around the walls here. Just \nsit tight.\n  Ten minutes later, he came back and said: Change of plans. The mob is \nadvancing on this Chamber as we speak. Leave immediately.\n  Everyone picked up as fast as they could and left.\n  It was a scene that seemed so unrealistic, you wouldn't imagine it \ncould happen in the Capitol of the United States of America. But the \ninsurrectionist mob inspired by President Donald Trump was here for \nbusiness. They were here to stop the ordinary course of business in the \nSenate and the House, which would announce at the end of the day the \nselection of Joseph Biden as our new President.\n  Now a parallel is taking place in Israel, and a new coalition to \nreplace Benjamin Netanyahu is being contested by those who are going to \nmarch in the streets. The Israeli leaders--at least those in the \nsecurity services--are begging people not to do it.\n  I put that in context to think that that idea in the United States \nsomehow has taken root in Israel. I pray that nothing happens. I want \nnothing to happen there. But we should be forewarned to take this \nseriously. There are forces at work in the United States and Israel and \nother countries to stop the orderly transfer of power in a democratic \nnation. We ought to take that seriously. We ought to take it so \nseriously that we appoint a bipartisan Commission to investigate what \nhappened here on January 6, 2021.\n  Just a few weeks ago, Republican Members of the House of \nRepresentatives were dismissing the January 6th events, the mob action \nhere in the Capitol, and saying that they were somehow ``orderly \ntourists.'' That is what one of the Congressmen said, a Congressman \nfrom Georgia, a Republican. Those were ``orderly tourists.'' Look at \nthose videos and imagine under any circumstance that you would describe \nthem as ``orderly tourists.'' They weren't orderly tourists when you \nsee five people losing their lives as a result of their actions and 140 \nof our law enforcement officials being personally attacked, many of \nthem still bearing the scars of that day.\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\n  I bring this to the attention of the Senate and the American people \nbecause I think the answer is obvious. Israel is taking it seriously. \nThey don't want a Trump-like mob to take control in their country.\n  We shouldn't be allowing this to happen, nor should we stop with what \nwe have done and say no more will be said. This was a direct attack on \nour democracy. We cannot find, unfortunately, in the Republican \nleadership one Republican leader who will support this idea of a \nbipartisan Commission. When it comes to January 6, the job isn't \nfinished.\n  The last point I will make is, we received a letter--an anonymous \nletter--from the Capitol Hill Police asking us to form this Commission \nand to get to the bottom of it. To think that we walk through this \nCapitol every day and those men and women are risking their lives for \nus and we would not even allow a bipartisan Commission to look into \nthat day and the threats to the lives of those policemen on that day is \nshameful.

Look at those videos and imagine under any circumstance that you would describe them as ``orderly tourists.'' They weren't orderly tourists when you see five people losing their lives as a result of their actions and 140 of our law enforcement officials being personally attacked, many of them still bearing the scars of that day. \n\tI bring this to the attention of the Senate and the American people because I think the answer is obvious. Israel is taking it seriously. They don't want a Trump-like mob to take control in their country.\n\tWe shouldn't be allowing this to happen, nor should we stop with what we have done and say no more will be said. This was a direct attack on our democracy. We cannot find, unfortunately, in the Republican leadership one Republican leader who will support this idea of a bipartisan Commission. When it comes to January 6, the job isn't finished.\n\tThe last point I will make is, we received a letter--an anonymous letter--from the Capitol Hill Police asking us to form this Commission and to get to the bottom of it. To think that we walk through this Capitol every day and those men and women are risking their lives for us and we would not even allow a bipartisan Commission to look into that day and the threats to the lives of those policemen on that day is shameful. It is disgraceful. It is unacceptable.\n\tSenator Schumer said we will vote on it again. I hope we do, and frequently, so we can remind the American people who is taking this matter very seriously and who is not", "speakers": ["Richard J. Durbin"], "citation": "167 Cong. Rec.

We were confronted with the reality that our schools \nand our workplaces were going to be shut down in the foreseeable \nfuture, family gatherings and get-togethers were going to be \nrestrained, and our favorite places for relaxing and fun--restaurants \nand stores--were basically closed. But amid all these uncertainties, \none thing remained constant and dependable: our domestic food supply. \nDespite the disruptions, panic buying, and supply chain bottlenecks \nthat arose during the pandemic, our domestic food supply remained \nfundamentally intact every step of the way.\n  Over the past year, most of us had the assurance that when we stopped \nat a grocery store, there was plenty of food for our family, and when \ngrocery store shelves started to run empty, we could always trust that \nmore food was on the way because farmers were doing their job and \ndistributors of food supply were doing the same. It goes to show that, \nthanks to American agriculture, we are blessed by abundance.\n  As we come together to commend the courageous doctors, nurses, and \nother frontline workers who have cared for our loved ones, there is \nanother group of essential workers who have toiled alongside our \nfarmers and ranchers to keep our families fed: farm workers.\n  I am sure most Americans know very little about the farm workers who \nsupply the food we eat every day. In Illinois, we have 20,000 of these \nfarm workers. They plant, harvest, and pick our State's most lucrative \ncrops.\n  Across the country, we have 2.5 million farm workers. Roughly half of \nthese 2.5 million are undocumented. These undocumented farm workers are \npart of our communities, and many are parents of American children. But \ndespite the essential work they do to keep our families fed, their \nsecond-class status in America means that they are often subject to \nharassment, untenable working conditions, substandard housing, and they \nlive under constant threat of deportation.\n  Last month, The Guardian news service published a piece on the \nworking and living conditions for farm workers in southern Texas. I \nwant to share a few passages about one worker in particular. Her name \nis Linda. Nina Lakhani writes that Linda ``works six days a week, \nsometimes seven, putting food on Americans' tables but earns barely \nenough to cover the bills and depends on food stamps to feed her [own] \nfamily,'' her children.\n\n       After long days in the fields, [Linda] sleeps on an old \n     couch in the kitchen-lounge as part of the house was left \n     uninhabitable by a fire and a hurricane.\n\n  But she calls it home.\n\n       Her 11-year-old son [who has some learning disorders] \n     sleeps on the other couch . . . two daughters share a bedroom \n     where water leaks through a mouldy roof. The eldest, a 16-\n     year-old . . . and her 6-month-old baby sleep in a room with \n     cindered walls.\n       Last summer, [Linda] and her three teenage daughters \n     contracted Covid-19. . . . Rather than risk going to an \n     emergency room, a relative with legal immigration status \n     crossed the border to Reynosa and purchased a small tank of \n     oxygen [for Linda].\n\n  Linda has lived in the United States of America for more than 25 \nyears. She is one of the many undocumented farm workers who keep my \nfamily and our families fed. Yet she herself can barely feed her own \nfamily. Her experience is not an isolated one.\n  I want to share one last passage from the article in The Guardian: \n``Even before the pandemic, farms were among the most dangerous \nworkplaces in the country, where low-paid workers have little \nprotection . . . long hours, repetitive strain injuries, exposures to \npesticides, dangerous machinery, extreme heat and animal waste.'\n  Now add this contagious virus that these workers face too.\n  According to the Environmental Working Group, more than a dozen \nStates don't provide any form of PPE or COVID testing for farm workers, \nand there are no social distancing guidelines in place on these farms. \nIn some cases, workers arrive to the fields in tightly packed trucks, \nand the crews reportedly share cups of water from the same cup during \nthe day.\n  I think it would be accurate to classify these working conditions as \ndangerous, but these essential workers don't have the luxury of being \nable to advocate for themselves--because they are always under the \nshadow and risk of deportation.\n  We in the Senate can change that. We can pass a piece of bipartisan \nlegislation that has already passed the House. It is called the Farm \nWorkforce Modernization Act. This legislation would fundamentally \nchange the lives of hundreds of thousands of these farm workers who \ncame to our rescue during the darkest days of the pandemic, who kept \nworking despite the threat of COVID-19 and the fact that they had few \ncreature comforts of their own.\n  This is legislation that has been in the making for years. It would \nprovide a path to lawful, permanent residency for undocumented farm \nworkers and their family members. That means they would be able to do \nthe essential work they have already been doing without living in fear \nof being deported and losing their kids. It also means these workers \ncould advocate for higher wages, safer working conditions, which would \nmake our Nation's farm labor workforce more stable and strengthen the \ndurability of our food supply chain.\n  Offering these farm workers a path to permanent residency is the \nleast that we could do to acknowledge their tireless, back-breaking \nwork during this pandemic. Over the past year, we have heard a lot of \npraise for the essential workers of America. I join them, of course. At \nour time of need, they did their job, sometimes at great personal cost. \nNow it is time to do our job and pass the Farm Workforce Modernization \nAct.\n  Enacting this legislation is not just about doing the right thing for \nworkers; it is about doing the right thing for our economy and doing \nthe right thing, period.\n  When the pandemic hit last year, it caused the worst economic crisis \nsince the Great Depression. Twenty-two million jobs vanished in \nAmerica. Millions of working families lost their source of income, and \nsome, for the first time in their lives, struggled to put food on the \ntable. Can you imagine how much worse this crisis would have been if \nour Nation was saddled with a food scarcity crisis as well? Thanks to \nour farmers and these farm workers I am speaking for today, we never \nfaced it. It is one of the many examples of how immigrants make our \ncountry stronger. We take them for granted. They go to work every day \nand do the dirtiest, most dangerous jobs in America. Now we have to do \nsomething for them.\n  According to last year's census, America's population grew at the \nslowest rate since the 1930s. That is a warning sign for the future of \nour economy. If our population growth continues to slow, our Nation's \ntax base will shrink. It means we will have fewer working-age adults \nwho can help support elderly Americans--a population that is expected \nto double over the next few decades. To grow our economy, we need to \nbring people out of the shadows so they can continue to contribute to \nAmerica for years to come. So when we vote on legislation like the Farm \nWorkforce Modernization Act, we are really voting for our economic \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\n  I would like to remind my colleagues that America didn't build the \nworld's greatest economy by closing our doors, crossing our fingers, \nand doing one another's laundry. We did it by welcoming the workers of \nthe world, by offering them a home where they can earn an honest \nliving, pay their fair share, and secure a brighter future for their \nchildren.\n  Many people say: Well, we want to get those Ph.D.s from India, China, \nand Asia. We want them living here. They are going to be good for our \neconomy, and they are going to create businesses.\n  That is all true. I stand behind that as well. But there are also \nmany workers who don't have that level of education but have a \ndetermination and a work ethic that have always been part of success in \nthe American economy.\n  This unique American promise, build a brighter future for their \nchildren as well as ours, is the bedrock of our Nation. No other \ncountry in the world can deprive us of it. We can only deprive \nourselves by refusing to fix a broken immigration system that leaves \nmillions of hard-working families in the shadows of our society. If we \nwant to continue leading in the 21st century, if we want America to be \nin first place and not second place, we need to keep the American \npromise alive, and we need to do it by passing the Farm Workforce \nModernization Act, joining together in support of comprehensive \nimmigration reform.\n  Madam President, the issue of immigration, as you probably know, is a \npoint of passion of mine. I know it is one of yours. You mentioned to \nme the other day in passing that you are the only true immigrant in the \nSenate, and it is, I guess, historic that I would give this speech and \nyou would be presiding over the Senate as I do. I am sure you feel as I \ndo. These people go to work every single day. They do the dirtiest, \nhardest, most dangerous work in America, and they do it without any \nhope of a great future because they are undocumented. They have no \nfuture. The person they are working for this week may decide on Friday \nnight not to pay them anything. Are they going to go to court to fight \nfor their rights as workers? Probably not. They don't feel they have \nany rights because they are undocumented.\n  But a good thing happened here years ago when a coalition of \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans, put together a farm worker \nprovision. Now the House has done it for us again. They have led the \nway with the Farm Workforce Modernization Act and passed it and sent it \nhere. It is time for us to take up this measure.\n  I have talked to a number of our Republican friends, and many of them \nare from agricultural States. They understand it, and they support it. \nThey want to be a part of it. You would be surprised if I told you \ntheir names on the floor, but I am careful not to. They are worried \nbecause this issue of immigration is controversial. But they understand \nthe fairness of it all.\n  I want to salute Michael Bennet, the Senator from Colorado, who has \nbeen a leader on this subject from the start. Years ago, we had a \ncoalition effort, the Gang of 8 effort. He was the person who put \ntogether the farm worker provision. I think Dianne Feinstein was a \ngreat contributor in that effort as well.\n  Michael Bennet is back again working for this bill. We ought to take \nthis up. We ought to do it this week. We ought to pass it out of the \nSenate, the bill that passed the House, and, in so doing, we would be \ndoing a favor for essential workers--some of the lowest paid, hardest \nworking people in America. It is only right, and I hope we do it soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. TUBERVILLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin).

Madam President, I spoke recently about a serious \ncrisis facing our economy, the workforce shortage. This has been \nbrought on by many things that my colleagues from the left have spent \nand asked questions and brought about policies.\n  Today, I want to discuss another looming challenge to our economy, \none where Democratic policies are adding fuel to the fire, if not \nstarting the fire itself. I am talking about inflation.\n  Inflation is not an abstract idea thrown around by finance gurus. \nInflation is a real threat to the pocketbooks of hard-working Americans \nthroughout our great country. We haven't hit the inflation levels of \nJimmy Carter's days yet, but the warning signs are here.\n  I recently spoke with a group of homebuilders from across my home \nState of Alabama. They told me how they are seeing prices increase that \nare even higher than the ballooning national average. As an example, in \nAlabama and across much of the South, homebuilding materials, such as \nbrick, are up 10 percent. Insulation prices are up 15 percent. \nSheetrock prices are up nearly 50 percent. Lumber prices are up 300 \npercent. And particle board prices, which are used in most homes across \nthe country, the price is up almost 600 percent.\n  Although demand for houses went up during the height of the pandemic, \nthe Commerce Department reported that U.S. homebuilding actually \ndeclined in April of this year. With the demand for housing so high \nright now, you would think new construction would be taking place \neverywhere you turn, but that is not the case. Builders are actually \ndelaying construction projects because material prices have hit record \nhighs. Prices are rising so rapidly that a project costing $300,000 at \nthe beginning ends up costing more than $350,000 at the time of \ncompletion. This eats into builders' margins and discourages them from \nstarting new projects, therefore, putting people out of work.\n  Folks back home can rest assured that I will be monitoring this \nclosely. I will be listening to my constituents and other companies \nabout their costs and supply chain experiences. But I shouldn't be the \nonly one taking all these concerns into account. These price jumps \nshould be concerning to all of us in this building because the national \nnumbers don't paint a rosy picture.\n  In April, consumer prices jumped by 4.2 percent, the highest rise in \nover a decade. Energy prices went up 25 percent overall, with gas \nprices increasing nearly 50 percent. According to the Philadelphia \nFederal Reserve, price increases by one metric were the highest since \n1980.\n  This level of inflation doesn't just affect a select few; it affects \nall American families. For many folks, a 4-percent hike on grocery \nbills takes a serious toll. Rising prices like these are the definition \nof a kitchen table issue. Paying 50 percent more for gas or having a \ncostlier electric bill forces families to make a hard choice on what \nthey can and cannot afford for that month.\n  We must get our fiscal house in order before inflation gets totally \nout of control and reverses the economic progress we made under \nPresident Trump's leadership.\n  You know there are different ways to combat inflation--a lot of \ndifferent ways--but we know what makes inflation worse: massive \ngovernment spending, and that is exactly what we are getting as we \nspeak.\n  President Biden and congressional Democrats spent $1.9 trillion on a \nstimulus bill that flooded the economy with cash just 2 months ago. \nThink about that--1.9 trillion. Now we want to spend trillions on a \npackage in disguise of an infrastructure bill. And they are following \nthis up by trillions more to fund items on the progressive priority \nlist in the future.\n  Well, they are being confronted by the old truth: There is no such \nthing as a free lunch. Simple economics show that when the supply of \nsomething goes up, the value goes down. Money is no different.\n  President Biden's policies are pumping our economy with money we \nsimply don't have to spend, and that is the definition of inflation: \nmaking money lose its value. It is the natural result of the policies \nthat we passed in this Chamber in the last few months.\n  That is why Larry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and adviser to \nPresidents Clinton and Obama, warned that the Biden stimulus would be \n``the least responsible macroeconomic policy we've had in the last 40 \nyears.'' Remember, he worked for\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\ntwo Democratic Presidents. I couldn't agree more with Mr. Summers.\n  Democrats learned the wrong lesson from the financial crisis in 2008. \nThey thought the recovery was slow because the government spent too \nlittle. They have been determined to spend much more this time around. \nThe economic recovery from the pandemic was already well underway when \nthe Democrats passed their massive stimulus in March--$1.9 trillion.\n  Thanks to the bipartisan emergency relief bills passed under \nPresident Trump, the economy had stabilized by yearend. We were in the \nmiddle of the most rapid economic recovery on record, but the \nDemocrats' out-of-control spending is putting the recovery at risk, and \nit is the American families who will pay the price in the end.\n  In addition to a reckless monetary policy, they want to raise taxes \non all of us, including small businesses and family farms, to fund this \nspending spree. They want to undo the Tax and Jobs Cuts Act passed by \nthe Senate Republicans and signed into law by President Trump.\n  These Republican tax cuts helped create the best economy in a \ngeneration. They created countless opportunities for hard-working \nAmericans. Unemployment was at historic lows. Blue-collar wages rose \nfaster than white-collar wages for the first time in history.\n  If they repeal the Republican tax cuts, Democrats will be encouraging \nAmerican companies to move overseas. Job creators will have to pay more \ntaxes at the same time as they are recovering from the pandemic, and \nthe tax increases being proposed will be passed on to working Americans \nin the form of higher prices and lower wages.\n  In fact, the only people Democrats want to lower taxes for are the \npeople who are high earners in New York, California, and New Jersey. \nHigher taxes, combined with the Democrats' inflation, would be a one-\ntwo knockout punch of our Nation's economic recovery.\n  It only takes one match to start a brush fire. Rather than taking \ncommonsense steps to fight inflation, Democrats are preparing for it by \ndumping lighter fluid on the entire field. President Biden styles \nhimself as the second coming of FDR, but he is looking more like Jimmy \nCarter every day.\n  Americans my age will remember Carter's Presidency and how tough \nthose times were for working families. I hope we can avoid repeating \nhistory, but that means we need to take action, and we need to take \naction now. I urge my Democratic colleagues to reexamine their \nmisplaced priorities and keep pro-worker tax and spending policies in \nplace.\n  Let's work together on practical ways to get our economy and our \ncountry back to work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n", "cleaned_text": "Economic Recovery\n\n\tMr. TUBERVILLE. Madam President, I spoke recently about a serious crisis facing our economy, the workforce shortage. This has been brought on by many things that my colleagues from the left have spent and asked questions and brought about policies.\n\tToday, I want to discuss another looming challenge to our economy, one where Democratic policies are adding fuel to the fire, if not starting the fire itself. I am talking about inflation.\n\tInflation is not an abstract idea thrown around by finance gurus. Inflation is a real threat to the pocketbooks of hard-working Americans throughout our great country. We haven't hit the inflation levels of Jimmy Carter's days yet, but the warning signs are here.\n\tI recently spoke with a group of homebuilders from across my home State of Alabama. They told me how they are seeing prices increase that are even higher than the ballooning national average. As an example, in Alabama and across much of the South, homebuilding materials, such as brick, are up 10 percent. Insulation prices are up 15 percent. Sheetrock prices are up nearly 50 percent. Lumber prices are up 300 percent. And particle board prices, which are used in most homes across the country, the price is up almost 600 percent.\n\tAlthough demand for houses went up during the height of the pandemic, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. homebuilding actually declined in April of this year. With the demand for housing so high right now, you would think new construction would be taking place everywhere you turn, but that is not the case. Builders are actually delaying construction projects because material prices have hit record highs. Prices are rising so rapidly that a project costing $300,000 at the beginning ends up costing more than $350,000 at the time of completion. This eats into builders' margins and discourages them from starting new projects, therefore, putting people out of work.\n\tFolks back home can rest assured that I will be monitoring this closely. I will be listening to my constituents and other companies about their costs and supply chain experiences. But I shouldn't be the only one taking all these concerns into account. These price jumps should be concerning to all of us in this building because the national numbers don't paint a rosy picture.\n\tIn April, consumer prices jumped by 4.2 percent, the highest rise in over a decade. Energy prices went up 25 percent overall, with gas prices increasing nearly 50 percent. According to the Philadelphia Federal Reserve, price increases by one metric were the highest since 1980.\n\tThis level of inflation doesn't just affect a select few; it affects all American families. For many folks, a 4-percent hike on grocery bills takes a serious toll. Rising prices like these are the definition of a kitchen table issue. Paying 50 percent more for gas or having a costlier electric bill forces families to make a hard choice on what they can and cannot afford for that month.\n\tWe must get our fiscal house in order before inflation gets totally out of control and reverses the economic progress we made under President Trump's leadership.\n\tYou know there are different ways to combat inflation--a lot of different ways--but we know what makes inflation worse: massive government spending, and that is exactly what we are getting as we speak.\n\tPresident Biden and congressional Democrats spent $1.9 trillion on a stimulus bill that flooded the economy with cash just 2 months ago. Think about that--1.9 trillion. Now we want to spend trillions on a package in disguise of an infrastructure bill. And they are following this up by trillions more to fund items on the progressive priority list in the future.\n\tWell, they are being confronted by the old truth: There is no such thing as a free lunch. Simple economics show that when the supply of something goes up, the value goes down. Money is no different.\n\tPresident Biden's policies are pumping our economy with money we simply don't have to spend, and that is the definition of inflation: making money lose its value. It is the natural result of the policies that we passed in this Chamber in the last few months.\n\tThat is why Larry Summers, a former Treasury Secretary and adviser to Presidents Clinton and Obama, warned that the Biden stimulus would be ``the least responsible macroeconomic policy we've had in the last 40 years.'' Remember, he worked for two Democratic Presidents. I couldn't agree more with Mr. Summers.\n\tDemocrats learned the wrong lesson from the financial crisis in 2008. They thought the recovery was slow because the government spent too little. They have been determined to spend much more this time around. The economic recovery from the pandemic was already well underway when the Democrats passed their massive stimulus in March--$1.9 trillion.\n\tThanks to the bipartisan emergency relief bills passed under President Trump, the economy had stabilized by yearend. We were in the middle of the most rapid economic recovery on record, but the Democrats' out-of-control spending is putting the recovery at risk, and it is the American families who will pay the price in the end.\n\tIn addition to a reckless monetary policy, they want to raise taxes on all of us, including small businesses and family farms, to fund this spending spree. They want to undo the Tax and Jobs Cuts Act passed by the Senate Republicans and signed into law by President Trump.\n\tThese Republican tax cuts helped create the best economy in a generation. They created countless opportunities for hard-working Americans. Unemployment was at historic lows. Blue-collar wages rose faster than white-collar wages for the first time in history.\n\tIf they repeal the Republican tax cuts, Democrats will be encouraging American companies to move overseas. Job creators will have to pay more taxes at the same time as they are recovering from the pandemic, and the tax increases being proposed will be passed on to working Americans in the form of higher prices and lower wages.\n\tIn fact, the only people Democrats want to lower taxes for are the people who are high earners in New York, California, and New Jersey. Higher taxes, combined with the Democrats' inflation, would be a one-two knockout punch of our Nation's economic recovery.\n\tIt only takes one match to start a brush fire. Rather than taking commonsense steps to fight inflation, Democrats are preparing for it by dumping lighter fluid on the entire field. President Biden styles himself as the second coming of FDR, but he is looking more like Jimmy Carter every day.\n\tAmericans my age will remember Carter's Presidency and how tough those times were for working families. I hope we can avoid repeating history, but that means we need to take action, and we need to take action now. I urge my Democratic colleagues to reexamine their misplaced priorities and keep pro-worker tax and spending policies in place.\n\tLet's work together on practical ways to get our economy and our country back to work.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. CORNYN.

Madam President, during the first 4 months of 2021, more \nthan half a million migrants have crossed our southern border--a half a \nmillion--including more than 50,000 unaccompanied children. Now, nobody \nreally believes that those children got there all by themselves. The \ntruth is, they have been smuggled to the border and crossed the border \nonly to be picked up by Border Patrol, taken care of, as we would all \nhope they would be, and ultimately be placed with U.S. sponsors. I will \nhave more to say about that in a moment.\n  In the same period of time last year, there were fewer than 125 \nmigrants who crossed our border, including just over 10,000 children--\nhalf a million so far this year, 125,000 last year, 50,000 children so \nfar this year, 10,000 last year during the same period of time. Put \nsimply, this is not normal, nor should it be the standard operating \nprocedure for the U.S. Government. The truth is, our country lacks the \nfacilities, the personnel, the resources, and the policies to handle \nthis sort of influx of humanity in a humane way.\n  Back in March, the President tapped Vice President Harris to handle \nthe border crisis, but we have seen no progress to date. In fact, the \nVice President, I believe, is in Guatemala today, and she hasn't even \nbeen to our southern border. She hasn't visited the facilities where \ntens of thousands of migrant children have been cared for. And she \nhasn't listened to the migrants' horrifying stories of how they were \ntreated by the human smugglers that brought them to the border.\n  We do know the Vice President is finally hitting the trail this week \nto talk about the border crisis. But that seems to be all it is, is \ntalk. The only problem is, she is not visiting the border. She is not \neven in her home State of California, which has a border with Mexico. \nShe is in Guatemala.\n  As law enforcement, nongovernmental organizations, and border \ncommunities are being overwhelmed by the surge of migration, the Vice \nPresident is meeting with foreign leaders. Now, there is nothing \ninherently wrong about meeting with foreign leaders, but, surely, she \ncan't think that a conversation with the President of Guatemala is \ngoing to solve the human crisis at our border.\n  The Border Patrol will tell you, as they have told me, mass migration \nlike this is a product of two different actions. One is the so-called \npush factors, which means people who lack economic opportunity; maybe \nthey are fleeing violence; maybe they just want to come to America to \nbe reunited with some other relatives; and certainly the human \nsmugglers are more than happy at $5,000, and more, a head to help them. \nBut these smugglers, as I intimated a moment ago, are a part of \ntransnational criminal organizations that care nothing for these \nmigrants. They just care about the money. And what they do is they \nflood the border with unaccompanied children, for example, taking as \nmany as 40 percent of the Border Patrol off the frontlines in the war \nagainst illegal drugs coming across the border. And when the Border \nPatrol is not there--surprise, surprise--the very drugs that \ncontributed to the loss of about 80,000 lives last year in America \nalone come flowing across, whether it is heroin or cocaine or \nartificial opioids. You name it, it is coming across the border by the \nsame people who are moving the migrants across the border. Again, they \nare commodity agnostic. They will do anything for a buck, and they care \nnothing about the migrants at all.\n  Well, imagine calling 9-1-1 when your home is on fire and watching as \nthey hose down your neighbor's house instead. That is what it feels \nlike watching the Vice President down in Central America.\n  For years, the United States has tried to address the crime and \ncorruption in Central America with very limited success. Do they have \nsome modest role in the crisis? Well, yes, but that is hardly where the \nVice President's attention should be focused right now. Particularly, \nshe should be focused--and the President focused--on working with us on \npolicies that Congress would pass that would mitigate this humanitarian \ncrisis.\n  Former Senator Harris's list of legislative accomplishments and her \nexperience solving complex policy problems is not particularly deep. \nBut rather than be critical, I would like to offer a suggestion.\n  In April, Senator Sinema--the Senator from Arizona--and I introduced \nthe Bipartisan Border Solutions Act to address this unfettered flow of \nmigration. She is concerned about Arizona; I am concerned about Texas. \nBut the truth is, I am concerned about America writ large.\n  We have been proud to work in a bicameral way, too, with two of our \nfriends on the other side of the Capitol: Congressman Henry Cuellar, a \nDemocrat from Laredo, TX; and Tony Gonzales, from the 23rd \ncongressional district. The four of us live in and represent border \nStates and districts. We have spent time--a lot of time--listening and \nlearning from the men and women who are committed to safeguarding our \nborder and those who care for the migrants and those who live in these \nborder communities.\n  There are a lot of people out there who will talk about what is \nhappening at the border who have never actually been there, so how in \nthe world would they possibly know? They inaccurately characterize \nborder communities as unsafe, lawless places. That is not true.\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\nThey villainize the Border Patrol and other law enforcement Agencies \nlike ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Remember the ``Abolish \nICE'' slogan? They are criticizing these public servants for actually \nenforcing the laws that Congress has passed. Congress passed those \nlaws. These brave men and women are simply executing the laws that \nCongress itself has passed.\n  Well, unfortunately, there is a lot of talk here in Washington by \npeople who offer blanket solutions that have nothing to do, or very \nlittle, with solving the complex problems that exist. The fact of the \nmatter is, my State of 29 million people has a beautiful, safe, and \nvibrant border region. I was there last Wednesday, last. The men and \nwomen who lead and protect these communities are doing everything they \ncan to fairly and humanely respond to the crisis. But they are being \noverwhelmed, and they are not getting much help from the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  The same is true across our entire southern border. At her \ninvitation, I visited Tucson last Tuesday, a very different border \nregion than we visited on Wednesday, where Senator Sinema came to \nMcAllen, at my request, in the Rio Grande Valley.\n  I appreciate her and her staff taking the time to learn more about \nthe differences in the border in my State from her State. And I \ncertainly learned a lot by traveling to Tucson and meeting with her \nconstituents.\n  In Arizona, we visited a soft-sided Customs and Border Protection \nfacility where migrants are processed, and the Tucson sector chief \ntalked about the broad responsibilities his agents have in these \nfacilities.\n  As I suggested a moment ago, normally, the Border Patrol is \nresponsible for patrolling the border. That is why they call them the \nBorder Patrol. But now they are encountering unaccompanied children and \nhave to leave those frontlines--about 40 percent of them--just to take \ncare of them at these CBP, Customs and Border Protection, facilities.\n  Well, we need the Border Patrol on the border, patrolling the border \nso they can deal with everything from encountering a child abandoned by \nhuman smugglers to a tractor full of human trafficking victims. They \nmight, and will and do, interdict drugs, weapons, money, or any of a \nnumber of contraband being smuggled across the border. Again, as some \nwise person coined the phrase ``commodity agnostic,'' these \ntransnational criminal organizations that really bring people into the \nUnited States from worldwide locations but principally from Mexico and \nCentral America--all they care about is the money.\n  In the Tucson sector alone, 103 agents were pulled from the field \nbecause somebody needed to take care of the migrants. Now they are \ndoing everything from changing diapers to serving meals, to supervising \nplaytime for the children--103 law enforcement officers in the Tucson \nsector alone who should be stopping dangerous people and dangerous \nsubstances from entering our country instead of acting as caretakers \nand not creating serious gaps in our border security.\n  Of course, the cartels--these criminal organizations--are pretty \nsmart. This is actually part of their business model. They know that if \nthey flood the border with unaccompanied children, for example, the \nBorder Patrol is going to leave huge gaps that are then going to be \nexploited by the drug smugglers.\n  They know about the vulnerabilities that exist on our border. They \nknow about our laws and policies, and they are actively exploiting \nthem. And we are basically letting them. Shame on us.\n  In the Rio Grande Valley last week, we spoke with a number of law \nenforcement and community leaders, including the National Border Patrol \nCouncil president, Brandon Judd. Brandon told us that, this year, \nindividuals from 151 different countries were processed at the Donna \nProcessing Facility. This is one processing facility in Donna, TX, in \nthe Rio Grande Valley. Last year, they processed people from 151 \ndifferent countries.\n  A couple of weeks ago, Customs and Border Protection at the Laredo \nPort of Entry made a seizure of hard narcotics worth more than $3.5 \nmillion of street value. This wasn't from an entire week's worth of \ndrug interdictions; this came from two vehicles that they stopped. One \nhad 20 pounds of cocaine in it; the other had more than 167 pounds of \nmethamphetamine.\n  This strain on law enforcement poses serious risks to our entire \ncountry. The criminals, the drugs, the weapons, and other illegal goods \nthat cross our border are heading to every corner of the United States. \nAnd if you think they are stopping at the border, think again. They are \ntraveling to all 50 of the United States.\n  And while unaccompanied children have become the face of this crisis, \nthere is a ripple effect that extends far and wide. Border Patrol, \nultimately, doesn't have the capacity to provide safe and thorough care \nfor these children and patrol our borders and interdict dangerous \nsubstances and enforce our laws. Agents are spread a mile wide and an \ninch deep, and something has got to change.\n  This is where the Bipartisan Border Solutions Act comes in. We \nprovide for two major changes in the way that migrants are processed to \nalleviate the strain on law enforcement and improve the way we process \nand care for migrants when they are in our custody. One, the bill \nestablishes at least four regional processing centers in high-traffic \nareas. It is, in effect, a ``one stop shop'' for the various government \nAgencies involved in processing migrants. CBP, Customs and Border \nProtection; ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement; FEMA, the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency; the USCIS, U.S. Customs and Immigration \nService; and the Office of Refugee Resettlement will all be housed \nunder a single roof.\n  Migrants can receive medical screenings, have their identities \nverified, and go through a criminal history check all in one place. And \nthen they will begin the legal process of seeking asylum if, in fact, \nthat is what they are doing. They will complete their asylum \ninterviews, go through legal orientation so they know their rights, and \nreceive the documents and information they need to appear for their \nfuture court date in front of an immigration judge.\n  Our bill also addresses the staffing shortages that have made this \nsituation much more challenging. It requires the hiring of hundreds of \nCBP officers and Border Patrol processing coordinators so agents can \nget back on the frontlines. In other words, these processing \ncoordinators aren't going to be Border Patrol agents who are highly \ntrained law enforcement officers. We want them back on the frontlines. \nBut if it comes to processing the migrants and preparing the paperwork, \nwe believe these processing coordinators can help.\n  Our legislation also calls for 150 new immigration judge teams, 300 \nasylum officers, ICE litigation teams, and other personnel to help \nadjudicate these asylum claims.\n  Right now, the system is completely overwhelmed, and that is exactly \nwhat the human smugglers--what we call the coyotes--are planning on. \nEverybody in Texas along the border, everybody in Arizona, and \neverybody who lives or works along the border understands what is \nhappening. Again, that is why it would be so instructive for Vice \nPresident Harris to actually go to the border.\n  In order to gain a handle on the mass movement of migrants, we need \nto make these commonsense changes. When it comes to children, it is not \nenough to ensure they are safely processed by Border Patrol and then \ntransferred to Health and Human Services' custody. We also need to make \nsure these children are safe after they have been placed with sponsors \nin the United States and told to appear for a future court hearing. In \nmost cases, children are released to parents or other relatives, but \nnot always.\n  HHS reports that in 2021, more than 1,000 children have been released \nto unrelated individuals or distant relatives they don't even know. \nWhile these may be legitimate caretakers, it can also open the door for \nthese children to be exploited or trafficked.\n  In 2014, the Office of Refugee Resettlement placed eight children \nwith members of a human trafficking ring who posed as family or \nfriends. These children were forced to work on an egg farm in Ohio for \nno pay for 12 hours a\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nday, 6 or 7 days a week. They lived in deplorable conditions, and they \nwere threatened with violence if they didn't comply. These distant \nrelatives, unbeknownst to these children, and these unrelated \nindividuals are a big cause for concern, but not the only one.\n  Before a child is released into the custody of anyone--a parent, \ngrandparent, aunt, or uncle--this person must be thoroughly vetted by \nthe Federal Government because we simply can't hand a child over to \nsomebody who is going to be a danger to them. There is no vetting \nrequirement, though, for other people who live in the same home. And \nthose of us who have dealt with the scourge of child abuse know that \nabout anybody living in the same home with a minor child--particularly, \nan unaccompanied child who has undergone the trauma of moving from \nCentral America to the United States is going to be a potential victim.\n  You can have a trustworthy individual identified as taking care of \nthe child, but abuse could be happening under the roof by another \nperson who lives there. Why do we say that? Because, sadly, it happens \nall the time. Or, heaven forbid, the parent or the relative is the one \nwho decides to exploit the child themselves.\n  What is being done to prevent this abuse? As it turns out, not a lot \nby the Federal Government. The Health and Human Services Department \nrequires safety and well-being check-in calls to be made to sponsors \nwithin 30 days after a child has been released. But in 2021 alone, the \ndata shows that 18 percent, nearly one in five children, could not be \nreached after 30 days. Phone calls were not answered. Door knocks were \nnot responded to. And that means that hundreds of children released to \nthe care of these adults in the United States on our watch are lost to \nthe system. We don't know if they are in a safe home or if they are a \nvictim of trafficking or abuse, or whether they simply disappeared, \nwhether they have been recruited into a gang. The U.S. Government \nsimply does not know where they are and what is happening to them. This \nis a national scandal.\n  Senator Sinema and I are committed to passing this legislation that \nprovides these critical protections for these children who already have \nendured a lot of pain and suffering--a lot more than any child should.\n  Our bill would require criminal background checks, not only for the \nchild's sponsor but for any other adult living in the household. It \nwill bar children from being placed in the custody of anyone who has \nbeen convicted of sex offenses, domestic violence, human trafficking, \nchild abuse, or other serious crimes. The U.S. Government simply can't \ncheck a box once they have placed a child with a sponsor in the United \nStates. After the initial 30-day checkup, we require another 60-day \ncheckup--as a matter of fact, every 60 days.\n  Protections for children, streamlined processes, more personnel--\nthese are commonsense reforms that will address the most urgent issues \ncurrently on our southern border.\n  Bipartisanship, as we know, is in short supply these days, especially \nwhen it comes to the debate surrounding immigration and border \nsecurity. We have folks in both parties and in both Chambers of \nCongress lined up behind this particular bill. I hope we can add more \nbipartisan cosponsors.\n  Our bill has already been endorsed by a broad range of law \nenforcement, immigration, and business groups--for example, the \nNational Border Patrol Council, National Immigration Forum, and U.S. \nHispanic Chamber of Commerce. I could go on and on.\n  As I have said before, and I will say again in closing, if anybody \nhas a better idea, I am all ears. But, right now, all we hear is \ncrickets. No one is offering any bipartisan, bicameral solutions--\nanything close to what we have described here. This isn't meant to be \ncomprehensive immigration reform. It is a targeted solution to the most \nurgent problems at hand.\n  I would be happy to offer this legislation to Vice President Harris \nor President Biden as a solution to the crisis on our southern border. \nI am happy to meet with them. Senator Sinema, I am sure, feels the \nsame, and Congressman Cuellar and Congressman Gonzalez.\n  We are interested in fixing the problem, not scoring political \npoints, and we can't afford to wait years or maybe even decades to see \nthe circumstances in Central America change. After all, then-Vice \nPresident Biden was tapped to solve this identical problem by President \nObama. Let me say that again: Vice President Biden was tapped to solve \nthis identical problem by President Obama. Not only was he \nunsuccessful, but, as we know, it has gotten worse since that time.\n  We need urgent action to address the crisis we are experiencing today \nat our Nation's border and the Bipartisan Border Solutions Act is an \nimportant first step.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But now they are encountering unaccompanied children and have to leave those frontlines--about 40 percent of them--just to take care of them at these CBP, Customs and Border Protection, facilities.\n\tWell, we need the Border Patrol on the border, patrolling the border so they can deal with everything from encountering a child abandoned by human smugglers to a tractor full of human trafficking victims. They might, and will and do, interdict drugs, weapons, money, or any of a number of contraband being smuggled across the border. Again, as some wise person coined the phrase ``commodity agnostic,'' these transnational criminal organizations that really bring people into the United States from worldwide locations but principally from Mexico and Central America--all they care about is the money.\n\tIn the Tucson sector alone, 103 agents were pulled from the field because somebody needed to take care of the migrants. Now they are doing everything from changing diapers to serving meals, to supervising playtime for the children--103 law enforcement officers in the Tucson sector alone who should be stopping dangerous people and dangerous substances from entering our country instead of acting as caretakers and not creating serious gaps in our border security.\n\tOf course, the cartels--these criminal organizations--are pretty smart. This is actually part of their business model. They know that if they flood the border with unaccompanied children, for example, the Border Patrol is going to leave huge gaps that are then going to be exploited by the drug smugglers.\n\tThey know about the vulnerabilities that exist on our border. They know about our laws and policies, and they are actively exploiting them. And we are basically letting them. Shame on us.\n\tIn the Rio Grande Valley last week, we spoke with a number of law enforcement and community leaders, including the National Border Patrol Council president, Brandon Judd. Brandon told us that, this year, individuals from 151 different countries were processed at the Donna Processing Facility. This is one processing facility in Donna, TX, in the Rio Grande Valley. Last year, they processed people from 151 different countries.\n\tA couple of weeks ago, Customs and Border Protection at the Laredo Port of Entry made a seizure of hard narcotics worth more than $3.5 million of street value. This wasn't from an entire week's worth of drug interdictions; this came from two vehicles that they stopped. One had 20 pounds of cocaine in it; the other had more than 167 pounds of methamphetamine.\n\tThis strain on law enforcement poses serious risks to our entire country. The criminals, the drugs, the weapons, and other illegal goods that cross our border are heading to every corner of the United States. And if you think they are stopping at the border, think again. They are traveling to all 50 of the United States.\n\tAnd while unaccompanied children have become the face of this crisis, there is a ripple effect that extends far and wide. Border Patrol, ultimately, doesn't have the capacity to provide safe and thorough care for these children and patrol our borders and interdict dangerous substances and enforce our laws. Agents are spread a mile wide and an inch deep, and something has got to change.\n\tThis is where the Bipartisan Border Solutions Act comes in. We provide for two major changes in the way that migrants are processed to alleviate the strain on law enforcement and improve the way we process and care for migrants when they are in our custody. One, the bill establishes at least four regional processing centers in high-traffic areas. It is, in effect, a ``one stop shop'' for the various government Agencies involved in processing migrants. CBP, Customs and Border Protection; ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement; FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency; the USCIS, U.S. Customs and Immigration Service; and the Office of Refugee Resettlement will all be housed under a single roof.\n\tMigrants can receive medical screenings, have their identities verified, and go through a criminal history check all in one place. And then they will begin the legal process of seeking asylum if, in fact, that is what they are doing. They will complete their asylum interviews, go through legal orientation so they know their rights, and receive the documents and information they need to appear for their future court date in front of an immigration judge.\n\tOur bill also addresses the staffing shortages that have made this situation much more challenging. It requires the hiring of hundreds of CBP officers and Border Patrol processing coordinators so agents can get back on the frontlines. In other words, these processing coordinators aren't going to be Border Patrol agents who are highly trained law enforcement officers. We want them back on the frontlines. But if it comes to processing the migrants and preparing the paperwork, we believe these processing coordinators can help.\n\tOur legislation also calls for 150 new immigration judge teams, 300 asylum officers, ICE litigation teams, and other personnel to help adjudicate these asylum claims.\n\tRight now, the system is completely overwhelmed, and that is exactly what the human smugglers--what we call the coyotes--are planning on. Everybody in Texas along the border, everybody in Arizona, and everybody who lives or works along the border understands what is happening. Again, that is why it would be so instructive for Vice President Harris to actually go to the border.\n\tIn order to gain a handle on the mass movement of migrants, we need to make these commonsense changes. When it comes to children, it is not enough to ensure they are safely processed by Border Patrol and then transferred to Health and Human Services' custody. We also need to make sure these children are safe after they have been placed with sponsors in the United States and told to appear for a future court hearing. In most cases, children are released to parents or other relatives, but not always.\n\tHHS reports that in 2021, more than 1,000 children have been released to unrelated individuals or distant relatives they don't even know. While these may be legitimate caretakers, it can also open the door for these children to be exploited or trafficked.\n\tIn 2014, the Office of Refugee Resettlement placed eight children with members of a human trafficking ring who posed as family or friends. These children were forced to work on an egg farm in Ohio for no pay for 12 hours a day, 6 or 7 days a week. They lived in deplorable conditions, and they were threatened with violence if they didn't comply. These distant relatives, unbeknownst to these children, and these unrelated individuals are a big cause for concern, but not the only one.\n\tBefore a child is released into the custody of anyone--a parent, grandparent, aunt, or uncle--this person must be thoroughly vetted by the Federal Government because we simply can't hand a child over to somebody who is going to be a danger to them. There is no vetting requirement, though, for other people who live in the same home. And those of us who have dealt with the scourge of child abuse know that about anybody living in the same home with a minor child--particularly, an unaccompanied child who has undergone the trauma of moving from Central America to the United States is going to be a potential victim.\n\tYou can have a trustworthy individual identified as taking care of the child, but abuse could be happening under the roof by another person who lives there. Why do we say that? Because, sadly, it happens all the time. Or, heaven forbid, the parent or the relative is the one who decides to exploit the child themselves.\n\tWhat is being done to prevent this abuse? As it turns out, not a lot by the Federal Government. The Health and Human Services Department requires safety and well-being check-in calls to be made to sponsors within 30 days after a child has been released. But in 2021 alone, the data shows that 18 percent, nearly one in five children, could not be reached after 30 days. Phone calls were not answered. Door knocks were not responded to. And that means that hundreds of children released to the care of these adults in the United States on our watch are lost to the system. We don't know if they are in a safe home or if they are a victim of trafficking or abuse, or whether they simply disappeared, whether they have been recruited into a gang. The U.S. Government simply does not know where they are and what is happening to them. This is a national scandal.\n\tSenator Sinema and I are committed to passing this legislation that provides these critical protections for these children who already have endured a lot of pain and suffering--a lot more than any child should.\n\tOur bill would require criminal background checks, not only for the child's sponsor but for any other adult living in the household. It will bar children from being placed in the custody of anyone who has been convicted of sex offenses, domestic violence, human trafficking, child abuse, or other serious crimes. The U.S. Government simply can't check a box once they have placed a child with a sponsor in the United States. After the initial 30-day checkup, we require another 60-day checkup--as a matter of fact, every 60 days.\n\tProtections for children, streamlined processes, more personnel--these are commonsense reforms that will address the most urgent issues currently on our southern border.\n\tBipartisanship, as we know, is in short supply these days, especially when it comes to the debate surrounding immigration and border security. We have folks in both parties and in both Chambers of Congress lined up behind this particular bill. I hope we can add more bipartisan cosponsors.\n\tOur bill has already been endorsed by a broad range of law enforcement, immigration, and business groups--for example, the National Border Patrol Council, National Immigration Forum, and U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. I could go on and on.\n\tAs I have said before, and I will say again in closing, if anybody has a better idea, I am all ears. But, right now, all we hear is crickets. No one is offering any bipartisan, bicameral solutions--anything close to what we have described here. This isn't meant to be comprehensive immigration reform. It is a targeted solution to the most urgent problems at hand.\n\tI would be happy to offer this legislation to Vice President Harris or President Biden as a solution to the crisis on our southern border. I am happy to meet with them. Senator Sinema, I am sure, feels the same, and Congressman Cuellar and Congressman Gonzalez.\n\tWe are interested in fixing the problem, not scoring political points, and we can't afford to wait years or maybe even decades to see the circumstances in Central America change. After all, then-Vice President Biden was tapped to solve this identical problem by President Obama. Let me say that again: Vice President Biden was tapped to solve this identical problem by President Obama. Not only was he unsuccessful, but, as we know, it has gotten worse since that time.\n\tWe need urgent action to address the crisis we are experiencing today at our Nation's border and the Bipartisan Border Solutions Act is an important first step.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, when I was first elected to Congress \nin the 1970s, I ran as ``Grassley, the inflation fighter.'' Inflation \nwas about 12 or 13 percent at that time. When I ran for the Senate, it \nwas 12 or 13 percent again, and it hasn't been a major problem since \nthen.\n  Those who remember that time of high inflation know that it is a time \nperiod when inflation was a real problem. It kneecaps middle-class \nprosperity and causes severe hardships for those already struggling. \nInflation is nothing short of a regressive tax, as it hurts Americans \nmore the less money that they have.\n  It is a stealth tax. With the income tax, you can see how much the \ngovernment is taking out of your paycheck. With a sales tax, you can \nsee on your receipt what the government took for its cut. With \ninflation, the value of the dollar in your pocket is reduced without \neven leaving your billfold.\n  When Americans suddenly notice that it costs more to buy the same \ngroceries, it can be hard to know whom to blame. Did the store just \ndecide to raise prices or is inflation caused by mysterious economic \nforces beyond anyone's control?\n  In reality, the Federal Government can directly cause inflation by \nprinting too much money to feed its spending habits. Politicians like \nto promise freebies that someone else will pay for--maybe ``the rich'' \nwill pay.\n  Who is ``the rich,'' you might ask. ``Don't worry; it is not you,'' \nthe big spenders assure us.\n  Well, don't be so sure. President Biden suggested that if rich people \npay their fair share of taxes, we can afford to spend another $4 to $6 \ntrillion. Now, in reality, if the government confiscated all the wealth \nof all the U.S. billionaires, it wouldn't cover that bill. Just asking \nthem to pay a little bit more, as the President suggests, will barely \nmake a dent.\n  So who is going to pay the bill? Don't be fooled. Each American is \ngoing to pay that bill. Hard-working Americans will be shouldering the \ncosts of Biden's spending plans in the form of lower wages or higher \nprices at the gas pump or the checkout lines at Hy-Vee in Cedar Falls, \nIA.\n  Remember, prior to the pandemic, tax reform and a more predictable \nregulatory environment contributed to the best economy America had seen \nin decades. Yes, prior to the pandemic, as a result of the policies of \nregulatory reform and of the tax bill of 2017, we did end up with the \nbest economy America had seen in 50 years. Unemployment reached a 50-\nyear low. Family incomes and workers' wages experienced robust gains. \nIn fact, wage growth was strongest for low-wage workers. As a result, \nincome inequality actually declined.\n  My colleagues across the aisle like to repeat the falsehood that tax \nreform was just ``tax cuts for the rich''--not true. We eliminated \nloopholes that allowed some favored corporations to avoid millions in \ntaxes. By having more corporations paying their fair share, we were \nable to lower the overall corporate rate to be more in line with other \ncountries, like Sweden or Denmark.\n  Tax reform meant more investments in America, creating good-paying \njobs for hard-working Americans.\n  The prepandemic thriving economy is poised now to come roaring back \nif the government just gets out of the way. Raising tax rates while \nadding new giveaways for Democrats' favored corporations that sign onto \nthe Green New Deal will kill the goose that laid the golden egg.\n  While President Biden talks a good game about everyone paying their \nfair share, he is proposing an unprecedented spending binge. This will \nonly\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\nfuel inflation. The burden will fall hard on the middle class and be \ndevastating to low-income Americans.\n  There are already signs that inflation is starting to kick in. Have \nyou ordered a hamburger at a restaurant lately? I heard from an Iowan \nin Sioux City that at one furniture store, a particular recliner that \nsold for $199 last year now sells for $249. A leather reclining sofa \nthat sold for $1,899 last year, today costs $2,599. Price increases of \n25 percent to 37 percent for furniture are impacting the lifestyle of \nIowa families and doing it right now.\n  Many homebuilding supplies have doubled or even tripled in price. \nThis is partly due to the shortage of lumber. I have called on the \nadministration to take action to address this, but the price increases \nare not limited just to wood products.\n  President Biden's economic advisers assure us that this inflation \nIowans are seeing with their own eyes is just temporary and really \nnothing to worry about, but it is real and it is happening.\n  Economists from across the political spectrum are starting to raise \nalarms. Larry Summers--whom you know as the former president of \nHarvard, former outstanding economic professor at Harvard, President \nObama's chief economist, and also Secretary of Treasury under President \nClinton--warned that the $2 trillion Biden stimulus that was rammed \nthrough Congress on a partisan basis was way too big.\n  Larry Summers is quoted as saying:\n\n       I think this is the least responsible macroeconomic policy \n     we've had in the last 40 years.\n\n  More recently, in a Time Magazine interview conducted after the \nrelease of the President's budget, he expressed concerns this way: \n``that we are injecting more demand into the economy than the potential \nsupply . . . and that will generate overheating.''\n  When a longtime Democratic economist of the stature of Larry Summers \nsounds the inflation alarm, the President would be well advised to \nlisten to that alarm. The President's spending plans would dump fuel on \nan inflation fire that the Fed has ignored in favor of easy money \npolicies geared toward propping up Wall Street.\n  In the end, the poor and the middle class will pay. Income inequality \nwill rise. For all of their lip service about taking from the rich and \ngiving to the poor, the Democrats' big spending policies may stimulate \nstock prices for the wealthiest Americans, while everyone else pays \nmore for less.\n  I suggested in a speech about excess unemployment benefits that \npoliticians should emulate doctors, and you know what doctors are \ntaught: ``First, do no harm.'' That applies to big spending plans when \nthere are signs of inflation. Once inflation starts to run away, it is \ndifficult to stamp out. Remember the decade of the seventies. The Fed \nwould have no choice but to aggressively hike interest rates, which \ncould trigger a recession.\n  In coming out of a pandemic that has caused so many hardships for \nAmerican families, the last thing they need is more economic hardship \ncaused by either inflation or a recession. That should give Congress \npause.\n  First, do no harm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Smith). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam President, it appears the White House had good \nreason to wait until the Friday before Memorial Day to release their \nbudget proposal. They couldn't afford a full week's news cycle any more \nthan the American people can afford to fulfill the wish list items \nPresident Biden is asking them to pay for. It is a very long list.\n  I think it is safe to say my Democratic colleagues are trying to make \nthe most of the next year and a half. They know that time is not on \ntheir side nor are the American people. There really is something for \nevery faction of the left. Here are a few of the items that are \ncontained in this Biden boondoggle of a budget.\n  The environmental lobby did a great job these past few months. They \nare more than taken care of with more electric car subsidies and a $936 \nmillion payout toward environmental justice initiatives.\n  We also have more funding to expand the Department of Education. If \nyou think that more government is what your child's educational \nexperience has been missing, well, this is the budget for you. Yet, if \nyou are fed up with the way teachers unions have treated children in \nthe classroom, if you are fed up with schools that have been in \nlockdown, you will want to pay close attention to what I am talking \nabout today.\n  Apparently, the good people over at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services have time on their hands. Bear in mind, it is your money \nthat is paying them to do the job at which they have time on their \nhands. Now, they will be switching gears from pandemic response to a \nnew focus on environmental extremism, reparations, and gutting the \nSecond Amendment.\n  What is in this budget? Bigger government, a higher deficit, and \nrunaway inflation.\n  What is out? According to this budget, national defense is no longer \na priority for the Biden administration or for the Department of \nDefense. Border security is also on the back burner along with the \nfamily-friendly tax policies we implemented under President Trump.\n  President Biden and the Democrats are doubling down on every mistake \nthey have made so far. Instead of doing their jobs, they are paying lip \nservice to struggling businesses, to struggling stores on Main Street \nin your hometown, to crumbling bridges--like in Memphis, TN--and \nroadways, and to future generations of Americans who will come into \nthis world owning their own, personal chunk of our skyrocketing \nnational debt. That is right. If you have a child or a grandchild born \nthis year, their share of the national debt is going to be about \n$80,000. Think about that.\n  Think about what has happened to this debt. From President Washington \nto President George Bush, it was about $10.6 trillion. During the \nObama-Biden years, that debt doubled. Then it was added to through the \npandemic. Now one would be led to believe that this administration had \ndecided it was going to take the credit cards and swipe them so many \ntimes they would run the numbers off of them\n  Yes, this is the Biden surcharge at work--forcing the American people \nto pay a premium just to live. Cradle to grave, daylight to dark, they \nhave got a list of tax hikes and increased fees for you. You hard-\nworking Americans, you cannot escape it, and what a world they have \ndecided they want to leave for future generations. I think it is awful.\n  I will tell you what--this budget is such a terrible representation \nof what America actually needs that, back home in Tennessee, as I was \nhome last week, people would come up to me and ask me if this was \nreally a serious budget. It is so extreme. It is so huge.\n  They would say: Surely, your Democratic colleagues are not serious \nabout this. Surely, President Biden is not serious about this budget.\n  Still, my colleagues across the aisle are so eager to get this done \nthat they are prepared to, once again, throw regular order out the \nwindow.\n  My Democratic colleagues are living in an alternate reality. It is \nthe only explanation for why they continue to insist that this country \nwill be better off under a government that strips away your freedoms \nrather than guarantees them and one that tries to tell you how to live \nyour life every minute of every day--from the time your feet hit the \nfloor in the morning until the time you brush your teeth and get in bed \nat night.\n\n\n                       For the People Act of 2021\n\n  No, Madam President, when it comes to the Biden administration, Big \nGovernment is its theme not only of the day but of every day. It is the \ntheme when it comes to spending, to regulations, and even to intrusions \ninto constitutionally mandated State authority.\n  Before the State work period, the majority leader indicated that he \nintended to use this month to shove through yet another wish list item. \nMy Democratic colleagues have tried several times to skip debate and \nsneak through various provisions of their S. 1 election takeover bill. \nThey tried to do this for the same reason President Biden released his \ndisastrous budget on a Friday after everyone had already left town. It \nis because the bill could not survive a fair news cycle once the \nAmerican people knew what was in it.\n  To my Democratic colleagues, remember the American people know--\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\nafter we went through ObamaCare and the Affordable Care Act--that the \ncurrent Speaker of the House had then said: Well, we have to pass this \nbill so we can read it and find out what is in it.\n  They know that this is the way you like to operate.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \ndispute my characterization of the bill. So, for the benefit of the \nrecord, let's go through a few of the provisions they are absolutely \nconvinced will somehow expand freedom and secure our elections. This is \nwhat you will find in their S. 1 election takeover bill:\n  It would require States to allow ballot harvesting and no-excuse \nmail-in balloting, which we know from experience will open the door to \nfraud. We know this. So are they intentionally trying to open the door \nto fraud? You are right; people are correct in asking that question.\n  It would also overrule State-level voter ID laws--another great way \nto guarantee rampant fraud. So, yes, you heard me correctly. They want \nthe Federal Government to tell your State that you cannot require \nsomeone to prove his identity, to show an ID in order to--what?--vote \nin an election. How about that?\n  It would weaponize the FEC against minority parties, mandate donor \ndisclosure, and require the Federal Government to match private \ncontributions. You heard me right. They want your tax dollars to fund \npeople who are running for office even if you don't agree with their \nopinions. Your money would be going to them to match the contributions \nthat they are raising. By the way, it is a 6-to-1 match. Pretty \nconvenient, isn't it?\n  I call it insanity, and anyone who has ever staffed a polling place \nor has helped to count ballots knows this. Yet here we are, staring \ndown yet another attempt to put this bill on the fast track--taking \naway the States' authority to run elections in their States.\n  Here is what I say to my Democratic colleagues: You are not going to \nget the benefit of a quiet news cycle on this. America is watching and \nlistening, and they are paying attention.\n  Your attempts to whip the Senate into a state of partisan warfare \nover a bill you don't have the votes to pass will not go unnoticed.\n  Your attempts to make another run at the filibuster and invent a \nmandate the voters refuse to give you will not go unnoticed.\n  Your attempt to sneak through this unconstitutional, partisan power \ngrab is not going to go unnoticed. People are paying attention, and my \nRepublican colleagues and I are going to stand up against it. Members \nof your own caucus have said they will not stand for it.\n  Most importantly, the American people are watching, they are \nlistening, they are paying attention, and they do not stand for what \nyou are seeking to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They know that time is not on their side nor are the American people. There really is something for every faction of the left. Here are a few of the items that are contained in this Biden boondoggle of a budget.\n\tThe environmental lobby did a great job these past few months. They are more than taken care of with more electric car subsidies and a $936 million payout toward environmental justice initiatives.\n\tWe also have more funding to expand the Department of Education. If you think that more government is what your child's educational experience has been missing, well, this is the budget for you. Yet, if you are fed up with the way teachers unions have treated children in the classroom, if you are fed up with schools that have been in lockdown, you will want to pay close attention to what I am talking about today.\n\tApparently, the good people over at the Department of Health and Human Services have time on their hands. Bear in mind, it is your money that is paying them to do the job at which they have time on their hands. Now, they will be switching gears from pandemic response to a new focus on environmental extremism, reparations, and gutting the Second Amendment.\n\tWhat is in this budget? Bigger government, a higher deficit, and runaway inflation.\n\tWhat is out? According to this budget, national defense is no longer a priority for the Biden administration or for the Department of Defense. Border security is also on the back burner along with the family-friendly tax policies we implemented under President Trump.\n\tPresident Biden and the Democrats are doubling down on every mistake they have made so far. Instead of doing their jobs, they are paying lip service to struggling businesses, to struggling stores on Main Street in your hometown, to crumbling bridges--like in Memphis, TN--and roadways, and to future generations of Americans who will come into this world owning their own, personal chunk of our skyrocketing national debt. That is right. If you have a child or a grandchild born this year, their share of the national debt is going to be about $80,000. Think about that.\n\tThink about what has happened to this debt. From President Washington to President George Bush, it was about $10.6 trillion. During the Obama-Biden years, that debt doubled. Then it was added to through the pandemic. Now one would be led to believe that this administration had decided it was going to take the credit cards and swipe them so many times they would run the numbers off of them\n\tYes, this is the Biden surcharge at work--forcing the American people to pay a premium just to live. Cradle to grave, daylight to dark, they have got a list of tax hikes and increased fees for you. You hard-working Americans, you cannot escape it, and what a world they have decided they want to leave for future generations. I think it is awful.\n\tI will tell you what--this budget is such a terrible representation of what America actually needs that, back home in Tennessee, as I was home last week, people would come up to me and ask me if this was really a serious budget. It is so extreme. It is so huge.\n\tThey would say: Surely, your Democratic colleagues are not serious about this. Surely, President Biden is not serious about this budget.\n\tStill, my colleagues across the aisle are so eager to get this done that they are prepared to, once again, throw regular order out the window.\n\tMy Democratic colleagues are living in an alternate reality. It is the only explanation for why they continue to insist that this country will be better off under a government that strips away your freedoms rather than guarantees them and one that tries to tell you how to live your life every minute of every day--from the time your feet hit the floor in the morning until the time you brush your teeth and get in bed at night.\n\n\n                       For the People Act of 2021\n\n\tNo, Madam President, when it comes to the Biden administration, Big Government is its theme not only of the day but of every day. It is the theme when it comes to spending, to regulations, and even to intrusions into constitutionally mandated State authority.\n\tBefore the State work period, the majority leader indicated that he intended to use this month to shove through yet another wish list item. My Democratic colleagues have tried several times to skip debate and sneak through various provisions of their S. 1 election takeover bill. They tried to do this for the same reason President Biden released his disastrous budget on a Friday after everyone had already left town. It is because the bill could not survive a fair news cycle once the American people knew what was in it.\n\tTo my Democratic colleagues, remember the American people know-- after we went through ObamaCare and the Affordable Care Act--that the current Speaker of the House had then said: Well, we have to pass this bill so we can read it and find out what is in it.\n\tThey know that this is the way you like to operate.\n\tI am sure many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would dispute my characterization of the bill. So, for the benefit of the record, let's go through a few of the provisions they are absolutely convinced will somehow expand freedom and secure our elections. This is what you will find in their S. 1 election takeover bill:\n\tIt would require States to allow ballot harvesting and no-excuse mail-in balloting, which we know from experience will open the door to fraud. We know this. So are they intentionally trying to open the door to fraud? You are right; people are correct in asking that question.\n\tIt would also overrule State-level voter ID laws--another great way to guarantee rampant fraud. So, yes, you heard me correctly. They want the Federal Government to tell your State that you cannot require someone to prove his identity, to show an ID in order to--what?--vote in an election. How about that?\n\tIt would weaponize the FEC against minority parties, mandate donor disclosure, and require the Federal Government to match private contributions. You heard me right. They want your tax dollars to fund people who are running for office even if you don't agree with their opinions. Your money would be going to them to match the contributions that they are raising. By the way, it is a 6-to-1 match. Pretty convenient, isn't it?\n\tI call it insanity, and anyone who has ever staffed a polling place or has helped to count ballots knows this. Yet here we are, staring down yet another attempt to put this bill on the fast track--taking away the States' authority to run elections in their States.\n\tHere is what I say to my Democratic colleagues: You are not going to get the benefit of a quiet news cycle on this. America is watching and listening, and they are paying attention.\n\tYour attempts to whip the Senate into a state of partisan warfare over a bill you don't have the votes to pass will not go unnoticed.\n\tYour attempts to make another run at the filibuster and invent a mandate the voters refuse to give you will not go unnoticed.\n\tYour attempt to sneak through this unconstitutional, partisan power grab is not going to go unnoticed. People are paying attention, and my Republican colleagues and I are going to stand up against it. Members of your own caucus have said they will not stand for it.\n\tMost importantly, the American people are watching, they are listening, they are paying attention, and they do not stand for what you are seeking to do.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today with a lot of joy. I get a \nchance to speak about someone I have known for decades. I am rising to \nspeak about Julien Neals and my hope that he gets to serve on the U.S. \nDistrict Court of the great State of New Jersey.\n  I have spoken to many of my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee about Julien Neals. He is someone I have not just known for a \nlong time, but even though he is not quite my height, I look up to him. \nWe worked together when I was mayor of the city of Newark. So today \nwhat I really want to speak about is not simply his impressive career, \nhis distinguished resume, but I really want to talk a bit about who he \nis.\n  I am not sure how many of my colleagues know this about the city of \nNewark, NJ, but when I became mayor in 2006, we inherited a lot of very \ncomplex, very serious challenges, and for the sake of our residents, we \nneeded to make change quickly and very urgently. So I brought in this \nguy named Julien Neals, whom I didn't quite know that well, but he was \nso well highly recommended.\n  He moved from the private sector, where he was with a very \nprestigious New Jersey law firm, and decided to lead the transformation \nin New Jersey's largest municipal court. He knew that it was a court \nsystem that had to change, and he stepped up. He changed it. He changed \nthe way our court operated. He centered it in common community values \nand made sure that everyone who came before that court was treated in a \nway that affirmed their dignity, no matter what the matter was.\n  He pioneered innovations that the whole State--in fact, many places \nin our Nation--took notice of. He created the first community court in \nthe State of New Jersey, the first youth court, and the first veterans \ncourt. He realized that citizens all have, often, different needs, \nespecially folks like our young people and our veterans, and that there \nis a different way to achieve a larger standard and a larger ideal of \njustice.\n  Well, the problem is, when you do so well in one job, you get pushed \nto another opportunity. I quickly moved him from being my chief judge \nof New Jersey's largest municipal court to come in and be my \ncorporation counsel in my mayoral administration.\n  In the wake of the recession in 2008, he became the business manager, \nthe person who runs the city day to day, and under the most difficult, \nsavage of circumstances, he made challenging changes that helped us get \nthrough that very difficult period.\n  Cities all over New Jersey were being crushed financially, making \nmassive amounts of layoffs, and in those financial times, he was able \nto get our city to be dramatically more efficient, to bring in new \nideas that helped us to create everything from environmental \nsustainability to expanding access to municipal services to the public. \nHe brought in innovations that became really par for the course all \nover New Jersey, but Newark did them first.\n  Today, now, Julien serves as the counsel for the largest county in \nNew Jersey--a county that is bigger than some of our States.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Julien, as I have said, now for \nthe past couple decades, and I have watched him handle challenge after \nchallenge, from a global recession to Hurricane Sandy. He has stood in \nthe saddle and helped with calmness, with coolness, with an equipoise \nthat is enviable to all, including me. I have watched him lead. I have \nwatched him care. I have watched his love of others be reflected in the \ndecisions he made under the most difficult of circumstances. I have \nseen him in crisis after crisis rise not just to meet the challenge but \nto, in most circumstances, have us come out better off than we were \nbefore.\n  He, in so many ways, is one of the great leaders I have had the \nprivilege of working with in my life. Julien Neals is brilliant. He is \nthoughtful. He is deliberate in his decision making. He has all of the \nideals that I think we want in a Federal judge.\n  I have to tell you, most importantly to me, I know him. I know his \nparents. I know his family. I know his kids. He is one of those people \nwho would make you proud not just in knowing but in ascending to a \nposition like a judge. I know he will make us proud in the way that he \nleads from the bench.\n  I want to thank President Biden for nominating him. I want to \nencourage all of my colleagues in a bipartisan way, as I said in the \nJudiciary Committee, to consider supporting him.\n  I have had many privileges as a U.S. Senator. God, this is one of \nthose jobs where you have to, like, give glory to God every day for \njust having the privilege of standing on this floor and getting to be a \npart of some things that, as much as we rancor back and forth, we \nshould all be proud of, whether it is a global pandemic or just making \nsure we are funding critical parts of the government where public \nservants serve. But of all the privileges I have, I have to say this is \none of the great ones, the chance to make a man whom I look up to in \nevery way--make him a Federal judge, to try to encourage my colleagues \nto make him a Federal judge.\n  I see that my senior Senator, my friend--another guy I look up to \neven though I got him by an inch or two--has come to the floor, and if \nthe Presiding Officer would allow me, I would like to yield to the \nsenior Senator of the State of New Jersey--more handsome than I am, but \nI think we are an equal tag team when it comes to serving our State\n  I yield the floor with the fear that he does have the microphone \nlast.\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, it is a fear that one should have as \nto who gets the microphone last, but nonetheless, no need to fear. I \nthink that statement about better looking is a Pinocchio on your part, \nin any event. But I will stop before I get called out of order.\n  Madam President, it is with great urgency that I come to the floor to \nurge support for the confirmation of Julien Xavier Neals to be a U.S. \ndistrict court judge in New Jersey. My distinguished colleague, who \nknows Mr. Neals extraordinarily well, can speak to all the elements of \nhim as a human being, as a lawyer, and as someone who was a judge at \none level and, in fact, can be and will be an extraordinary district \ncourt judge.\n  We are known in New Jersey as having one of the busiest courts in the \nentire country. As of last year, more than 46,000 cases were pending \nbefore it, many of them among the most complex and challenging cases in \nthe Nation. Yet multiple judicial vacancies on the court have led the \nJudicial Conference of the United States to declare a judicial \nemergency. The court is short-staffed by a third, leaving each of our \nseated judges with a mind-boggling caseload of 2,700 pending cases. \nThat is a caseload more than three times higher than the national \naverage.\n  Fortunately, this week, the Senate has an opportunity to begin \nalleviating this judicial emergency by confirming Julien Neals to the \nU.S. District Court in New Jersey. Mr. Neals is an outstanding nominee \nwho has devoted his entire career to the practice of law in my home \nState of New Jersey. Throughout his three decades in the legal \nprofession, he has served in many diverse roles. Every step of the way, \nhe has impressed those around him with his integrity, sound judgment, \nand commitment to equal justice and fair administration of the law.\n  He clerked on the Superior Court of New Jersey, practiced civil \nrights, employment discrimination, and intellectual property law as an \nassociate and partner of a Secaucus-based firm. He served the city of \nNewark during my distinguished colleague Senator Booker's time as the \nmayor of that great city of Newark and since 2015 has worked as counsel \nfor Bergen County, the most populous county in all of New Jersey.\n  As you heard, my colleague still speaks glowingly of Mr. Neals' \nachievements during his time as chief judge of the Newark Municipal \nCourt, how he improved the efficiency and the culture of the \ninstitution, created the first community court in the State of New \nJersey, and in less than 2 years presided over more than 6,000 cases, \nwhile supervising 11 full-time judges.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Neals will be an asset to the \nU.S. District Court in New Jersey as it emerges from this pandemic and \nworks to reduce its backlog of pending cases. He is qualified, and he \nwas qualified to serve on the Federal bench back in 2015 when President \nObama first nominated him to the U.S. District Court in New Jersey. \nUnfortunately, the politics of the time didn't get him a vote, and he \nis even more qualified today.\n  Mr. Neals already commands enormous respect in our legal community. \nFrom serving on the Supreme Court of New Jersey's Committee on \nCharacter and Fitness to serving as chairman for the Volunteer Lawyers \nfor Justice, he personifies the meaning of public service. His \ntremendous breadth of experience, even temperament, and sound judgment \nmake him a superb candidate to serve on the Federal bench. Clearly our \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee here in the Senate came to the \nsame conclusion when they reported him out of committee by a large \nbipartisan margin.\n  New Jerseyans have waited too long for the Senate to fill this \nvacancy, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to confirm \nMr. Julien Neals without further delay. I am thrilled to join my \ncolleague from New Jersey in advocating for him and especially thankful \nto the junior Senator from New Jersey for advancing his name so that \njustice can be realized in the State of New Jersey.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, is there a pending vote now on the \ncloture vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in a quorum call.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The vote is to occur in 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I appreciate the 180 seconds, and I will \nbe patient and wait.\n  I am sorry. There is a quorum call, correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  The senior Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to waive all \nexisting time and move towards the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BOOKER.

Mr. President, I rise to ask that the Senate be \ngiven the chance to consider and vote on the Military Justice \nImprovement and Increasing Prevention Act.\n  Before I discuss the bill, I would like to first acknowledge that we \nhave just returned from Memorial Day recess and to recognize the men \nand women who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our country and to \nprotect our freedom. They got on a plane or they got on a ship; they \nwent to countries they may never have been to before; they fought for \nour country; and they didn't come home.\n  We ask so much of our servicemembers and their families, and we owe \nit to them to take action when they are in danger. That is why I want \nto talk about this bill right now.\n  Sexual assault in the military is an epidemic. Year after year, \nreports of sexual assault have gone up, but conviction rates and \nprosecution rates have actually come down. This stems from a \nfundamental problem which has to be addressed: There is bias in our \nmilitary justice system.\n  Right now, if you are a victim of sexual assault or another serious \ncrime, the decision to prosecute goes to a commander, not to a trained \nmilitary prosecutor. And while our commanders are exceptional leaders \nand exceptional warfighters, they are not legal experts, nor should \nthey be asked to be. Nor can commanders be truly independent when \nconsidering charges against a subordinate or charges made by a \nsubordinate.\n  This bill removes the decision of whether to prosecute sexual \nassaults or any other serious crime out of the chain of command and \ngives it to trained military prosecutors, where it belongs. This would \nestablish something fundamental to our justice system: blind justice. \nIt is a simple change. It is a change that is supported by legal \nexperts, by JAGs, by commanders, by generals, by admirals, by veterans.\n  Opponents of this bill--and their numbers are dwindling--claim that \nthis one change would somehow undermine good order and discipline. \nWell, I will tell you, I have heard that one before. It is the same \nweak argument they have made time and time again.\n  Many people stood on this floor and said that we could not repeal \ndon't ask, don't tell because it undermined good order and discipline. \nWhen we wanted to integrate the military and have Black servicemembers \nserve, we were told we couldn't possibly do that; it would undermine \ngood order and discipline. We made the case that LGBTQ members should \nbe able to serve openly, that trans members should be able to serve \nopenly. We were told: You can't possibly do that; it would undermine \ngood order and discipline. When we asked for women to be able to serve \nin combat, something they had been doing for a very long time but not \nnecessarily getting credit for it, we were told: You can't possibly do \nthat; it will undermine good order and discipline.\n  But each of those times Congress rose to the occasion and did the \nright thing and did the thing that was necessary to make our military \nstronger, and each time our military became stronger.\n  Further undermining this argument is the fact that this system, or \nversions very similar to it, are being used today by our allies that we \nfight side by side, allies like the UK or Israel or Germany or \nNetherlands or Australia or Canada. They did not see a degradation of \ngood order and discipline. They told us so.\n  Finally, in addition to the opposition to this bill being a weak \nargument, the support for this bill is strong, and that support \ncontinues to grow. How many bills have you heard of in this Congress, \nor the last, or the last, or the last that have 66 cosponsors? Widely \nbipartisan. How many bills have Liz Warren and Ted Cruz on them or \nMitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer in support of? It doesn't happen very \noften.\n  But this is something that I and many Senators in this Chamber have \nbeen working on for 8 years, holding hearings on for 8 years, making \namendments in the NDAA for 8 years, making the case that this change is \nneeded for 8 years. And through all that work and through all that \nadvocacy, we now have 66 cosponsors--a majority of the Senate, a \nmajority of the Armed Services Committee. This bill deserves a vote. \nThis bill deserves to have the Senate vote on it now. It is time to \npass this law, and it is time to do our jobs.\n\n  Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent \nthat, at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation \nwith the Republican leader, the Senate Armed Services Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 1520 and the Senate proceed \nto its consideration; that there be 2 hours for debate, equally \ndivided, in the usual form and that upon the use or yielding back of \nthat time, the Senate vote on the bill with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of all, \nlet me commend Senator Gillibrand. No one has been as relentless in \nterms of trying to improve the Uniform Code of Military Justice, \nparticularly with respect to sexual assault. And I agree: These crimes \ninvolving sexual assault can be properly moved out, done so in a way \nthat does not impede good order and discipline in the U.S. military.\n  The issue that is emerging is an issue of the scope. The Senator's \nbill includes felonies like burglary and larceny that do not involve \nsexual assault. The Senator has pointed out, and I think correctly, \nthat Congress has risen to the occasion. In fact, I was with people who \nwanted to repeal ``don't ask, don't tell.'' I was fighting for those \nthings, along with other provisions that she cited.\n  But Congress has done the right thing only after careful \nconsideration, and we have that opportunity in the committee. That is \nthe way we have done every piece of major legislation since I have been \nhere over a couple decades. There will be an opportunity to vote on all \nthese issues in the committee with men and women who have great insight \nand knowledge--combat veterans, others who have served for a very long \ntime. And they have invested, as I know the Senator has invested, time \nand effort and can perhaps improve the bill and perhaps point out areas \nof the bill that have not been thoroughly analyzed.\n  So I think it is incumbent upon us to move forward to consider this \nbill in committee and then to bring it to the floor of the Senate. \nThere will be opportunities for amendments, and at the end of the day, \nwe will have, I think, one, a better bill, perhaps. But, two, we will \nhave a bill that people can embrace because it has been thoroughly \nvetted by the committee of jurisdiction.\n  So for those reasons, I would object to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, while the chairman does agree that \nthe serious crime of sexual assault should be taken out of the chain of \ncommand, our bill requests and requires that all serious crimes be \ntaken out of the chain of command because of the existence of bias. And \nwe have two data points that prove that bias. One is the poor results \nwe have seen for survivors of sexual assaults over the last 10 years \nthat data has been collected, and the second data point we have, which \nhas been developed over the last 3 years, is the existence of racial \nbias.\n  Protect Our Defenders did a serious report in 2017, and it determined \nthat across all services, looking at all punishments, Black and Brown \nservicemembers were punished approximately two times more often than \nWhite servicemembers, looking at both nonjudicial and court-martials. \nAnd that show of bias means that the military justice system isn't \nworking for many people. It is not working for plaintiffs, and it is \nnot working for defendants.\n  And, in fact, when our allies looked at this same issue, particularly \ndefendants' rights over the last 40 years, they determined that bias in \nthe system was incompatible with their views of justice, and they \ndecided that for defendants' rights, specifically, all serious crimes \nshould be decided by trained military prosecutors.\n  So this solution is one we have been debating in the committee for 8 \nyears, and, in fact, we have used compromises\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nand smaller steps and small-ball measures over the last 8 years to \naddress this problem. Unfortunately, despite putting in place \napproximately 250 new measures over the last 8 years, the rate of \nconviction and the rate of prosecution is still going down, but the \nrate of sexual assault has stayed persistent at approximately 20,000 \nincidents a year.\n  So while I appreciate that my colleague is coming to the conclusion \nthat one serious crime should be taken out of the chain of command, \nmilitary experts disagree that a line should be drawn around only one \ncrime because they believe that that will result in unfair systems of \njustice--two systems of justice and one that does not meet the needs of \nbias that we see in the current system.\n  Second, we have many combat veterans on this legislation. Joni Ernst \nis one of our lead sponsors, who is the only female Republican combat \nveteran and who has also experienced sexual assault. Mark Kelly is on \nour bill. Tammy Duckworth is on our bill. Gary Peters is on our bill. \nJosh Hawley is on our bill. And we also have many of our attorneys \ngeneral on this bill, people who have looked at the law from a \nperspective of civil rights and civil liberties, such as Richard \nBlumenthal.\n  This matters, and I believe that we have given the committee 8 years \nto solve this problem.\n  Third, when we have given the opportunity to the committee to solve \nthis problem and pass meaningful--meaningful--reforms, if the DOD \ndisagreed with those reforms, despite passing in the House and in the \nSenate, they have seen fit to make sure those reforms have been taken \nout in conference. One such example was legislation we passed in 2019 \ncreating a ``safe to report'' provision, which would have allowed \nsurvivors of sexual assault to come forward to report the crime but not \nbe prosecuted for related smaller crimes, such as drinking or being off \nbase.\n  That language passed the Senate. It passed the House. And, \nmiraculously, because the DOD didn't approve, it was taken out in \nconference. In 2020, the Senators who worked on that provision, Senator \nErnst and I, made very clear that we did not appreciate staff members \ntaking out work and provisions that had been considered and voted on by \nSenators as part of their responsibility. And we were able to pass it \nthe second time.\n  So, unfortunately, Mr. President, I don't have faith that if we allow \nthe committee to look at this bill and pass it in the Senate and the \nHouse, that it will not be watered down or taken out in conference \nwithout the consent of all the Senators who voted for it.\n  Therefore, I urge this body to allow for an up-or-down vote on this \nSenate floor. That is a privilege that was given ``don't ask, don't \ntell'' repeal because of similar filibusters by members of the Armed \nServices Committee. When we voted on ``don't ask, don't tell,'' it was \nan up-or-down Senate vote. This deserves the same opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Smith). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       77th Anniversary of D-day\n\n  Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I am here on the floor of the Senate \nthis evening to commemorate the 77th anniversary of D-day. This was a \nhuge turning point in World War II, of course. The invasion of Normandy \noccurred 77 years ago yesterday.\n  Historian Douglas Brinkley wrote that D-day was the single most \nimportant moment in the 20th century and one of the most tragic, too, \nin terms of loss of life. I think he was right. There were 160,000 \nsoldiers who crossed the Channel that day to begin the campaign to \nrecapture Europe from Hitler's rule. On their backs were rucksacks with \n80 pounds of gear, but so too was the fate of all of us--our allies in \nEurope and, really, the fate of the free world.\n  Many of our best and brightest young Americans did fall that day. We \nlost more than 10,000 men in 1 day. The Nazis had spent 2 years \nfortifying the coast to prepare for this moment. It was Hitler's so-\ncalled Atlantic Wall. The beautiful coastline of Northern France was \ncovered in barbed wire, land mines, and bunkers, but at the end of the \nlargest amphibious invasion in history, we stood victorious, battered \nbut not broken. On we marched through France, through Belgium, and, \nfinally, into Germany itself.\n  But even today, amid the flowers and fields of Normandy--I have been \nthere, and many of you have been there who are listening tonight--you \ncan feel, even today, the lingering presence of those who died that day \nin the service of liberating Europe, and you can see it in the stark, \norderly U.S. military cemeteries, where row after row of white crosses \nand Stars of David commemorate those brave souls who were lost--\nrepresenting lives lost in a noble cause. Though much has happened in \nthe following 77 years, we can never lose sight of the valor and the \nsacrifice by our Armed Forces on that 1 day.\n  On Memorial Day, about a week ago, I spoke at the National Veterans \nMemorial and Museum in Columbus, OH. It was a hopeful day for me not \njust to have so many people together as we emerged from COVID-19--\nreally the first big public event they have had--but also to see the \ngenerations of veterans and family members there to honor the fallen: \nWorld War II veterans, Gulf war veterans, Korean war veterans, Vietnam \nveterans, and veterans, of course, from Afghanistan and Iraq. They \nrepresented the living embodiment of the stories we ought to be \nremembering from a war that recedes further into the past with every \npassing year.\n  They are the stories of valor like that displayed by Jim ``Pee Wee'' \nMartin from Dayton, OH. On that day, he and the rest of the 506th \nParachute Infantry Regiment parachuted behind German lines in the dark \nof pre-dawn. Jim was wounded but fought bravely, earning both the \nPurple Heart and the Bronze Star for his efforts.\n  They are the stories of sacrifice like that of the Napier brothers of \nWarren County in southwest Ohio, the county my mom is from. All five of \nthe brothers served in the war, and two of the five brothers landed at \nD-day. One died there on the beaches, never to return to his Ohio home.\n  These are stories to be preserved for generations to come. The memory \nof D-day and, indeed, of all of World War II must never be lost.\n  Since I have been here in the U.S. Senate, I have often come to the \nfloor on D-day to recite the special prayer that was given that day by \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt. It was expected, of course, that FDR would \ngive a speech when the invasion took place--one of his fireside chats \nfrom the White House--but for some reason, FDR was moved to prayer. The \nfamous prayer that he gave that day has become known as the D-day \nPrayer. It is a powerful statement, my favorite Presidential statement \nand one that deserves to be remembered for generations to come.\n  In 2013, I introduced legislation, called the World War II Memorial \nPrayer Act, which directs the Secretary of the Interior to install a \nplaque to be placed at the World War II Memorial, on the National Mall, \nwith the words of the D-day Prayer. It is a beautiful memorial, but, \nfrankly, some more interpretation wouldn't be a bad thing, and having \nthat prayer there, as you will see in a moment when we recite it, would \nbe an appropriate way to pay tribute to those who lost their lives that \nday.\n  It was the Ohio Christian Alliance President, Chris Long, who first \ncame to me with the idea of a plaque to display this historic prayer. \nThat legislation was actually signed into law with the help of Senator \nJoe Lieberman. On a bipartisan basis, we got it passed in 2014.\n  The friends of the National World War II Memorial and the National \nPark Service, since that time, have worked with us to develop and \nrefine the final permanent plaque design. Most recently, they received \ndesign approvals from the Commission of Fine Arts and the \nNational Capital Planning Commission.\n\n  It takes a while to get things done on the National Mall, I found. \nThere is quite a process. It has now been 7 years, longer than World \nWar II itself. Despite the hurdles, we have yet to see the final plaque \ninstalled, but it will be done, by the way, not at any cost to\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nthe taxpayers, meaning private fundraising, not taxpayer dollars, will \nbe used. We had hoped to have the final plaque in place for the 75th \nanniversary. In the meantime, in 2019, we were able to have a temporary \nplaque in place with the words of the prayer at the permanent location \nfor the permanent plaque, which is at the Circle of Remembrance, next \nto the World War II Memorial.\n  If you are on The Mall and you are coming from the Capitol, it will \nbe on your right. It is north of the World War II Memorial but right \nnext to it. In this very beautiful place, the Circle of Remembrance--a \ngood place to sit and reflect--you will see, right now, the plaque is \nthere, and you can read the prayer. The permanent plaque will be even \nbigger and will allow even more people to have access to it. I \nencourage people to go see that plaque. By the way, I think it is the \nonly prayer on display on our National Mall.\n  The temporary plaque, by the way, was generously donated by the \nFriends of the National World War II Memorial. We are very hopeful that \nthe permanent plaque will be placed at the circle next year. I want to \nthank the Lilly Endowment for its generous support of this project, by \nthe way. Last October, it provided a $2 million grant for the \nconstruction and installation of the permanent plaque. This committed \nfinancial support will be critical to finally bringing the project \nacross the line.\n  The fact that a prayer was offered that day by our Commander in Chief \nis historic in and of itself, but it is the content of the prayer that \nmakes it so worthy of remembrance. I would now like to read this World \nWar II D-day Prayer, if I may.\n\n       My fellow Americans [FDR began]: Last night, when I spoke \n     with you about the fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that \n     troops of the United States and our allies were crossing the \n     Channel in another and greater operation. It has come to pass \n     with success thus far.\n       And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in \n     prayer:\n       Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have \n     set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our \n     Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free \n     a suffering humanity.\n       Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms, \n     stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.\n       They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and \n     hard, for the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. \n     Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return \n     again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the \n     righteousness of our cause, our sons will [prevail].\n       They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without \n     rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by \n     noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the \n     violences of war.\n       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice \n     arise, and tolerance and good will among all Thy people. They \n     yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the \n     haven of home.\n       Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive \n     them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.\n       And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives, \n     sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas--whose thoughts \n     and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to \n     rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of \n     great sacrifice.\n       Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single \n     day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the \n     desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a \n     continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again \n     when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, \n     invoking Thy help to our efforts.\n       Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to \n     redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the \n     material support of our armed forces.\n       And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, \n     to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our \n     sons wheresoever they may be.\n       And, O Lord, give us Faith. Give us Faith in Thee; Faith in \n     our sons; Faith in each other; Faith in our united crusade. \n     Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not \n     the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but \n     fleeting moment let not these deter us in our unconquerable \n     purpose.\n       With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces \n     of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and \n     racial arrogancies. Lead us to the saving of our country, and \n     with our sister Nations into a world unity that will spell a \n     sure peace a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy \n     men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, \n     reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.\n       Thy will be done, Almighty God.\n       Amen.\n\n  A powerful prayer. I love the part about they come not to conquer; \nthey come to liberate. The same can be said for our Armed Forces \nthroughout the ages.\n  I look forward to seeing these words of prayer permanently displayed \non the National Mall to help us memorialize such a noble day we must \nnever forget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to ask that the Senate be given the chance to consider and vote on the Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention Act.\n\tBefore I discuss the bill, I would like to first acknowledge that we have just returned from Memorial Day recess and to recognize the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our country and to protect our freedom. They got on a plane or they got on a ship; they went to countries they may never have been to before; they fought for our country; and they didn't come home.\n\tWe ask so much of our servicemembers and their families, and we owe it to them to take action when they are in danger. That is why I want to talk about this bill right now.\n\tSexual assault in the military is an epidemic. Year after year, reports of sexual assault have gone up, but conviction rates and prosecution rates have actually come down. This stems from a fundamental problem which has to be addressed: There is bias in our military justice system.\n\tRight now, if you are a victim of sexual assault or another serious crime, the decision to prosecute goes to a commander, not to a trained military prosecutor. And while our commanders are exceptional leaders and exceptional warfighters, they are not legal experts, nor should they be asked to be. Nor can commanders be truly independent when considering charges against a subordinate or charges made by a subordinate.\n\tThis bill removes the decision of whether to prosecute sexual assaults or any other serious crime out of the chain of command and gives it to trained military prosecutors, where it belongs. This would establish something fundamental to our justice system: blind justice. It is a simple change. It is a change that is supported by legal experts, by JAGs, by commanders, by generals, by admirals, by veterans.\n\tOpponents of this bill--and their numbers are dwindling--claim that this one change would somehow undermine good order and discipline. Well, I will tell you, I have heard that one before. It is the same weak argument they have made time and time again.\n\tMany people stood on this floor and said that we could not repeal don't ask, don't tell because it undermined good order and discipline. When we wanted to integrate the military and have Black servicemembers serve, we were told we couldn't possibly do that; it would undermine good order and discipline. We made the case that LGBTQ members should be able to serve openly, that trans members should be able to serve openly. We were told: You can't possibly do that; it would undermine good order and discipline. When we asked for women to be able to serve in combat, something they had been doing for a very long time but not necessarily getting credit for it, we were told: You can't possibly do that; it will undermine good order and discipline.\n\tBut each of those times Congress rose to the occasion and did the right thing and did the thing that was necessary to make our military stronger, and each time our military became stronger.\n\tFurther undermining this argument is the fact that this system, or versions very similar to it, are being used today by our allies that we fight side by side, allies like the UK or Israel or Germany or Netherlands or Australia or Canada. They did not see a degradation of good order and discipline. They told us so.\n\tFinally, in addition to the opposition to this bill being a weak argument, the support for this bill is strong, and that support continues to grow. How many bills have you heard of in this Congress, or the last, or the last, or the last that have 66 cosponsors? Widely bipartisan. How many bills have Liz Warren and Ted Cruz on them or Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer in support of? It doesn't happen very often.\n\tBut this is something that I and many Senators in this Chamber have been working on for 8 years, holding hearings on for 8 years, making amendments in the NDAA for 8 years, making the case that this change is needed for 8 years. And through all that work and through all that advocacy, we now have 66 cosponsors--a majority of the Senate, a majority of the Armed Services Committee. This bill deserves a vote. This bill deserves to have the Senate vote on it now. It is time to pass this law, and it is time to do our jobs.\n\n\tMr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that, at a time to be determined by the majority leader in consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate Armed Services Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1520 and the Senate proceed to its consideration; that there be 2 hours for debate, equally divided, in the usual form and that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on the bill with no intervening action or debate.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\tThe Senator from Rhode Island.\n\tMr. REED. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first of all, let me commend Senator Gillibrand. No one has been as relentless in terms of trying to improve the Uniform Code of Military Justice, particularly with respect to sexual assault. And I agree: These crimes involving sexual assault can be properly moved out, done so in a way that does not impede good order and discipline in the U.S. military.\n\tThe issue that is emerging is an issue of the scope. The Senator's bill includes felonies like burglary and larceny that do not involve sexual assault. The Senator has pointed out, and I think correctly, that Congress has risen to the occasion. In fact, I was with people who wanted to repeal ``don't ask, don't tell.'' I was fighting for those things, along with other provisions that she cited.\n\tBut Congress has done the right thing only after careful consideration, and we have that opportunity in the committee. That is the way we have done every piece of major legislation since I have been here over a couple decades. There will be an opportunity to vote on all these issues in the committee with men and women who have great insight and knowledge--combat veterans, others who have served for a very long time. And they have invested, as I know the Senator has invested, time and effort and can perhaps improve the bill and perhaps point out areas of the bill that have not been thoroughly analyzed.\n\tSo I think it is incumbent upon us to move forward to consider this bill in committee and then to bring it to the floor of the Senate. There will be opportunities for amendments, and at the end of the day, we will have, I think, one, a better bill, perhaps. But, two, we will have a bill that people can embrace because it has been thoroughly vetted by the committee of jurisdiction.\n\tSo for those reasons, I would object to the unanimous consent request.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\tThe Senator from New York.\n\tMrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, while the chairman does agree that the serious crime of sexual assault should be taken out of the chain of command, our bill requests and requires that all serious crimes be taken out of the chain of command because of the existence of bias. And we have two data points that prove that bias. One is the poor results we have seen for survivors of sexual assaults over the last 10 years that data has been collected, and the second data point we have, which has been developed over the last 3 years, is the existence of racial bias.\n\tProtect Our Defenders did a serious report in 2017, and it determined that across all services, looking at all punishments, Black and Brown servicemembers were punished approximately two times more often than White servicemembers, looking at both nonjudicial and court-martials. And that show of bias means that the military justice system isn't working for many people. It is not working for plaintiffs, and it is not working for defendants.\n\tAnd, in fact, when our allies looked at this same issue, particularly defendants' rights over the last 40 years, they determined that bias in the system was incompatible with their views of justice, and they decided that for defendants' rights, specifically, all serious crimes should be decided by trained military prosecutors.\n\tSo this solution is one we have been debating in the committee for 8 years, and, in fact, we have used compromises and smaller steps and small-ball measures over the last 8 years to address this problem. Unfortunately, despite putting in place approximately 250 new measures over the last 8 years, the rate of conviction and the rate of prosecution is still going down, but the rate of sexual assault has stayed persistent at approximately 20,000 incidents a year.\n\tSo while I appreciate that my colleague is coming to the conclusion that one serious crime should be taken out of the chain of command, military experts disagree that a line should be drawn around only one crime because they believe that that will result in unfair systems of justice--two systems of justice and one that does not meet the needs of bias that we see in the current system.\n\tSecond, we have many combat veterans on this legislation. Joni Ernst is one of our lead sponsors, who is the only female Republican combat veteran and who has also experienced sexual assault. Mark Kelly is on our bill. Tammy Duckworth is on our bill. Gary Peters is on our bill. Josh Hawley is on our bill. And we also have many of our attorneys general on this bill, people who have looked at the law from a perspective of civil rights and civil liberties, such as Richard Blumenthal.\n\tThis matters, and I believe that we have given the committee 8 years to solve this problem.\n\tThird, when we have given the opportunity to the committee to solve this problem and pass meaningful--meaningful--reforms, if the DOD disagreed with those reforms, despite passing in the House and in the Senate, they have seen fit to make sure those reforms have been taken out in conference. One such example was legislation we passed in 2019 creating a ``safe to report'' provision, which would have allowed survivors of sexual assault to come forward to report the crime but not be prosecuted for related smaller crimes, such as drinking or being off base.\n\tThat language passed the Senate. It passed the House. And, miraculously, because the DOD didn't approve, it was taken out in conference. In 2020, the Senators who worked on that provision, Senator Ernst and I, made very clear that we did not appreciate staff members taking out work and provisions that had been considered and voted on by Senators as part of their responsibility. And we were able to pass it the second time.\n\tSo, unfortunately, Mr. President, I don't have faith that if we allow the committee to look at this bill and pass it in the Senate and the House, that it will not be watered down or taken out in conference without the consent of all the Senators who voted for it.\n\tTherefore, I urge this body to allow for an up-or-down vote on this Senate floor. That is a privilege that was given ``don't ask, don't tell'' repeal because of similar filibusters by members of the Armed Services Committee. When we voted on ``don't ask, don't tell,'' it was an up-or-down Senate vote. This deserves the same opportunity.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\tThe legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\tMr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Smith). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       77th Anniversary of D-day\n\n\tMr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I am here on the floor of the Senate this evening to commemorate the 77th anniversary of D-day. This was a huge turning point in World War II, of course. The invasion of Normandy occurred 77 years ago yesterday.\n\tHistorian Douglas Brinkley wrote that D-day was the single most important moment in the 20th century and one of the most tragic, too, in terms of loss of life. I think he was right. There were 160,000 soldiers who crossed the Channel that day to begin the campaign to recapture Europe from Hitler's rule. On their backs were rucksacks with 80 pounds of gear, but so too was the fate of all of us--our allies in Europe and, really, the fate of the free world.\n\tMany of our best and brightest young Americans did fall that day. We lost more than 10,000 men in 1 day. The Nazis had spent 2 years fortifying the coast to prepare for this moment. It was Hitler's so-called Atlantic Wall. The beautiful coastline of Northern France was covered in barbed wire, land mines, and bunkers, but at the end of the largest amphibious invasion in history, we stood victorious, battered but not broken. On we marched through France, through Belgium, and, finally, into Germany itself.\n\tBut even today, amid the flowers and fields of Normandy--I have been there, and many of you have been there who are listening tonight--you can feel, even today, the lingering presence of those who died that day in the service of liberating Europe, and you can see it in the stark, orderly U.S. military cemeteries, where row after row of white crosses and Stars of David commemorate those brave souls who were lost--representing lives lost in a noble cause. Though much has happened in the following 77 years, we can never lose sight of the valor and the sacrifice by our Armed Forces on that 1 day.\n\tOn Memorial Day, about a week ago, I spoke at the National Veterans Memorial and Museum in Columbus, OH. It was a hopeful day for me not just to have so many people together as we emerged from COVID-19--really the first big public event they have had--but also to see the generations of veterans and family members there to honor the fallen: World War II veterans, Gulf war veterans, Korean war veterans, Vietnam veterans, and veterans, of course, from Afghanistan and Iraq. They represented the living embodiment of the stories we ought to be remembering from a war that recedes further into the past with every passing year.\n\tThey are the stories of valor like that displayed by Jim ``Pee Wee'' Martin from Dayton, OH. On that day, he and the rest of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment parachuted behind German lines in the dark of pre-dawn. Jim was wounded but fought bravely, earning both the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for his efforts.\n\tThey are the stories of sacrifice like that of the Napier brothers of Warren County in southwest Ohio, the county my mom is from. All five of the brothers served in the war, and two of the five brothers landed at D-day. One died there on the beaches, never to return to his Ohio home.\n\tThese are stories to be preserved for generations to come. The memory of D-day and, indeed, of all of World War II must never be lost.\n\tSince I have been here in the U.S. Senate, I have often come to the floor on D-day to recite the special prayer that was given that day by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It was expected, of course, that FDR would give a speech when the invasion took place--one of his fireside chats from the White House--but for some reason, FDR was moved to prayer. The famous prayer that he gave that day has become known as the D-day Prayer. It is a powerful statement, my favorite Presidential statement and one that deserves to be remembered for generations to come.\n\tIn 2013, I introduced legislation, called the World War II Memorial Prayer Act, which directs the Secretary of the Interior to install a plaque to be placed at the World War II Memorial, on the National Mall, with the words of the D-day Prayer. It is a beautiful memorial, but, frankly, some more interpretation wouldn't be a bad thing, and having that prayer there, as you will see in a moment when we recite it, would be an appropriate way to pay tribute to those who lost their lives that day.\n\tIt was the Ohio Christian Alliance President, Chris Long, who first came to me with the idea of a plaque to display this historic prayer. That legislation was actually signed into law with the help of Senator Joe Lieberman. On a bipartisan basis, we got it passed in 2014.\n\tThe friends of the National World War II Memorial and the National Park Service, since that time, have worked with us to develop and refine the final permanent plaque design. Most recently, they received design approvals from the Commission of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission.\n\n\tIt takes a while to get things done on the National Mall, I found. There is quite a process. It has now been 7 years, longer than World War II itself. Despite the hurdles, we have yet to see the final plaque installed, but it will be done, by the way, not at any cost to the taxpayers, meaning private fundraising, not taxpayer dollars, will be used. We had hoped to have the final plaque in place for the 75th anniversary. In the meantime, in 2019, we were able to have a temporary plaque in place with the words of the prayer at the permanent location for the permanent plaque, which is at the Circle of Remembrance, next to the World War II Memorial.\n\tIf you are on The Mall and you are coming from the Capitol, it will be on your right. It is north of the World War II Memorial but right next to it. In this very beautiful place, the Circle of Remembrance--a good place to sit and reflect--you will see, right now, the plaque is there, and you can read the prayer. The permanent plaque will be even bigger and will allow even more people to have access to it. I encourage people to go see that plaque. By the way, I think it is the only prayer on display on our National Mall.\n\tThe temporary plaque, by the way, was generously donated by the Friends of the National World War II Memorial. We are very hopeful that the permanent plaque will be placed at the circle next year. I want to thank the Lilly Endowment for its generous support of this project, by the way. Last October, it provided a $2 million grant for the construction and installation of the permanent plaque. This committed financial support will be critical to finally bringing the project across the line.\n\tThe fact that a prayer was offered that day by our Commander in Chief is historic in and of itself, but it is the content of the prayer that makes it so worthy of remembrance. I would now like to read this World War II D-day Prayer, if I may.\n\n       My fellow Americans [FDR began]: Last night, when I spoke \n     with you about the fall of Rome, I knew at that moment that \n     troops of the United States and our allies were crossing the \n     Channel in another and greater operation. It has come to pass \n     with success thus far.\n       And so, in this poignant hour, I ask you to join with me in \n     prayer:\n       Almighty God: Our sons, pride of our Nation, this day have \n     set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our \n     Republic, our religion, and our civilization, and to set free \n     a suffering humanity.\n       Lead them straight and true; give strength to their arms, \n     stoutness to their hearts, steadfastness in their faith.\n       They will need Thy blessings. Their road will be long and \n     hard, for the enemy is strong. He may hurl back our forces. \n     Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return \n     again and again; and we know that by Thy grace, and by the \n     righteousness of our cause, our sons will [prevail].\n       They will be sore tried, by night and by day, without \n     rest--until the victory is won. The darkness will be rent by \n     noise and flame. Men's souls will be shaken with the \n     violences of war.\n       For these men are lately drawn from the ways of peace. They \n     fight not for the lust of conquest. They fight to end \n     conquest. They fight to liberate. They fight to let justice \n     arise, and tolerance and good will among all Thy people. They \n     yearn but for the end of battle, for their return to the \n     haven of home.\n       Some will never return. Embrace these, Father, and receive \n     them, Thy heroic servants, into Thy kingdom.\n       And for us at home--fathers, mothers, children, wives, \n     sisters, and brothers of brave men overseas--whose thoughts \n     and prayers are ever with them--help us, Almighty God, to \n     rededicate ourselves in renewed faith in Thee in this hour of \n     great sacrifice.\n       Many people have urged that I call the Nation into a single \n     day of special prayer. But because the road is long and the \n     desire is great, I ask that our people devote themselves in a \n     continuance of prayer. As we rise to each new day, and again \n     when each day is spent, let words of prayer be on our lips, \n     invoking Thy help to our efforts.\n       Give us strength, too--strength in our daily tasks, to \n     redouble the contributions we make in the physical and the \n     material support of our armed forces.\n       And let our hearts be stout, to wait out the long travail, \n     to bear sorrows that may come, to impart our courage unto our \n     sons wheresoever they may be.\n       And, O Lord, give us Faith. Give us Faith in Thee; Faith in \n     our sons; Faith in each other; Faith in our united crusade. \n     Let not the keenness of our spirit ever be dulled. Let not \n     the impacts of temporary events, of temporal matters of but \n     fleeting moment let not these deter us in our unconquerable \n     purpose.\n       With Thy blessing, we shall prevail over the unholy forces \n     of our enemy. Help us to conquer the apostles of greed and \n     racial arrogancies. Lead us to the saving of our country, and \n     with our sister Nations into a world unity that will spell a \n     sure peace a peace invulnerable to the schemings of unworthy \n     men. And a peace that will let all of men live in freedom, \n     reaping the just rewards of their honest toil.\n       Thy will be done, Almighty God.\n       Amen.\n\n\tA powerful prayer. I love the part about they come not to conquer; they come to liberate. The same can be said for our Armed Forces throughout the ages.\n\tI look forward to seeing these words of prayer permanently displayed on the National Mall to help us memorialize such a noble day we must never forget.\n\tI yield the floor.\n\tThe PRESIDING OFFICER.

LANDER\n\n  Mr. LEE. Madam President, per an agreement that was reached with my \ncolleagues, Dr. Eric Lander, the President's nominee for the Director \nof the Office of Science and Technology Policy was not subject to a \nrollcall vote on the Senate floor, but was instead considered under a \nvoice vote.\n  I would like to be on the record that I am opposed to the nomination \nof Dr. Lander. As OSTP Director, Dr. Lander will advise the President \nand the administration on all the scientific, technological, and \nengineering aspects of Federal policy, including Federal research. Dr. \nLander should receive even further scrutiny for this position after \nPresident Biden has chosen to elevate the Director of the OSTP to a \nCabinet-level position.\n  This nomination comes at a critical time as the Senate seeks to pass \nthe Endless Frontier Act, which would increase Federal scientific \nresearch and development funding--imprudently in my opinion--by over \n$100 billion.

Madam President, per an agreement that was reached with my colleagues, Dr. Eric Lander, the President's nominee for the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy was not subject to a rollcall vote on the Senate floor, but was instead considered under a voice vote.\n\tI would like to be on the record that I am opposed to the nomination of Dr. Lander. As OSTP Director, Dr. Lander will advise the President and the administration on all the scientific, technological, and engineering aspects of Federal policy, including Federal research. Dr. Lander should receive even further scrutiny for this position after President Biden has chosen to elevate the Director of the OSTP to a Cabinet-level position.\n\tThis nomination comes at a critical time as the Senate seeks to pass the Endless Frontier Act, which would increase Federal scientific research and development funding--imprudently in my opinion--by over $100 billion. As I have weighed the nomination of Dr. Lander both in the Senate Commerce Committee and in the weeks leading up to his consideration by the full Senate, Dr. Lander has failed to provide the guarantees that he supports appropriate guardrails around federally funded research, including protections for unborn life through the prohibition of experimenting with aborted fetal tissue, embryonic stem cells, or live embryos.\n\tWith the consideration of the Endless Frontier Act and the greater role that OSTP will take in directing the direction of our Federal research and development, I am very concerned that Dr. Lander has not assured me that he will put in place protections for the unborn or institute appropriate ethical guardrails to protect such life.\n\tFor these reasons, I opposed the nomination of Dr. Lander.\n\n                          ____________________", "speakers": ["Mike Lee"], "citation": "167 Cong.
