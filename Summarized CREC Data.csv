              HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. ALBERT DOTSON, SR.

                                 ______
                                 

                       HON. MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR

                               of florida

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Ms. SALAZAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Albert Dotson, 
Sr., a beloved constituent in our community who served as a pioneer, 
activist, husband, and loving father throughout his lifetime. On May 
29, 2021, Mr. Dotson passed away at the age of 83.
  I would like to recognize Dr. Albert Dotson, Sr.'s steadfast 
leadership, his embrace of the communities he has lived and served in, 
and his many achievements.
  Born in Memphis, Tennessee in 1938, Albert was raised by a single 
mother who worked as a housekeeper. His mother, Alberta, taught him the 
value of hard work and respect at an early age.
  Later on in life, Albert met his wife, Earlene, while at church. The 
couple married in 1959 and continued to attend church together 
throughout the next six decades. Together, they had five children and 
13 grandchildren.
  Throughout his life, Albert never forgot the value of hard work that 
his mother instilled in him. After dropping out of college to take an 
entry-level job at Sears Roebuck and Company, he eventually worked his 
way up as the corporation's first African American store manager. In 
1976, he relocated to Miami, where he eventually decided to launch 
several of his own businesses with his wife.
  Education was always very important to Albert and Earlene. After 
watching all five of their children graduate from college, they decided 
to go back to school themselves and complete their undergraduate 
degrees. Albert eventually went on to complete his PhD in Philosophy in 
2004.
  Albert continuously remained active in the higher education 
community, serving on Florida International University's (FIU) 
Foundation Board of Directors for nearly two decades to secure research 
funding for architecture and medical students. He eventually went on to 
chair the FIU Board of Trustees from 2009 to 2011.
  Albert cared deeply for the Miami community, being involved with 
community groups like the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce and the Miami-
Dade School Board. In 1989, he joined the Orange Bowl Committee, 
created in 1935 to promote tourism to the Miami metropolitan area. Less 
than a decade later, Albert broke records when he became the first 
African American President of the Committee.
  Albert's life is a great example of service-leadership and working 
hard towards the American Dream. Miami-Dade will always be grateful for 
his contributions to our community.
  Dr. Dotson Sr. is survived by his wife Earlene; his sons Albert Jr. 
and Jonathan; his daughters Dr. Toya Greene, LeTessa Hall, Christa 
Dean; and his 13 grandchildren.

                    STEM EDUCATOR AWARDS EQUITY ACT

                                 ______
                                 

                  HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO SABLAN

                    of the northern mariana islands

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I introduce the STEM Educator 
Awards Equity Act to ensure educators from the Northern Mariana 
Islands, Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa are represented in 
the annual Presidential Awards for Excellence in Math and Science 
Teaching.
  Established by Congress in 1983, the Presidential Award is the 
highest recognition that an elementary or secondary school mathematics 
or science teacher may receive in the United States. Over 4,800 
teachers have been recognized for their contributions in the classroom 
and to their profession.
  Unlike the fifty States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and 
Department of Defense schools, each of which may recognize a STEM 
educator, no more than two awards in total can go to teachers from the 
four insular areas: the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, 
Guam, and American Samoa. This limitation has resulted in many years in 
which no teacher from one of those four areas is selected. No teacher 
from the Marianas, for instance, was selected this year. And this lack 
of recognition defeats the purpose of the program, which is to inspire 
excellence within each area and provide a role model for other local 
STEM educators to emulate. These statutory limits, also, unfairly deny 
deserving educators in the insular areas the national recognition and 
professional development opportunities we provide to STEM educators 
elsewhere in our Nation.
  My bill provides a more equitable process by requiring awards to at 
least one teacher from each of the four areas. By ensuring teachers 
from all parts of America are represented, more students and schools 
will benefit from the expert-led training programs and collaboration 
opportunities available to awardees during their visit to our Nation's 
Capital.
  The gentlewoman from American Samoa, Mrs. Radewagen and the gentleman 
from Guam, Mr. San Nicolas, are original cosponsors of the bill.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.

            HONORING ROBERT EIKLEBERRY AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. CYNTHIA AXNE

                                of iowa

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Robert ``Mongo'' 
Eikleberry, as a longtime LGBTQ advocate, business owner, community 
leader during this Pride Month.
  Robert served in the Vietnam War as a young man, where he was given 
the nickname ``Mongo'', When he returned home in 1972, he began working 
as a senior electrician as well as working at bars. Here, Robert saw 
that while gay bars were some of the only places LGBT individuals could 
openly be themselves, many establishments weren't uplifting the causes 
of the LGBT community. Robert realized he should open a business in Des 
Moines that would provide philanthropic support to multiple causes 
impacting his community.
  Robert opened the Blazing Saddles in Des Moines in 1983, 38 years 
ago, which is now the oldest gay bar in the Midwest. Robert's work has 
allowed him to create charities, such as the All Iowa AIDs Benefits to 
support Iowans suffering from HIV/AIDS during the height of the 
epidemic, as well as helping fundraise to support the needs of LGBT 
Iowans. Robert founded the Imperial Court of Iowa which funds 
educational scholarships for high school students and adult education 
seekers. He's known to pitch in for causes like voter education and 
advocacy, equal rights, and much more. Robert has always made sure his 
employees at the Blazing Saddles were paid competitive wages and had 
job protection to be themselves, protection that would not be given to 
most LGBT workers until 2020.
  In his over 40 years of activism, Robert has come face-to-face with 
hate and discrimination right here in Iowa. His bar had their windows 
smashed, flags burned, received threatening letters, and various other 
acts of vandalism over the years. ``You can't make fear a part of your 
life'', he said, reflecting on that fact that the fight for LGBT 
equality has historically been met with violence and intimidation. 
``But they can't scare us back into closet'' he said with a chuckle. 
Although LGBT equality has made strides recently, Robert has said there 
is still more work to do. ``Everyone needs a place to be themselves'' 
he said.
  His bar was named after the 1974 movie, Blazing Saddles, where a 
plucky group of immigrants, railroad workers, white townsfolk, and a 
black Sheriff who pull together to save their town for those who wish 
them harm and in turn, live safely together. A fitting name indeed. 
Please join me in honoring Robert ``Mongo'' Eikleberry as our Iowan of 
the Week as we celebrate Pride this month.

                 IN RECOGNITION OF FRAYDUN MANOCHERIAN

                                 ______
                                 

                        HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY

                              of new york

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Fraydun Manocherian on the 75-year anniversary of his 
immigration to the United States from Tehran, Iran and for his 
steadfast dedication to and impactful advocacy for automobile safety. 
Mr. Manocherian is also a successful entrepreneur embodying the 
American Dream with his wife Jennifer, their five children, and 13 
grandchildren.
  In 1932, Fraydun Manocherian emigrated to the United States at the 
age of 14 with his mother and brother. He soon became an entrepreneur 
pursing the American Dream, starting his first business venture in high 
school by buying and selling used cars. Then, while attending New York 
University, he turned his sights to New York's skyline--embarking on 
his career in real estate development.
  He acquired three adjacent five-story walk up buildings in Manhattan 
for $15,000 a piece which he then redeveloped. During the 1960's and 
1970's, Mr. Manocherian was one of the most prolific developers in 
Manhattan. In the 1980's he expanded his ventures nationwide through 
real estate investments and high-rise developments, among a multitude 
of other enterprises. He was the originator of the mega-health-club 
concept, opening the first New York Health & Racquet Club in 1973, 
followed by ten additional Manhattan locations. He also developed The 
Kimberly Suite Hotel in midtown Manhattan in 1985, and has since 
acquired other hotels which he still personally oversees.
  However, among all this success, Mr. Manocherian is, at his core a 
public servant and philanthropist. And it is for his accomplishments in 
automobile safety that I, his family, and all Americans are most proud.
  In 1951, two of Mr. Manocherian's high school friends were killed by 
a drunk driver. At the age of nineteen, he turned his grief into 
activism and became an advocate for federal funding of public education 
in traffic safety. After learning that automobile accidents were the 
number one killer of all young adults aged 16-25 years old, and the 
number one cause of physical disabilities--causing agonizing tragedy 
and grief for countless families, a 19-year-old Mr. Manocherian sent a 
telegram to President Eisenhower. The President arranged a meeting with 
Senator Irving Ives.
  He continued meeting with congressional leaders in Washington, D.C. 
to urge President Eisenhower's Committee on Traffic Safety to begin a 
national mass media educational program. While his determined efforts 
and countless contributions were impressive, he was not satisfied with 
the speed of progress. In 1962, he founded the National Road Safety 
Foundation with the purpose of reducing the 55,000 auto related 
fatalities every year. In 1970, he wrote Flesh, Metal, and Glass, a 
book on auto safety. Over the past 50 years, more than two million 
copies of Mr. Manocherian's book have been distributed free to 
thousands of high schools and drivers' education programs across the 
country. The publication has been updated several times and is now 
available online. The National Road Safety Foundation has also produced 
dozens of educational videos and public service announcements. The book 
and videos, along with other educational materials, are still used as 
important tools in driver's education programs throughout the country.
  Over the last half century, The National Road Safety Foundation has 
educated millions on how to become better and safer drivers through 
collaborating with educators, private groups, legislators, and 
government agencies to effect national standards in driving competence. 
The National Road Safety Foundation has also played an important role 
in seat belt laws, drunken driving policy, safer car regulations, and 
helmet and tum signal legislation for motorcycles. Mr. Manocherian has 
been a persuasive and influential force in Congress as this body 
enacted policies and legislation focused on driver safety.
  Mr. Manocherian's voice was among the first to rally the nation 
against drunk driving and his advocacy for federal funding of public 
education in traffic safety contributed toward passage of The Highway 
Safety Act of 1970, which established the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration. He is currently working to secure increased 
funding from the Federal Highway Trust Fund for a sustained National 
Traffic Safety Education media program. These efforts, among countless 
others, have helped reduce fatalities from 55,000 a year to 38,000 a 
year. This 30 percent reduction in fatalities is astonishing 
considering that in that same time, the number of drivers and mile 
driven have grown exponentially.
  For his dedication and accomplishments in the field of auto safety, 
Mr. Manocherian has received the ``Man of the Year'' award from the New 
York Council for Civic Affairs, the ``Man of the Year'' award from the 
Greater New York Automobile Dealers Association, an Honorary Doctorate 
in Humane Letters from St. John's University, a Master of Arts degree 
from the International University of Communications in Washington, 
D.C., the 1997 Distinguished Service to Safety Award from the National 
Safety Council, and the 2005 Public Service Award, one of the highest 
awards given by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. He 
has met with almost every President since President Eisenhower, is a 
founder of the Carter Center, and was appointed by President H. W. Bush 
to serve on the National Driver Register Advisory Committee.
  At 89 years young, Fraydun Manocherian is not only a nationally 
recognized powerful public service advocate, but also a rated jet 
pilot, and, more importantly, a greater husband, father, and 
grandfather than businessman, entrepreneur, or philanthropist.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my distinguished colleagues to join me in 
recognizing Fraydun Manocherian for his public service and incredible 
contributions to society and a lifetime of dedication to automobile and 
driver safety.

","IN RECOGNITION OF FRAYDUN MANOCHERIAN                                   ______                                                            HON. CAROLYN B. MALONEY                                of new york                      in the house of representatives                           Tuesday, June 8, 2021   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Fraydun Manocherian on the 75-year anniversary of his immigration to the United States from Tehran, Iran and for his steadfast dedication to and impactful advocacy for automobile safety. Mr. Manocherian is also a successful entrepreneur embodying the American Dream with his wife Jennifer, their five children, and 13 grandchildren.  In 1932, Fraydun Manocherian emigrated to the United States at the age of 14 with his mother and brother. He soon became an entrepreneur pursing the American Dream, starting his first business venture in high school by buying and selling used cars. Then, while attending New York University, he turned his sights to New York's skyline--embarking on his career in real estate development.  He acquired three adjacent five-story walk up buildings in Manhattan for $15,000 a piece which he then redeveloped. During the 1960's and 1970's, Mr. Manocherian was one of the most prolific developers in Manhattan. In the 1980's he expanded his ventures nationwide through real estate investments and high-rise developments, among a multitude of other enterprises. He was the originator of the mega-health-club concept, opening the first New York Health & Racquet Club in 1973, followed by ten additional Manhattan locations. He also developed The Kimberly Suite Hotel in midtown Manhattan in 1985, and has since acquired other hotels which he still personally oversees.  However, among all this success, Mr. Manocherian is, at his core a public servant and philanthropist. And it is for his accomplishments in automobile safety that I, his family, and all Americans are most proud.  In 1951, two of Mr. Manocherian's high school friends were killed by a drunk driver. At the age of nineteen, he turned his grief into activism and became an advocate for federal funding of public education in traffic safety. After learning that automobile accidents were the number one killer of all young adults aged 16-25 years old, and the number one cause of physical disabilities--causing agonizing tragedy and grief for countless families, a 19-year-old Mr. Manocherian sent a telegram to President Eisenhower. The President arranged a meeting with Senator Irving Ives.  He continued meeting with congressional leaders in Washington, D.C. to urge President Eisenhower's Committee on Traffic Safety to begin a national mass media educational program. While his determined efforts and countless contributions were impressive, he was not satisfied with the speed of progress. In 1962, he founded the National Road Safety Foundation with the purpose of reducing the 55,000 auto related fatalities every year. In 1970, he wrote Flesh, Metal, and Glass, a book on auto safety. Over the past 50 years, more than two million copies of Mr. Manocherian's book have been distributed free to thousands of high schools and drivers' education programs across the country. The publication has been updated several times and is now available online. The National Road Safety Foundation has also produced dozens of educational videos and public service announcements. The book and videos, along with other educational materials, are still used as important tools in driver's education programs throughout the country.  Over the last half century, The National Road Safety Foundation has educated millions on how to become better and safer drivers through collaborating with educators, private groups, legislators, and government agencies to effect national standards in driving competence.

  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize 
Sheila Tracy. After serving 28 years, Sheila Tracy is retiring from her 
position as President of the Northland Regional Chamber of Commerce.
  With the help of Sheila's leadership, the Northland Regional Chamber 
has continued to advocate for the needs of constituents in Missouri's 
Sixth Congressional District and the Northland of Kansas City. Sheila 
and the Chamber have worked on several large projects to benefit the 
Northland and my district. Sheila has spent countless hours working to 
move projects forward that would benefit my constituents, most recently 
the Buck O'Neil Bridge.
  I am honored to have collaborated with Sheila during her time as 
President of the Northland Regional Chamber. Her professionalism and 
dedication to the Northland and

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I introduce the District of 
Columbia Local Juror Non-Discrimination Act of 2021. This bill would 
clarify that D.C. residents may not be excluded or disqualified from 
jury service in the D.C. Superior Court based on sexual orientation or 
gender identity. Specifically, my bill would clarify that ``sex,'' 
which is a protected class under the non-discrimination law that 
applies to jurors in the D.C. Superior Court, includes sexual 
orientation and gender identity. Under the Home Rule Act, Congress has 
exclusive jurisdiction over title 11 of the D.C. Code (relating to 
organization and jurisdiction of the local D.C. courts).
  The District has one of the strongest non-discrimination laws in the 
country, including protecting individuals based on sexual orientation 
and gender identity. However, under the Home Rule Act, the District 
does not have the authority to make this non-discrimination law 
applicable to jurors in the D.C. Superior Court. Therefore, until the 
District is given complete control over the organization and 
jurisdiction of its local courts, an act of Congress is required to 
make this important change to protect the rights of all D.C. residents. 
This bill is necessary to protect jurors in the D.C. Superior Court 
from discrimination.
  My bill is similar to the Juror Non-Discrimination Act of 2021 (H.R. 
1140), which would provide the same protections for jurors in federal 
court. I am a proud cosponsor of that bill.
  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
anniversary of the Downriver Family YMCA located in Southgate, 
Michigan. Their 80 years of service to our community and its families 
is worthy of commendation.
  In Metro Detroit, the YMCA has been serving families for over 168 
years. The YMCA is an organization of men, women, and children with a 
shared commitment to nurturing the potential of kids, promoting healthy 
living, and fostering a sense of social responsibility.
  With simple beginnings as an organization established in 1941 by W.F. 
Newell at a house on Biddle Avenue in Wyandotte, Michigan, the 
Downriver Family YMCA has grown to be an exceptional center of 
wellness, community, and education. In 1943, The YMCA outgrew their 
small house and moved to a property at Chestnut and Biddle. This new 
Downriver YMCA represented the first ``family'' YMCA branch including 
boys and girls as well as men and women. Sixteen years later, they made 
the big move to their new home in Southgate at Fort Street and Eureka, 
partnering with the YWCA. Together they built two new pools and 
improved their offerings constantly to continue to serve the bustling 
area of Downriver. On May 11, 2003, to meet the growing needs of the 
community the YMCA and the City of Southgate held the grand opening for 
their brand-new building, The Southgate Fun and Fitness Center.
  Serving over 15,000 members, the Downriver Family YMCA is the largest 
branch in Metro Detroit. This organization has supported generations of 
Downriver families from childhood well into their senior years. 
Providing after-school programs, summer camps, food drives, active 
living classes, and activities for seniors, the Downriver Family YMCA's 
commitment to the promotion of health and wellness has impacted the 
lives of thousands of Michiganders of all ages as they enter their 
eighth decade of service to the people of Downriver.
  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 
Downriver Family YMCA's 80 years of service to our community. The 
Downriver Family YMCA has been a constant in the lives of the Downriver 
area's children and families for decades. I extend my gratitude to the 
entire Downriver Family YMCA team and wish them continued success in 
service and healthy living for years to come.

          OF REPRESENTATIVES, IN CELEBRATION OF HIS RETIREMENT

                                 ______
                                 

                           HON. RODNEY DAVIS

                              of illinois

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
acknowledge the career of a true public servant, House Inspector 
General Michael Ptasienski, who has dedicated nearly 15 years of his 
professional career to ensuring the People's House operates with 
integrity and accountability. Appointed as Inspector General in 
February of 2018, Mike is only the fifth individual to hold this 
position and as House IG, exemplified the excellence, attention to 
detail, determination and character necessary for success.
  But of course, the role of the Inspector General was not a surprise 
to Mike. Prior to being appointed, he had served as Deputy Inspector 
General of Advisory and Administrative Services, and as Director of 
Management Advisory Services. This month, his tenure in the House IG 
shop came to its end when he entered retirement on June 4, 2021. Mike 
will be missed--not only for his dedication and commitment to the IG 
mission, but for his positive attitude and approachable nature.
  Part of the mission of the House IG is to ``serve as a constructive 
critic, helpful advisor, and positive change agent.'' In fulfilling 
this mission, Mike has gone above and beyond, and the House is a more 
accountable, efficient, and safe institution due to the many 
recommendations and advisories his team produced under his leadership.
  I wish to once again express my and my team's gratitude for Mike's 
partnership, collaboration, and kindness throughout the years, and wish 
him all the best in his retirement.

                                 ______

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the Reverend Dr. 
John Roberts, Pastor of Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church in 
Toledo, for his 56 years of service in Jesus Christ. Our community 
joined his congregation in celebration of this heralded event on June 
6, 2021.
  I chronicled Pastor Roberts' life in an Extension of Remarks in April 
2005 upon the very special occasion of his fortieth anniversary. This 
56th year, Pastor Roberts will be elevated to the honorable status of 
Pastor Emeritus.
  Born in Bryant, Mississippi in 1927 to George and Melvina Roberts, 
John E. Roberts came to Toledo, Ohio in 1944. A founding member of 
Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church, he has been part of the 
church since it was organized in 1946. As noted in his biography, ``He 
has served and walked in the footsteps of most positions in the church, 
from custodian to Pastor'' and was called to pastor the church on the 
3rd Sunday of January l965. Even while Pastor, he pursued his Bachelor 
of Arts and Bachelor of Religious Education degrees in 1975, his Master 
of Theology in 1984, and his Doctorate in Biblical Theology in 1985.
  His biography highlights his many roles in his capacity as pastor: 
teacher, preacher, counsellor, and builder. The biography notes he is 
``Christ-like in devotion: strong in faith and mighty in prayer. His 
life, with its results, is a never-failing inspiration and challenges 
people of all ages and races, creating strong men around him.''
  Though Pastor Roberts has been the guiding light of his congregation 
and family for decades, standing beside him always has been his wife, 
First Lady Mother Bernice Roberts. Pastor and First Lady Mother Roberts 
are partners in all ways and ``jointly through the Grace of God they 
have mastered certain techniques that involve the ability to 
compromise, understand, cooperate, give and take, adjusting for better, 
not worse, knowing that all things work together for the good of those 
who love the Lord.'' Pastor and Mother Roberts were blessed to 
celebrate their 71st anniversary this year, on April 6. Together

[[Page E616]]

their family includes children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
  Pastor Roberts' service to the membership of Indiana Avenue 
Missionary Baptist Church blazed a path of leadership as he grew the 
church over many decades. His congregation blossomed from dozens to 
thousands as he shared the Word of the Lord, his devotion and wisdom, 
and his unique gifts.
  In addition to his leadership in the church, Pastor Roberts' 
imprimatur in our community is writ large. A highly respected community 
leader, he has served on many Toledo area organizations, lending his 
expertise and counsel well beyond the doors of his church.
  Reverend Dr. John E. Roberts came to retirement at age 93 in March of 
2021. He was the oldest serving Baptist pastor in Toledo, Lucas County, 
Ohio, and the Nation. As Pastor Emeritus, I am certain he will continue 
Christ's Message of Love and follow Psalms 78:72, ``So he shepherded 
them according to the integrity of his heart. And guided them by the 
skillfulness of his hands.''
  We are grateful for Pastor Roberts' unique and precious gifts 
including an irrepressible, wry sense of humor, brilliant smile, 
twinkling eyes, and a master of biblical text. A man of the Word, he 
kept his word. His life inspired others from all walks of life to 
follow his steady lead. The Indiana Avenue Missionary Baptist Church 
building he led his congregation to construct, and then expand several 
times, serves as a foundation stone for the revitalization of the near 
west neighborhood that hugs Toledo's downtown.
  When Pastor Roberts set a course, he always arrived at the 
destination.

               HONORING THE LIFE OF COL. DICK LITTLESTONE

                                 ______
                                 

                             HON. TED LIEU

                             of california

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate the life of Colonel 
Richard ``Dick'' Littlestone, United States Army retired--a beloved 
husband, father, grandfather, and dedicated advocate for veterans from 
California's 33rd Congressional District. Colonel Littlestone passed 
away on May 15, 2021 at the age of 97.
  Colonel Littlestone was born on September 23, 1923 in Evanston, 
Illinois and moved with his family to California at a young age. He 
attended and graduated from Los Angeles High School and was drafted 
into the Army a couple years later. While there, he was chosen to go to 
the United States Military Academy at West Point where he graduated in 
1947.
  Colonel Littlestone married his wife Doris in 1948. They moved to the 
Pacific Palisades neighborhood of Los Angeles in 1972 and raised three 
children, Richard, Nanette and Mark. They resided in the Palisades for 
49 years. Doris and Dick were married for almost 73 years.
  Colonel Littlestone was a veteran of World War II, the Korean War, 
and the Vietnam War. He served in the United States Army for 33 years 
and received the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and more than a 
dozen other honors.
  Through the G.I. Bill, he earned several advanced degrees and said 
that as a result, he had a wonderful career in the Army.
  After his time in the service, Colonel Littlestone taught at West 
Point for several years and later served as Chair and Professor of the 
Department of Military Science and Associate Director of the Computers 
and Information Systems Research Program at the University of 
California, Los Angeles.
  Colonel Littlestone believed deeply in duty, honor, and country, but 
went beyond that to serve his community and when he retired, this 
became his passion. Colonel Littlestone dedicated his time towards 
advocating for local veterans and fighting for improvements in his 
community. He said it was his service in three wars, and all the Army 
provided him, that drove his continued involvement and advocacy.
  Colonel Dick Littlestone was the driving force behind the creation of 
the Los Angeles National Cemetery's new and expanded columbarium, a 
4.4-acre project on the West Los Angeles VA Campus that would go on to 
house the remains of over 90,000 veterans and their family members. For 
22 years he championed this cause to ensure more veterans in the region 
could be laid to rest closer to their families and homes. The process 
was a labor of love and he prodded and cajoled several Secretaries of 
Veterans Affairs for years, knocking down one hurdle after another. His 
final achievement was to see the completion and dedication of the 
columbarium at the Los Angeles National Cemetery, which took place in 
October 2019.
  Colonel Littlestone was honored in 2015 with the first-ever Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors' Veterans Lifetime Achievement 
Award. He was more recently recognized for his service to the country 
when named Los Angeles Veteran of the Year in 2020 by Los Angeles City 
Councilmember Mike Bonin. Bonin said, ``Throughout his decades of 
service to both his country and his community, Colonel Littlestone has 
consistently combined his passion for the military with education.'' 
Bonin added, ``Colonel Dick Littlestone is an extraordinary example of 
patriotic duty and service--to his country and to the City of Los 
Angeles.''
  Colonel Dick Littlestone believed deeply in duty, honor, and country. 
His dedication to veterans and his service to his country and community 
is a shining example for all of us to follow. May his memory be a 
blessing.

  Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize John Manning on 
the occasion of his retirement as Chief Executive Officer of 
Southwestern Community Services .
  For more than 30 years, John Manning has provided much needed support 
to our community through his work at Southwestern Community Services 
(SCS). SCS runs numerous critical programs designed to empower low-
income individuals and families, such as the Community Food Program, 
several Energy and Fuel Assistance Programs, seven Head Start Centers, 
and more. Through John's leadership, SCS continues to expand services, 
including the distribution of critical rental assistance funds to 
thousands of households throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.
  I commend John Manning on his retirement after more than three 
decades of public service and dedication to the Granite State. John 
also serves as the Fire Chief for the Town of Marlborough, a testament 
to his commitment to the well-being and safety of Granite Staters.
  On behalf of New Hampshire's Second Congressional District, I thank 
John Manning for his service and wish him the best of luck in his new 
chapter.

For more than 30 years, John Manning has provided much needed support to our community through his work at Southwestern Community Services (SCS). SCS runs numerous critical programs designed to empower low-income individuals and families, such as the Community Food Program, several Energy and Fuel Assistance Programs, seven Head Start Centers, and more. Through John's leadership, SCS continues to expand services, including the distribution of critical rental assistance funds to thousands of households throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  I commend John Manning on his retirement after more than three decades of public service and dedication to the Granite State. John also serves as the Fire Chief for the Town of Marlborough, a testament to his commitment to the well-being and safety of Granite Staters.  On behalf of New Hampshire's Second Congressional District, I thank John Manning for his service and wish him the best of luck in his new chapter.                            ____________________",['Ann M.

  Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor GLC Minerals, LLC 
as the company celebrates its 150th anniversary.
  GLC Minerals is a Green Bay based, custom manufacturer of minerals 
and applications in its fifth generation of ownership and operation by 
the Hurlbut family. GLC Minerals serves many of Wisconsin's key 
industries, including dairy, poultry, glass, paper, construction, and 
agronomy.
  The company came from humble beginnings when entrepreneur, Fred 
Hurlbut, Sr., realized the strategic location of Green Bay and the 
economic opportunity of Great Lakes shipping following the Civil War 
and, in 1871, Fred's foresight came to fruition as the Hurlbut Calcium 
and Chemical Company.
  In 1913, second-generation owner, Fred Hurlbut, Jr., grew the company 
to include major coal and bulk distribution throughout Northeast 
Wisconsin. In 1940, the now named F. Hurlbut Company relocated to the 
shores of the Fox River where it still resides today, 81 years later. 
Throughout the mid-1900s, the company expanded its equipment and 
product lines.
  Under third-generation owners, Wesley H. Garner I, Charles Bennet and 
Frederick J. Lenfesty, the company diversified into the calcium and 
concrete products business. In 1965, Wesley H. Garner I's son, 
Frederick L. Garner, joined the company and, after serving in various 
capacities within the company for more

[[Page E617]]

than twenty years, he purchased Hurlbut Calcium and Chemical from the 
family. Frederick focused on reinvesting in the plant and equipment to 
produce a diverse and high-quality product line, and changed the name 
of the firm to Great Lakes Calcium Corporation.
  In 1996, Wesley Hurlbut Garner ll, became the fifth-generation family 
member to continue the entrepreneurial spirit by further expanding 
product lines. In 2015, Wes changed the company's name to GLC Minerals, 
LLC and launched GLC Integrated Services, LLC, a trans-load company 
serving Wisconsin's dairy industry with cost-effective movement of 
product from rail to truck to farm. GLC Minerals continues to grow and 
support our local business community and the broader Green Bay 
community, as it did in the early days when it helped to establish and 
support the Greater Green Bay Chamber.
  Madam Speaker, I urge all Members of this body to join me in 
applauding GLC Minerals and the Hurlbut family legacy for their 150 
years of success.

  NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER HERITAGE MONTH 
                         ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS

                                 ______
                                 

                  HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO SABLAN

                    of the northern mariana islands

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, this year, I hosted the first-ever Asian 
and Pacific Islander Heritage Month Essay Contest for Northern Mariana 
Islands middle school and high school students. This contest gives 
students in my district the opportunity to showcase their writing 
skills and reflect on their unique experiences living in the Northern 
Mariana Islands. This year's essay prompt encouraged students to share 
how the Asian and Pacific Islander community has impacted them, and 
what the Marianas community can do to best celebrate and respect the 
diversity in our islands.
  I would like to congratulate the 44 students who participated. A 
volunteer panel of judges reviewed the essays and chose Jia Ross Nicdao 
and Camille Torres Hocog as this year's winners of the middle school 
and high school division, respectively. Jia, an 8th grade student at 
Admiral Herbert G. Hopwood Middle School, wrote about her experience as 
a young Asian American in the Northern Mariana Islands. Camille, a 
sophomore at Marianas High School, wrote about diversity and unity.
  I am proud to include in the Record the essays submitted by Jia and 
Camille:

       Even though it is a small area, the Northern Marianas 
     Islands are undeniably full of different cultures and 
     traditions. Many ethnic groups, specifically Asian citizens 
     and Pacific Islanders, proudly call the CNMI their home; they 
     comprise more than 80 percent of Saipan's population. Whether 
     you were born or migrated from a different country, we still 
     thrive as a community to empower one another.
       My parents immigrated to the CNMI for work and started a 
     family here. My identity as Asian American has been a little 
     confusing. In the beginning, I felt as if I did not deserve 
     to be a member of the Filipino community. I felt like my 
     opinions and thoughts were invalid when discussing Filipino 
     topics because I was raised away from the area of action and 
     lived abroad. My different living situation made me feel as 
     if I do not deserve the recognition Filipinos got. I 
     struggled to find a label that I connected to, so I decided 
     to research Filipino culture. At that moment was when I found 
     out about the ethnic group that I was unknowingly part of, 
     known as Asian Americans, who are Americans with Asian 
     ancestry and/or children of immigrated parents. This 
     community was something I finally related to. On the island, 
     I never felt indifferent because of my ethnicity, which was 
     opposite to my other feelings. I was surrounded by other 
     Asians, so whenever I was around them, I felt like I belonged 
     with them. I liked that I could relate with other Asian 
     Americans through shared experiences; it gave me comfort. 
     Most of the representation here in the CNMI has been 
     positive. When I see members from this community succeed, it 
     not only impacts the view and generalization for our 
     community, but it also empowers me personally to strive for 
     that success. It pushes me to fulfill the achievements that 
     others succeeded in. It motivates me to become involved in 
     that success and also positively represent the community. I 
     am one of those community members, and I am proud to 
     represent the Asian American Community.
       I believe one of the best ways to respect and celebrate 
     diversity in this community is by educating ourselves on each 
     other's cultures. We can set an example for other communities 
     to participate in Asian American and Pacific Islander 
     appreciation month by first doing it within the community. 
     Sharing about our experiences; getting to know each others' 
     viewpoints is an expressive way to understand each others' 
     lifestyles. Also, researching appropriate behaviors and 
     mannerism is critical to be aware of when talking to other 
     people from different countries; we should never offend 
     anyone and be disrespectful. If we remove the negative energy 
     between nationalities in the community, we can work together 
     as one and spread love with other communities. Overall, being 
     part of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community 
     comes with many responsibilities, so being one with each 
     other will help us all accomplish many goals.

       The Northern Mariana Islands; an archipelago of islands in 
     the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Despite our small and rather 
     remote location, an abundance of cultures within the Asian 
     and Pacific Islander community reside here. Descendants from 
     all around the Asian-Pacific region call our islands home.
       As a young Chamorro woman who is indigenous to these 
     islands, this place means a significant amount to me. I take 
     great pride in my roots and where I come from, for it is a 
     source of my values, confidence, goals, and morals. But 
     there's one thing about my Chamorro identity that has always 
     stuck out to me; I am a result of the perseverance of my 
     people. Among the Pacific Islands, the Marianas has the 
     longest history of colonialism. To this day, we are still 
     experiencing its lasting effects. As I grow and learn even 
     more about my heritage, the more I have an understanding of 
     who I am in this world. Each moment of understanding reminds 
     me that because of my ancestor's resilience, I want to live 
     my life in fulfilling ways that would make them and my 
     islands proud today.
       Being from the islands also means connecting and building 
     friendships with people of different cultures, majority of 
     them being from within the API community. Reflecting on these 
     friendships made me realize how truly broad the term ``API'' 
     is, almost like it's a bigger picture. Despite all of us 
     being boxed into this term, looking a bit closer and seeing 
     the great amount of cultural diversity within this group 
     makes you realize how beautifully inclusive it is. Without a 
     doubt, there is a wealth of culture within the Asian-Pacific 
     region, and it's absolutely evident here in the Marianas. 
     Being able to share our cultural stories, arts, and 
     experiences with each other is, in my opinion, the best way 
     to celebrate our similarities and differences this month.
       One unforgettable experience in regards to the sharing of 
     my culture would be in 2016, where I went on a student 
     exchange trip to Japan. I was in 6th grade at the time. For a 
     couple of days, I stayed with a host family of four; one mom, 
     one dad, one daughter, and one younger son. The mom was the 
     only one who spoke English. I remember they'd take me to 
     different places around their hometown, such as restaurants, 
     the park, and different Japanese sites. With them, I was able 
     to experience firsthand what it was like to live in a 
     Japanese household.
       One morning before the daughter had to go to school, she 
     asked me to teach her some Chamorro words so that she could 
     show them to her friends. I taught her a few simple phrases 
     such as ``Hafa Adai'' and ``Buenas Dias''. Her mom translated 
     for us, and she was able to write down these words on a 
     notepad and take it with her to school.
       Having that experience at such a young age shaped the way I 
     see culture today. It showed me that simply sharing our parts 
     of the world and understanding each other's background is, 
     again, the best way to celebrate our cultural diversities.
       As we all know, May is a special month for us Asian and 
     Pacific Islanders. It's a month for us to celebrate our 
     achievements, contributions, and our heritage. It's an 
     occasion where many within the community open up about their 
     experiences being Asian and/or Pacific Islander. Whether it 
     be about the struggles or moments of contentment, it would be 
     the time to listen to and grasp onto our words. Despite this 
     month being named API Heritage Month, we shall continue to 
     listen to and uplift each other's voices even after May ends. 
     All throughout time, we will celebrate diversity and unity. 
     Thank you for reading.

  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, I proudly pause to recognize 
Christopher James Llewellyn. Christopher is a very special young man 
who has exemplified the finest qualities of citizenship and leadership 
by taking an active part in the Boy Scouts of America, Troop 401, and 
earning the most prestigious award of Eagle Scout.
  Christopher has been very active with his troop, participating in 
many scout activities. Over the many years Christopher has been 
involved with scouting, he has not only earned 39 merit badges, but 
also the respect of his family, peers, and community. Most notably, 
Christopher has been inducted into the Order of the Arrow and is the 
Sr. Patrol Leader of his troop. Christopher has also contributed to

his community through his Eagle Scout project which was renovating the 
Marian Grotto beside Mary Immaculate Catholic Church.
  Madam Speaker, I proudly ask you to join me in commending Christopher 
James Llewellyn for his accomplishments with the Boy Scouts of America 
and for his efforts put forth in achieving the highest distinction of 
Eagle Scout.

 THANKING PHILIP L. PARKER FOR HIS SERVICE TO THE GREATER DAYTON, OHIO

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mr. TURNER. Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to a respected 
community leader and trusted friend from my congressional district, 
Philip L. Parker, for his outstanding leadership and service to the 
business community and the Greater Dayton, Ohio region.
  Phil Parker became president and CEO of the Dayton Area Chamber of 
Commerce on April 29, 1994 and retired on July 31, 2020. Before joining 
the Chamber, Phil was Executive Director of the Home Builders 
Association of Dayton and the Miami Valley.
  For nearly a half-century, Phil has worked to make the Miami Valley a 
better place to live, work, and raise a family. When I served as mayor 
of the city of Dayton, and throughout my time in Congress, Phil and I 
worked together on many issues and community projects to advance our 
shared goals of promoting economic and job growth throughout Southwest 
Ohio.
  During his 26-year tenure as president and CEO of the Dayton Area 
Chamber of Commerce, Phil directed one of the 25 largest Chambers of 
Commerce in the nation. He oversaw the implementation of numerous 
transportation initiatives, such as the development of Austin Boulevard 
and much-needed improvements of U.S. Route 35 and I-70. Under his 
leadership, the Dayton Area Chamber was consistently recognized as one 
of the very best in the nation. In 1998, the Dayton Chamber was named 
Chamber of the Year by the Association of Chamber of Commerce 
Executives.
  Phil has been actively involved as a local, regional, state, and 
national volunteer, serving more than 500 volunteer hours a year over 
nearly 46 years. The generous amounts of time and energy he has 
contributed to a variety of volunteer and civic organizations, 
including the Greater Dayton Jaycees, the United Way, and the American 
Red Cross, have benefited our entire community.
  Phil has served on more than 50 boards over the years and currently 
sits on a dozen local boards including Greene Memorial Hospital, Soin 
Medical Center, Kettering College, and is a member of the Dayton Rotary 
Club.
  Madam Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to extend my heartfelt 
congratulations to Phil Parker as he celebrates his retirement. I ask 
my colleagues to join me in thanking a truly outstanding citizen for 
his lifetime of service to the people of Southwest Ohio.

 INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FEDERAL OFFICIALS RESIDENCY 
                        REQUIREMENT EQUALITY ACT

                                 ______

                      of the district of columbia

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I introduce the District of 
Columbia Federal Officials Residency Requirement Equality Act, which 
would require certain federal officials who serve the District of 
Columbia to live within its boundaries. In nearly every other 
jurisdiction in the United States, federal district court judges, 
federal circuit court judges, U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals and federal 
court clerks are required by federal law to reside within the 
jurisdictions where they have been appointed--but these same officials 
appointed to serve only the people of the District are not bound by 
this same requirement. Even in the territories, such officials are 
required to live in those jurisdictions, other than the U.S. Attorney 
and U.S. Marshal appointed for the Northern Mariana Islands who at the 
same time are serving in the same capacity in another jurisdiction. The 
only other exceptions exist for such officials appointed to the 
Southern District of New York and the Eastern District of New York, 
which are the only districts that serve different parts of the same 
city. My bill would put the District on equal footing with almost every 
other jurisdiction by ensuring that our federal judges, U.S. Marshals, 
U.S. Attorney and federal clerk live among the residents they have been 
appointed to serve, in keeping with the federal law that applies 
elsewhere in the United States.
  The requirement that these federal officials live in the 
jurisdictions they serve is significantly related to knowledge of the 
effect of their decisions, an important reason the residency 
requirement is enshrined in federal law. As stated in the official 
commentary to the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, ``a judge 
should not become isolated from the society in which the judge lives.'' 
The same holds true for other federal officials. My bill recognizes 
that the District deserves federal officials with the same 
understanding and links to the community as Congress has seen fit to 
require for federal officials in other jurisdictions.
  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

                          ____________________

                    in the house of representatives

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mr. NEAL. Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate the Pope Francis Preparatory School Boys Ice Hockey Team 
on winning the 2021 U.S.A. Hockey High School Division I National 
Championship. This milestone achievement deserves the highest praise 
for the hard work and dedication of these exemplary athletes and 
coaches. Despite the countless challenges posed by this unprecedented 
season, the perseverance and commitment to success demonstrated 
throughout the year led their team to victory on the biggest stage in 
high school hockey.
  The 2021 U.S.A. Hockey High School Division I Tournament brought 
twelve of the most elite high school hockey teams from across the 
country to compete for this year's National Championship. Members of 
the Pope Francis Boys Ice Hockey Team not only performed with 
exceptional mental and physical fortitude, but also displayed 
remarkable sportsmanship and character on their path to victory. They 
represented the First District of Massachusetts with great honor and 
distinction, and I am confident that the lessons learned during this 
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity will serve these young men well in their 
future endeavors.
  The Pope Francis Boys Ice Hockey Team was led by their Head Coach, 
Brian Foley, who has provided crucial guidance and instrumental 
mentorship to his young athletes both on and off the ice over the past 
eighteen seasons. Coach Foley was assisted by Assistant Coaches Steve 
Ashe, Tim Keeney, and Dan Fenton, and the victorious student athletes 
are Matt Hanscom, Zach Buffone, Jack Moltenbrey, Jacob Iby, Ryan 
Hemenway, Ryan Leonard, Brandon Spaulding, Colin Foyle, Evan Phaneuf, 
Drew Bolduc, Jack Kennedy, Ryan Shaw, Bryce Russ, Joey DiMichele, 
Stephen Rougeot, Jack Turowsky, Matt Burke, Derek Rhodes, Ryan O'Leary, 
Ryan Rhodes, Ben Zaranek, and Josh Iby.
  Madam Speaker, I would like to once again acknowledge the Pope 
Francis Preparatory School Boys Ice Hockey Team for their superb 
achievement. I am proud of this group and I wish them much continued 
success.

                         Tuesday, June 8, 2021

  Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Sam Houston 
State Bearkats and their first NCAA FCS title in program history.
  Throughout the season, the team faced countless unprecedented 
challenges. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FCS football season was 
moved to Spring 2021. Additionally, following the February Winter 
Freeze, players and coaches used feed shovels to clear snow off the 
field for practice. Meanwhile, due to renovations to the football 
facilities, the Sam Houston St. players were without locker room and 
shower facilities.
  Despite the season's difficulties, Sam Houston State's resilience 
made the year one that will not be soon forgotten. The Bearkats 
finished their regular season undefeated with a 10-0 record. The team 
clinched its eighth Southland Conference championship. Additionally, 
coach K.C. Keeler won the Southland Conference Coach of the Year. With 
such a successful regular season, the Bearkats entered the postseason 
with momentum and with the No. 2 seed in the FCS playoffs.
  After defeating Monmouth, South Dakota St., and James Madison, the 
Bearkats secured their place in the FCS title game. The 2021 FCS 
Championship Game, played in

[[Page E619]]

Frisco, TX between the Sam Houston State Bearkats and the No. 1 seed 
South Dakota State Jackrabbits, was an instant classic. After a back 
and forth game, the Bearkats' resilience proved to be the difference. 
With only 16 seconds left in the game, Eric Schmic found Ife Adeyi for 
a 10-yard touchdown to take the lead. With a 23-21 victory, Sam Houston 
St secured its first FCS Championship in program history.
  This was not only a first for Sam Houston State and Texas, but it was 
also a first for Coach K.C. Keeler, who became the first coach to win 
an FCS Championship at two different schools: first at the University 
of Delaware and now at Sam Houston State. Coach Keeler also became the 
all-time winningest coach in FCS playoff history with 24 wins. The 
Bearkats' Jequez Ezzard was also named the FCS Championship Game's Most 
Outstanding Player. The team's achievement will be long remembered. As 
Coach Keeler said to his team after the game: ``It's immortality for 
the rest of our lives and beyond that . . . Sam Houston State is the 
national champion.''
  I join the rest of the state of Texas in honoring Sam Houston State 
and the Bearkats for their historic victory. They truly represent the 
best of Texas and its fighting spirit of strength and determination.

  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the Senate, today, will achieve an 
important milestone for the session. We will confirm the first of 
President Biden's judicial nominees--the first but, certainly, not the 
last, not even close. We will soon confirm Julien Neals to be a judge 
for the District of New Jersey. Afterward, we will turn to the 
nomination of Regina Rodriguez to be a judge for the District of 
Colorado. I greatly look forward to confirming what will be the first 
of many judicial appointments during the Biden administration.

  Mr. President, later today, the Senate will take a final vote on the 
U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, paving the way for the largest 
investment in science and technology for generations.
  After 3 months of bipartisan negotiations, after the hard labor of 6 
Senate committees, and after considering over 20 amendments from both 
sides of the floor, we should--and we will--pass this historic bill 
today. When all is said and done, the bill will go down as one of the 
most important things this Chamber has done in a very long time--a 
statement of faith in America's ability to seize the opportunities of 
the 21st century.
  The ambitions of this legislation are large, but the premise is 
simple: If we want American workers and American companies to keep 
leading the world, the Federal Government must invest in science, basic 
research, and innovation, just as we did in the decades after the 
Second World War.
  Technology firms currently make up a quarter--a quarter--of the 
global stock market. Whoever wins the race to the technologies of the 
future is going to be the global economic leader, with profound 
consequences for foreign policy and national security as well. Whoever 
harnesses the technologies, like AI, quantum computing, and innovations 
yet unseen, will shape the world in its image.
  Do we want that image to be a democratic image, with a small ``d,'' 
or do we want it to be an authoritarian image like President Xi would 
like to impose on the world?
  Either we can cede the mantle of global leadership to our adversaries 
or we can pave the way for another generation of American leadership. 
That is what this bill is all about, and I look

forward to joining my colleagues in finally passing this bill later 
today.


                               January 6

  Now, Mr. President, on January 6, this morning, the Senate's Homeland 
Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, in partnership with the 
Rules Committee, released a joint report related to the aspects of the 
tragedy of January 6.
  I particularly salute Chairs Peters and Klobuchar for the good work 
they have done with their ranking members.
  The report drew a few notable conclusions, especially with respect to 
the failures in intelligence gathering and communication that took 
place on and before January 6, but just as glaring as what the report 
didn't consider is, indeed, what it was not allowed to consider. The 
report did not investigate, report on, or hardly make any reference to 
the actual cause, the actual impetus, for the attack on January 6.
  With the exception of a brief reference to former President Trump's 
remarks at the Ellipse, Senate Republicans insisted that the report 
exclude anything having to do with the cause of the insurrection.
  If anything, the joint report by the Homeland Security and Rules 
Committees has strengthened the argument for an independent commission 
on January 6.
  We had a perfect opportunity to establish such a Commission at the 
end of last session before Republicans mounted a partisan filibuster 
against it, despite the fact that the Democrats worked with Republicans 
for weeks in the House and Senate to construct a Commission that was 
bipartisan, focused, straight down the middle; despite the fact that 
Speaker Pelosi acceded to every major request made by House Republicans 
about the structure of the commission; and despite the fact that, here 
in the Senate, I supported the changes proposed by my colleague Senator 
Collins.
  As the Big Lie continues to spread, as faith in our elections 
continues to decline, it is crucial--crucial--we establish a trusted, 
independent record of what transpired on January 6 and what caused it.
  So I reserve the right to bring legislation for an independent, 
bipartisan Commission to the Senate floor for another vote.

                           Paycheck Fairness

  Mr. President, now, on paycheck fairness, finally, this week the 
Senate will vote on whether to take up legislation that would provide 
equal pay for women in America.
  We have been talking about the wage gap for years now, with no action 
taken by the Senate.
  Women with the same jobs, the same degrees, sometimes even better 
degrees than their male colleagues, are making less money. For women of 
color, the gap between them and their male counterparts is even wider.
  This is a fundamental issue of fairness, and we have a very simple, 
commonsense legislative proposal to address the issue. But yesterday, 
the Republican leader said Democrats' attempts to bring this issue up 
for a debate was ``transparently designed to fail.'' He went on to say 
that issues like gun safety and pay equity were merely ``demands of 
[our] radical base.''
  Look, the only way that a bill to provide equal pay for women is 
designed to fail is if Senate Republicans block it. And if the 
Republican leader wants to talk about ``radical'' positions, I would 
say that opposing legislation to provide equal pay for women, supported 
by a solid majority of voters, is a radical position. Does he believe 
that?
  You know what is radical? Opposing legislation to expand background 
checks to prevent felons and the mentally ill from getting a gun. More 
than 90 percent--90 percent--of Americans support that policy. But 
Republicans have, in the past, opposed it. That is truly a radical 
position.
  You know what else is radical? Opposing a bipartisan, independent 
Commission to report on a violent mob that attacked this Capitol. 
Spreading doubt about the veracity of our elections. That is radical 
and, in my opinion, despicable. It gnaws at the very roots of this 
grand democracy. And we hear either encouragement or acquiescence from 
the other side when President Trump and his minions do this.
  You know what else is radical? Passing laws that specifically make it 
harder for younger, poorer, and non-White Americans to vote. That is 
truly radical and dangerous. It is against the whole grain of progress 
we have made in America. Remembering that when the Constitution was 
passed, the vast majority of us in this Chamber, not the vast majority 
but probably the majority--I haven't counted--would have to be White, 
male, Protestant property owners to vote, we have made progress. They 
want to take a giant step back for pure electoral gain. Radical. That 
is radical.
  So we are going to have a vote on paycheck fairness this week. The 
first vote is not even a vote on the bill; it is just a vote on whether 
to take it up for debate. We will see if our Republican colleagues take 
the radical step of blocking the Senate from even debating equal pay 
for women.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.

                          Endless Frontier Act

  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today the Senate will wrap up 
consideration of a broad bipartisan effort to update our approach to 
competition with China. This bill has accelerated an important 
conversation on a topic we all know deserves our full attention. From 
critical supply chains to intellectual property, to counterespionage, 
it touches on key issues that will help determine our strategic footing 
for decades.
  That is why an overwhelming majority of us, myself included, voted to 
proceed to the measure here on the floor, not because the bill was 
already perfect. In fact, as the ranking member of the Commerce 
Committee noted when it was reported out, the legislation was ``not 
ready for prime time.''
  Rather, we took it up precisely because it deserved robust debate and 
amendment. So I was glad that several of our colleagues were allowed to 
offer substantial revisions here on the floor. In particular, I am glad 
the Democratic leader thought better of blocking Chairman Wyden and 
Ranking Member Crapo from including their bipartisan provision on 
combating illicit trade practices.
  But I was disappointed that he proceeded with an effort to end this 
important debate without allowing the Senate to consider a number of 
other outstanding Republican amendments.
  There is no practical reason our consideration of this important 
issue should have to compete for sufficient space on the Democrats' 
dance card.
  We are talking about making America more competitive with its biggest 
and fastest growing rival. If any issue demands thorough, exhaustive 
debate, it is this one.
  Unfortunately, the final bill we will be voting on today will remain 
incomplete. It includes several smart, targeted measures but leaves 
many more on the table. And so it will advance as an imperfect approach 
to an extremely consequential challenge.
  One thing this legislation did demonstrate extremely well, however, 
was that the rules of the Senate don't stand in the way of bipartisan 
legislating.
  Needless to say, final passage of this legislation cannot be the 
Senate's final word--final word on our competition with China. It 
certainly won't be mine. As I have warned repeatedly, soft power is 
only as strong as the hard power underpinning it.
  The Chinese Communist Party doesn't hesitate in investing the 
proceeds of its predatory trade practices and influence campaigns 
directly into modernizing its hard power arsenal.
  Over the past two decades, defense spending in Beijing has increased 
astronomically. Meanwhile, the Biden administration's proposal for 
defense spending puts forward such a meager--meager--year-on-year 
increase, it fails to keep pace with inflation, let alone with our 
rivals.
  The White House request would degrade our ability to project power

[[Page S3969]]

quickly out in the Western Pacific. It would cannibalize Pacific 
Deterrence Initiative funds intended to build infrastructure and 
enhance interoperability with our partners in the region just to cover 
shortfalls elsewhere in the budget. And it would cut procurement of 
critical munitions that are already in short supply.
  The administration is playing a dangerous shell game, and the 
political consequences aren't lost on either side of the Pacific.
  The perception that the United States might be any less than fully 
committed to prevailing in great power competition has left China 
emboldened and our friends in the region quite worried.
  Here at home, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs sounded the alarm, 
warning that great power peace was ``fraying at the edge.''
  Preserving that peace will require more than the action we will take 
today. It will require this administration to get serious about funding 
our national defense. It will require major investment in the sorts of 
cutting-edge capabilities that deter those who intend harm on America 
and our allies.
  So in the coming weeks, we will see whether Democrats' talk about 
rebuilding alliances has any substance to it. In the annual Defense 
authorization and the appropriations process, the Senate will embrace 
this essential debate about restoring America's hard power head-on. 
This is a pivotal moment, not a time for half measures on America's 
national security.


                               January 6

  Mr. President, now on another matter, today, the Homeland Security 
and Rules Committees released the conclusions of their monthslong 
investigation into the circumstances of the unprecedented breach of 
security here at the Capitol on January 6.
  I am grateful to our colleagues on both committees whose hard work 
made this invaluable report possible.
  My assessment of the terrible events of the 6th has been consistent 
from the beginning. I have condemned the perpetrators, as well as those 
who enabled and encouraged them, and I have given full-throated support 
to our colleagues' bipartisan inquiry, along with the work of Federal 
investigators and prosecutors, to ensure that every criminal 
participant faces justice.
  The Rules and Homeland Security report identifies a number of serious 
shortcomings in Capitol security that were exposed and exploited on the 
6th. It directs our attention to the most glaring gaps that could leave 
the complex vulnerable to future incidents.
  Through the efforts of the Capitol Police, the Senate Sergeant At 
Arms, and other institutional partners, the Senate's work to close 
these gaps is already well underway. The committee's inquiry into 
January 6 is ongoing, and the nationwide search for a new Chief of the 
Capitol Police is making progress. Our colleagues' latest findings 
should guide the entire institution's ongoing security reviews.
  Today's report is one of the many reasons I am confident in the 
ability of existing investigations to uncover all actionable facts 
about the events of January 6. I will continue to support these efforts 
over any that seek to politicize the process, and I would urge my 
colleagues to do the same.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

                          Judicial Nominations

  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the major responsibilities of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, is the selection of judges 
to serve our Nation. It is important not only because it is a question 
of measuring their standards of integrity, honesty, and judgment but 
also because these are lifetime appointments. Literally, the women and 
men who are chosen for these slots will have an impact on the future of 
America in their courts which could last for many years and decades. 
That is why we are careful with the Biden administration to not only 
bring good nominees before the Committee but to make certain they bring 
the necessary qualities.
  This week, the Senate will consider several of President Biden's 
judicial nominees. I believe they understand the role of a judge in our 
system. They will bring much needed experiential and demographic 
diversity to our Nation's courts.
  I have tried throughout my career, and many others like me have 
tried, to choose men and women for the bench who will reflect the 
diversity of America. The face of justice is often as important as the 
fact of justice, and if people appearing before our courts feel that 
there is at least a chance for success based on the background and 
experience of a judge, I think it is a positive thing.
  Given the background of these judges in trying cases, arguing 
appeals, and issuing rulings from the bench, I believe, and the 
committee agreed, that these judicial nominees are ready for service.
  Today, I would like to speak in support of two of them: Julien Neals, 
nominated to the District Court of New Jersey, and Regina Rodriguez, 
nominated to the District Court of Colorado.
  New Jersey is really in desperate need of Federal judges. They are 
facing a judicial emergency. In each of the States' six judicial 
vacancies, they have been designated as a judicial emergency status by 
the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.
  Today, we can begin to address this judicial emergency by finally 
confirming Julien Neals to the U.S. District Court for the District of 
New Jersey. He is an extraordinary public servant. He has served the 
people of the State of New Jersey for decades. As an expert in 
municipal law, he handled several legal disputes that were tried to 
verdict, judgment, or final decision, including multiple--multiple--
jury trials. He was the chief judge of the Newark Municipal Court. He 
presided over 6,000 cases in that capacity.
  He received a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' from the 
American Bar Association. He has the strong support of his home State 
Senators, Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez. He has received broad 
bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee, with five Republicans 
joining all the Democrats in supporting his nomination.
  I urge my colleagues to support him.
  This week, the Senate will also consider the nomination of Regina 
Rodriguez to be a judge in the District Court of Colorado. What a life 
story she brings. Ms. Rodriguez is the daughter of a Japanese-American 
mother, whose family was interned during World War II, and a Mexican-
American father who was one of the first Hispanic coaches in the 
National Football League. Her father's job as a coach took the family 
across the country.
  Although Ms. Rodriguez was born in Colorado, she spent several of her 
formative years in my home State of Illinois. When she was 17 years 
old, Ms. Rodriguez thought she might want to be a lawyer, so she put on 
her best suit, as she says, and knocked on doors in Macomb, IL, until 
she found a lawyer who said: ``Come on in. I'll show you the ropes.''
  Lucky for us, Ms. Rodriguez held on to that passion that first 
developed when she was a teenager. Over the past 30 years, she has 
served as a talented litigator who has tried 35 cases to verdict.
  She has a range of experience in government and the private sector. 
In the public sector, she served as an assistant U.S. attorney and rose 
to become the first Latina Chief of the Civil Division of the U.S. 
Attorney's Office for the District of Colorado. In private practice, 
she represented a broad array of clients, from individuals to Fortune 
500 firms. During her tenure as a litigator, Ms. Rodriguez has 
demonstrated that she understands the importance of applying the law to 
the facts in a fair manner. She has represented plaintiffs, defendants, 
government, and those who have sued the government. As a woman of 
color, she has risen as a partner in several leading law firms--no mean 
feat.
  Ms. Rodriguez has taken out time from her demanding schedule to 
mentor young attorneys, just as that lawyer in Macomb, IL, did for her.
  She has received a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the 
American Bar Association, as well as positive

blue slips from both Senators Bennet and Hickenlooper. Her nomination 
is also supported by the National Asian Pacific American Bar 
Association, the Latinas First Foundation, and the Colorado Lawyers 
Committee.
  She has earned support across the aisle. On May 20, Ms. Rodriguez was 
voted out of the committee by a vote of 17 to 5, with the support of 
six of my Republican colleagues.
  When confirmed, she will be the first Asian-American judge to serve 
not only in the District of Colorado but in the entire Tenth Circuit. 
Her historic, well-deserved confirmation will bring our Federal 
judiciary closer to reflecting the lives and experiences of all 
Americans. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for Ms. 
Rodriguez's nomination.
  The judicial nominees we are voting on this week illustrate something 
that is substantial and profound. They illustrate that President Joe 
Biden is dedicated to appointing legal experts with outstanding 
credentials and a wealth of experience.
  During his first several months in office, President Biden has 
nominated public servants who will bring to the bench a variety of 
professional perspectives and personal experiences. Too often, those 
things have been missing in previous nominees. By confirming judges who 
reflect the experience of all Americans and who demonstrate fealty to 
the rule of law, we can continue building a justice system that works 
for everyone.
  Over the last 4 years, we have seen a concerted effort on the 
Republican side to fill vacancies. They broke records, in some 
respects, in the number of nominees that they brought before the Senate 
for approval. Some of the records are not ones to be proud of, from my 
perspective, and 10 of the nominees who were submitted for 
consideration during the last 4 years before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee were found unqualified by the American Bar Association. 
Nevertheless, most of them made it to the bench in lifetime 
appointments.
  Many nominees came before us, of the Trump administration, who were 
seeking lifetime appointments to become a trial judge and had no 
personal experience in a courtroom. It is hard to imagine that anyone 
would be thrust into that situation and expected to perform as a 
professional. Imagine, if you will, the parties to those lawsuits, many 
of whom stake their lives and reputations on the outcome, to find a 
judge who couldn't find their way through the Code of Civil Procedure 
if they were forced to. That, unfortunately, was the standard that was 
used. As long as these nominees in the past had the blessing of the so-
called Federalist Society, that was good enough for many of my 
Republican colleagues.
  Joe Biden is really responding to that by suggesting nominees who 
meet much higher standards. I want to work with the Biden 
administration to continue in that tradition, so at the end of the day 
we can fill the vacancies with women and men who are not only competent 
and honest but have the integrity and experience, both legal and 
otherwise, to serve our Nation for the rest of their lives, should they 
choose, in these judicial capacities.
  I commend these two nominees who passed out of our committee with a 
strong bipartisan votes. To my colleagues on the floor today, I hope 
they will join me in supporting them.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so 
ordered.


                               January 6

  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I am grateful 
to Senators Klobuchar, Blunt, Peters, and Portman and the two Senate 
committees that they lead for their bipartisan investigation into the 
events of January 6, and for producing a detailed report in a short 
amount of time. The report makes clear that there is more work ahead 
for the committees. More importantly, it also highlights the immense 
bravery of the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police who defended 
the Capitol Complex on January 6.
  In the coming days, after a thorough review of the 100-page report, I 
will discuss its recommendations with my colleagues and work to 
institute reforms that will make a meaningful change to better protect 
the U.S. Capitol

","Judicial Nominations   Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, one of the major responsibilities of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, is the selection of judges to serve our Nation. It is important not only because it is a question of measuring their standards of integrity, honesty, and judgment but also because these are lifetime appointments. Literally, the women and men who are chosen for these slots will have an impact on the future of America in their courts which could last for many years and decades. That is why we are careful with the Biden administration to not only bring good nominees before the Committee but to make certain they bring the necessary qualities.  This week, the Senate will consider several of President Biden's judicial nominees. I believe they understand the role of a judge in our system. They will bring much needed experiential and demographic diversity to our Nation's courts.  I have tried throughout my career, and many others like me have tried, to choose men and women for the bench who will reflect the diversity of America. The face of justice is often as important as the fact of justice, and if people appearing before our courts feel that there is at least a chance for success based on the background and experience of a judge, I think it is a positive thing.  Given the background of these judges in trying cases, arguing appeals, and issuing rulings from the bench, I believe, and the committee agreed, that these judicial nominees are ready for service.  Today, I would like to speak in support of two of them: Julien Neals, nominated to the District Court of New Jersey, and Regina Rodriguez, nominated to the District Court of Colorado.  New Jersey is really in desperate need of Federal judges. They are facing a judicial emergency. In each of the States' six judicial vacancies, they have been designated as a judicial emergency status by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts.  Today, we can begin to address this judicial emergency by finally confirming Julien Neals to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. He is an extraordinary public servant. He has served the people of the State of New Jersey for decades. As an expert in municipal law, he handled several legal disputes that were tried to verdict, judgment, or final decision, including multiple--multiple--jury trials. He was the chief judge of the Newark Municipal Court. He presided over 6,000 cases in that capacity.  He received a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' from the American Bar Association. He has the strong support of his home State Senators, Senators Cory Booker and Bob Menendez. He has received broad bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee, with five Republicans joining all the Democrats in supporting his nomination.  I urge my colleagues to support him.  This week, the Senate will also consider the nomination of Regina Rodriguez to be a judge in the District Court of Colorado. What a life story she brings.

                          Biden Administration

  Mr. President, on a different topic, in his 1996 State of the Union 
address, then-President Bill Clinton famously declared: ``The era of 
big government is over.''
  Well, after taking a look at the Biden budget, it is clear that the 
era of Big Government is back, and it is bringing Big Government's 
usual companions: big taxation, big spending, big deficits, and, it 
seems likely, big inflation.
  The Biden budget, which the administration quietly slipped out the 
door before the holiday weekend, would raise taxes by $3.6 trillion 
over 10 years--3.6 trillion. All told, the Biden budget proposes at 
least 30 separate tax increases, ranging from a hike in the capital 
gains tax to a hike in the top income tax rate, to a new death tax. And 
it would raise taxes on middle-class families by allowing the tax 
relief the Republicans passed in 2017 to expire.
  Under the Biden budget, in just a few short years, working Americans 
could be facing thousands of dollars in higher taxes. All these tax 
hikes, of course, are an attempt to pay for the Biden administration's 
new spending.
  Under the Biden budget, government spending would exceed $6 trillion 
every year. To put that in perspective, the total--total--Federal 
budget in 2019 was $4.4 trillion. An increase to $6 trillion plus per 
year--$8.2 trillion by 2031--is a massive, massive hike in Federal 
spending.
  Over the course of the Biden budget, government spending would equal 
around 25 percent of our gross domestic product--far exceeding the 
average of the past five decades for spending, as a percentage of our 
total economic outlook.
  So what would the consequences of all this spending look like? Well, 
I have already mentioned the $3.6 trillion in new tax hikes. Another 
would be the deficits, which would exceed $1.3 trillion every year for 
the next 10 years. By 2031, the end of the Biden budget window, our 
debt would be--get ready for this--$39 trillion. Our debt would equal 
117 percent of the U.S. economy--again, the highest level in our 
Nation's history, debt to GDP.
  The interest payments on the debt would triple over the next 10 years 
to $914 billion. That is right. By 2031, we would be paying nearly $1 
trillion a year just in interest on the debt. That is more money than 
our Nation will spend on Medicare this year.
  So let's review. The Biden budget equals taxes, spending, and debt. 
And here is the real kicker: The Biden budget hikes taxes, hikes 
spending, and drives up the debt for pretty much nothing. That is 
right. After an initial good year or two, the Biden budget projects 
permanently weak economic growth. For a majority of the next 10 years, 
economic growth wouldn't even hit 2 percent.
  All that government spending and debt isn't going to result in 
prosperity. It is going to result in permanent economic stagnation, and 
that means permanently diminished opportunities for American families, 
fewer jobs, lower wages, and weaker career prospects.
  Democrats like to talk as if government can provide security and 
salvation. But the truth is, government is not an engine of prosperity. 
Government might serve as a safety net in difficult circumstances, but 
government will never make you prosperous. It is a robust economy, not 
a robust government, that would produce prosperity, that would produce 
the good jobs and good salaries and good benefits and good careers.
  That is why one of the most important jobs of government is creating 
the conditions that will allow the economy to flourish. That is what 
Republicans worked to do with the tax relief that we passed in 2017. 
And, as we saw before the pandemic hit, it was working.
  The Biden budget, on the other hand, focuses on creating a 
flourishing government, and the economy would pay the price. And 
working Americans would face a future of diminished earnings and 
reduced opportunity.
  There is a lot more that could be said about the Biden budget. I 
haven't even mentioned the diminished investment

[[Page S3971]]

in our national defense, which could have very serious consequences for 
our national security.
  Less than 3 years ago, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy 
Commission released a report warning--warning--that our readiness had 
eroded to the point where we might struggle to win the war against a 
major power like Russia or China. And while we have made some real 
progress since then, we still have a lot of work to do to ensure that 
our military is prepared to defend our Nation and meet the threats of 
the 21st century. The Biden budget would send us right back to the 
situation that we faced 3 years ago.
  I guess it is not surprising that a budget that fails to be serious 
about fiscal realities would fail to be serious about national security 
realities, but it is deeply concerning that the President doesn't seem 
to understand the importance of investing in our national defense.
  President Biden has made the priorities of liberal interest groups 
the top priorities for his administration--whether that is canceling 
the Keystone XL's good-paying jobs and economic growth to please the 
environmental left or overturning the Mexico City policy so that 
taxpayer dollars can go to fund abortions overseas.
  On the question of abortion, President Biden's budget abandons 
decades of bipartisan compromise and eliminates the Hyde amendment, 
which protects taxpayers from having their tax dollars used to fund 
abortions here at home. You would think that if we can't agree that the 
human rights of unborn children should be protected, we should at least 
agree that a taxpayer shouldn't be forced to pay for the killing of 
unborn children.
  Almost 60 percent of Americans oppose using taxpayer dollars to pay 
for abortions, but President Biden has made it clear that his 
allegiance to the radical abortion left trumps the opinions of the 
American people. So his budget eliminates the Hyde amendment and 
imposes a number of other pro-abortion measures, like additional 
government funding access for the Nation's largest abortion provider, 
Planned Parenthood.
  The Biden budget might be good news for liberal interest groups, but 
it is bad news for the American people and bad news for our country. I 
hope that my Democratic colleagues will think twice before forcing this 
massive government expansion onto the American people.
  I yield the floor.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded.

ordered.

                   Nomination of Regina M. Rodriguez

  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor today to 
share a few words about Regina Rodriguez, President Biden's nominee for 
the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. Gina's nomination 
comes to this floor with broad, well-earned support across the State of 
Colorado. My office has received a flood of letters on her behalf. All 
of them testify to her character, her hard work, and her commitment to 
service, justice, and the rule of law.
  She learned all of it from her family. Her mom's family knew 
injustice firsthand. During the Second World War, they were relocated 
from California to the Heart Mountain internment site in Wyoming, 
joining over 10,000 people whose loyalty was questioned by the U.S. 
Government based solely on their Japanese ancestry.
  Her mother Linda went on to become a teacher and administrator in the 
Denver public schools, my old school district. Her father Peter was a 
Mexican American who went from living in a railroad boxcar on the South 
Side of Chicago to earning a nomination for the NFL Hall of Fame.
  Education and hard work transformed her parents' lives, and Regina 
has always sought to live up to their example. Gina grew up in 
Gunnison, CO, but her family moved around the country because her dad 
coached football. She graduated with honors from the University of 
Iowa, which I know is not the only reason Chairman Grassley supported 
her nomination but probably was an important one, and then returned 
home to earn a J.D. from the University of Colorado Law School.
  After starting at a private firm in Denver, Gina joined the U.S. 
Attorney's Office. The Department of Justice noticed her talent, and 
she went to work for the Attorney General on alternative dispute 
resolution--a new approach at the time meant to avoid lengthy trials 
through arbitration and mediation. She helped to mainstream the 
approach for all U.S. attorneys, saving the government countless hours 
and taxpayers' countless dollars over the years.
  Gina's leadership in Washington earned her a promotion back in 
Denver, where she rose to become Chief of the Civil Division in the 
U.S. Attorney's Office. She was the first Latina to hold that position 
and quickly developed a stellar reputation among colleagues and judges.
  Today, she is one of the most respected trial lawyers in Colorado and 
has received reward after reward for her work.
  Her commitment to the community has been just as impressive. She is a 
founding board member of Colorado Youth at Risk, a nonprofit that helps 
kids stay on the right track. She served as one of Colorado's higher 
education commissioners and still serves on the board of Denver's 
highest performing charter school, the School of Science and Technology 
in my old district. Somehow, she finds time to mentor young lawyers 
from underrepresented communities.
  The evidence is overwhelming: Regina Rodriguez is an exceptional 
nominee with a distinguished career and commitment to service. She has 
blazed trails in Colorado and in Colorado law through the sheer force 
of her intellect, hard work, and character. Regina and her family are 
what we mean when we come to this floor and talk about the American 
dream.
  She has my full and enthusiastic support, and I want to thank my 
colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for advancing her nomination with 
overwhelming, bipartisan support. They saw what Colorado already knows, 
which is what an exceptional judge Gina would make, and I 
wholeheartedly agree. I urge my colleagues to come together and confirm

","Nomination of Regina M. Rodriguez   Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor today to share a few words about Regina Rodriguez, President Biden's nominee for the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. Gina's nomination comes to this floor with broad, well-earned support across the State of Colorado. My office has received a flood of letters on her behalf. All of them testify to her character, her hard work, and her commitment to service, justice, and the rule of law.  She learned all of it from her family. Her mom's family knew injustice firsthand. During the Second World War, they were relocated from California to the Heart Mountain internment site in Wyoming, joining over 10,000 people whose loyalty was questioned by the U.S. Government based solely on their Japanese ancestry.  Her mother Linda went on to become a teacher and administrator in the Denver public schools, my old school district. Her father Peter was a Mexican American who went from living in a railroad boxcar on the South Side of Chicago to earning a nomination for the NFL Hall of Fame.  Education and hard work transformed her parents' lives, and Regina has always sought to live up to their example. Gina grew up in Gunnison, CO, but her family moved around the country because her dad coached football. She graduated with honors from the University of Iowa, which I know is not the only reason Chairman Grassley supported her nomination but probably was an important one, and then returned home to earn a J.D. from the University of Colorado Law School.  After starting at a private firm in Denver, Gina joined the U.S. Attorney's Office. The Department of Justice noticed her talent, and she went to work for the Attorney General on alternative dispute resolution--a new approach at the time meant to avoid lengthy trials through arbitration and mediation. She helped to mainstream the approach for all U.S. attorneys, saving the government countless hours and taxpayers' countless dollars over the years.  Gina's leadership in Washington earned her a promotion back in Denver, where she rose to become Chief of the Civil Division in the U.S. Attorney's Office. She was the first Latina to hold that position and quickly developed a stellar reputation among colleagues and judges.  Today, she is one of the most respected trial lawyers in Colorado and has received reward after reward for her work.  Her commitment to the community has been just as impressive. She is a founding board member of Colorado Youth at Risk, a nonprofit that helps kids stay on the right track. She served as one of Colorado's higher education commissioners and still serves on the board of Denver's highest performing charter school, the School of Science and Technology in my old district. Somehow, she finds time to mentor young lawyers from underrepresented communities.  The evidence is overwhelming: Regina Rodriguez is an exceptional nominee with a distinguished career and commitment to service. She has blazed trails in Colorado and in Colorado law through the sheer force of her intellect, hard work, and character. Regina and her family are what we mean when we come to this floor and talk about the American dream.  She has my full and enthusiastic support, and I want to thank my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee for advancing her nomination with overwhelming, bipartisan support.

     Helping American Victims Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act

  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to applaud the swift, 
unanimous Senate passage last night of the Helping American Victims 
Afflicted by Neurological Attacks Act, or the HAVANA Act. This bill 
will provide much needed assistance to the employees of the 
Intelligence Community, the State Department, and other Federal 
Agencies who have suffered from often debilitating brain injuries at 
the hands of our foreign adversaries. Too often, these injured public 
servants have had to battle the bureaucracy to receive the medical care 
they desperately require.
  I am very pleased today to be joined on the Senate floor by the 
Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Warner. He has 
been relentless in his pursuit of care for these injured public 
servants who risk their lives for us, who serve in difficult and 
dangerous environments. Senator Warner and the vice chairman of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Rubio, and Senator Shaheen of 
New Hampshire worked with me to draft the bill that the Senate 
unanimously cleared last night.
  We are very pleased that the following Senators cosponsored our 
legislation: Senators Cornyn, Bennet, Burr, Gillibrand, Blunt, 
Heinrich, Sasse, Feinstein, Cotton, King, Risch, Durbin, Scott, 
Menendez, Blumenthal, and Hassan. I mentioned those cosponsors to show 
the breadth of concern in the Senate about these injured employees.
  For several years, American personnel serving our country in Cuba, 
China, and elsewhere have experienced unexplained, serious medical 
harm, including, in some cases, permanent brain injuries. Their 
conditions are believed to be the consequence of a mysterious, directed 
energy weapon used by an adversary.
  As we investigate the source of previous attacks and seek to prevent 
future ones, the bill that passed the Senate last night would provide 
additional medical care and financial compensation to Americans who 
continue to experience debilitating symptoms as a result of these 
heinous attacks.
  The injuries that many of these victims have endured are significant 
and life-altering. I have talked with many of these victims. They have 
described debilitating headaches, a loss of vision, a decreased ability 
to hear, dizziness, and many other symptoms as well, including a 
decline in their cognitive abilities. In some cases, they have been 
forced to medically retire. In other cases, they somehow continue on 
while coping with these symptoms.
  I have spoken several times to CIA Director Burns and the Director of 
National Intelligence, Haines, about these attacks, and I am heartened 
by the commitments that they have made to me and to other members of 
the Senate Intelligence Committee to care for the victims and to 
identify the perpetrators and the weapon used in these attacks.
  We can speculate. We have our suspicions. But the fact is, we do not 
know exactly what the weapon is nor who is wielding it. We need a 
whole-of-government approach to identify the adversary who is targeting 
our American personnel, and I am grateful to the chairman and vice 
chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, who I know are committed to 
getting to the bottom of these attacks.
  I hope, when President Biden meets with President Putin, that he will 
ask President Putin about these attacks, that he will grill him about 
them to see if the Russians are responsible. At this point, we don't 
know.
  The public servants who work in our embassies and consulates overseas 
make many personal sacrifices to represent America's interests. They 
deserve our unwavering support when they are harmed in the line of 
duty, just as we care for soldiers who are injured on the battlefield. 
Last night, we took an important step in that direction.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.
  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to echo what my good friend

[[Page S3973]]

and colleague, Senator Collins, has already said. Let me be clear. She 
pointed out the virtual unanimous support this legislation has from 
members of the Intelligence Committee--both sides. Let there be no 
mistake in terms of who was the relentless driver--some might even say 
``persistent-beyond-belief driver'' of this issue. It was Susan 
Collins, and, once again, her service shows that she is standing up for 
America's diplomats and the intel community serving our country around 
the world who, as Senator Collins already indicated, have been involved 
in dangerous incidents resulting in brain trauma and other unexplained 
illnesses. We have called it the Havana syndrome
  The remarkable thing is that for nearly 5 years, we have been aware 
of these reports, and we have seen, as the Senator mentioned, attacks 
on U.S. personnel in Cuba, in China, and around the world. We have 
these reports here in this country, and rather than disappearing or 
going down in number, they actually appear to be increasing.
  Five years after the start of this effort, we don't know what 
happened, we don't know who did it, and we don't know what kind of 
device was used.
  This is wrong. Particularly, I want to point out--this is an area 
where, again, we were in bipartisan agreement--that under the last 
administration, we just didn't treat these victims from the intel 
community, the State Department, and DOD with the seriousness they 
deserved.
  As chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know the 
hardships, sacrifices, and risks our intelligence officers, diplomats, 
and other personnel serving overseas endure--often anonymously, often 
without recognition.
  The fact that some of these brave women and men have been subjected 
to these serious health issues by unknown attackers is unacceptable. 
That their own government did not believe them when they were injured 
or denied them proper medical attention and care is beyond the pale. 
These are folks who were injured while serving our government and, in 
some cases, facing lifelong health consequences, and, for a while, we 
just got blown off. It is inexcusable that they were treated this way, 
and it is outrageous that we still don't know who did it or what tool 
was used in these attacks.
  Their country, after their service, needs to have their backs. With 
Senator Collins's legislation--now that it has passed the Senate, and 
our hope is that it will soon pass the House--we will show that the 
country will have their backs.
  I also want to give credit to the new CIA Director, Ambassador Burns, 
for making this a top priority. On the Senate Intelligence Committee, 
there is complete bipartisan unanimity on this issue. We are going to 
ensure that the United States gets to the bottom of this, identifies 
those responsible for those attacks on American personnel, holds them 
accountable, and ensures that these attacks on American personnel stop 
once and for all.
  Let me echo what Senator Collins said. This should be one in an ever 
growing list of topics that President Biden ought to raise with 
President Putin.
  We must protect our people around the globe. At the same time, it is 
more important than ever that the United States also provides those 
affected by these attacks with the medical and financial support they 
deserve. Again, that is why Senator Collins' legislation, the HAVANA 
Act, is so important.
  Let me echo again what Senator Collins said. My partner in this, as 
well, has been Vice Chairman Rubio, and our good friend Senator 
Shaheen. The fact that this passed this quickly, unanimously, is 
extraordinarily important, but it is just the first step in having the 
backs of our diplomats, our intel personnel, our DOD, and, for that 
matter, anyone who has been a victim of this kind of activity. Again, I 
want to thank Senator Collins for her leadership on this issue. I can 
assure you, as Senator Collins said and Senator Rubio and I have 
repeated a number of number of times, the Intelligence Committee of the 
Senate is going to get to the bottom of this. We are going to make 
sure--and we have taken a giant step on this by passing this 
legislation--that the personnel will get the medical and, if necessary, 
financial assistance they need; that we are going to find out who did 
it, we are going to find out what type of device, and we are going to 
hold them accountable.
  With that, I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.

                             Semiconductors

  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as we all know, in recent years, China 
has emerged as one of the greatest competitors to the world order. 
Unfortunately, they don't play by the same rules that the rest of the 
international community plays by. The Chinese Communist Party is 
increasingly aggressive and well-resourced and has made no secret of 
its intent to gain more influence and power.
  For everything from national security to economic policy, there is a 
clear and urgent need to reorient the way our country views and 
responds to the challenge from China. I am glad the Senate is taking up 
an important step today through the U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act. The cornerstone of this legislation, of course, is funding to 
bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing so the United States can 
compete with China and secure some of our most critical supply chains.
  Nearly 90 percent of the semiconductors made in the world are made by 
countries in Asia, with Taiwan dominating the market with about 63 
percent of that total of 90 percent. In fact, one company, Taiwan 
Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, accounted for more than half of 
the total foundry revenues last year. As I said, companies in Taiwan 
control 63 percent of the advanced semiconductor markets.
  If for any reason that supply chain was cut off, it would lead to 
very serious consequences across our entire economy. To address this, 
Senator Warner, the senior Senator from Virginia, and I introduced the 
CHIPS for America Act last year to shore up domestic semiconductor 
manufacturing and reduce our alliance on other countries for one of our 
most critical products. Semiconductors go into everything with an off 
and on switch.
  The United States is not the only country that spotted this blinking 
red light, this danger signal. Other countries have recognized the 
immense risks that exist, and they are also pouring billions of dollars 
into new foundries. The European Union, for example, is investing up to 
$35 billion, South Korea is investing $65 billion, and China is 
investing a whopping $150 billion in semiconductor manufacturing. Our 
competitors are pouring tens of billions of dollars into boosting their 
own supplies of these essential semiconductors, and the United States 
needs to keep up and compete.
  The vast majority of our colleagues agree that this was an important 
and critical task. It was carefully crafted in monthslong, bipartisan, 
bicameral negotiations, and, in fact, this legislation was adopted as 
an amendment to last year's Defense Authorization Act by a vote of 96 
to 4. Now, though, it falls to us to fund what we authorized in the 
Defense authorization bill, and there is just one issue standing in the 
way.
  During committee consideration of the Endless Frontier Act, an 
amendment was adopted that would apply controversial and unnecessary 
prevailing wage language to the CHIPS for America Act. The prevailing 
wage provision creates an obstacle to our funding the CHIPS for America 
Act, and it confers zero benefit on anybody because the manufacturing 
of semiconductors is a very sophisticated, well-paying business.
  Considering the current wages of U.S. semiconductor manufacturing 
companies, there is zero impact on workers' wages by requiring 
companies to pay an elevated, so-called prevailing wage. So it is 
really a nonissue. However, these Davis-Bacon provisions also represent 
an unprecedented expansion of a partisan labor policy, and applying 
them to private construction projects, as I said, sets a troublesome 
precedent.
  Leaving this language in the bill has the potential to dramatically 
weaken support for this essential broader legislation, and I hope we 
can all agree that the stakes are simply too high to let that happen. I 
have introduced an amendment to strike this unnecessary and divisive 
provision and to maintain the strong bipartisan support that the

[[Page S3974]]

CHIPS for America Act has earned so far. This partisan provision has no 
impact on workers' wages, and it should hardly be a reason to forfeit 
the strong bipartisan support the CHIPS Program has previously 
received.
  It is important that we send a clear and distinct and unequivocal 
message to our competitors and rivals in China. Republicans and 
Democrats have worked together to bolster domestic semiconductor 
manufacturing and to confront one of our biggest looming threats from 
China. Now is not the time to sacrifice the progress we made.
  I encourage our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this 
amendment so we can maintain the strong bipartisan support for this 
essential program

","Semiconductors   Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, as we all know, in recent years, China has emerged as one of the greatest competitors to the world order. Unfortunately, they don't play by the same rules that the rest of the international community plays by. The Chinese Communist Party is increasingly aggressive and well-resourced and has made no secret of its intent to gain more influence and power.  For everything from national security to economic policy, there is a clear and urgent need to reorient the way our country views and responds to the challenge from China. I am glad the Senate is taking up an important step today through the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. The cornerstone of this legislation, of course, is funding to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing so the United States can compete with China and secure some of our most critical supply chains.  Nearly 90 percent of the semiconductors made in the world are made by countries in Asia, with Taiwan dominating the market with about 63 percent of that total of 90 percent. In fact, one company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, accounted for more than half of the total foundry revenues last year. As I said, companies in Taiwan control 63 percent of the advanced semiconductor markets.  If for any reason that supply chain was cut off, it would lead to very serious consequences across our entire economy. To address this, Senator Warner, the senior Senator from Virginia, and I introduced the CHIPS for America Act last year to shore up domestic semiconductor manufacturing and reduce our alliance on other countries for one of our most critical products. Semiconductors go into everything with an off and on switch.  The United States is not the only country that spotted this blinking red light, this danger signal. Other countries have recognized the immense risks that exist, and they are also pouring billions of dollars into new foundries. The European Union, for example, is investing up to $35 billion, South Korea is investing $65 billion, and China is investing a whopping $150 billion in semiconductor manufacturing. Our competitors are pouring tens of billions of dollars into boosting their own supplies of these essential semiconductors, and the United States needs to keep up and compete.  The vast majority of our colleagues agree that this was an important and critical task. It was carefully crafted in monthslong, bipartisan, bicameral negotiations, and, in fact, this legislation was adopted as an amendment to last year's Defense Authorization Act by a vote of 96 to 4. Now, though, it falls to us to fund what we authorized in the Defense authorization bill, and there is just one issue standing in the way.

                              Coronavirus

  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, in January of 2020, when reports began 
to circulate about the coronavirus, I instructed my oversight and 
investigations staff to get a classified briefing from the Department 
of Health and Human Services' Office of National Security. Around that 
same time, I publicly said that there were signs that the virus could 
develop into a worldwide threat. I also noted at that time my concern 
that China may not be accurately reflecting the scale or scope of the 
problem and that China was failing to share information with global 
health organizations. Unfortunately, my concerns proved to be true.
  From the beginning, my goal has been to ensure a robust Federal 
response to the threat and to better understand the origins of the 
virus.
  Today, as we emerge from the pandemic, the focus has rightly shifted 
to understanding how the virus originated. We lost over 500,000 of our 
fellow Americans, and this body has spent trillions of dollars to 
support the U.S. economy during the pandemic.
  We the people have an absolute right to know everything that the U.S. 
Government knows about the origins of the coronavirus. On March 8, 
2021, I wrote to the Director of National Intelligence and the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services requesting all intelligence, 
among other requests, relating to what the government knows about the 
origin of the coronavirus. I received some intelligence product, and 
that product causes very serious concern and further supports my belief 
that the ongoing review of its origin can't leave any stone unturned. 
The effort must be a whole-of-government approach.
  In response to my letter, the National Institutes of Health, an 
Agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, stated that 
it hasn't funded gain-of-function research on the coronavirus. Recent 
reports have cast doubts on that position.
  Dr. Fauci's unit provided $3.4 million in taxpayer grants to a 
research organization called EcoHealth Alliance. That group then issued 
subgrants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It has been reported that 
from this $3.4 million, somewhere between $600,000 and $826,000 was 
sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That money, by the way, is 
U.S. taxpayer money. It was spent on researching bat coronaviruses.
  As the Wall Street Journal noted last week, it is likely that the 
Wuhan Institute of Virology was doing gain-of-function research. If 
true, that research could have strengthened the virus to the version 
that caused the global pandemic.
  Dr. Fauci has said that Chinese scientists are trustworthy, that ``we 
generally always trust the grantee to do what they say,'' and that ``I 
can't guarantee that a grantee hasn't lied to us because you never 
know.'' He also said, ``I can't guarantee everything that is going on 
in the Wuhan lab, we can't do that.'' What complete nonsense and a mess 
that it is.
  Well, Dr. Fauci, why can't you know what is going on inside the Wuhan 
plant if you are going to send taxpayers' money to do it? For crying 
out loud, be aggressive and be accountable.
  We know the Chinese Government can't be trusted. We know the Chinese 
Government is involved in risky and deadly viral research. We know that 
sending money to any entity affiliated with the Chinese Government is a 
risky proposition, which is why any sign of any taxpayer money sent to 
the Chinese Government should be subject to the most rigorous and 
comprehensive oversight.
  If Dr. Fauci and his team know that taxpayer money is going to the 
Chinese Government, what steps did he and they take to oversee how that 
money was used? Well, that question is exactly what I asked in my March 
8, 2021, letter to the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS 
failed to answer what, if any, oversight was done.
  In my followup letter to the Department of Health and Human Services 
on May 26 of this year, I stated the following:

       Your letter failed to describe the steps the Department of 
     Health and Human Services took to oversee the research done 
     at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in light of it being 
     funded by the taxpayer.

  The taxpayers expect the Federal Government to, at a minimum, know 
what their money is buying.
  Congress expects the Federal Government to perform aggressive 
oversight, especially when the funded research involves highly 
infectious and deadly viruses. Furthermore, if no oversight were 
performed, then that would call into question the government's 
confidence that no gain-of-function research was supported by 
taxpayers' dollars, because that is what I was told by the HHS.
  The people have a right to know what the government knows about the 
origins of the coronavirus. The people have a right to know if Dr. 
Fauci and other government officials were derelict in their duty to 
conduct oversight of the money that they knew would end up with the 
Communist Chinese Government.
  Dr. Fauci is constantly going on television to talk about anything 
that he wants to talk about. He should start talking about what, if 
any, oversight he did with respect to the taxpayers' money that he knew 
was going to the Communist Chinese Government.
  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my 
remarks before the vote starts.

                          Endless Frontier Act

  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I come to the floor, hopefully today 
will be the day we wrap up debate on the America Competes-Endless 
Frontier legislation now known as the USICA, United States Innovation 
and Competition Act of 2021. We come to talk about this now, primarily 
because we know that the research dollars invested today are going to 
decide the jobs of the future. And we know that we all believe a 
significant increase in the investment in research and development 
dollars will help us spur innovation, continue to help us compete, and 
continue to be competitive in key sectors of our economy that are so 
important to us.
  We know that we have been having this debate literally now for more 
than a decade, starting with President Bush's 2006 report saying 
America needed to invest more in the National Science Foundation. And 
at the time, I am pretty sure we thought we were in a track meet where 
our competitor was maybe half a lap behind us
  I am pretty sure now, as the decade has moved on, we are looking over 
our shoulder and realizing that the competition is gaining. So we need 
to make this investment in research and development to stay 
competitive, to grow jobs for tomorrow, and solve some of our most 
pressing problems, whether that is climate change, national security on 
cyber issues, or the advent and usage of artificial intelligence and 
what that will mean both for our opportunities and for our challenges.
  So we are making a renewed commitment to the National Science 
Foundation. I thank my colleagues again, Senator Schumer and Senator 
Young, for

[[Page S3975]]

their innovative legislation. They are telling us a couple of things. 
They are saying, one, invest more money in research and development, so 
this bill not only increases the NSF budget, it increases DOE's budget 
and increases the Defense Advanced Research Program Agency's funding as 
well by $17.5 billion.
  So it is saying, yes, basic research is still very important. But it 
is also saying, for the first time, we need to get more out of the 
research that we do, and we need to have more translational science, 
that is, taking the basic research and applied research and actually 
using the applications of that in a more robust way so that we can 
translate more of that into actual science and manufacturing.
  Why is this so important? Because we know that our competitiveness as 
a nation is suffering from the fact that people are looking at our own 
research and development. They are looking at our teachings and our 
publishing at universities and actually going and implementing this. So 
we need to do better on tech transfer.
  This underlying legislation not only helps us do that by helping to 
help universities who are our No. 1 research partner with Federal 
dollars, it allows those universities to help us with more tech 
transfer in innovative ways, that universities not just do the 
research, but help commercialize it. It also makes investments and 
helping them protect the patenting of that critical information, so no 
longer having that patentable information used in other places around 
the globe, but actually capitalizing on the jobs here in the United 
States.
  It also makes a huge investment in STEM, the science, technology, 
engineering, and math jobs that we need for the future. And clearly, 
you can't make a major investment in research and development if you 
don't have the workforce to carry it out. And we need a workforce to 
carry it out. So this underlying legislation helps us not only 
diversify our workforce by a major investment in STEM, going from an 
annual budget of about $1 billion in the year 2020 to about $4 billion 
a year by 2026. So we are going to get a more diversified STEM 
workforce with women and minorities participating.
  And we are also trying to distribute more of our engineering and 
science capacity around the United States. Our colleagues, Senators 
Schumer and Young, were adamant that we also look at innovation 
infrastructure happening in more regional places in the United States, 
where they may not currently have the R&D capability of some of our 
major institutions.
  So this legislation promises 20 percent of the research and 
investment dollars go to those EPSCoR states, Established Program to 
Stimulate Competitive Research, an already identified landmark in how 
we distribute research dollars, that tries to grow the regional 
research infrastructure in more places in the United States. Again, I 
thank my colleagues Senator Wicker for leading the charge on that and 
helping us make that investment. And it also triples the Manufacturing 
Extension Partnership Program, so that we get more out of manufacturing 
workforce training and resiliency of our supply chain for the future.
  As I mentioned before we left, it also includes an authorization for 
NASA and the Artemis mission and making sure that we are staying 
competitive. As Senator Nelson said in a House hearing on our mission 
and challenges, as China has made it clear, they are going to Mars, we 
are going back to the Moon to ready ourselves to go to Mars, and we 
think that it, too, deserves the funding and support to make us 
competitive.
  I think the bottom line here is that we know that American innovation 
drives the economy of the future. In a lot of ways, in passing this 
legislation today--and just so our colleagues know, we will have a 
couple of votes here before we get to a final passage--we really are 
doing our part.
  People hopefully will support this legislation enthusiastically, well 
past the majority of Members, because you believe in the history of the 
United States research and development that we have achieved innovation 
goals--whether that was what we did with the internet, whether that was 
what we have done on biosciences, even on some of our issues as it 
relates to energy. We have achieved big breakthroughs.
  So today's vote is about investing in that innovation economy of the 
future. I am pretty confident because I have met some of these 
innovators across the United States. I don't know if everything that we 
have done so far will be absorbed by universities, our researchers, and 
our labs, but literally, we are trying to dust off R&D skills and make 
them more competitive for today.
  I guarantee you, though, these dollars that reach American 
entrepreneurs, who reach American innovators, they are ready and 
willing to take up this challenge. Give them those collaborative 
research resources through innovation at universities, through tech 
hubs, through more collaboration on workforce training, through 
investments in semiconductors, and I guarantee you these entrepreneurs 
in America will innovate our economy and create the economies of the 
future.
  And what is at stake? If my colleagues have a better idea, I am 
willing to hear it. But I know this: Americans want us to lead on their 
regional economies, on the U.S. economies, and on global economies. 
They do not want to get left behind. They look at this time and era as 
a challenge to the leadership we have provided in the past.
  So settling for Federal investment being near their lowest point as a 
percentage of GDP in 60 years won't cut it. What cuts it is making an 
investment in R&D and empowering those entrepreneurs so they will 
create those future economies.
  I yield the floor.

But I know this: Americans want us to lead on their regional economies, on the U.S. economies, and on global economies. They do not want to get left behind. They look at this time and era as a challenge to the leadership we have provided in the past.  So settling for Federal investment being near their lowest point as a percentage of GDP in 60 years won't cut it. What cuts it is making an investment in R&D and empowering those entrepreneurs so they will create those future economies.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will 
resume legislative session to consider S. 1260, which the clerk will 
report.
  The bill clerk read as follows:

       A bill (S. 1260) to establish a new Directorate for 
     Technology and Innovation in the National Science Foundation, 
     to establish a regional technology hub program, to require a 
     strategy and report on economic security, science, research, 
     innovation, manufacturing, and job creation, to establish a 
     critical supply chain resiliency program, and for other 
     purposes.


[[Page S3976]]


  Pending:

       Schumer amendment No. 1502, in the nature of a substitute.
       Cornyn-Cotton amendment No. 1858 (to amendment No. 1502), 
     to modify the semiconductor incentives program of the 
     Department of Commerce.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 3 
minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to 
amendment No. 1858 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.
  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.


                           Amendment No. 1858

  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, during the committee markup on this bill 
in the Commerce Committee, there was an amendment offered that was 
accepted that added Davis-Bacon prevailing wage protection to the 
underlying bill, which is now in the bill before us.
  This is purely a gratuitous addition to this bill because the fact 
is, in constructing these major semiconductor fabs, they pay far 
greater than the prevailing wage. But perhaps the most dangerous part 
of this is the fact that this now is being applied to private 
construction.
  Davis-Bacon historically and statutorily has been applied only to 
public workers. But this is an unnecessary expansion and, frankly, 
jeopardizes some of the support we are getting for the underlying bill, 
which we cannot afford to lose any of that support in our competition 
against China, particularly when it comes to manufacturing 
semiconductors here onshore and shoring up the vulnerable supply chain.
  I would ask colleagues to vote for the amendment.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, construction is hard, dangerous work, 
and too often, when it comes to wages for workers, we see a race to the 
bottom, where workers and communities lose.
  Prevailing wage requirements, such as we have in this bill, help make 
sure that construction jobs created by the Federal Government come with 
a fair wage that supports our local community.
  Prevailing wage requirements have long had bipartisan support, 
including in this bill. This amendment would strip those protections 
for construction workers at the same time we need to help rebuild our 
country's infrastructure.
  The workers and the communities that build our bridges and our 
highways and other critical infrastructure deserve the protections and 
benefits prevailing wage provides.
  I urge my colleagues to oppose amendment No. 1858.


                       Vote on Amendment No. 1858

  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the 
amendment.
  Mr. CORNYN. I ask for the yeas and nays.

  There appears to be a sufficient second.

  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Florida.


                             Point of Order

  Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, there is clearly an urgent need 
for the United States to address the growing threat posed by Communist 
China. In so doing, we can't forget the commitment we all made to 
American taxpayers to be responsible stewards of their tax dollars.
  America is in a nearly $30 trillion debt crisis. We can't afford to 
spend more than $250 billion on a bill that doesn't pay for itself. 
Worse, it would add to our national yearly deficit in dramatic fashion, 
which is what triggers the point of order I am raising today.
  In 2018, we agreed not to pass spending bills without a way to pay 
for them, but there is no plan to pay for this. We are completely 
ignoring our own rules to advance this spending.
  Spending beyond our means has consequences. There will be a day of 
reckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502 to S. 1260, 
would violate the Senate pay-go rule by increasing the on-budget 
deficit. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure 
pursuant to section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71 to the concurrent 
resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.


 =========================== NOTE =========================== 

  
  On page S3976, June 8, 2021, second column, the following 
appears: There will be a day of reckoning. The pending measure, 
Senate amendment No. 1502 to amendment No. 1260, would violate the 
Senate pay-go.
  
  The online Record has been corrected to read: There will be a 
day of reckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502 
to S. 1260, would violate the Senate pay-go.


 ========================= END NOTE ========================= 


  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.


                            Motion to Waive

  Ms. CANTWELL. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act 
of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, and 
section 4(g)3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to 
waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget 
resolutions for the purposes of the pending measure, and I ask for the 
yeas and nays.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?
  There appears to be a sufficient second.
  The yeas and nays are ordered.
  The Senator from Washington.
  Ms. CANTWELL. If I could explain to my colleagues about this vote 
because it goes far beyond the simplicity of just the debate regarding 
the semiconductor chips and emergency appropriations.
  The way this point of order is drafted, basically, it would gut the 
bill. Basically, it not only guts the provisions related to the chips 
emergency appropriations, but it strikes the Foreign Relations 
Committee's work, it strikes the Homeland Security Committee's work, it 
strikes the Banking Committee's work, it effectively strikes the HELP 
Committee's work and the Judiciary's, and most importantly, the Finance 
Committee's work, which it was the entire Finance Committee's 
insistence that the GSP, the System of Preferences, be included in the 
bill.
  So all of those things that everybody wishes would be in the bill 
would no longer be in the bill, including the Department of Energy 
funding, the increase in STEM funding, and many other provisions.
  I ask my colleagues to waive the budget point of order. Vote yes, and 
let us move this legislation forward.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to 
waive.
  The yeas and nays were previously ordered.
  The clerk will call the roll.
  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.

                          and 1782 as Modified

  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we have been working for almost a month 
to review and vet hundreds of amendments filed by my colleagues on both 
sides. You maybe followed the floor debate here, where we agreed to 
numerous amendments and had discussions on many more--I think 20, to be 
exact.
  We had been working on a managers' package that was previously 
objected to before we left for the recess. Since then, we have been 
working diligently with our colleague Senator Wicker, on the Commerce 
Committee, to put forth a bipartisan package of amendments to improve 
the legislation. Many of these provisions have been great bipartisan 
efforts: Senators Ernst and Hassan's bipartisan amendment to improve 
transparency of the National Science Foundation grant funding; Senator 
Collins' amendment to require an update on implementation of the Energy 
Implementation Act; Senator Blackburn had a technical fix on studying 
the possible threats to our communications network and fiber optic 
transmission; Senator Warnock's amendment to clarify the definition of 
minority-serving institutions on STEM grants; Senator Cortez Masto 
worked on several bipartisan pieces of legislation to resolve issues on 
amendments dealing with critical minerals and recycling, something very 
important to us as a nation.
  So, in total, we have 42 amendments--23 led by Republicans, 19 led by 
Democrats--many of which, as I said, are bipartisan. These amendments 
would seek to improve the bill and accomplish Member priorities. And 
this is what happens when you negotiate on the Senate floor in regular 
order. You vote on amendments; you have some voice vote amendments; and 
you have a managers' package.
  So I hope our colleagues will consider giving our colleagues a chance 
to have their amendments that have been agreed to accepted into this 
package.
  So I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be agreed to 
en bloc: Collins 1583; Fischer 1637; Johnson 1701; Shaheen 1758; Rubio 
1777; Thune 1851; Wicker 1943; Hagerty 1958; Cotton 1964; Blunt 1988; 
Scott 2000; Ernst-Hassan 2017; Romney-Menendez 2025; Johnson 2048; 
Lujan 2082; Rosen 1768; Merkley 1823; Warnock 1980; Murray 1981; Hassan 
2001; Warren-Rubio 2104; Collins 1622; Wicker 1801; Leahy-Tillis 2093;

Cardin-Wicker, as modified, 1782.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?
  The Senator from Kentucky.
  Mr. PAUL. This bill adds over $250 billion to our debt. The 
additional debt will make us weaker, not stronger. As we speak, the 
massive Federal spending of the last 2 years is already causing 
inflation throughout the supply chain and eventually will lead to 
economic stagnation.
  There is nothing conservative about this bill. The bill is nothing 
more than a Big Government response that will make our country weaker, 
not stronger. I object.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I do believe our colleagues have worked 
hard to have their legislation considered. I want them to know I am 
going to continue to promulgate these ideas about competitiveness.
  You know, I had a chance to fly home, and for me it is a long way. It 
is 5\1/2\ hours so you get a lot of reading done. And I read Chris 
Wallace's new book about 1945 and the number of days that our Nation 
had to respond to the threat of war, what it took them to go out and 
develop the Manhattan Project, to get them to go and not only in my 
State, develop the Hanford site--Los Alamos developed that--and not 
only that, developed what happened at Oak Ridge and a scientific 
response to make our Nation more secure. All we are asking for here is 
a little R&D dollars. So I can tell you that I wish we would find a 
Leslie Groves of today because those are the people who responded to 
our Nation when we needed to respond in a competitive fashion.
  I am so sorry that our colleagues' amendments are not going to be 
considered, but if my colleague's underlying premise is that you don't 
want to respond to the competitive threats to our Nation, you have a 
right to vote no. But holding up our colleagues' good work, I think, is 
a mistake.
  I will commit to our colleagues that these important things on 
critical minerals, on transparency, and on moving forward on science, 
we will continue to work with you.
  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I think now we have a vote on the 
substitute amendment.

  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read 
the third time
  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, China announced that it would 
now allow families to have three children--a profound shift from their 
previous one- and two-child policies.
  Why the change? China looked to the future and realized that its 
population policies would hamper economic growth. Now, the U.S. 
Government will never tell families how many children to have. That 
choice is profoundly personal. Yet we must ask ourselves the same 
questions China is asking: What kind of changes will lead or deter the 
United States from a future of economic growth and prosperity? How can 
we enhance America's competitiveness? And more than just compete, how 
can we make sure America comes in first?

[[Page S3978]]

  The answer is obvious: Invest in American creativity. China is 
investing heavily in electric vehicles, critical minerals, energy 
production, computer chips--the list goes on. In all of these areas, 
China is beginning to pull ahead of the pack. They are aiming for 
first.
  And what underscores all of their efforts? Research. Every 
breakthrough, every new technology, every scientific step forward opens 
new markets and drives their economy into the future at high speed.
  Unfortunately, it is a different story in America. For decades, in 
both the public and private sectors, we have downsized our discovery 
and innovation investments. Since the days of the space race, we have 
stepped away from the great challenge of discovery. If we were to 
commit the same percentage of our national budget to research today as 
we did in the Apollo era, we would invest $900 billion over 5 years. 
That kind of an investment puts people on the Moon. That kind of 
investment puts us in first.
  So how do we get there? The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act would 
set us back on track and at a fraction of the cost of Apollo-era 
spending. As we debate and hopefully pass this bill, we must keep 
asking: What are we willing to do to be No. 1?
  One important way we can compete with countries like China is by 
increasing support for domestic manufacturing and strengthening our 
domestic supply chains. The legislation before us does exactly that. It 
provides $52 billion in emergency funding to boost our domestic 
semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. In 1990, the United States 
produced 37 percent of the world's semiconductors, but today, just 12 
percent of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States. Now, 
we are facing a global shortage of microchips, which is impacting jobs 
in my State and many others.
  I am proud that Illinois has long been a leader in auto 
manufacturing, thanks to dedicated workers like those at a Stellantis 
plant in Belvidere, IL, who assemble Jeep Cherokees. Unfortunately, 
that plant was forced to shut down in March due to the global shortage 
of semiconductors. And last month, Stellantis announced that as many as 
1,640 employees at the plant could be laid off in July--again, because 
it does not have enough microchips. After briefly resuming operations 
last week, the plant already has had to shut down again for 2 weeks 
because of this shortage. Last week, I spoke to representatives from 
Stellantis who shared that the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act 
could make a real difference in terms of boosting supply of these 
chips.
  This funding is not just important for the assembly plant in 
Belvidere. Sadly, we are seeing similar impacts of the semiconductor 
shortage at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, which supports 5,800 jobs. 
That plant was idled through April, with shutdowns extended into May.
  We urgently need to act to address this global microchip shortage to 
provide certainty to the workers whose livelihoods depend on a stable 
supply of semiconductors. The legislation before us will not only 
address our immediate market needs but it will also help prevent these 
shortages again the future. This investment supports jobs across the 
entire supply chain, from construction of new facilities, to 
manufacturing and development of chips, to workers in the auto industry 
who depend on a reliable supply of semiconductors, to American 
consumers.
  The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is the result of weeks of 
negotiation and bipartisan work. I was puzzled by some of my Republican 
colleagues' arguments for voting against cloture on this bill. If you 
don't want China's products and values to dominate the global 
marketplace, why would you cede that marketplace to China--or anyone 
else, for that matter? If you believe in America's products, values, 
and most of all, its people, then do the smart thing: Invest in them. 
Although some of my colleagues seem to believe otherwise, invective 
isn't going to win this global competition. We need investment to 
remain No. 1.
  No one bill will secure America's economic prosperity or national 
security or resolve all of the outstanding issues in our relationship 
with China, but strengthening America's role as a global leader in 
science and technology is an essential piece of our effort to 
preserving American leadership in this world. So I put it to my fellow 
Senators: Let's take a step forward today. Let's invest in the 
research, the jobs, and the future that all Americans deserve. I plan 
to vote in favor of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same.
  Let's not settle for second best. Let's put America in the lead.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that myself, 
Senator Cantwell, Senator Wicker, Senator Young, and Senator Schumer be 
allowed to speak before the vote.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?
  Without objection, it is so ordered.
  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I just wanted to take a moment to thank, 
obviously, my colleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator Young, for their 
hard work on this legislation and thank my counterpart, Senator Wicker, 
for his tremendous effort in moving this bill.
  We have now been on this bill, and we reported it out May 12. I think 
it came on the calendar May 13, and, literally, we have been working on 
it since. So this is a very hard effort to produce something very 
important to today's economy. So I want to thank Senator Schumer's 
staff, Mike Lynch, Meghan Taira, Gerry Petrella; and John Keast, 
Crystal Tully, Steven Wall, James Mazol, Cheri Pascoe of Senator 
Wicker's office.
  On my team, David Strickland, Melissa Porter, and Mary Guenther. But, 
specifically, I want to thank Richard-Duane Chambers, who came to the 
Senate from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, I think, 
maybe like a week before we started working on this bill. So, 
literally, since he joined the Senate Commerce Committee, he has been 
just knee-deep in the conversation of dusting off our R&D for the 
Nation, making a new investment, making more translational science. So 
I really appreciate Richard-Duane's effort.
  I also want to thank Gigi Slais, Shawn Bone, John Branscome, Ronce 
Almond, Alex Simpson, Jared Bomberg, Shannon Smith, John Beezer, Noam 
Kantor, Tiffany George, Jordan Blue, Kara Fischer, Nikky Teutschel, 
Matthew Bobbink, Caitlin Warner, Alex Kiles, George Greenwell, Elle 
Wibisono, Alexis Gutierrez, Eric Vryheid, Brian McDermott, Lucy Koch, 
Hunter Blackburn, and Alex Hall. So all of these people.
  I think my colleagues know that these bills don't come about easily. 
They come through a lot of hard work. And we thank everybody for 
participating in a regular order process out here on the Senate floor 
to produce a bipartisan result for something so important to our 
Nation's competitiveness.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.
  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I certainly rise in support of this 
legislation and urge a ``yes'' vote. This is an opportunity for the 
United States to strike a blow on behalf of answering the unfair 
competition that we are seeing from Communist China, and it is an 
opportunity to have a game changer in terms of geographic diversity in 
our research effort.
  This morning, the Armed Services Committee heard extensive testimony 
about the need to compete with China at the military level. This is an 
opportunity to compete with China at the research level. This bill will 
strengthen our country's innovation in key technology fields of the 
future--in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum 
computing, and communications.
  And this bill also is a game changer in terms of giving universities 
all over the United States an opportunity to participate in game-
changing research, which will help us compete. Universities, largely in 
smaller States such as mine, have been left behind in the past. They 
will finally, under this legislation, have an opportunity to 
participate in research at a meaningful level--so two good reasons to 
vote yes.
  The distinguished chair of the committee has been gracious in 
thanking all of our staffs on the majority and the minority side. I 
appreciate her doing that, as well as Senator Cantwell's admirable job 
of managing this bill through the committee.
  I congratulate the two authors of this bill, Senator Schumer and 
Senator

[[Page S3979]]

Young, who sponsored this legislation. This bill is headed toward 
passage with a fine bipartisan vote, and I am pleased to support 
passage.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.
  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues: 
Senator Schumer, Senator Wicker, and Senator Cantwell. All showed 
exceptional leadership over the course of drafting this legislation and 
ensuring that it made it through the process.
  I also want to thank members of my team: Lauren O'Brien, my 
legislative director; Brandt Anderson, my national security adviser; 
Dan Cheever; Nancy Martinez, on my ledge staff. They went above and 
beyond.
  So this piece of legislation, yes, it, indeed, is related to 
countering the threat that the Chinese Communist Party presents to this 
country. But it also is a piece of legislation that we are considering 
at a time when so many of our citizens feel overlooked, when the 
intimate communities that they call home feel hollowed out, when trust 
in our civic institutions is eroding, and when allegiance seems 
increasingly to our political tribes and not to one another on behalf 
of the common good.

  So let's not kid ourselves. The Chinese Communist Party aims to 
exploit all of these divisions. They aim to exploit the insecurities of 
the global age. They aim to ensure that their power and their 
capabilities continue to grow. And they are, indeed, locked in a global 
competition with the United States of America and with our partners and 
allies.
  So let's do what we have always done as Americans in times like this. 
Let's come together, and let's use this as an opportunity to become a 
better version of ourselves.
  I will end with this. When generation after generation of immigrants 
have come into the New York Harbor, they have seen that beautiful 
Statue of Liberty. And at the base of the Statue of Liberty is a 
sonnet, and everyone here in this Chamber and so many across America 
are familiar with the words of that sonnet: ``Give me your tired, your 
poor, your huddled masses . . . ''
  There is also a line in there that I particularly love about 
``imprisoned lightning''--``imprisoned lightning.'' I am not sure what 
Emma Lazarus meant by the phrase ``imprisoned lightning,'' but to me 
that ``imprisoned lightning'' refers to the untapped potential, the 
God-given potential of every human being. And this legislation, the 
Endless Frontier Act, aims to tap into that ``imprisoned lightning'' of 
people across the heartland to ensure that they can stay part of the 
economic game in the 21st century and that they help us outcompete, 
outinnovate, and outgrow the Chinese Communist Party. We will win. We 
are going to get a great vote today, and I thank all of my colleagues 
for their intention to support this legislation.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I, too, would like to thank 
Senators Cantwell and Wicker for an amazing, bipartisan job; and 
Senators Menendez and Risch, another great bipartisan contribution. All 
the Members--just about every Member has contributed to this bill.
  I do want to single out two of my staff members who just slaved over 
this bill relentlessly, and that is Mike Kuiken and Jon Cardinal. Mike 
is there. I don't know if Jon is here. But they deserve tremendous 
kudos for what they did. Without them I don't think we would have had a 
bill, to be honest with you--and everybody else, all the other staffs 
who worked so hard.
  Now, this is a quote from Dr. Vannevar Bush: ``Without scientific 
progress, no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our 
health, prosperity, and security in the modern world.''
  That was Dr. Vannevar Bush, the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific 
Research, writing in 1945. His report to President Truman was titled: 
``Science--The Endless Frontier''--an inspiration to the legislation we 
considered today.
  In the wake of Dr. Bush's report, we created the National Science 
Foundation. We funded the National Laboratories. We split the atom. We 
spliced the gene. We landed a man on the Moon. We unleashed the 
internet. We generated 75 years of American prosperity and fostered an 
innate sense of optimism in the American spirit.
  We face a challenge now--in this century--to replicate the success of 
the previous one. But the Federal Government's commitment to science, 
unfortunately, has waned. As a percentage of GDP, we spend less than 
half as much as the Chinese Communist Party on basic research.
  We rely on foreign nations to supply critical technologies that we 
invented, like semiconductors. That sunny American optimism has 
flickered as well.
  The world is more competitive now than at any time since the end of 
the Second World War. If we do nothing, our days as the dominant 
superpower may be ending.
  We don't mean to let those days end on our watch. We don't mean to 
see America become a middling nation in this century. We mean for 
America to lead it. Passing this bill--now called the U.S. Innovation 
and Competition Act--is the moment when the Senate lays the foundation 
for another century of American leadership.
  Let me say that again. This bill could be the turning point for 
American leadership in the 21st century, and for that reason, this 
legislation will go down as one of the most significant bipartisan 
achievements of the U.S. Senate in recent history.
  Around the globe, authoritarian governments believe that squabbling 
democracies like ours can't unite around national priorities. They 
believe that democracy itself is a relic of the past and that by 
beating us to emerging technologies, they--many of the meritocracies--
will be able to reshape the world in their own image.
  Well, let me tell you something. I believe they are wrong. I believe 
that this legislation will enable the United States to outinnovate, 
outproduce, and outcompete the world in the industries of the future. I 
believe that the strongly bipartisan work on this bill has revealed 
that in this Chamber, we all believe that another American century lies 
on the horizon. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.

  I yield the floor.

                          ____________________


","LEGISLATIVE SESSION                                   ______                                                         ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT--Resumed   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will resume legislative session to consider S. 1260, which the clerk will report.  The bill clerk read as follows:         A bill (S. 1260) to establish a new Directorate for       Technology and Innovation in the National Science Foundation,       to establish a regional technology hub program, to require a       strategy and report on economic security, science, research,       innovation, manufacturing, and job creation, to establish a       critical supply chain resiliency program, and for other       purposes.     Pending:         Schumer amendment No. 1502, in the nature of a substitute.        Cornyn-Cotton amendment No. 1858 (to amendment No. 1502),       to modify the semiconductor incentives program of the       Department of Commerce.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 3 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1858 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.                              Amendment No. 1858   Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, during the committee markup on this bill in the Commerce Committee, there was an amendment offered that was accepted that added Davis-Bacon prevailing wage protection to the underlying bill, which is now in the bill before us.  This is purely a gratuitous addition to this bill because the fact is, in constructing these major semiconductor fabs, they pay far greater than the prevailing wage. But perhaps the most dangerous part of this is the fact that this now is being applied to private construction.  Davis-Bacon historically and statutorily has been applied only to public workers. But this is an unnecessary expansion and, frankly, jeopardizes some of the support we are getting for the underlying bill, which we cannot afford to lose any of that support in our competition against China, particularly when it comes to manufacturing semiconductors here onshore and shoring up the vulnerable supply chain.  I would ask colleagues to vote for the amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, construction is hard, dangerous work, and too often, when it comes to wages for workers, we see a race to the bottom, where workers and communities lose.  Prevailing wage requirements, such as we have in this bill, help make sure that construction jobs created by the Federal Government come with a fair wage that supports our local community.  Prevailing wage requirements have long had bipartisan support, including in this bill. This amendment would strip those protections for construction workers at the same time we need to help rebuild our country's infrastructure.  The workers and the communities that build our bridges and our highways and other critical infrastructure deserve the protections and benefits prevailing wage provides.  I urge my colleagues to oppose amendment No. 1858.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1858   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the amendment.  Mr. CORNYN.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murphy). The Senator from Florida.                                Point of Order   Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, there is clearly an urgent need for the United States to address the growing threat posed by Communist China. In so doing, we can't forget the commitment we all made to American taxpayers to be responsible stewards of their tax dollars.  America is in a nearly $30 trillion debt crisis. We can't afford to spend more than $250 billion on a bill that doesn't pay for itself. Worse, it would add to our national yearly deficit in dramatic fashion, which is what triggers the point of order I am raising today.  In 2018, we agreed not to pass spending bills without a way to pay for them, but there is no plan to pay for this. We are completely ignoring our own rules to advance this spending.  Spending beyond our means has consequences. There will be a day of reckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502 to S. 1260, would violate the Senate pay-go rule by increasing the on-budget deficit. Therefore, I raise a point of order against this measure pursuant to section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71 to the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018.    =========================== NOTE ===========================       On page S3976, June 8, 2021, second column, the following appears: There will be a day of reckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502 to amendment No. 1260, would violate the Senate pay-go.     The online Record has been corrected to read: There will be a day of reckoning. The pending measure, Senate amendment No. 1502 to S. 1260, would violate the Senate pay-go.    ========================= END NOTE =========================     The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.                               Motion to Waive   Ms. CANTWELL. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the waiver provisions of applicable budget resolutions, and section 4(g)3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of those acts and applicable budget resolutions for the purposes of the pending measure, and I ask for the yeas and nays.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?  There appears to be a sufficient second.  The yeas and nays are ordered.  The Senator from Washington.  Ms. CANTWELL. If I could explain to my colleagues about this vote because it goes far beyond the simplicity of just the debate regarding the semiconductor chips and emergency appropriations.  The way this point of order is drafted, basically, it would gut the bill. Basically, it not only guts the provisions related to the chips emergency appropriations, but it strikes the Foreign Relations Committee's work, it strikes the Homeland Security Committee's work, it strikes the Banking Committee's work, it effectively strikes the HELP Committee's work and the Judiciary's, and most importantly, the Finance Committee's work, which it was the entire Finance Committee's insistence that the GSP, the System of Preferences, be included in the bill.  So all of those things that everybody wishes would be in the bill would no longer be in the bill, including the Department of Energy funding, the increase in STEM funding, and many other provisions.  I ask my colleagues to waive the budget point of order. Vote yes, and let us move this legislation forward.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive.  The yeas and nays were previously ordered.  The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 72, nays 28, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 224 Leg.]                                  YEAS--72       Baldwin      Bennet      Blackburn      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Brown      Burr      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Crapo      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Graham      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      Menendez      Merkley      Moran      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Rubio      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Thune      Tillis      Van Hollen      Warner        Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--28       Barrasso      Boozman      Braun      Cassidy      Cotton      Cramer      Cruz      Daines      Ernst      Fischer      Grassley      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      McConnell      Paul      Sanders      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Toomey      Tuberville  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Markey). On this vote, the yeas are 72, the nays are 28.  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to, and the point of order falls.  The Senator from Washington.  Unanimous Consent Request--Amendment Nos. 1583, 1637, 1701, 1758, 1777, 1851, 1943, 1958, 1964, 1988, 2000, 2017, 2025, 2048, 2082, 1768, 1823, 1980, 1981, 2001, 2104, 1622, 1801, 2093, 2049, 2085, 2083, 1945, 2026, 1933, 1841, 2103, 2105, 2113, 2094, 2106, 2090, 2101, 2112, 1905, 2081,                            and 1782 as Modified   Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, we have been working for almost a month to review and vet hundreds of amendments filed by my colleagues on both sides. You maybe followed the floor debate here, where we agreed to numerous amendments and had discussions on many more--I think 20, to be exact.  We had been working on a managers' package that was previously objected to before we left for the recess. Since then, we have been working diligently with our colleague Senator Wicker, on the Commerce Committee, to put forth a bipartisan package of amendments to improve the legislation. Many of these provisions have been great bipartisan efforts: Senators Ernst and Hassan's bipartisan amendment to improve transparency of the National Science Foundation grant funding; Senator Collins' amendment to require an update on implementation of the Energy Implementation Act; Senator Blackburn had a technical fix on studying the possible threats to our communications network and fiber optic transmission; Senator Warnock's amendment to clarify the definition of minority-serving institutions on STEM grants; Senator Cortez Masto worked on several bipartisan pieces of legislation to resolve issues on amendments dealing with critical minerals and recycling, something very important to us as a nation.  So, in total, we have 42 amendments--23 led by Republicans, 19 led by Democrats--many of which, as I said, are bipartisan. These amendments would seek to improve the bill and accomplish Member priorities. And this is what happens when you negotiate on the Senate floor in regular order. You vote on amendments; you have some voice vote amendments; and you have a managers' package.  So I hope our colleagues will consider giving our colleagues a chance to have their amendments that have been agreed to accepted into this package.  So I ask unanimous consent that the following amendments be agreed to en bloc: Collins 1583; Fischer 1637; Johnson 1701; Shaheen 1758; Rubio 1777; Thune 1851; Wicker 1943; Hagerty 1958; Cotton 1964; Blunt 1988; Scott 2000; Ernst-Hassan 2017; Romney-Menendez 2025; Johnson 2048; Lujan 2082; Rosen 1768; Merkley 1823; Warnock 1980; Murray 1981; Hassan 2001; Warren-Rubio 2104; Collins 1622; Wicker 1801; Leahy-Tillis 2093; Van Hollen-Tillis 2049; Blackburn 2085; Cortez Masto 2083, which includes language from Senator Durbin; Lankford 1945; Baldwin-Braun 2026; Hyde-Smith 1933; Hyde-Smith 1841; Merkley-Rubio-Romney 2103; Ossoff 2105; Kennedy 2113; Barrasso 2094; Rubio 2106; Kaine 2090; Barrasso-Cardin 2101; Peters 2112; Cantwell 1905; Baldwin 2081; and Cardin-Wicker, as modified, 1782.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?  The Senator from Kentucky.  Mr. PAUL. This bill adds over $250 billion to our debt. The additional debt will make us weaker, not stronger. As we speak, the massive Federal spending of the last 2 years is already causing inflation throughout the supply chain and eventually will lead to economic stagnation.  There is nothing conservative about this bill. The bill is nothing more than a Big Government response that will make our country weaker, not stronger. I object.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I do believe our colleagues have worked hard to have their legislation considered. I want them to know I am going to continue to promulgate these ideas about competitiveness.  You know, I had a chance to fly home, and for me it is a long way. It is 5\1/2\ hours so you get a lot of reading done. And I read Chris Wallace's new book about 1945 and the number of days that our Nation had to respond to the threat of war, what it took them to go out and develop the Manhattan Project, to get them to go and not only in my State, develop the Hanford site--Los Alamos developed that--and not only that, developed what happened at Oak Ridge and a scientific response to make our Nation more secure. All we are asking for here is a little R&D dollars. So I can tell you that I wish we would find a Leslie Groves of today because those are the people who responded to our Nation when we needed to respond in a competitive fashion.  I am so sorry that our colleagues' amendments are not going to be considered, but if my colleague's underlying premise is that you don't want to respond to the competitive threats to our Nation, you have a right to vote no. But holding up our colleagues' good work, I think, is a mistake.  I will commit to our colleagues that these important things on critical minerals, on transparency, and on moving forward on science, we will continue to work with you.  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I think now we have a vote on the substitute amendment.                    Vote on Amendment No. 1502, as Amended   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1502, as amended.  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?  There appears to be a sufficient second.  The clerk will call the roll.  The legislative clerk called the roll.  The result was announced--yeas 68, nays 32, as follows:                        [Rollcall Vote No. 225 Leg.]                                  YEAS--68       Baldwin      Bennet      Blumenthal      Blunt      Booker      Brown      Cantwell      Capito      Cardin      Carper      Casey      Collins      Coons      Cornyn      Cortez Masto      Crapo      Daines      Duckworth      Durbin      Feinstein      Gillibrand      Graham      Grassley      Hassan      Heinrich      Hickenlooper      Hirono      Kaine      Kelly      King      Klobuchar      Leahy      Lujan      Manchin      Markey      McConnell      Menendez      Merkley      Murkowski      Murphy      Murray      Ossoff      Padilla      Peters      Portman      Reed      Risch      Romney      Rosen      Rounds      Sasse      Schatz      Schumer      Shaheen      Sinema      Smith      Stabenow      Sullivan      Tester      Tillis      Van Hollen      Warner      Warnock      Warren      Whitehouse      Wicker      Wyden      Young                                  NAYS--32       Barrasso      Blackburn      Boozman      Braun      Burr      Cassidy      Cotton      Cramer      Cruz      Ernst      Fischer      Hagerty      Hawley      Hoeven      Hyde-Smith      Inhofe      Johnson      Kennedy      Lankford      Lee      Lummis      Marshall      Moran      Paul      Rubio      Sanders      Scott (FL)      Scott (SC)      Shelby      Thune      Toomey      Tuberville  The amendment (No. 1502), in the nature of a substitute, as amended, was agreed to.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the cloture motion is withdrawn.  The clerk will read the title of the bill for the third time.  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read the third time  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last week, China announced that it would now allow families to have three children--a profound shift from their previous one- and two-child policies.  Why the change? China looked to the future and realized that its population policies would hamper economic growth. Now, the U.S. Government will never tell families how many children to have. That choice is profoundly personal. Yet we must ask ourselves the same questions China is asking: What kind of changes will lead or deter the United States from a future of economic growth and prosperity? How can we enhance America's competitiveness? And more than just compete, how can we make sure America comes in first?   The answer is obvious: Invest in American creativity. China is investing heavily in electric vehicles, critical minerals, energy production, computer chips--the list goes on. In all of these areas, China is beginning to pull ahead of the pack. They are aiming for first.  And what underscores all of their efforts? Research. Every breakthrough, every new technology, every scientific step forward opens new markets and drives their economy into the future at high speed.  Unfortunately, it is a different story in America. For decades, in both the public and private sectors, we have downsized our discovery and innovation investments. Since the days of the space race, we have stepped away from the great challenge of discovery. If we were to commit the same percentage of our national budget to research today as we did in the Apollo era, we would invest $900 billion over 5 years. That kind of an investment puts people on the Moon. That kind of investment puts us in first.  So how do we get there? The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act would set us back on track and at a fraction of the cost of Apollo-era spending. As we debate and hopefully pass this bill, we must keep asking: What are we willing to do to be No. 1?  One important way we can compete with countries like China is by increasing support for domestic manufacturing and strengthening our domestic supply chains. The legislation before us does exactly that. It provides $52 billion in emergency funding to boost our domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. In 1990, the United States produced 37 percent of the world's semiconductors, but today, just 12 percent of semiconductors are manufactured in the United States. Now, we are facing a global shortage of microchips, which is impacting jobs in my State and many others.  I am proud that Illinois has long been a leader in auto manufacturing, thanks to dedicated workers like those at a Stellantis plant in Belvidere, IL, who assemble Jeep Cherokees. Unfortunately, that plant was forced to shut down in March due to the global shortage of semiconductors. And last month, Stellantis announced that as many as 1,640 employees at the plant could be laid off in July--again, because it does not have enough microchips. After briefly resuming operations last week, the plant already has had to shut down again for 2 weeks because of this shortage. Last week, I spoke to representatives from Stellantis who shared that the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act could make a real difference in terms of boosting supply of these chips.  This funding is not just important for the assembly plant in Belvidere. Sadly, we are seeing similar impacts of the semiconductor shortage at Ford's Chicago Assembly Plant, which supports 5,800 jobs. That plant was idled through April, with shutdowns extended into May.  We urgently need to act to address this global microchip shortage to provide certainty to the workers whose livelihoods depend on a stable supply of semiconductors. The legislation before us will not only address our immediate market needs but it will also help prevent these shortages again the future. This investment supports jobs across the entire supply chain, from construction of new facilities, to manufacturing and development of chips, to workers in the auto industry who depend on a reliable supply of semiconductors, to American consumers.  The U.S. Innovation and Competition Act is the result of weeks of negotiation and bipartisan work. I was puzzled by some of my Republican colleagues' arguments for voting against cloture on this bill. If you don't want China's products and values to dominate the global marketplace, why would you cede that marketplace to China--or anyone else, for that matter? If you believe in America's products, values, and most of all, its people, then do the smart thing: Invest in them. Although some of my colleagues seem to believe otherwise, invective isn't going to win this global competition. We need investment to remain No. 1.  No one bill will secure America's economic prosperity or national security or resolve all of the outstanding issues in our relationship with China, but strengthening America's role as a global leader in science and technology is an essential piece of our effort to preserving American leadership in this world. So I put it to my fellow Senators: Let's take a step forward today. Let's invest in the research, the jobs, and the future that all Americans deserve. I plan to vote in favor of the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  Let's not settle for second best. Let's put America in the lead.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that myself, Senator Cantwell, Senator Wicker, Senator Young, and Senator Schumer be allowed to speak before the vote.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?  Without objection, it is so ordered.  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I just wanted to take a moment to thank, obviously, my colleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator Young, for their hard work on this legislation and thank my counterpart, Senator Wicker, for his tremendous effort in moving this bill.  We have now been on this bill, and we reported it out May 12. I think it came on the calendar May 13, and, literally, we have been working on it since. So this is a very hard effort to produce something very important to today's economy. So I want to thank Senator Schumer's staff, Mike Lynch, Meghan Taira, Gerry Petrella; and John Keast, Crystal Tully, Steven Wall, James Mazol, Cheri Pascoe of Senator Wicker's office.  On my team, David Strickland, Melissa Porter, and Mary Guenther. But, specifically, I want to thank Richard-Duane Chambers, who came to the Senate from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, I think, maybe like a week before we started working on this bill. So, literally, since he joined the Senate Commerce Committee, he has been just knee-deep in the conversation of dusting off our R&D for the Nation, making a new investment, making more translational science. So I really appreciate Richard-Duane's effort.  I also want to thank Gigi Slais, Shawn Bone, John Branscome, Ronce Almond, Alex Simpson, Jared Bomberg, Shannon Smith, John Beezer, Noam Kantor, Tiffany George, Jordan Blue, Kara Fischer, Nikky Teutschel, Matthew Bobbink, Caitlin Warner, Alex Kiles, George Greenwell, Elle Wibisono, Alexis Gutierrez, Eric Vryheid, Brian McDermott, Lucy Koch, Hunter Blackburn, and Alex Hall. So all of these people.  I think my colleagues know that these bills don't come about easily. They come through a lot of hard work. And we thank everybody for participating in a regular order process out here on the Senate floor to produce a bipartisan result for something so important to our Nation's competitiveness.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I certainly rise in support of this legislation and urge a ``yes'' vote. This is an opportunity for the United States to strike a blow on behalf of answering the unfair competition that we are seeing from Communist China, and it is an opportunity to have a game changer in terms of geographic diversity in our research effort.  This morning, the Armed Services Committee heard extensive testimony about the need to compete with China at the military level. This is an opportunity to compete with China at the research level. This bill will strengthen our country's innovation in key technology fields of the future--in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing, and communications.  And this bill also is a game changer in terms of giving universities all over the United States an opportunity to participate in game-changing research, which will help us compete. Universities, largely in smaller States such as mine, have been left behind in the past. They will finally, under this legislation, have an opportunity to participate in research at a meaningful level--so two good reasons to vote yes.  The distinguished chair of the committee has been gracious in thanking all of our staffs on the majority and the minority side. I appreciate her doing that, as well as Senator Cantwell's admirable job of managing this bill through the committee.  I congratulate the two authors of this bill, Senator Schumer and Senator Young, who sponsored this legislation. This bill is headed toward passage with a fine bipartisan vote, and I am pleased to support passage.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.  Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I want to begin by thanking my colleagues: Senator Schumer, Senator Wicker, and Senator Cantwell. All showed exceptional leadership over the course of drafting this legislation and ensuring that it made it through the process.  I also want to thank members of my team: Lauren O'Brien, my legislative director; Brandt Anderson, my national security adviser; Dan Cheever; Nancy Martinez, on my ledge staff. They went above and beyond.  So this piece of legislation, yes, it, indeed, is related to countering the threat that the Chinese Communist Party presents to this country. But it also is a piece of legislation that we are considering at a time when so many of our citizens feel overlooked, when the intimate communities that they call home feel hollowed out, when trust in our civic institutions is eroding, and when allegiance seems increasingly to our political tribes and not to one another on behalf of the common good.   So let's not kid ourselves. The Chinese Communist Party aims to exploit all of these divisions. They aim to exploit the insecurities of the global age. They aim to ensure that their power and their capabilities continue to grow. And they are, indeed, locked in a global competition with the United States of America and with our partners and allies.  So let's do what we have always done as Americans in times like this. Let's come together, and let's use this as an opportunity to become a better version of ourselves.  I will end with this. When generation after generation of immigrants have come into the New York Harbor, they have seen that beautiful Statue of Liberty. And at the base of the Statue of Liberty is a sonnet, and everyone here in this Chamber and so many across America are familiar with the words of that sonnet: ``Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses . . . ''  There is also a line in there that I particularly love about ``imprisoned lightning''--``imprisoned lightning.'' I am not sure what Emma Lazarus meant by the phrase ``imprisoned lightning,'' but to me that ``imprisoned lightning'' refers to the untapped potential, the God-given potential of every human being. And this legislation, the Endless Frontier Act, aims to tap into that ``imprisoned lightning'' of people across the heartland to ensure that they can stay part of the economic game in the 21st century and that they help us outcompete, outinnovate, and outgrow the Chinese Communist Party. We will win. We are going to get a great vote today, and I thank all of my colleagues for their intention to support this legislation.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I, too, would like to thank Senators Cantwell and Wicker for an amazing, bipartisan job; and Senators Menendez and Risch, another great bipartisan contribution. All the Members--just about every Member has contributed to this bill.  I do want to single out two of my staff members who just slaved over this bill relentlessly, and that is Mike Kuiken and Jon Cardinal. Mike is there. I don't know if Jon is here. But they deserve tremendous kudos for what they did. Without them I don't think we would have had a bill, to be honest with you--and everybody else, all the other staffs who worked so hard.  Now, this is a quote from Dr. Vannevar Bush: ``Without scientific progress, no amount of achievement in other directions can insure our health, prosperity, and security in the modern world.''  That was Dr. Vannevar Bush, the head of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research, writing in 1945. His report to President Truman was titled: ``Science--The Endless Frontier''--an inspiration to the legislation we considered today.  In the wake of Dr. Bush's report, we created the National Science Foundation. We funded the National Laboratories. We split the atom. We spliced the gene. We landed a man on the Moon. We unleashed the internet. We generated 75 years of American prosperity and fostered an innate sense of optimism in the American spirit.  We face a challenge now--in this century--to replicate the success of the previous one. But the Federal Government's commitment to science, unfortunately, has waned. As a percentage of GDP, we spend less than half as much as the Chinese Communist Party on basic research.  We rely on foreign nations to supply critical technologies that we invented, like semiconductors. That sunny American optimism has flickered as well.  The world is more competitive now than at any time since the end of the Second World War. If we do nothing, our days as the dominant superpower may be ending.  We don't mean to let those days end on our watch. We don't mean to see America become a middling nation in this century. We mean for America to lead it. Passing this bill--now called the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act--is the moment when the Senate lays the foundation for another century of American leadership.  Let me say that again. This bill could be the turning point for American leadership in the 21st century, and for that reason, this legislation will go down as one of the most significant bipartisan achievements of the U.S. Senate in recent history.  Around the globe, authoritarian governments believe that squabbling democracies like ours can't unite around national priorities. They believe that democracy itself is a relic of the past and that by beating us to emerging technologies, they--many of the meritocracies--will be able to reshape the world in their own image.  Well, let me tell you something. I believe they are wrong. I believe that this legislation will enable the United States to outinnovate, outproduce, and outcompete the world in the industries of the future. I believe that the strongly bipartisan work on this bill has revealed that in this Chamber, we all believe that another American century lies on the horizon. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.   I yield the floor.                               Vote on S. 1260   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?  Mr. WICKER.

                         PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, there are still millions of women across 
this country today who are doing the same jobs as their male colleagues 
and are being paid less. It is more clear than ever that we must take 
steps to close loopholes that allow for pay discrimination and empower 
women to hold their employers accountable when pay discrimination 
occurs. Nearly 60 years after passage of the Equal Pay Act and 12 years 
after passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, women still only 
earn 82 cents for every dollar paid to men on average. For women of 
color, the wage gap is even worse. Black women make only 63 cents for 
every dollar paid to White men, and Latina women make only 55 cents. 
Mothers make just 75 cents for every dollar paid to fathers.
  Throughout the pandemic, too many families have wondered how they 
will feed their families, keep their homes, and care for their children 
amid an unprecedented public health and economic crisis. For working 
mothers, it has been especially challenging. The labor force 
participation rate among women has dropped to 57.4 percent, the lowest 
it has been since 1988. A survey last fall found that almost 40 percent 
of working mothers in Illinois lost their jobs or were working reduced 
hours. Nearly half of working mothers of color reported the same.
  Why has this economic crisis been so economically devastating for so 
many women? The reasons are clear. Women tend to be overrepresented in 
the industries that were hit hardest by the pandemic, such as 
restaurants, retail, and leisure and hospitality. And many women are 
the primary caretakers for their families. With schools and childcare 
programs closed, what choice did mothers have other than to step back 
from work?
  The economic hardship women have faced during the pandemic has only 
been made worse by the wage gap. From wage discrimination to the 
unavailability of childcare, women are not getting a fair deal. That 
means working families are not getting a fair deal, and it must change.
  This week, we have the opportunity to pass legislation that would 
close the loopholes that allow paycheck discrimination to continue. The 
Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which prohibits gender-based pay 
discrimination, was the first bill signed into law by President Obama 
back in 2009. Unfortunately, it is hard to enforce because employers 
still maintain policies that punish employees who voluntarily share 
salary information with their coworkers. Women can't demand equal pay 
if they don't know they are being underpaid.
  The Paycheck Fairness Act would ensure workers cannot be retaliated 
against if they disclose their wages. It also would prohibit employers 
from asking prospective employees about their salary history. And it 
would require employers to prove that pay disparities exist for 
legitimate, job-related reasons--not just because they believe 
``women's work'' is worth less. I am happy to join Senator Murray and 
my Democratic colleagues in supporting this important legislation.
  Women have carried America's families through this pandemic, but it 
may take years for women to recover from the economic and career 
setbacks they have suffered. By passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, we 
can take an important step toward helping women and their families 
fully recover from this pandemic and economic crisis.
  I am disappointed that Republican opposition has previously prevented 
the Senate from passing this bill. I hope that my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle can agree it is time to pass this commonsense 
measure that will help put more money in the pockets of women and their 
families across the country.
  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, you know, it has been more than half a 
century since the Equal Pay Act became law, and 12 years since 
President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, but women in 
the United States still, on average, earn only 82 cents on the dollar 
compared to their male counterparts, and the wage gap is far greater 
for women of color because, even though the Equal Pay Act and the Lilly 
Ledbetter Act were critical steps forward, there is clearly a lot more 
we have got to do.
  Right now, an employer can brush aside reports of pay discrimination 
by saying things like, ``Well, he was a better negotiator'' or ``They 
work in different buildings.'' I mean, what does that have to do with 
it?
  And too often, a woman's history of being paid less means she gets 
paid less in the future because her past salary can be used to 
determine her future salary, regardless of what her counterparts are 
making or her new responsibilities, and that has real consequences for 
women and their families.
  Today, 4 out of 10 mothers with children under the age of 18 are 
their family's primary or sole breadwinners. As families rely more on 
women's wages to make ends meet, the gender pay gap has an even greater 
impact on children.
  For example, over the course of just 1 year, the wage gap for Latino 
women averages almost $30,000 less compared to what a White man earns. 
We are talking about women losing out on hundreds of thousands of 
dollars over the course of their working lives, and that is money that 
could go to pay the bills, put food on the table, buy a house, start a 
business, save for retirement, get an education, and so much more.
  Instead, women struggle with lifelong financial effects, including 
higher poverty rates as compared to men. Women are being shortchanged, 
plain and simple.
  And this pandemic, by the way, has made things worse. Millions of 
women now, as we know, have left the labor force, and many have fallen 
behind just as caregiving responsibilities have disproportionately 
fallen on them.
  According to one study, a woman who was earning about $47,000 a year 
before the pandemic, could lose nearly a quarter of a million dollars 
over her lifetime, assuming she is able to return to work this year.
  The pandemic has set women--and in particular, women of color--back 
even further and made clear just how urgent it is for us to act 
because, you know what, if women don't recover from this crisis, our 
economy will not either, which is why we desperately need to close the 
wage gap.
  We have got a responsibility to finally make sure women are paid 
fairly for their work so women can build financial security for 
themselves, for their families, for their communities, and so our 
economy--so much of which is driven by women, by the way--can fully 
recover from this crisis.
  We have been fighting for the Paycheck Fairness Act for quite some 
time, but for those who need a reminder, here is what it would do 
simply, very straightforward: It will close the loopholes that allow 
pay discrimination to continue and protect workers from retaliation for 
discussing their pay; it will limit the use of prior wage history in 
the hiring process so pay discrimination cannot follow workers from job 
to job; and it will increase transparency and accountability so workers 
know whether they are being treated fairly and so they have the 
evidence to hold their employers accountable if they are not.
  These are commonsense steps, and that is why this bill already passed 
the House with bipartisan support, and it is up to the Senate now to 
get this done because the reality is each and every Senator represents 
a State where half of the population earns less than they deserve, and 
that is ridiculous.
  It is past time we end this injustice. I urge my colleagues to join 
me in voting to finally put money women have earned fair and square in 
their pockets where it belongs and take an essential step toward 
ensuring our economy can build back stronger and fairer from COVID-19.
  There is absolutely nothing controversial about making sure every 
worker gets paid fairly for their work. Women have been waiting long 
enough. They need the Paycheck Fairness Act now more than ever. Let's 
get this done
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.
  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Washington 
for her incredible leadership not only

[[Page S3981]]

on this bill but on this issue for pretty close to a decade, and it is 
long overdue.
  You know, we have been working in a very bipartisan way on numerous 
subjects, including the competition bill that just passed, but it 
appears there are real limits to bipartisanship here in the Senate.
  We are about to vote just to start debate--just to start debate on a 
bill that is very simple--provide equal pay for women. It is a modest 
proposal to address a real problem in our economy.
  Women with the same jobs and same qualifications as their male 
colleagues often make less money. It is too hard for too many women to 
overcome that pay discrimination. This makes it easier for women to 
achieve pay parity, and like the previous bill, will help unleash 
strong economic forces to help America go forward because when women 
are not getting the pay they deserve, it impedes our whole economy and 
all of the human resources that we need.
  Every Senate Democrat is ready to start debate on the Paycheck 
Fairness Act, but Senate Republicans seem to be mounting another 
partisan filibuster against this bill.
  It is ridiculous that Senate Republicans will not even allow the 
Senate to debate a straightforward piece of legislation to help provide 
equal pay for working women in America, just like it was ridiculous for 
the Republican minority to filibuster bipartisan legislation to create 
an independent Commission on January 6.
  Americans expect their government to make progress to improve our 
country, but Senate Republicans once again seem to be choosing 
obstruction.
  I yield the floor.

                              CORONAVIRUS

  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, for over a year now, people worldwide 
have experienced immeasurable pain, suffering, and loss. This pandemic 
has tested each and every one of us in ways that we didn't know 
possible.
  But perhaps no one has been more tested than our Nation's frontline, 
essential healthcare workers. They, like so many other frontline 
workers, did not have the option to telework, to socially distance, to 
remain in their homes, with their families, while the coronavirus 
ravaged our communities--no, just the opposite. They showed up more 
than ever before.
  Not only did our Nation's doctors, nurses, and other medical 
professionals put their own health concerns aside to treat COVID 
patients, they continued to see all their other patients who couldn't 
afford to delay treatment, the heart attack and stroke victims, the 
chemotherapy and dialysis patients, the pregnant moms and new babies, 
people who had been involved in car accidents or were victims of gun 
violence.
  When the rest of the world was being encouraged to stay home and 
avoid interactions with people, our medical providers continued to 
report to hospitals, community health centers, doctor's offices. They 
did so even when they weren't provided the proper personal protective 
equipment. They did so even when it meant that they had to quarantine 
from their own families. They did so even when it meant extra shifts on 
little to no sleep. They did so even when it meant spending each day 
watching dying patients say their final goodbyes to loved ones over 
Zoom. And they did so even when, in the midst of all of this, they were 
subjected to racism, sexism, and hate.
  An essay that appeared in the New York Times last month detailed one 
doctor's experience. Dr. Chaya Bhuvaneswar--a female, Asian-American, 
Boston-area physician--recalled an incident last April, when a patient 
spit on her and said she ``brought the sickness.''
  Anti-Asian bigotry is, sadly, nothing new in this country, and the 
rise of it during COVID was certainly fueled by our former President, 
who seemed to delight in coining hateful, racist terminology to 
describe the coronavirus. Like so many others, our healthcare 
providers, whether they are Asian American or African American, or 
members of other minority groups, are subjected to racism, simply in 
the course of doing their jobs.
  Racism is inexcusable always, but imagine how much worse it must have 
felt this past year, risking your life every single day to help a 
nation in the midst of a deadly pandemic, only to be subjected to 
racial slurs, offensive stereotypes, and vile actions. If this past 
year has taught us anything, it is that our Nation still has a long way 
to go on issues of race and immigration.
  Consider this: One in six healthcare and social service workers are 
immigrants. Yet our broken immigration laws prevent many immigrants 
from contributing more fully to the battle against the pandemic.

[[Page S3982]]

  As long as I am a U.S. Senator, I will continue to come to fight for 
all immigrants. We must ensure that the hundreds of thousands of 
immigrant workers in our essential workforce are not forced to stop 
contributing when the need for their service has never been greater, 
and we must give them the chance they deserve to become American 
citizens. They have waited long enough.
  I hope that, even in these divided times, we can come together in 
Congress to quickly aid our immigrant healthcare heroes and other 
essential workers. Whether we are witnessing horrific, racially 
motivated acts of police brutality on the nightly news or reading about 
bigoted verbal and physical assaults in our hospitals, it is clear that 
the epidemic of racism, which long predated this pandemic, has not gone 
anywhere.
  It is my hope that, someday soon, we can look at one another and see 
how much more unites us than divides us, but for now, let me just offer 
another word of thanks to our Nation's healthcare workforce: You have 
all given so much and endured so much. We are eternally thankful for 
all you have done and all you will continue to do.

                          TRIBUTE TO EULA HALL

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, Southeastern Kentucky lost Eula Hall 
this May, a humanitarian titan who blessed her community with 
generosity, tenacity, and dedication. Eula was a self-described 
``hillbilly activist'' whose efforts to improve healthcare in Kentucky 
enhanced the lives of her neighbors and friends. As the founder of the 
Mud Creek Clinic, now known as the Eula Hall Health Center, Eula was 
driven by her selfless spirit to deliver quality care to thousands of 
Kentuckians. Today, I recognize Eula Hall as a lifelong champion of 
Floyd County and the entire Southeastern Kentucky region.
  Eula founded the Mud Creek Clinic in 1973 with a $1,400 donation and 
a calling to improve healthcare in her disadvantaged community. She 
served everyone, regardless of their ability to pay, through a primary 
care clinic, mental health counselor, pharmacy, and food and clothing 
pantry. Even after her clinic burned down in 1982, Eula did not miss a 
day of service, delivering help directly from her own home. She 
redefined healthcare in Southeastern Kentucky from the ground up, 
leaving an indelible impact on the region.
  Eula was born into extreme poverty, growing up without plumbing or 
electricity and only receiving an eighth-grade education. In spite of 
these obstacles, she was driven by a higher calling to serve her 
community. When Eula founded the Mud Creek Clinic, she did so based on 
a conviction that all Kentuckians, regardless of income, deserved to be 
cared for by their neighbors. Her work quickly caught the attention of 
local leaders and physicians, bringing much needed resources to her 
distressed region.
  She was a local activist from a young age, driven by the struggles 
and suffering she saw during her childhood. Motivated by a desire to 
assist the vulnerable, Eula gave help to the needy and a voice to the 
voiceless through an ever-expanding series of projects. With an 
unflappable work ethic, Eula would go on to run the Mud Creek Water 
District, piping drinking water to 800 homes, and served as the 
president of the Kentucky Black Lung Association. Her tireless, 
grassroots efforts have left an enduring legacy of community-based 
activism in Southeastern Kentucky.
  Eula's industriousness permeated every aspect of her life, even as 
she entered old age. Just last year, she was working on a proposal to 
found a nursing home in her area as a response to the COVID-19 
pandemic. In recognition of her determination and tenacity, Eula 
received a number of awards, including honorary doctorates from Berea, 
Midway, and Pikeville colleges in Kentucky and Trinity College in 
Connecticut. She was also the subject of a landmark book on healthcare 
in Eastern Kentucky, ``Mud Creek Medicine,'' by Kiran Bhatraju. She led 
a vibrant family, and is survived by 4 children, 8 grandchildren, 14 
great-grandchildren, and 5 great-great-grandchildren.
  I had the opportunity to speak with Eula just a few weeks before she 
passed and expressed my deep appreciation for her decades of hard work. 
During our numerous conversations and visits, I was always struck by 
her ceaseless devotion to Southeastern Kentuckians. Eula was honored 
with tributes from around the country, including from the U.S. Senate, 
but she never sought the spotlight. She preferred to dedicate her 
entire focus to the needy in her community.
  After her passing, Eula was recognized by both the Wall Street 
Journal and the New York Times, demonstrating the nationwide impact of 
her work. She was one of the toughest women I ever met, and it was an 
absolute pleasure to work with her over the years to deliver much 
needed help to Kentucky communities. I would like to express my 
personal gratitude for Eula Hall's decades of service to the 
Commonwealth and encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in sharing 
condolences with her family, colleagues, and neighbors, whose lives 
were uplifted by this one-of-a-kind Kentuckian.

                          TRIBUTE TO ERIC KING

  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, during a year of unprecedented 
challenges, students, staff, and faculty at the University of Kentucky 
have been fortunate to have Eric King as their tireless advocate and 
supporter. As UK's executive director of federal relations, Eric has 
made lasting contributions to Kentucky's students, professors, and 
administrators. In recognition of that hard work, Eric was honored last 
month by the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities with the 
Jennifer Poulakidas Outstanding Achievement Award. Today, I, too, would 
like to recognize Eric for his strong advocacy on behalf of the 
University of Kentucky community and our State as a whole.
  Eric has been making contributions to Kentucky higher education since 
he was an undergrad, serving as the student body president of Murray 
State University. Since then, he has dedicated his career to helping 
Kentuckians. Fresh out of college, Eric served as a legislative 
correspondent in my office and was later promoted to a legislative 
assistant focused on energy, agriculture, and environmental policy. He 
contributed to the passage of the Agricultural Act of 2014, which 
delivered major wins for Kentucky farmers and their families.
  Eric also served as the director of government and community affairs 
at the Kentucky Association of Electric Cooperatives, KAEC. There, he 
advocated for a statewide association of 24 consumer-owned electric 
distribution utilities that collectively serve nearly 2 million 
Kentuckians. I know that Eric's work at that organization had a real 
and lasting impact on Kentucky families.
  Now, Eric has taken his advocacy skills to the University of 
Kentucky, working closely with President Eli Capilouto to promote the 
well-being of more than 30,000 students, 12,000 staff, and 2,000 
faculty. When the coronavirus pandemic threatened to shut down colleges 
and universities across the country, Eric stepped up and fought to 
include vital funding for higher education in the Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief, and Economic Security, CARES, Act. Because of advocacy like 
Eric's, the CARES Act included the Higher Education Emergency Relief 
Fund, providing millions of dollars to colleges and universities to 
overcome the challenges imposed by the pandemic. Thousands of Kentucky 
students and graduates benefited from Eric's leadership.
  Eric has been described by his colleagues as a man with ``unmatched 
integrity'' and a ``can-do attitude'' who has made ``incredible 
contributions'' to our Nation's system of public and land-grant 
universities. As Eric's former boss, I can confirm that these 
superlatives are correct. His hard work during the coronavirus pandemic 
provided vital protection to our colleges and universities, both in 
Kentucky and nationwide.
  Kentuckians--and especially Wildcats--are grateful for Eric's 
tireless dedication to our State's public university system. On behalf 
of the Senate, I would like to express my congratulations to Eric for 
receiving this award and my thanks for his service and leadership amid 
a time of incredible hardship.

establish a new Technology and Innovation Directorate at the National 
Science Foundation. Section 2005 of USICA would define 10 initial key 
technology focus areas to direct research at the new Directorate and 
the Department of Energy. One of these areas is advanced energy 
technology. I want to put in the record that Congress has previously 
enacted legislation defining advanced energy technology in 42 USC 
18632, and that definition should apply here.

                  HONORING TROOPER JOHN MARTIN HARRIS

  Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to 
Mississippi Highway Patrol Trooper John Martin Harris, who was killed 
in the line of duty on May 28, 2021. Harris was conducting a routine 
traffic stop on Highway 16 in Madison County when a vehicle struck and 
killed him. I honor Trooper Harris' service, extend my deepest 
condolences to his family, and reiterate my unwavering support for our 
law enforcement personnel.
  A Clarksdale native, Harris knew from a young age he wanted to serve 
his community as a law enforcement officer. Trooper Harris began his 
law enforcement career in 1997 in Webb, MS. He earned his first Law 
Enforcement Purple Heart while serving on the police force in Friars 
Point and earned a second Purple Heart while serving at the Madison 
County Sheriff's Office. Harris then continued his career at the 
Richland Police Department. In 2018, Harris achieved his lifelong dream 
of becoming a Mississippi Highway Patrolman and graduated from Trooper 
School as part of Cadet Class No. 62. In addition to the Purple Heart 
medals, Harris received dozens of awards, too numerous to mention here, 
for valor and bravery. Several were commendations for his work on 
narcotics teams and with K-9 units.
  Trooper Harris is survived by his wife Katie Parker Harris of 
Madison, his two children Parker and Cooper, and his parents Jean and 
Jimmy Harris of Clarksdale. I send my deepest sympathies to his family 
and to all who knew him. May God grant them comfort, grace, and peace 
in these unspeakably difficult times.
  Law enforcement officers across our Nation face many challenges in 
their mission to protect and serve. Trooper Harris's death shows us 
that our law enforcement officers face tremendous danger to ensure 
public safety, and I greatly admire those who remain steadfast amiss 
the dangers of their noble profession. Let us commemorate Trooper 
Harris's life by redoubling our commitment to support and advocate for 
those in law enforcement. I will continue to honor the legacy of 
Trooper Harris and all of those officers who have lost their life in 
the line of duty by doing all I can to support our law enforcement 
officers.

         50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATRONA COUNTY MEALS ON WHEELS

  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I rise today to recognize a 
significant anniversary for the Natrona County Meals on Wheels Program. 
On Saturday, June 19, 2021, this wonderful organization will celebrate 
its 50th anniversary.
  Meals on Wheels is dedicated to providing healthy meals, a friendly 
smile, and a watchful eye to seniors across the Nation. As a doctor, I 
understand the importance of balanced nutrition but also companionship 
and care. The hard-working employees and volunteers deliver all three 
by offering tailored meals and home visits.
  In 1971 Casper resident Mabel Marvel founded the Casper branch of 
Meals on Wheels. Mabel was on a trip to Colorado to visit family when 
she ran across a similar service. The volunteers for the Colorado 
organization were delivering hot meals to elderly residents from a 
church kitchen. Mrs. Marvel realized that Casper did not have such a 
program. Soon after, she formed an office in a Salvation Army coat 
closet and requested that the Natrona County Memorial Hospital, now 
Wyoming Medical Center, aid in providing meals. This was the beginning 
of the Natrona County Meals on Wheels Program.
  When Natrona County Meals on Wheels began initial operations, they 
were preparing 20 meals a day. By 2001, the number of meals delivered 
increased to over 500 per day. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, the 
need for home-delivered meals exploded. This Casper-based organization 
rose to the challenge and served clients who were forced to quarantine 
and unable to leave their homes. In Natrona County, they delivered over 
650 meals each Monday through Thursday and an average of 1,550 meals on 
Fridays to cover the weekends. Their hard work resulted in senior 
citizens in Natrona County receiving nearly 207,000 meals in 2020.
  Serving so many people at once is challenging, especially when many 
of these meals are prepared with special dietary needs in mind. Meals 
on Wheels prepares healthy food for community members requiring 
specific diets including diabetic, celiac, and vegetarian. The 
volunteers with Meals on Wheels also make home visits to check in with 
members of the community who may not have enough social interaction or 
are not as mobile. The giving nature of this organization presents its 
members with a balanced meal and quality time spent with others. 
Ensuring the needs of community members allows seniors to preserve 
their independence at home.
  Meals on Wheels continues to find new ways to enrich our community. 
Jamie Loveall has been leading the charge as the Executive Director of 
Natrona County Meals on Wheels for more than 17 years. She has written 
grants, planned community events, and helped prepare meals in order to 
keep clients fed, staff members engaged, and the community aware. A 
favorite community event is their Bubbles, Baubles 'n Beans fundraiser. 
It is a chili and soup tasting experience to raise money for annual 
operating costs.
  The strength of an organization is determined by the dedication of 
its leadership, staff, and volunteers. The full-time staff are 
responsible for preparing the meals, managing the financial aspects, 
and writing the delivery routes. In addition to Executive Director 
Jamie Loveall, staff members are Katrina Lorenzen, Foundation 
Development Director, Andrea Trout, Route Coordinator/Administrative 
Assistant, Debbie Cardinal, Receptionist/Volunteer Coordinator, Ashley 
Woodward, Client Services Coordinator, Mariah Bokhari, Bookkeeper, and 
Shelley Blake, Kitchen Manager.
  Current board members are Jim Browlee, President, Joe Moss, Vice 
President, Vickie Ujvary, Treasurer, Don Smith, Secretary, and members 
Wendy Elmer, Bob Thunselle, Ed Chase, Jennifer Deurloo, Peggy Porter, 
Kelli Carmichael, Paul Rhodes, CJ Lovato, Dane Grace, and Stacia Hill.
  The volunteers deliver the meals, partake in home visits, and spend 
quality time with clients. Eighty-five percent of the volunteers with 
the Natrona County service are seniors themselves, using their time to 
help friends and neighbors. About the volunteers, Jamie Loveall says, 
``Without these individuals, our program would not exist.''
  It is my great honor to celebrate the incredible work of this 
organization. Every day, the staff and volunteers of Natrona County 
Meals on Wheels work to make our community a better place

to live. My wife Bobbi joins me in wishing the Natrona County Meals on 
Wheels another 50 years of success.

                  TRIBUTE TO COLONEL NATHAN E. COOK II

  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, today I honor a superb leader, liaison, 
and soldier for his tireless commitment to the U.S. Army, which 
includes 2 years of service with the Army Office of the Legislative 
Liaison, as the chief of the Army's Senate Liaison Division. As COL 
Nathan E. Cook II prepares to retire after 28 years of dedicated and 
distinguished service to our Nation, I believe it is fitting to 
recognize his exceptional service and relationship with this Chamber.
  Colonel Cook's congressional liaison assignment is only the capstone 
to what has been an outstanding career of service to the Army and our 
Nation. Colonel Cook is a 1993 graduate of The United States Military 
Academy at West Point. He was commissioned into the Army as a field 
artillery officer and has served in command and staff positions from 
the tactical to the strategic level in the 2d Armored Division, 4th 
Infantry Division, 8th Army, 3d Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry 
Division, Headquarters Resolute Support, and Headquarters Department of 
the Army. He has led our Nation's soldiers during multiple combat tours 
in Iraq and Afghanistan during OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, OPERATION NEW 
DAWN, and OPERATION RESOLUTE SUPPORT. Likewise, he commanded our 
soldiers in combat as the commander of the 3d Battalion, 82d Field 
Artillery Regiment from Fort Hood, TX, and the 75th Field Artillery 
Brigade from Fort Sill, OK. Prior to his assignment as the chief of the 
Army's Senate Liaison Division, he served as the senior advisor to the 
Afghan Minister of Defense, where he provided timely and critical 
advice across the Ministry of Defense and the NATO coalition. The Army 
has continuously relied upon Colonel Cook for his exceptional 
leadership and unparalleled work ethic throughout his career.
  Over the course of the last few years, Colonel Cook's tireless 
efforts proved invaluable in broadening the understanding of Members 
and staff on Army priorities, policies, and initiatives that ultimately 
provided resources and authorities for the Army and enhanced trust and 
confidence across the Senate. He managed all of this while leading and 
managing numerous congressional delegations to various locations around 
the world. Colonel Cook has become a trusted adviser and friend to many 
of us, distinguishing himself by continuously going above and beyond 
the call of duty to serve the needs of Congress.
  This Chamber will feel Colonel Cook's absence. I join many past and 
present Members of Congress in my gratitude and appreciation to Colonel 
Cook for his outstanding leadership and unwavering support. There is no 
doubt that the strength of our soldiers comes from their families. 
Colonel Cook's strength comes from his wife Traci and his two sons, 
Nathan and Joshua. This Nation is grateful for their commitment and 
personal sacrifices made throughout Colonel Cook's career.
  On behalf of the U.S. Senate and the United States of America, I 
commend Colonel Cook for his tireless efforts in the support of our 
Army, our military, and our Nation. As Nate and his family transition 
from the military, I congratulate him on completing an extremely 
successful military career and wish all of them the best in all their 
future endeavors.

  Mr. RUBIO. Madam President, I recognize Zachary Daniel Zampella, who, 
after 12 years of serving the people of Florida in the U.S. Senate, has 
moved on to new opportunities. I thank him for his years of hard work 
with my office.
  Zach began his time with my office as a caseworker specializing in 
military and veterans administration issues before becoming my regional 
director for Southwest Florida in 2012. He returned to my Orlando 
office in 2015, serving as deputy director of constituent services.
  During his time with my office, Zach mentored several of my staffers, 
played a key role in my Constituent Services Department and disaster 
relief efforts, and drafted office correspondence. He also assisted 
veterans with their issues pertaining to the Department of Veteran 
Affairs and worked with other various Federal, State, and local 
government agencies.
  In 2017, he assisted residents affected by Hurricane Irma, working 
our Recovery Assistance Center events held in the hardest hit cities 
across Florida. In 2018 and 2019, he made several trips to the 
panhandle region after Hurricane Michael's devastation. He walked door-
to-door to assist constituents and provided valuable assistance in the 
region.
  Zach grew up in Orlando, FL, graduating with his bachelor's degree in 
history and master's degree in business administration from 
Southeastern University in Lakeland, FL. After graduation, he interned 
for Senator Mel Martinez, later joining his staff in 2008. He also 
worked for Senator George LeMieux before joining my staff in 2011.
  Zach's work for my constituents for my office made a real difference 
over the years. I am grateful for his dedicated service to the people 
of Florida and extend my best wishes to Zach on his future endeavors.

                       RECOGNIZING RUPE'S BURGERS

 Mr. RISCH. Madam President, as a senior member and former 
chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship, each month I recognize and celebrate the American 
entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting the success of a small business 
in my home State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to honor Rupe's Burgers 
in Blackfoot, which will celebrate its 34th anniversary this month, as 
the Idaho Small Business of the Month for June 2021.
  Rupe's Burgers is an American-style diner and drive-in known for its 
quality food and strong community foundation. In 1962, former owner 
Vaughn Rupe opened an A&W Restaurant and after years of success made 
the decision to sell the restaurant in 1978. In 1987, Vaughn's son 
Kevin purchased the property and renamed the restaurant ``Rupe's 
Burgers.''
  Rupe's Burgers prides itself on its dedication to community service. 
The Rupe family donates and volunteers for local philanthropic 
missions, such as the Santa's Helpers Program, a holiday drive 
organized by Bingham County emergency responders to provide gifts to 
economically disadvantaged children. The restaurant has also donated to 
local organizations that promote the success and leadership of women, 
such as Blackfoot Distinguished Young Women and Soroptimists. In 
addition to its philanthropic efforts, the Rupe family puts a premium 
on serving and celebrating the Blackfoot community, featuring 
memorabilia from local school sports teams and providing nearly 50 jobs 
to the local community.
  Congratulations to Kevin and all of the employees of Rupe's Burgers 
on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for June 
2021, and congratulations on 34 years in business. You make our great 
State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and 
success.

Madam President, as a senior member and former chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho. Today I am pleased to honor Rupe's Burgers in Blackfoot, which will celebrate its 34th anniversary this month, as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for June 2021.  Rupe's Burgers is an American-style diner and drive-in known for its quality food and strong community foundation. In 1962, former owner Vaughn Rupe opened an A&W Restaurant and after years of success made the decision to sell the restaurant in 1978. In 1987, Vaughn's son Kevin purchased the property and renamed the restaurant ``Rupe's Burgers.''  Rupe's Burgers prides itself on its dedication to community service. The Rupe family donates and volunteers for local philanthropic missions, such as the Santa's Helpers Program, a holiday drive organized by Bingham County emergency responders to provide gifts to economically disadvantaged children. The restaurant has also donated to local organizations that promote the success and leadership of women, such as Blackfoot Distinguished Young Women and Soroptimists. In addition to its philanthropic efforts, the Rupe family puts a premium on serving and celebrating the Blackfoot community, featuring memorabilia from local school sports teams and providing nearly 50 jobs to the local community.  Congratulations to Kevin and all of the employees of Rupe's Burgers on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for June 2021, and congratulations on 34 years in business.

          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS

      By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. 
        Warren, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Booker, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Markey, 
        Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. 
        Shaheen, Mr. Peters, and Ms. Hassan):
  S. 1970. A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to conduct 
testing for and remediation of perfluoroalkyl substances and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances at or surrounding installations of the 
Department of Defense located in the United States, formerly used 
defense sites, and State-owned facilities of the National Guard, and 
for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.
  Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Clean Water For 
Military Families Act.'' This legislation would provide $10 billion for 
the Department of Defense to conduct investigations and remediate PFAS 
contamination at and surrounding DOD installations in the U.S. and 
state-owned National Guard facilities.
  Dating back to the 1960s, the U.S. Navy began using a firefighting 
foam called aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) that contains toxic PFAS 
chemicals. The military used AFFF firefighting foam for emergencies, 
fire training exercises, and equipment testing, resulting in large 
discharges of PFAS contamination in groundwater and other environments.
  For decades, DOD continued using AFFF firefighting foam despite 
mounting evidence of detrimental health concerns, and even after 
leading manufacturers voluntarily phased out production of PFOS and 
PFOA, the two most widespread and studied PFAS compounds.
  In recent years, Congress has passed legislation requiring DOD to 
phase out the use of AFFF firefighting foams. While this is a vital 
step toward ensuring DOD adopts PFAS-free alternatives going forward, 
it does not address DOD's legacy pollution.
  To clean up the legacy pollution at contaminated military sites 
across the country, this legislation authorizes a one-time, $10 billion 
investment for PFAS investigations and cleanup. We owe it to military 
communities to ensure that they can drink clean water and live 
pollution-free.
  There are hundreds of contaminated military sites across the country 
that jeopardize the health, safety, and well-being of military 
communities who have suffered from exposure to PFAS pollution and toxic 
drinking water.
  In California alone, there are 62 military facilities with a known or 
suspected PFAS release.
  Since the discovery of PFAS at these installations, there has been 
little to no progress on the bases with the highest PFAS detections. A 
$10 billion investment would accelerate DOD's existing cleanup efforts 
and cover all types of PFAS chemicals. Absent this legislation, it 
could take decades for DOD to clean up toxic PFAS. We must act now to 
move beyond studying the problem and toward a comprehensive cleanup 
effort to protect service-members, veterans, and military communities.
  I thank my co-lead, Senator Gillibrand for her tireless leadership 
fighting PFAS contamination at DOD sites. I also thank the bill's 
cosponsors for championing this effort with me in the Senate.
  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the ``Clean 
Water for Military Families Act'' as quickly as possible.
  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

                           U.S. SUPREME COURT

  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, in my opening speech about the 
rightwing scheme to capture the Court, the Supreme Court, I described 
the secret strategy memo that Lewis Powell wrote on the eve of his 
appointment to the Court about how to deploy corporate political power.
  As a Justice of the Supreme Court, Powell had the chance to prove to 
the corporate world his secret memo's theory of what could be achieved 
by ``exploiting judicial action''--his phrase--particularly with, as he 
called it, ``an activist-minded Supreme Court.''
  Second, Powell had the chance on the Court to start laying the legal 
groundwork for precisely the sort of corporate political activity that 
his secret memo had recommended to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and 
Powell did both.
  The first case that allowed Powell to implement recommendations from 
his secret report came in 1976, in a case about the Federal Election 
Campaign Act. The case was Buckley v. Valeo, and the decision was a 
beast--138 pages, with another 83 pages of dissent and concurrence 
cobbled together by the Court with what one observer called 
``extraordinary speed.'' Five Justices in that case, including Powell, 
were described as First Amendment hawks who were wary of any portion of 
the Federal Election Campaign Act that could inhibit free speech and 
association.
  Now, you have to understand that free speech and association were 
buzz words for corporate political activity precisely of the sort 
championed in Powell's secret chamber memo. Free speech meant corporate 
America having the right to be heard, even to, as the secret report 
said, ``equal time.'' Freedom of association provided corporations the 
``organization,'' ``careful long-range planning and implementation,'' 
and well-financed ``joint effort''--all those quotes--that Powell had 
recommended be done in his report ``through united action and national 
organizations.''
  The Court's decision in Valeo did two noncontroversial things. It 
accepted that campaign contributions could be limited because unlimited 
campaign contributions could give rise to corruption or at least the 
appearance of corruption. Unlimited donations to candidates would even 
``undermine representative democracy,'' the Court said. No big deal. 
The Court also decided that candidates may spend as much of their own 
money as they want on their own campaigns. It considered unlimited 
spending on one's own campaign protected by the First Amendment, as 
there was little danger of corruption from spending one's own campaign 
money on oneself.
  So both of those holdings are unremarkable. What was remarkable was 
where Powell and his hawks took the Court when other interests, like 
corporate interests, wanted to spend money on a candidate. Corporate 
political spending per se was not at issue in the case, but spending by 
special interests is precisely the kind of political influence which 
Powell had recommended in his secret report to the chamber.
  Powell and his hawks said special interest political spending, so 
long as it was not in the form of a campaign contribution, was 
protected by the same principle that protected a candidate spending his 
own money on his own campaign.
  Powell asserted that limiting these supposedly ``independent'' 
special interest expenditures ```perpetrates (the) grossest 
infringement' on First Amendment rights.'' He did acknowledge the 
interest in ```purity' of elections,'' but he used skeptical quotation 
marks around the word ``purity,'' just like he had used skeptical 
quotation marks in his report around the word ``environment.'' But 
Powell dismissed those purity concerns as likely ``illusory,'' to use 
his word.
  Powell's Bench memo for the case critiqued the election law's 
``attempt to lower barriers to political competition to increase the 
range of voter choice.'' It read: ``[T]he attempt to open access for 
the many necessarily involves limiting the power of the few to exercise 
rights of speech and association protected by the Constitution.''
  This interest in protecting the ``power of the few'' aligns exactly 
with Powell's secret chamber memo about corporate power and aligns with 
Powell's own notes, which have more of his disparaging quotation marks 
questioning some of the briefs filed in the Valeo case that ``identify 
one of the `evils' as the power of `the wealthy few' (undefined but 
obviously unworthy people) to influence elections unduly.'' In tone and 
import, that comes right out of Powell's secret chamber report, which 
counted on the power of the corporate few.
  Powell's Richmond history, his corporate law practice, his social 
position, his boardroom experience, and his anxiety about upheaval all 
align with a corporate worldview that society's decisions should be 
made by the sort of people in corporate boardrooms, so the power of 
those ``few'' had to be protected, to battle against what his report 
called the ``broad attack'' both on the ``American free enterprise 
system'' and the ``American political system of democracy under the 
rule of law.'' Particularly important it was to protect that power 
when, as he had written to the chamber, the trouble is ``deep'' and the 
``hour is late.''
  To accommodate that corporate perspective, the Court had to reach 
judgments about politics. It showed itself helpless. The amateurish 
political outlook of the Court in Valeo stood out in the late-added 
footnote 52, which, in the interest of drawing clear lines--
``vagueness'' being a stated concern of the Justices--exempted from 
disclosure political advertisements that did not expressly advocate for 
the election or defeat of a candidate using magic words like ``vote 
for,'' ``vote against,'' ``elect,'' or ``defeat.''
  In the Court's amateur opinion, a hostile bombardment of TV 
advertising challenging a candidate's morals, decency, or integrity, or 
attacking the candidate's alignment with the community's values, and 
dropped on the candidate in the heat of election season with the 
intention of defeating the candidate, was not deemed advocacy in the 
election--unless it used those magic words. The idiocy of that premise 
is obvious to anyone in politics.
  The Court's amateurish folly about political spending extended to 
presuming that spending by a powerful interest for a candidate would 
create no risk of corruption; that the spending and the resulting 
influence could be kept separate and independent. That is idiotic in 
real life.
  When a powerful political interest starts signaling that it will 
spend enormous sums to support candidates, guess what--candidates will 
find a way to take advantage, perhaps by attracting the spending to 
their own side by the positions they take or perhaps by avoiding taking 
positions that would send the spending to their opponent's side. The 
Court presumed that some etiquette would separate interest from 
candidate, but that was folly. It is blindingly naive to think that 
politics would produce no workarounds, that no coordination or 
signaling or intermediaries would violate whatever etiquette of 
independence the Court had in mind.
  As we know, information travels fast in politics, never mind the 
etiquette. Drop a rock in a stream, and the stream flows around it. Put 
eager candidates and enormous interested spenders together, and trouble 
will follow, as it has. Look no further than the corruption of American 
politics on climate change by the fossil fuel industry. Again, this was 
idiocy from amateurs.
  But the Valeo folly accomplished one thing: It opened the lane for 
unlimited special interest spending to come into elections to support 
or oppose candidates, just as Powell's secret memo had recommended.
  The next opportunity for Powell came 2 years later, and this, time it 
involved not just the type of political activity corporations would 
likely undertake but corporations directly.
  Massachusetts had banned corporate campaign contributions from 
statewide political referenda. A Massachusetts bank, the First National 
Bank of Boston, objected and sued. Frank Bellotti was then the 
Commonwealth's attorney general and defendant.

  First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti wound its way up to the 
Supreme Court. Here, the question was the very right of corporations to 
influence popular elections--in this case, a

[[Page S3996]]

referendum election. In a 5-to-4 decision, Powell wrote for the 
Republican-appointed majority that corporations had a constitutional 
right to engage in that political activity.
  This outcome can't be found in the Constitution, which provides no 
political role whatsoever to corporations, but this outcome aligned 
precisely with the recommendations of Powell's secret report to the 
chamber. Indeed, it was the heart of his pitch to the chamber. His 
entire secret plan for corporate political power would fall apart if 
States could bar corporate influence from elections, even referendum 
elections. Powell had urged in his secret report that corporate 
interests not have ``the slightest hesitation to press vigorously in 
all political arenas'' and that corporations should show no 
``reluctance to penalize politically those who oppose [them].'' 
Corporations could never ``press vigorously'' or ``penalize 
politically'' if they could be kept out of elections, and so Bellotti 
was decided.
  Paired with Valeo, the Bellotti case established that corporations 
had a constitutional right to engage in elections--at least referendum 
elections--with as much money as they wanted, or at least as much money 
as they could raise, so long as the election spending was not in the 
form of campaign contributions.
  Ultimately, this laid the framework for the infamous Citizens United 
decision, another bare, 5-to-4 Republican majority that gave in this 
case corporate interests a full constitutional right to unlimited 
political spending and, as a practical matter, to unlimited anonymous 
political spending.
  How, in Bellotti, did they get around a Constitution that provides 
corporations no political rights? The trick used was to focus on the 
message, not the messenger--completely overlook that it was a 
corporation, not a person. The Court said that corporate political 
spending was actually speech, that influencing a popular referendum was 
the ``type of speech'' at the heart of representative democracy, and 
that the public had a right to hear it. The fact that corporations are 
not people and, indeed, that they have advantages over real people in 
electioneering and, indeed, that they might even come to dominate 
popular democracy because of those advantages was overlooked by 
directing attention to the speech, not the speaker.
  If the type of speech was relevant to the public debate, Powell said, 
it doesn't matter whether a corporation or a person says it--except 
every piece of this is wrong. Money is not speech. Corporations are not 
people. And looking at the message, not the messenger, would allow any 
entity's message into our politics, even foreign ones. Then add in 
anonymity, and the problem goes toxic, as we now see in our country 
today. ``We the People'' becomes ``We the Hidden Anything With Money.''
  The last case for Powell was Federal Election Commission v. 
Massachusetts Citizens for Life in 1986. Here, the question was whether 
an advocacy group of precisely the kind Powell had in mind in the 
chamber memo was forbidden to spend its corporate treasury funds in a 
Federal election.
  Now, the situation was that Congress had blocked corporations from 
using their treasury funds in Federal elections. They had to raise 
money from voluntary donations; hence the corporate PACs that we have 
seen that had to raise and spend their own money. The Court accepted 
that corporate treasuries might give corporate voices ``an unfair 
advantage in the political marketplace'' given their vast corporate 
wealth and resources. But in the case before it, the Court decided that 
nonprofits were different. They were designed for advocacy, and they 
didn't have the same sort of treasury funds as business corporations.
  Again, remember the Powell memo. Powell didn't recommend that 
corporations undertake their political work directly. He had pressed 
for ``organization,'' for ``joint effort.'' He had urged corporate 
America to pursue ``the political power available only through united 
action and national organizations.'' And guess what. The U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce, the national organization to which Powell had delivered 
his secret recommendations, was a nonprofit corporation.
  In his years on the Court, Lewis Powell made good on the secret 
recommendations that he had made to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 5 
months before joining the Court. He showed that ``an activist-minded 
Supreme Court''--his words--could be that ``important instrument for 
social, economic and political change''--his words--that he had 
proposed. He opened a lane for unlimited money into politics, enabling 
what his secret report had called ``the scale of financing available 
only through joint effort.'' He bulldozed aside bars on corporate 
spending and politics so corporations could deploy, just as his report 
had urged, ``whatever degree of pressure--publicly and privately--may 
be necessary.'' And he allowed advocacy organizations to spend their 
treasuries in politics, opening the way for the ``organization,'' 
``joint effort,'' and ``united action'' he had called for in his report 
through ``national organizations.''
  All the key pieces were in place to unleash the corporate influence 
machine that he had recommended to the chamber, influence that 
dominates much of American politics today, influence that controls much 
of what we do in the Senate Chamber today, and in which, of all things, 
the chamber, which was his client for the secret report, is today the 
apex predator of corporate influence, red in tooth and claw.
  Everything was aligned for what Powell had recommended: corporate 
``political power,'' ``assiduously cultivated,'' ``used aggressively 
and with determination,'' with ``no hesitation to attack,'' ``not the 
slightest hesitation to press vigorously in all political arenas,'' and 
no ``reluctance to penalize politically those who oppose.''
  It is a dark achievement, but it is quite an achievement. And, 
interestingly, Powell's official biography frames out his judicial 
career without mentioning his role as the early orchestrator of 
corporate political influence in American politics. It is actually 
likely his most significant and lasting legacy.
  To be continued.
  I yield the floor.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.

Madam President, in my opening speech about the rightwing scheme to capture the Court, the Supreme Court, I described the secret strategy memo that Lewis Powell wrote on the eve of his appointment to the Court about how to deploy corporate political power.  As a Justice of the Supreme Court, Powell had the chance to prove to the corporate world his secret memo's theory of what could be achieved by ``exploiting judicial action''--his phrase--particularly with, as he called it, ``an activist-minded Supreme Court.''  Second, Powell had the chance on the Court to start laying the legal groundwork for precisely the sort of corporate political activity that his secret memo had recommended to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and Powell did both.  The first case that allowed Powell to implement recommendations from his secret report came in 1976, in a case about the Federal Election Campaign Act. The case was Buckley v. Valeo, and the decision was a beast--138 pages, with another 83 pages of dissent and concurrence cobbled together by the Court with what one observer called ``extraordinary speed.'' Five Justices in that case, including Powell, were described as First Amendment hawks who were wary of any portion of the Federal Election Campaign Act that could inhibit free speech and association.  Now, you have to understand that free speech and association were buzz words for corporate political activity precisely of the sort championed in Powell's secret chamber memo. Free speech meant corporate America having the right to be heard, even to, as the secret report said, ``equal time.'' Freedom of association provided corporations the ``organization,'' ``careful long-range planning and implementation,'' and well-financed ``joint effort''--all those quotes--that Powell had recommended be done in his report ``through united action and national organizations.''  The Court's decision in Valeo did two noncontroversial things. It accepted that campaign contributions could be limited because unlimited campaign contributions could give rise to corruption or at least the appearance of corruption. Unlimited donations to candidates would even ``undermine representative democracy,'' the Court said. No big deal. The Court also decided that candidates may spend as much of their own money as they want on their own campaigns. It considered unlimited spending on one's own campaign protected by the First Amendment, as there was little danger of corruption from spending one's own campaign money on oneself.  So both of those holdings are unremarkable. What was remarkable was where Powell and his hawks took the Court when other interests, like corporate interests, wanted to spend money on a candidate. Corporate political spending per se was not at issue in the case, but spending by special interests is precisely the kind of political influence which Powell had recommended in his secret report to the chamber.  Powell and his hawks said special interest political spending, so long as it was not in the form of a campaign contribution, was protected by the same principle that protected a candidate spending his own money on his own campaign.  Powell asserted that limiting these supposedly ``independent'' special interest expenditures ```perpetrates (the) grossest infringement' on First Amendment rights.'' He did acknowledge the interest in ```purity' of elections,'' but he used skeptical quotation marks around the word ``purity,'' just like he had used skeptical quotation marks in his report around the word ``environment.'' But Powell dismissed those purity concerns as likely ``illusory,'' to use his word.  Powell's Bench memo for the case critiqued the election law's ``attempt to lower barriers to political competition to increase the range of voter choice.'' It read: ``[T]he attempt to open access for the many necessarily involves limiting the power of the few to exercise rights of speech and association protected by the Constitution.''  This interest in protecting the ``power of the few'' aligns exactly with Powell's secret chamber memo about corporate power and aligns with Powell's own notes, which have more of his disparaging quotation marks questioning some of the briefs filed in the Valeo case that ``identify one of the `evils' as the power of `the wealthy few' (undefined but obviously unworthy people) to influence elections unduly.'' In tone and import, that comes right out of Powell's secret chamber report, which counted on the power of the corporate few.  Powell's Richmond history, his corporate law practice, his social position, his boardroom experience, and his anxiety about upheaval all align with a corporate worldview that society's decisions should be made by the sort of people in corporate boardrooms, so the power of those ``few'' had to be protected, to battle against what his report called the ``broad attack'' both on the ``American free enterprise system'' and the ``American political system of democracy under the rule of law.'' Particularly important it was to protect that power when, as he had written to the chamber, the trouble is ``deep'' and the ``hour is late.''  To accommodate that corporate perspective, the Court had to reach judgments about politics. It showed itself helpless. The amateurish political outlook of the Court in Valeo stood out in the late-added footnote 52, which, in the interest of drawing clear lines--``vagueness'' being a stated concern of the Justices--exempted from disclosure political advertisements that did not expressly advocate for the election or defeat of a candidate using magic words like ``vote for,'' ``vote against,'' ``elect,'' or ``defeat.''  In the Court's amateur opinion, a hostile bombardment of TV advertising challenging a candidate's morals, decency, or integrity, or attacking the candidate's alignment with the community's values, and dropped on the candidate in the heat of election season with the intention of defeating the candidate, was not deemed advocacy in the election--unless it used those magic words. The idiocy of that premise is obvious to anyone in politics.  The Court's amateurish folly about political spending extended to presuming that spending by a powerful interest for a candidate would create no risk of corruption; that the spending and the resulting influence could be kept separate and independent. That is idiotic in real life.  When a powerful political interest starts signaling that it will spend enormous sums to support candidates, guess what--candidates will find a way to take advantage, perhaps by attracting the spending to their own side by the positions they take or perhaps by avoiding taking positions that would send the spending to their opponent's side. The Court presumed that some etiquette would separate interest from candidate, but that was folly. It is blindingly naive to think that politics would produce no workarounds, that no coordination or signaling or intermediaries would violate whatever etiquette of independence the Court had in mind.  As we know, information travels fast in politics, never mind the etiquette. Drop a rock in a stream, and the stream flows around it. Put eager candidates and enormous interested spenders together, and trouble will follow, as it has. Look no further than the corruption of American politics on climate change by the fossil fuel industry. Again, this was idiocy from amateurs.  But the Valeo folly accomplished one thing: It opened the lane for unlimited special interest spending to come into elections to support or oppose candidates, just as Powell's secret memo had recommended.  The next opportunity for Powell came 2 years later, and this, time it involved not just the type of political activity corporations would likely undertake but corporations directly.  Massachusetts had banned corporate campaign contributions from statewide political referenda. A Massachusetts bank, the First National Bank of Boston, objected and sued. Frank Bellotti was then the Commonwealth's attorney general and defendant.   First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti wound its way up to the Supreme Court. Here, the question was the very right of corporations to influence popular elections--in this case, a referendum election. In a 5-to-4 decision, Powell wrote for the Republican-appointed majority that corporations had a constitutional right to engage in that political activity.  This outcome can't be found in the Constitution, which provides no political role whatsoever to corporations, but this outcome aligned precisely with the recommendations of Powell's secret report to the chamber. Indeed, it was the heart of his pitch to the chamber. His entire secret plan for corporate political power would fall apart if States could bar corporate influence from elections, even referendum elections. Powell had urged in his secret report that corporate interests not have ``the slightest hesitation to press vigorously in all political arenas'' and that corporations should show no ``reluctance to penalize politically those who oppose [them].'' Corporations could never ``press vigorously'' or ``penalize politically'' if they could be kept out of elections, and so Bellotti was decided.  Paired with Valeo, the Bellotti case established that corporations had a constitutional right to engage in elections--at least referendum elections--with as much money as they wanted, or at least as much money as they could raise, so long as the election spending was not in the form of campaign contributions.  Ultimately, this laid the framework for the infamous Citizens United decision, another bare, 5-to-4 Republican majority that gave in this case corporate interests a full constitutional right to unlimited political spending and, as a practical matter, to unlimited anonymous political spending.  How, in Bellotti, did they get around a Constitution that provides corporations no political rights? The trick used was to focus on the message, not the messenger--completely overlook that it was a corporation, not a person. The Court said that corporate political spending was actually speech, that influencing a popular referendum was the ``type of speech'' at the heart of representative democracy, and that the public had a right to hear it. The fact that corporations are not people and, indeed, that they have advantages over real people in electioneering and, indeed, that they might even come to dominate popular democracy because of those advantages was overlooked by directing attention to the speech, not the speaker.  If the type of speech was relevant to the public debate, Powell said, it doesn't matter whether a corporation or a person says it--except every piece of this is wrong. Money is not speech. Corporations are not people. And looking at the message, not the messenger, would allow any entity's message into our politics, even foreign ones. Then add in anonymity, and the problem goes toxic, as we now see in our country today. ``We the People'' becomes ``We the Hidden Anything With Money.''  The last case for Powell was Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life in 1986. Here, the question was whether an advocacy group of precisely the kind Powell had in mind in the chamber memo was forbidden to spend its corporate treasury funds in a Federal election.  Now, the situation was that Congress had blocked corporations from using their treasury funds in Federal elections. They had to raise money from voluntary donations; hence the corporate PACs that we have seen that had to raise and spend their own money. The Court accepted that corporate treasuries might give corporate voices ``an unfair advantage in the political marketplace'' given their vast corporate wealth and resources. But in the case before it, the Court decided that nonprofits were different. They were designed for advocacy, and they didn't have the same sort of treasury funds as business corporations.  Again, remember the Powell memo. Powell didn't recommend that corporations undertake their political work directly. He had pressed for ``organization,'' for ``joint effort.'' He had urged corporate America to pursue ``the political power available only through united action and national organizations.'' And guess what. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the national organization to which Powell had delivered his secret recommendations, was a nonprofit corporation.  In his years on the Court, Lewis Powell made good on the secret recommendations that he had made to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce 5 months before joining the Court. He showed that ``an activist-minded Supreme Court''--his words--could be that ``important instrument for social, economic and political change''--his words--that he had proposed. He opened a lane for unlimited money into politics, enabling what his secret report had called ``the scale of financing available only through joint effort.'' He bulldozed aside bars on corporate spending and politics so corporations could deploy, just as his report had urged, ``whatever degree of pressure--publicly and privately--may be necessary.'' And he allowed advocacy organizations to spend their treasuries in politics, opening the way for the ``organization,'' ``joint effort,'' and ``united action'' he had called for in his report through ``national organizations.''  All the key pieces were in place to unleash the corporate influence machine that he had recommended to the chamber, influence that dominates much of American politics today, influence that controls much of what we do in the Senate Chamber today, and in which, of all things, the chamber, which was his client for the secret report, is today the apex predator of corporate influence, red in tooth and claw.  Everything was aligned for what Powell had recommended: corporate ``political power,'' ``assiduously cultivated,'' ``used aggressively and with determination,'' with ``no hesitation to attack,'' ``not the slightest hesitation to press vigorously in all political arenas,'' and no ``reluctance to penalize politically those who oppose.''  It is a dark achievement, but it is quite an achievement. And, interestingly, Powell's official biography frames out his judicial career without mentioning his role as the early orchestrator of corporate political influence in American politics. It is actually likely his most significant and lasting legacy.  To be continued.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
